Meanwhile, the IRGC, the elite wing of the Iranian military that was established in the aftermath of the country’s revolution in 1979, has asked all people to identify protesters, the country’s semi-official news agency Fars News said.\n\nThousands of Iranians have taken to the streets in protest since the death last week of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was apprehended in Tehran and taken to a “re-education center,” apparently for not wearing her hijab properly.\n\nSince Friday, demonstrations have taken place in at least 40 cities nationwide, including the capital Tehran, with protesters demanding an end to violence and discrimination against women as well as an end to compulsory wearing of the hijab.\n\nAt least 1,200 have been arrested in connection to the protests, Iranian state-backed news agency Tasmin reported Saturday, citing a security official.\n\nDozens of protesters have reportedly been killed in the resulting clashes with security forces.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the death toll – a precise figure is impossible for anyone outside the Iranian government to confirm – and different estimates have been given by opposition groups, international rights organizations and local journalists. Amnesty International said Friday that at least 30 people, including four children, had died; according to state media the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, 35 people have died.\n\nThe demonstrations have also seen journalists targeted by authorities, with at least 17 arrested, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a non-profit that monitors press freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has asked all people to identify protesters, the country’s semi-official news agency Fars News said.\n\nThe IRCG is the elite wing of the Iranian military that was established in the aftermath of the country’s revolution in 1979.\n\nPeople light a fire during a protest over the death of Mahsa Amini in Tehran on September 21, 2022. West Asia News Agency/Reuters\n\nDecades of repression\n\nAuthorities hope that by restricting the internet they can control the protests – the latest in a wave that has swept Iran in recent years. They started with the Green movement in 2009 over contested election results and more recently the 2019 protests sparked by a rise in fuel prices. Hundreds were believed to have been killed in the violent crackdown three years ago and thousands injured, according to estimates released by the UN and rights groups.\n\nBut this year’s protests are different – in their scope, scale and unprecedented feminist nature. There is also mobilization across the socio-economic divide. A young generation of Iranians are rising up on the streets against decades of repression – arguably bolder than ever.\n\nThe demonstrations have spread to dozens of Iranian cities, from the Kurdish region in the northwest, to the capital Tehran and even more traditionally conservative cities like Mashhad.\n\nWhile they were ignited by the death of Amini, the initial calls for accountability have turned into demands for more rights and freedoms, especially for women who for decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have faced discrimination and severe restrictions on their rights.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Iranian women open up about hijab law and morality police 01:13 - Source: CNN\n\nBut calls for regime change are growing too. People across the country are chanting for “death to the dictator,” in a reference to the Supreme Leader, tearing down portraits of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Remarkable images emerged on Friday night from Khamenei’s birthplace in the city of Mashhad, where protesters set fire to the statue of a man considered one of the symbols of the Islamic Revolution. Such scenes were unthinkable in the past.\n\nThis is all happening at a time when Iran’s hardline leadership is under growing pressure with talks to revive the stalled 2015 nuclear agreement and the state of the economy under US sanctions; ordinary Iranians are struggling to cope with soaring levels of inflation.\n\nWhile these protests are the biggest challenge for the government for years, analysts believe the government will likely move to contain them by resorting to the heavy-handed tactics it has used in the past. There are signs a brutal crackdown is coming, along with the internet restrictions on a level not seen since 2019. Other measures include the government mobilizing its supporters in mass rallies following Friday prayers; officials dismissing the demonstrators as rioters and foreign agents, and ominous warnings the army and powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps will be deployed to deal with the protests.\n\nSpeaking with state broadcaster IRIB on Friday, Iran’s Minister of Communications Ahmad Vahidi said, “Until the riots end, the internet will have limitations. To prevent riot organization through social media, we are obliged to create internet limitations.”\n\nVahidi’s comments came after videos on social media showed scenes of public defiance, with women removing and burning their headscarves and demonstrators chanting such slogans as, “women, life, freedom.”\n\nThe move to further restrict the internet also followed a call by the United Nations for an independent investigation into Amini’s death and for Iran’s security forces to refrain from using “disproportionate force” on the protesters.\n\nOutrage over Amini’s death comes from public skepticism over the account given by state officials, who claim she died after suffering a “heart attack” and fell into a coma. But Amini’s family have said she had no pre-existing heart condition.\n\nAmini’s death has now become a symbol of the violent oppression women have faced in Iran for decades, and her name has spread around the globe, with world leaders invoking her even at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City this week.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Thursday said UN experts strongly condemned the use of physical violence against women in Iran by state authorities.\n\n“Iranian authorities said (Amini) died of a heart attack, and claimed her death was from natural causes. However, some reports suggested that Amini’s death was a result of alleged torture and ill-treatment,” it said in a statement.\n\n“We call on the Iranian authorities to hold an independent, impartial, and prompt investigation into Ms Amini’s death, make the findings of the investigation public and hold all perpetrators accountable,” it added.\n\nInternet crackdown\n\nThe internet monitoring agency Netblocks said Friday Iranians are facing a third wave of “nation-scale” loss of mobile internet connectivity as the protests continue.\n\nThe watchdog group said earlier in the week that Iran was experiencing the most severe internet restrictions since 2019, with mobile networks largely shutdown and social networks Instagram and WhatsApp restricted in the country since protests began.\n\nTo circumvent internet blocks, Iranians both inside the country and in the diaspora are turning to popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers such as Tor Project and Hula VPN – the top downloaded apps available in Iran via Google Play Store, a marketplace for Android smartphone users to download apps, according to monitoring service AppBrain.\n\nHowever, Netblocks has warned that the kind of internet disruption seen currently in the country “cannot generally be worked around with the use of circumvention software or VPNs.”\n\nSimilar internet restrictions took place in Iran in November 2019, taking Iranians almost entirely offline as authorities tried to curb the spread of nationwide protests over fuel prices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Violent crackdown doesn't slow protest against Iran's morality police 02:35 - Source: CNN\n\nOracle’s Internet Intelligence called it at the time the “largest internet shutdown ever observed in Iran.”\n\nMeanwhile, Internet activist hacker group Anonymous has also targeted the Iranian government online over the past week, announcing several breaches of government websites on Thursday.\n\nUsing the hashtag #OpIran, short for Operation Iran, which started gaining traction on social media following the death of Amini, Anonymous also tweeted Thursday that the organization was successful in hacking more than 1,000 CCTV Iranian cameras – a claim CNN has not been able to independently confirm.\n\nUN calls for investigation\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres said Friday he was “concerned about reports of peaceful protests being met with excessive use of force leading to dozens of deaths and injuries.”\n\n“We call on the security forces to refrain from using unnecessary or disproportionate force and appeal to all to exercise restraint to avoid further escalation,” Dujarric said at the daily briefing on UNTV.\n\nThe UN said it’s closely following the protests in Iran and called on authorities to “respect the right to freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and association.”\n\n“We also call on the authorities to respect women’s rights and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and girls and implement effective measures to protect them from other human rights violations, in accordance with international standards.”\n\nGuterres reiterated a call from the Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights for a prompt investigation into the death of Amini by an “independent competent authority.”\n\nIran’s Interior Minister denied Mahsa Amini was beaten up, citing investigations into the incident, the country’s state news agency, IRNA, reported Saturday.\n\n“The results of observations, talking with those who were on the scene, receiving reports from relevant bodies and other investigations showed that late Ms. Amini was not beaten, Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi told (Iran’s state broadcaster) IRIB,” IRNA reported.\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi called Amini’s family saying he had ordered the incident to be investigated carefully so that no rights would be violated, according to IRNA. He said during his trip to the UNGA in New York last week that early coroner’s findings found no signs of beating.\n\nAfter returning to Iran follow his trip to the UNGA in New York, Raisi also called the family of a Basij member, a volunteer paramilitary group connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who was killed during protests in Mashhad, according to his official website.\n\nIn the statement released by his office, Raisi expressed his condolences to the family of Rasool Doust Mohammadi, the Basij member, and said there is a “need to distinguish between protest and disruption of public order and security,” while also describing the protests “as rioting and evil.”", "authors": ["Artemis Moshtaghian Jomana Karadsheh Caitlin Hu Kathleen Magramo Sahar Akbarzai Richard Roth", "Artemis Moshtaghian", "Jomana Karadsheh", "Caitlin Hu", "Kathleen Magramo", "Sahar Akbarzai", "Richard Roth"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-2-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Wexler/NorthJersey.com/USA Today Network In pictures: The world rallies in support of Ukraine Prev Next\n\nTensions between the two countries had been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-annexation-intl/index.html", "title": "Putin announces annexation of Ukrainian regions in defiance of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin announced Russia would seize of nearly a fifth of Ukraine on Friday, declaring that the millions of people living there would be Russian citizens “forever.”\n\nUnder the annexation process, which is illegal under international law, Moscow will recognize four Ukrainian regions as Russian territory: Luhansk and Donetsk – home to two Russian-backed breakaway republics where fighting has been ongoing since 2014 – as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, two areas in southern Ukraine that have been occupied by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began.\n\nPutin’s announcement, made in a formal speech at the Kremlin’s opulent St. George’s Hall on Friday, follows so-called referendums in the regions that were universally dismissed as “shams” by Ukraine and Western nations.\n\nPutin, however, attempted to claim that the referendums reflected the will of “millions” of people, despite reports from the ground suggesting that voting took place essentially – and in some cases, literally – at gunpoint. Western leaders have slammed the polls, saying that they fail to meet internationally recognized standards of free and fair elections.\n\nThe annexation announcement was met with a similar outcry. Members of the G7 – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – and the European Union have vowed to never recognize Russian sovereignty over the regions and to impose sanctions on Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington would place visa restrictions on 910 individuals in Russia and Belarus, while a Biden administration official said the White House would impose “swift and severe costs” on Russia. The British government said it would implement services sanctions and an export ban that target “Russian economic vulnerabilities.”\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky called the move a “farce” in a pre-recorded video statement released shortly after Putin’s speech and vowed that “the entire territory of our country will be liberated.” Zelensky also said his country would apply for NATO membership “under an accelerated procedure,” but it’s unclear how long such a process would take. New NATO members must meet a series of criteria for membership and be unanimously approved by current alliance members.\n\n“We see who threatens us,” Zelensky said. “It is in Ukraine that the fate of democracy in the confrontation with tyranny is being decided.\n\nDespite the widespread condemnation, Russia appears committed to forging ahead with its plans to fly its flag over some 100,000 square kilometers (38,600 square miles) of Ukrainian territory – the largest forcible annexation of land in Europe since 1945.\n\nIn his speech, Putin framed the annexation as an attempt to fix what he sees as a great historical mistake: Russia’s demise following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and continued Western efforts to keep the country weak.\n\nHe repeated his unfounded allegation that genocide was being committed against Russian speakers – one of the false pretenses Russia used to invade Ukraine in February.\n\nThe address, on the whole, was a commitment by the Russian leader to continue pursuing his major foreign policy aim: restoring Russia as a major global power charged with protecting the Russian speaking world from the continued threat posed by Western forces.\n\n“We remember the horrible and hungry 1990s, but Russia has survived and became stronger. And it has its place in the world,” Putin said. “But the West is still trying to make us weaker, to split us into parts.”\n\nA new phase of the conflict\n\nThe annexations could lay the groundwork for a dangerous new phase in Russia’s assault on Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have, in recent weeks, successfully expelled Russian forces from parts of Donetsk thanks in part to the advanced weaponry sent by the US and other allies. Kyiv now controls about 40% of Donetsk, though many towns and cities bear scars of war that will take years to heal.\n\nNow that Russia formally recognizes Donetsk as its own territory, the Kremlin is likely to push forward to recapture it using some of the 300,000 Russian citizens who will be conscripted as part of a “partial mobilization” Putin announced last week.\n\n“It will have to be liberated,” said Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, shortly before the speech.\n\nPutin said Friday that while he was willing to negotiate with Ukraine, the sovereignty of those four regions would not be on the table.\n\n“I want the Kyiv authorities and their real masters in the West to hear me. For everyone to remember. People living in Luhansk and Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are becoming our citizens. Forever,” the Russian president said during the annexation ceremony.\n\nPutin has previously vowed to defend Russian territory “with all the means at our disposal,” including nuclear weapons. US officials have said that they don’t believe Putin would resort to tactical nuclear weapons – a type of bomb designed for use on the battlefield that is less powerful than traditional “strategic” nuclear weapons – though they cannot discount the possibility.\n\n“We are looking very carefully to see if Russia is actually doing anything that suggests that they are contemplating the use of nuclear weapons. To date, we’ve not seen them take these actions,” US Secretary of State Blinken said Friday.\n\nAnalysts believe that Putin hopes the annexations will help shift public opinion in Russia in favor of what the Kremlin euphemistically calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian leader enjoyed stratospheric approval ratings after Crimea was annexed after a similar so-called referendum in 2014, but that was done in a largely bloodless manner using “little green men” – Russian special operations troops who poured over the border into the peninsula ahead of the annexation.\n\nThis invasion of Ukraine has proven to be a bloody, seemingly intractable conflict that has cost the Russian military countless lives. Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilization” last week led many Russians who do not support the war to fear that they will be drawn into the conflict.\n\nMore than 200,000 people – many of them young men of fighting age – have fled Russia since the partial mobilization began. Several who spoke with CNN voiced fears that the government could impose a draft at a later date.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We can't trust our government': Man joins tens of thousands fleeing Russia's draft 02:06 - Source: CNN\n\nInside Russia, the renewed war effort – and its apparent botched rollout – has been met in some corners with anger. Reports emerged of men being improperly conscripted, which Putin appeared to acknowledge on Thursday when he demanded that “mistakes” related to the order be rectified.\n\nActivist groups have said ethnic minorities in Russia are being disproportionately mobilized.

Here’s a look at how the conflict started:\n\nWhat’s the recent history in Donbas?\n\nWar broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Intense fighting left portions of Luhansk and Donetsk, in the Donbas region, in the hands of Russian-backed separatists. Russia also annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that sparked global condemnation.\n\nRussian-backed rebels seized a government building in Donetsk, Ukraine on April 11, 2014. Efrem Lukatsky/AP/FILE\n\nThe separatist-controlled areas in Donbas became known as the Luhansk and the Donetsk People’s Republics. The Ukrainian government in Kyiv asserts the two regions are, in effect, Russian-occupied. The self-declared republics are not recognized by any governments, other than Russia and its close ally Syria. The Ukrainian government refuses to talk directly with either separatist republic.\n\nThe Minsk II agreement of 2015 led to a shaky ceasefire agreement, and the conflict settled into static warfare along the Line of Contact that separates the Ukrainian government and separatist-controlled areas. The Minsk Agreements (named after the capital of Belarus where they were concluded) ban heavy weapons near the Line of Contact.\n\nLanguage around the conflict is heavily politicized. The Ukrainian government calls separatist forces “invaders” and “occupiers.” Russian media calls separatist forces “militias” and maintains that they are locals defending themselves against the Kyiv government.\n\nMore than 14,000 people have died in the conflict in Donbas since 2014. Ukraine says 1.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with most staying in the areas of Donbas that remain under Ukrainian control and about 200,000 resettling in the wider Kyiv region.\n\nHow has Putin stoked the conflict?\n\nThe separatists in Donbas have had substantial backing from Moscow. Russiahas long maintained that it has no soldiers on the ground there, but US, NATO and Ukrainian officials say the Russian government supplies the separatists, provides them with advisory support and intelligence, and embeds its own officers in their ranks.\n\nMoscow has also distributed hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to people in Donbas in recent years. Western officials and observers have accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of attempting to establish facts on the ground by naturalizing Ukrainians as Russian citizens, a de facto way of recognizing the breakaway states. It also gives him a reason to intervene in Ukraine.\n\nLast week, the Russian parliament recommended that the Kremlin formally recognize parts of the LPR and DPR as an independent states, another escalation in rhetoric that US officialssaid at the time demonstrated that Putin has no intention of abiding by the Minsk agreement.\n\nUkraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine would “not stop until we free our territories in Donbas, Crimea, until Russia pays for all the damage it caused in Ukraine.”\n\nPutin has long accused Ukraine of violating the rights of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine, and has said it was within Russia’s rights to militarily intervene to protect them.\n\nIn recent weeks, Putin has alleged that “genocide” was being committed in Donbas. His allegations aren’t new, but the timing is of concern to Western policy-makers, who fear a repeat of a 2008 conflict in Georgia.\n\nBy invoking genocide, Putin was echoing Russia’s false claim that Georgia committed genocide against civilians in the breakaway republic of South Ossetia in August 2008. During that brief conflict, Russia launched a massive military incursion that pushed deep into Georgian territory.\n\nAs it was in 2014, the Donbas region is now the crucible of the conflict between east and west, between Putin’s drive to reassert control – weakening the Ukrainian state – and the growing aspiration of Ukrainians to join the fold of European democracies.", "authors": ["Tamara Qiblawi Nathan Hodge Tim Lister Ivana Kottasová", "Tamara Qiblawi", "Nathan Hodge", "Tim Lister", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/10/07/history-of-israel-and-palestine-conflict-and-the-latest-hamas-attacks-war-in-gaza-in-maps/71098600007/", "title": "History of Israeli and Palestinian conflict and the latest conflict in ...", "text": "Intense fighting is raging in Israel and Gaza after Hamas militants launched thousands of rockets into Israel and gunmen infiltrated Southern Israel. \"We are at war, and we will win it,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. The fight may be the worst since 2021, but it's part of a complex, bitter conflict that reaches back to the first world war.\n\nThe dispute is rooted in pre-biblical times. Though its borders have shifted over the years, Palestinian territories used to be what is now Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nBoth Israeli Jews’ and Palestinian Arabs’ history, culture and identity are linked to the Palestinian territories and to the ancient city of Jerusalem, “one of the most bitterly contested cities on earth,” according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire controlled the region for about 400 years before its defeat, along with Germany, in World War I. Britain was given control of Palestine by the League of Nations in 1920, under an order called the British Mandate.\n\nIn 1917, the British government signaled its support for the establishment of a Jewish state in Israel with the Balfour Declaration.\n\nWhile the declaration stated support, it also said that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestinian territories, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.”\n\nJewish migration from eastern and central Europe surged from 1922 to 1947 as Jews fled persecution and the destruction of their communities during the interwar period and during World War II. By the end of the Holocaust, more than 6 million European Jews had been murdered, and many survivors were left stateless.\n\nAs the number of Jewish immigrants increased, many Palestinians were displaced. They began pushing back and violence resulted.\n\nIn 1929, 67 Jews were killed in the Hebron massacre, part of Palestinian riots against Jewish immigration in Palestine.\n\nDisputed territory\n\nGaza: Also known as the Gaza Strip, it’s the home to about 2 million Palestinians, many of them displaced after leaving or being driven from Israel during the War of Independence.\n\nWest Bank: Smaller than Delaware, the West Bank is east of Israel. About 3 million Palestinians live there, most of them Muslim Arabs. The West Bank contains a number of Jewish holy sites, which are visited by thousands of pilgrims every year.\n\nEast Jerusalem: Jerusalem itself is a divided, disputed city. It was cut in two after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Israel controlled the western portion and Jordan controlled the east. Israel captured the entire city in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\nThough Jerusalem's ownership is disputed, Israeli officials claim it as the undivided capital of Israel. In 2017, the Trump administration moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a formal recognition of Jerusalem as the capital.\n\nHowever, most nations do not acknowledge Jerusalem as belonging to either Israelis or Palestinians.\n\nWho's fighting?\n\nHamas\n\nHamas is the largest Palestinian militant group and has fired rockets from Gaza at Israeli cities in the fighting.\n\nIt was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and hasand has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2006, then wresting militarily control from another leadership group in 2007. It's committed to the destruction of Israel and is considered a terrorist group by the U.S., the U.K. and other nations.\n\nIsraeli Defense Forces\n\nThe IDF is the combined armed forces of Israel, including army, navy and air force. It was established in 1948, two weeks after Israel declared itself a state.\n\nInternational community tries, fails to bring peace\n\n1947: The U.N. votes to divide Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states and make Jerusalem an international city. Arabs reject the plan, which is later dropped.\n\n1948: After the British Mandate expires on May 14, the Jewish People's Council meets in Tel Aviv and establishes the State of Israel. The U.S. officially recognizes the new nation later that day; the USSR acknowledges it three days later.\n\n1949: The Armistice Agreements is a U.N.-mediated attempt to bring peace to Palestine. Israel signs agreements with Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon to reach a formal peace treaty within six months, but the effort ultimately fails.\n\n1956: Egypt nationalizes the Suez Canal and bars Israeli ships from using it and the Straits of Tiran, another shipping route. Israel, aided by Britain and France, invades Egypt. The Soviet Union, an ally of Egypt, threatens nuclear retaliation, and the U.S. pressures British, French and Israeli forces to withdraw. The U.N. deploys a peacekeeping force.\n\n1964: The Palestine Liberation Organization, a group with the goal of uniting Arab groups and liberating the Palestinian territories through armed struggle, is formed in Egypt.\n\n1967: The Six-Day War grows out of the Suez Canal conflict. Egypt orders the U.N. force to leave, closes the Straits of Tiran to Israel again, and plans a secret attack against Israel.\n\nIn a preemptive strike, Israel attacks Egypt and later Jordan and Syria, capturing Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nShift in the state of Israel\n\n1973: The Yom Kippur War starts with Egypt and Syria attacking Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year. The war is an attempt to reverse the defeat of the 1967 war.\n\nCaught unaware, the Israelis counterattack and win. The U.S. helps secure disengagement agreements from combatants, laying groundwork for future peace efforts.\n\n1979: The Camp David Accords, an Israeli-Egyptian peace deal, is set up by President Jimmy Carter and signed by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.\n\n1979: Israel begins gradual withdrawal from the Sinai.\n\n1987: Palestinians stage the first of two uprisings, or intifadas, in Gaza, Israel and the West Bank, using mass boycotts, civil disobedience and attacks on Israelis. More than 50 Israeli civilians are killed. The intifada lasts more than five years, ending in September 1993.\n\nThe Israeli military kills 1,070 Palestinians, including 237 children, according to B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization. Jewish settlers kill 54 Palestinians. The U.S. and the U.N. criticize Israel's use of lethal force.\n\n1991: In response to the intifada, the Madrid Conference, a historical gathering of all participants in the Arab-Israeli conflict, is chaired by the U.S. and Russia.\n\n1993: Oslo I, known as the Declaration of Principles, is signed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. It establishes a timetable for a Middle East peace process.\n\n1995: Oslo II is signed, a second agreement in which the Palestine Liberation Organization recognizes the state of Israel and Israel allows Palestinians limited self-government in Gaza.\n\n2000: President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat gather at the Camp David summit, a meeting intended to end hostilities. It ends without an agreement.\n\nPalestinians, frustrated over failures to create a Palestinian state, begin the second intifada in September, which lasts until February 2005. B'Tselem estimates more than 3,100 Palestinians and nearly 1,000 Israelis are killed.\n\n2005: Israel withdraws from Gaza but retains control.\n\n2007: Hamas, the militant Palestinian group, wins elections in Gaza.\n\n2008: Israel launches a major military campaign against Hamas in Gaza after increased rocket fire from militants. The fighting ends on Jan. 18, 2009, with 1,440 Palestinians and 13 Israelis killed.\n\n2012: Israeli forces kill Ahmed Jabari, a Hamas military chief, in a missile strike. The strike is part of an Israeli operation to eliminate weapons and militants in Gaza. Hamas says the killing has \"opened the gates of hell.\"\n\n2014: Hamas kidnaps and kills three Israeli teens in the West Bank, igniting the Gaza War, in which rocket attacks and airstrikes kill 2,251 Palestinians and 73 Israelis. A senior Hamas leader praises the kidnapping and says it was intended to spark a new Palestinian uprising.\n\nThe war lasts 50 days and ends with a truce. A U.N. report says both sides may have committed war crimes, which Israel and Hamas dispute.\n\n2017: The Trump administration says it will move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, in effect an official U.S. recognition of Israel's claim to the city. The embassy is relocated in 2018.\n\n2018: Protests break out on the Gaza-Israeli border as the U.S. Embassy is relocated. Demonstrators throw explosives and rocks across barrier fences and are met with gunfire and tear gas. At least 58 Palestinians are killed, the Gaza health ministry says.\n\n2021: Fighting erupts again as Israeli police raid the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem on April 13, the first night of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and disconnect speakers broadcasting prayers as Reuven Rivlin, the Israeli president, is speaking at the Western Wall, a site sacred to the Jewish people.\n\nPolice then close a nearby plaza, a popular gathering place. Palestinians and Jews begin attacking one another, and Israeli police raid the mosque on May 7.\n\nThe raid, on what's considered a holy Muslim site on one of the holiest nights of Ramadan, is viewed by Muslims as an insult.\n\nHamas and other militants fire rockets into Israel from Gaza on May 10. Israel counterattacks with airstrikes.\n\nA ceasefire went into effect on May 21. It lasted until June 16, when Hamas sent incendiary balloons – helium balloons or kites with flammable devices attached – across the Gaza border into Israel.\n\nThe devices caused 20 ground fires in fields near the border, according to the Israeli fire brigade. Hamas launched the devices after Israeli officials permitted ultranationalist demonstrators to march in Jerusalem.\n\n2022: In the spring and summer of 2022 Israel experienced a string of terrorist attacks that led it to take what it described as preemptive action, including airstrikes targeting senior commanders and weapons depots, against Iran-backed militant groups such as Islamic Jihad.\n\nAt least 44 Palestinians, including 15 children, were killed in three days of violence in August 2022.\n\n2023: In January too this year, Israel launched the first of two raids against the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, where it said Palestinian militants and activists were hiding out.\n\nThe second raid, in July 2023, saw Israel send about 1,000 soldiers, backed by drone strikes, to Jenin to demolish what it characterized as a militant \"command center.\"\n\nOctober 2023: In the biggest offensive in years, dozens of gunmen from the Palestinian militant group Hamas infiltrate southern Israel in a stunning surprise attack that coincided with a major Jewish holiday. Overnight and into the morning, Hamas launched thousands of rockets into Israel. Israel’s national rescue service said at least dozens of people were killed and hundreds wounded.\n\nCONTRIBUTING Katharine Vogel\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; The Associated Press; United Nations; Reuters; U.S. State Department", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/07"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/middle-east/956851/will-west-bank-mass-evictions-trigger-israel-palestine-clashes", "title": "Will West Bank mass evictions trigger Israeli-Palestinian clashes ...", "text": "Israel has begun demolishing buildings and evicting Palestinians in a contested area of the southern West Bank after a court ruling earlier this month approved the development of a military training zone.\n\nThe court decision follows “decades of demolition, rebuilding and a more than 20-year legal battle”, The Washington Post said, and will trigger what activists have described as “the biggest mass expulsion” of Palestinians in the West Bank since the 1967 war.\n\nThe demolitions have also “sparked expressions of concern” from the White House, the paper added.

Palestinians call it Masafer Yatta, “a collection of villages with a population of about 1,000”.\n\nBut to the Israeli state it is “Firing Zone 918, a military training area in which civilians are prohibited”, the paper added. And the fight over whether the land should be handed over to the military is “one of the fiercest battles of the Israeli occupation”.\n\nThe “tug of war for these dry rolling hills” began in the 1980s, The Washington Post said, when Israeli officials “laid claim to several areas of the West Bank for the stated reason of creating military training grounds”.\n\nThe court that decided in favour of the demolitions “was unswayed by historical documents presented by advocates for the Palestinians”, the paper added. Activists had claimed to have evidence that the government’s plan to establish a firing range four decades ago “was meant to prevent Palestinians from claiming the land”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) responded to the ruling by saying the “Supreme Court fully accepted the State Of Israel’s position” and that it “ruled that the petitioners were not permanent residents of the area”. The country’s highest court “also noted that the petitioners rejected any attempted compromise offered to them”, it added.\n\nBut Hamdan Mohammed al-Huraini, a local activist, told The Guardian: “It’s not really about destroying the houses. It’s about destroying the life.”\n\nInternational condemnation\n\nAs well as the demonstrations by residents of Masafer Yatta and other disputed territories, the Israeli government has been criticised by a host of foreign governments.\n\nFifteen European countries last week urged Israel to stop plans for more illegal settlements in the West Bank, describing the plans as a “clear violation of international law” that “hinder fair, lasting and global peace between Israelis and Palestinians”.\n\n“We are deeply concerned by the decision of the Israeli Higher Planning Council to advance plans for the construction of more than 4,000 housing units in the West Bank,” said spokespersons for the foreign ministries of France, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. “We urge the Israeli authorities to reverse this decision.”\n\nThe decision will “directly threaten the viability of a future Palestinian state”, they added, as well as creating “an additional obstacle to the two-state solution”.\n\nThe UN has also attacked the move, suggesting that the forced evictions could constitute a war crime against the Palestinian people.\n\n“By upholding this policy to drive Palestinians out of Masafer Yatta, the Israeli judicial system has given carte blanche to the Israeli government to perpetuate the practice of systematic oppression against Palestinians,” three UN special rapporteurs said in a statement.\n\nThey continued that it was “all the more disconcerting” that the decision had been made to make way for a military training base, adding: “How can this be given priority over the rights of the Palestinian residents?\n\n“Israel has shown no ‘imperative military necessity’ to vacate the area. The displacement of the Masafer Yatta communities may thus amount to a war crime.”\n\nViolent response?\n\nThe threat of a mass eviction, including “some 500 children”, has given rise to fears of further violent clashes between the IDF and Palestinians, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nIn May last year, the government in Jerusalem was forced to declare a state of emergency in a number of cities after cars were set alight by Israeli Arabs, and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that governs the Gaza Strip, fired more than 1,000 rockets towards central and southern Israel.\n\nTriggered by forced evictions of Arabs in a disputed neighbourhood of Jerusalem and aggressive Israeli policing around the al-Aqsa mosque, the events quickly began to resemble previous uprisings by Palestinians – raising fears of a third bloody intifada.\n\nWhether there will be a violent response to the evictions in Masafer Yatta remains to be seen. However, the extensive “military activity” that already takes place in the area may dissuade any demonstrations, The Guardian said.\n\nNadav Weiman, the deputy director of Breaking the Silence, an NGO that collects testimonies from former IDF soldiers, said that even before the evictions, his job in Masafer Yatta had been “to make people’s lives miserable”, adding: “That was the point.”\n\nThe speed of the demolitions may also stop any protests having time to ferment.\n\nMany of the “simple houses of block and metal roofing” have already disappeared in a spate of destruction; two were flattened by a bulldozer in “less than two hours”, The Washington Post said.\n\nSoldiers “instructed the men of the family to stay well away from the house as the women raced to grab clothes and bedding”, the paper added. But “many of their belongings were still inside when the soldiers told them to stand back”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Irenie Forshaw", "The Week Uk", "David Faris", "Rebekah Evans", "Harriet Marsden", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Austin Chen", "Sorcha Bradley"], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/asia/india-china-border-tensions-video-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Indian and Chinese troops fight with sticks and bricks in video | CNN", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nVideo of what appears to be a previously unreported violent clash between Indian and Chinese troops at their disputed Himalayan border has emerged online, offering a rare window into the long-simmering territorial tensions between the two Asian powers.\n\nThe video, according to a serving Indian military officer with knowledge of the clashes on the China-India border, was filmed in the mountainous Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh at the Line of Actual Control – the de facto border between the two countries – on September 28, 2021.\n\nCNN has reached out to China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment on the video.\n\nThough it’s not clear who filmed or released the video, it began circulating on Indian social media on Tuesday just hours after the Indian Defense Ministry confirmed that a brawl had taken place at the border on Friday, in the remote Tawang sector of northeastern India. The first reported incident in nearly two years.\n\nIn the video – which CNN cannot independently verify – troops from both countries are seen on mountainous terrain, surrounded by green hills apparently untouched by winter. Though they’re separated by barbed wire, the footage appears to show Indian troops beating the Chinese soldiers with makeshift weapons, including what look like wooden sticks and metal pipes. In several instances, Indian soldiers can be seen throwing bricks or stones.\n\nMany of the Chinese soldiers, gathered on the other side of the wire, also appear to be holding long sticks or batons.\n\nEventually the barbed wire collapses and the Indian soldiers move forward, prompting the Chinese troops to jump over a short stone wall and leave the area, to cheers from the Indian side.\n\nThe Indian military source said transgressions happen frequently due to the two sides’ different perceptions of the border – and the patrols they carry out along the LAC.\n\nSeveral experts who spoke to CNN agreed the video did not depict a recent clash given the lack of visible snow. However, the video does offer an insight into the ongoing tensions, information about which is typically highly restricted by authorities.\n\n“It’s an illustration of how quickly things can go south if tensions are not reduced between the two sides,” said Sushant Singh, senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research, an Indian think tank.\n\nBorder scuffles\n\nThe shared 2,100 mile (3,379 kilometer) border has long been the source of friction between India and China. The two countries do not agree on its precise location and both regularly accuse the other of overstepping it, or seeking to expand their territory.\n\nThough a series of mostly non-lethal scuffles over the position of the border have taken place over the years, tensions escalated sharply in June 2020 when hand-to-hand fighting between the two sides resulted in the deaths of at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers.\n\nExperts say other skirmishes that have broken out since have been downplayed by authorities. “The Indian thinking, when I speak with the officials, is that if the situation can be resolved at a very local level, at an operational level between local commanders, it does not blow up into a big major international issue where the political leadership has to be involved,” said Singh.\n\nBut unlike those apparently downplayed incidents, Friday’s skirmish was reported by Indian media. This coverage, as well as pressure from domestic political opposition, could have pushed the Indian government to discuss the incident publicly, Singh said.\n\nSpeaking to lawmakers on Tuesday, India’s defense minister accused Chinese troops of trying to cross the LAC, saying they were trying to “unilaterally” change the status quo. Soldiers from both sides sustained minor injuries, he said.\n\nLater that evening in a statement posted online, the Chinese military’s Western Theater Command accused Indian troops of “illegally” crossing into the Chinese side of the border.\n\nThe location of Friday’s clash is also significant, Singh said. Tawang, a Buddhist town, is home to a revered monastery that plays a central role in Tibetan internal politics, and the town itself is strategically important for China in handling Tibetan affairs.\n\nTibet is an internationally recognized autonomous region within the People’s Republic of China, though many Tibetans dispute the legitimacy of China’s rule. The Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has been in exile in India since an unsuccessful revolt against the Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1959.\n\n‘Indian victory’\n\nThough the source of the newly emerged video is unclear, the timing of its release – shortly after Indian authorities confirmed Friday’s Tawang clash – has raised questions.\n\nThe video appears to show “an Indian victory,” said Ian Hall, deputy director of the Griffith Asia Institute. “I think it was released to reinforce the Indian government’s narrative that it is robustly defending India’s claims.”\n\nHe added that given the opacity of information surrounding the border situation, the government has been under increased pressure from its political opponents since 2020 “about exactly what occurred … and how much ground was lost.”\n\nSingh added that the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has faced domestic criticism for not taking a stronger stance on China – meaning videos like this, appearing to show a firm Indian military response, reflect the “nationalistic mood” among the Indian population and political opposition.\n\n“I think these kinds of videos allow that political narrative to play out domestically – that look, we’re responding strong,” he said, adding that it was “highly possible” the video was timed to shore up support for the country’s leadership and military.\n\nBut more importantly, the video illustrates how precarious the border situation is, and how quickly violence could break out and potentially escalate.\n\nChinese and Indian officials have held a series of talks in the past few years, with China withdrawing troops and dismantling infrastructure along the border in 2021 under a mutual disengagement agreement. But progress has since stalled, with relations fraying further as India has drawn closer to the United States, while US-China ties have sunk to new lows.\n\n“The video reminds the rest of the world that the LAC is still volatile – much more so than it was pre-2020,” Hall said.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Former President Donald Trump announces a White House bid for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign.

She then guided Democrats as they rode the waves of popular opinion, seeing their power swell to a 257-seat majority after the 2008 elections, ultimately crash to a 188-seat minority, and then rise once again.\n\nHer political career was marked by an extraordinary ability to understand and overcome those political shifts, keeping conflicting factions of her party united in passing major legislation. She earned the Speaker’s gavel twice – after the 2006 and 2018 elections – and lost it after the 2010 elections.\n\nOf late, she has conducted a string of accomplishments with one of the slimmest party splits in history, passing a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package last year and a $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill in August.\n\nHer legislative victories in the Biden era cemented her reputation as one of the most successful party leaders in Congress. During the Obama administration, Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the massive economic stimulus bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which provides over 35 million Americans health care coverage.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the California liberal has been relentlessly attacked by Republicans, who portray her as the personification of a party for the coastal elite. “We have fired Nancy Pelosi,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Fox News on Wednesday, after Republicans won back the chamber.\n\nIn recent years, the anger directed toward her has turned menacing. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, pro-Trump rioters searched for her — and last month, a male assailant attacked Paul Pelosi, the speaker’s husband, with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco, while she was in Washington.\n\nPelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this month that her decision to retire would be influenced by the politically motivated attack. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital two weeks ago after surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his arm and hands.\n\nAfter thanking her colleagues for their well-wishes for Paul, the House chamber broke out into a standing ovation.\n\nDemocrats now look to finally choose Pelosi’s successor\n\nPelosi’s long reign became a source of tension within her own party. She won the gavel after the 2018 elections by promising her own party that she would leave her leadership post by 2022.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN it’s time for a new chapter.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” said Moulton.\n\nBut some Democrats praised Pelosi and said they wished she would remain leader. Asked about her decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said ‘please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nHouse Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats won’t vote until November 30.\n\nAfter her speech, Pelosi wouldn’t tell reporters who’d she support. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced they would also step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi. Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.” Clyburn added that he hoped Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in House Democratic leadership.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries, and help him become the first Black House Democratic leader.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” said Beatty.”I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nRetiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a former CBC chairman, told CNN that Jeffries “is prepared for the moment” if Pelosi steps aside. Butterfield said he thought Jeffries would run.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that members of her caucus had asked her to “consider” running in the party’s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding: “But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nAny decision to run again, Pelosi said, “is about family, and also my colleagues and what we want to do is go forward in a very unified way, as we go forward to prepare for the Congress at hand.”\n\n“Nonetheless, a great deal is at stake because we’ll be in a presidential election. So my decision will again be rooted in the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus,” she continued. “But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. And there are all kinds of ways to exert influence.”\n\nPelosi is a towering figure in American politics with a history-making legacy of shattering glass ceilings as the first and so far only woman to be speaker of the US House of Representatives.\n\nPelosi was first elected to the House in 1987, when she won a special election to fill a seat representing California’s 5th Congressional District.\n\nWhen she was first elected speaker, Pelosi reflected on the significance of the event and what it meant for women in the United States.\n\n“This is an historic moment,” she said in a speech after accepting the speaker’s gavel. “It’s an historic moment for the Congress. It’s an historic moment for the women of America.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Annie Grayer Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Annie Grayer", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/asia/japan-china-senkaku-islands-ships-intl-hnk-mic-ml/index.html", "title": "China is relentlessly trying to peel away Japan's resolve on disputed ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nSeoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nFor all the speculation of quick military action by China to achieve its foreign policy goals, Beijing’s track record has been more akin to peeling an onion, slowly and deliberately pulling back layers to reach a goal at the center.\n\nThink of how Beijing built up islands in the South China Sea and then fortified them, eventually establishing what the former head of the US Pacific Command in 2018 called a “Great Wall of SAMs,” – surface-to-air missiles – on islands that years earlier Chinese leader Xi Jinping had pledged not to militarize.\n\n“Relevant construction activities that China is undertaking in the Nansha (Spratly) islands do not target or impact any country, and China does not intend to pursue militarization,” Xi told former US President Barack Obama at the White House in 2015.\n\nThose militarized islands are also claimed in part by the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan, but none of those places are likely to see their claims realized. The islands – with names like Fiery Cross Reef and Mischief Reef – are essentially People’s Liberation Army bases.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Japan expands defense of its southern front line to counter China (April 2022) 05:44 - Source: CNN\n\nNow Beijing may be slowly peeling back the onion in another disputed island chain, the rocky, uninhabited Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, administered by Japan and known as the Diaoyus in China.\n\nChinese Coast Guard and even naval ships have been spending record amounts of time in the waters around the Senkakus this year, according to the Japanese Defense Ministry.\n\nEarlier this week, a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) frigate entered the waters in the contiguous zone around the Senkakus for only the fourth time since 2016, Japanese officials said.\n\nA contiguous zone covers waters between islands that do not fall into the 12-nautical-mile limit of a nation’s territorial waters. Foreign warships are allowed into those waters – so the Chinese navy hasn’t broken any international agreements – and China’s Foreign Ministry told CNN earlier this year that the Chinese Coast Guard’s patrols in the waters surrounding the islands were “an appropriate exercise of China’s sovereign right.”\n\nChina attempted to demonstrate that right on Monday when it warned a frigate from the Russian Navy to leave the very same waters, a Japanese official said.\n\n“Beijing’s goal is to establish and demonstrate effective control over the Senkaku Islands” and it needs symbols of that control, said James Brown, an associate professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo.\n\n“Sending its frigate to monitor the activity of the Russian ship could be interpreted as one such symbol of control,” Brown said.\n\nThe record amounts of time Chinese vessels are spending near the Senkakus make another statement, Brown said.\n\nTo present an international legal claim to the islands over Japan, “China simply needs to establish a greater and more enduring presence of its ships in the waters around the islands,” he said.\n\nCompeting claims\n\nAlthough the islands are uninhabited, there are economic interests involved, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nThe islands “have potential oil and natural gas reserves, are near prominent shipping routes, and are surrounded by rich fishing areas,” it says.\n\nTokyo says its claims to the islands are rooted in history. Japan’s Foreign Ministry website says in 1895 the chain was incorporated into Japanese territory after the government “carefully ascertained that there had been no trace of control over the Senkaku Islands by another state prior to that period.”\n\nJapanese Coast Guard vessels, rear and right, sail alongside a Japanese activists' fishing boat, center with a flag, near a group of disputed islands called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan, in August 2013. Emily Wang/AP\n\nAt one point, about 200 Japanese people lived in the islands, further cementing Tokyo’s claims, and China did not challenge Japanese sovereignty over the Senkakus for 75 years, it says.\n\n“This changed in the 1970s, when significant attention was drawn to the islands due to the potential existence of the oil reserves in the East China Sea,” the ministry’s website says.\n\nNow, those Chinese challenges come regularly.\n\nJapan said Wednesday that Chinese Coast Guard ships had entered Japanese territorial waters in the Senkaku chain for the 16th time this year, approaching a Japanese fishing boat.\n\nThe Japanese Coast Guard said its patrol vessels continue to deliver warnings to the Chinese ships to leave. And Tokyo has said it has protested the Chinese presence near the Senkakus through diplomatic channels.\n\nBut China has given no indication it’s prepared to negotiate over the islands.\n\nThe country’s Foreign Ministry maintains the islands are China’s inherent territory, and has accused Japanese fishing boats of making “repeated intrusions” into the area.\n\nAnd sending Chinese warships to patrol and monitor the waters around the islands “is an act of safeguarding national sovereignty,” Zhou Yongsheng, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at China Foreign Affairs University, told the state-run tabloid Global Times on Monday.\n\nSo Tokyo’s protests are just words. And if Beijing ignores them and keeps on peeling the onion, Tokyo is only left with options it doesn’t have the stomach for, Brown said.\n\nHe pointed to a 2010 incident in the islands, when a Chinese trawler rammed two Japanese coast guard vessels. Japan arrested the trawler’s captain but he was later released without charge in the face of a series of escalatory measures from Beijing, including an unofficial ban of the export of vital rare earth metals to Japan.\n\nTensions remained high for three months, and the Japanese government came under strong domestic protest for its handling of the incident.\n\n“Japan will not risk a repeat of the collision incident,” Brown said.\n\nChopping the onion\n\nLast year, China introduced a law that allows the Chinese Coast Guard to use weapons to protect national sovereignty, which in a confrontation like that of 2010, significantly expands Beijing’s options. It forces Japan to be even more cautious, according to Brown.\n\nToo much caution can become paralysis. Like the Philippines or Vietnam or Taiwan did in the South China Sea, Japan may fall victim to China’s relentless peeling.\n\n“Overall, Japan risks seeing its administration of the Senkaku Islands slip away,” Brown said.\n\nThe Chinese marine surveillance ship, top, tries to approach a Japanese fishing boat, bottom, as a Japan Coast Guard vessel Ishigaki cruises next to the Chinese ship near what are known as the Senkaku isles in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China, In April 2013. Kyodo/Reuters\n\nSome may argue that the Senkakus has one layer of protection China may not be able to peel back – the US-Japan Security Treaty, which requires Washington to defend Japanese territory.\n\nBrown said read the fine print on that – and then consider possible Japanese paralysis.\n\n“The US security commitment applies to ‘territories under the administration of Japan.’ Beijing may therefore be of the view that, if Japan no longer exercises such administration, the US security guarantee to the Senkaku Islands will no longer apply,” he said.\n\nAnd at that point, the onion will not only be peeled, it will be chopped.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}]}

After two terms, McCain ascended to the U.S. Senate in 1987, replacing legendary Republican U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater, who in 1964 was the only other Arizonan to top the national ticket of a major U.S. political party. McCain was re-elected to the Senate in 1992, 1998, 2004, 2010 and 2016.

John McCain follows announcement that he's ending cancer treatment\n\nOften called a maverick, McCain was a complicated personality and will be remembered as the most important political figure to emerge from Arizona in the past 50 years.\n\nHe was ensnared by the “Keating Five” scandal of the late 1980s and was deemed by the Senate Ethics Committee to have demonstrated poor judgment by joining four Senate colleagues in meeting with federal thrift regulators on behalf of political benefactor Charles H. Keating Jr., a savings-and-loan tycoon and developer.\n\nIt was in the wake of that scandal, in the 1990s and early- to mid-2000s, McCain's \"maverick\" reputation began to take shape, as he led fights for campaign finance reform and comprehensive immigration reform and against Big Tobacco. During his 2000 presidential run, McCain famously decried leaders of the Religious Right as “agents of intolerance,” a gutsy fight to pick for a Republican.\n\nThe 'maverick'\n\nIn 2015, his own presidential ambitions in the past, McCain clashed with Republican Donald Trump in a public feud that extended into Trump’s time in the White House.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, McCain sided with two other GOP senators and all Democrats and cast a crucial vote — a literal thumbs-down on the Senate floor — that stalled Republican efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act, a top Trump priority.\n\nUnlike many of Trump’s GOP punching bags, McCain had the stature to go nose-to-nose with the president.\n\nAt one point in the early 2000s, Democrats encouraged McCain to consider switching parties, and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry approached him about serving as his running mate.

I said I have always acted in what I think is in the best interests of the state and the country, and that’s the way that I will always behave.”\n\nTwo presidential runs\n\nMcCain proved himself to be a thorn in the side of his GOP rival, Bush, at least early in the first term of Bush’s presidency. The McCain vs. Bush fight in 2000 had taken a bitter turn in the South Carolina primary, where McCain and his allies accused their conservative opponents of trying to smear him and his family.\n\nHowever, he and Bush reconciled as McCain geared up for his second presidential run. A classic Senate hawk, McCain was a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and strongly supported Bush’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. McCain also was a champion of the surge strategy that Bush employed in Iraq in 2007.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential race, McCain had to overcome the lingering distrust of many conservatives who resented his maverick record, which included votes against key Bush tax cuts as well as McCain’s successful push for bipartisan campaign-finance-reform legislation.\n\nHis decision to gamble on the untested and little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate was cheered by the conservative wing of the Republican Party but may have hurt the GOP ticket among independent voters.\n\nHowever, McCain never had much of a chance of defeating Obama, given the political atmosphere of the time.\n\nVoters were widely dissatisfied with Bush, whose approval numbers were bad, and war fatigue had set in. If that wasn’t bad enough, the U.S. economy melted down in September 2008, making it unlikely that another Republican would succeed Bush. The political-science models pointed to a Democratic victory.\n\nMarch 13:Meghan McCain: Still no timetable for ailing father John McCain's return to the Senate\n\nMarch 4:Sen. John McCain, wife all smiles in springtime photo\n\n“You can't win with conditions this bad for the incumbent party,” Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said after the election. “And that's McCain's consolation: He did reasonably well under extremely difficult conditions. It was never meant to be.”\n\nLooking back at the race in an August 2017 interview with The Republic, McCain largely concurred, though he stressed that Obama deserves the credit for his victory.\n\n\"One, Barack Obama was a very, very strong candidate and that's the most important thing,\" McCain said. \"Second, when the stock market collapsed, it really sent us into a real drop. Third of all, I guess, Americans were ready for a change, too.\n\n“But I'd like to emphasize the first thing I said: Barack Obama was an incredibly impressive candidate and he did a great job campaigning,” he added.\n\nTaking on new foes\n\nTwo years after his White House defeat, the perception of McCain as an establishment moderate was still strong enough to attract a Senate primary challenger from the right: former six-term U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth, a professional broadcaster who was known as a fierce foe of illegal immigration.\n\nIn the year of the conservative “tea party” uprising, McCain took no chances and greatly outspent Hayworth, destroying him in the process with an unrelenting barrage of hard-hitting TV campaign commercials. In one memorable ad aimed at Hayworth’s conservative base, McCain rebranded himself as a border hard-liner by calling for the completion of “the danged fence” between the United States and Mexico. After dispatching Hayworth in the primary, McCain effortlessly clinched a fifth Senate term in the 2010 general election.\n\nFeb. 28:Cindy and Meghan McCain hit back at President Trump for attacking ailing Sen. John McCain\n\nFeb. 8:Meghan McCain: Flu season concerns are keeping John McCain in Arizona\n\nNear the end of that term, McCain found himself feuding with celebrity-billionaire-turned-presidential-candidate Trump.\n\nIn a notorious July 18, 2015, jab at McCain, Trump said McCain was “a war hero because he was captured” and that he liked “people that weren’t captured.”\n\nTrump also derided McCain as weak on immigration and border security. McCain returned the criticism on a number of issues, including Trump’s approach to foreign policy. In October 2016, McCain finally withdrew his endorsement of Trump after a 2005 recording surfaced of Trump talking about women in crude and vulgar ways.\n\nTheir duels may have helped McCain in that they made Democrats’ election-year efforts to tether McCain to Trump, who had made a series of inflammatory comments, all but impossible. McCain effortlessly defeated U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, and dramatically outperformed Trump, who also carried Arizona on Election Day but by a much slimmer margin.\n\nA POW in North Vietnam\n\nJohn Sidney McCain III was born Aug. 29, 1936, at the Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone. His father, John S. McCain Jr., and grandfather, John S. “Slew” McCain Sr., would become the only father-son team of four-star Navy admirals in U.S. history. During World War II, Slew McCain was in charge of aircraft carriers fighting the Japanese in the Pacific and had a destroyer named in his honor in 1953. The youngest McCain followed in the footsteps of his namesakes, attending the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and becoming a naval aviator.\n\nIn July 1967, during the Vietnam War, McCain survived a fiery maritime disaster on the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal that killed 134 people and nearly sank the ship in the Gulf of Tonkin. McCain was getting ready to take off from the deck when another plane accidentally fired a Zuni missile and hit his plane or one next to it, spilling fuel. McCain was wounded by shrapnel and narrowly escaped death himself in the blaze that followed as bombs and planes began exploding.\n\n“The crew’s heroics kept her afloat,” McCain recalled in his 1999 memoir \"Faith of My Fathers.\" “They fought the inferno with a tenacity usually reserved for hand-to-hand combat. They fought it all day and well into the next, and they saved the Forrestal.”\n\nFeb. 2:John McCain decries memo release: 'We are doing Putin's job for him'\n\nJan. 31:John McCain's son Jack says dad 'sounds better than the day before'\n\nOn the 40th anniversary of his getting shot down over Hanoi, North Vietnam, McCain told The Republic that the Forrestal disaster may have affected him more deeply in the long run.\n\n“To be honest with you, the Forrestal fire seems to be a more impactful date I remember more than that of when I was shot down,” McCain said at the time.\n\nSurviving the Forrestal crisis — the “Inferno at Sea” as the Aug. 11, 1967, cover of Life magazine dubbed it and the worst naval disaster since World War II — was just the beginning for McCain.\n\nOn Oct. 26, 1967, McCain was piloting an A-4 Skyhawk attack bomber that had taken off from the USS Oriskany when a missile blew off one of its wings. Seriously wounded, he was captured and would spend more than five brutal years as a POW.\n\nHe refused early release, which was offered to him because he was the son of a Navy admiral and would have served North Vietnamese propaganda purposes. While in custody, McCain was routinely beaten and at one point confessed that he was a “black criminal” and an “air pirate,” which he would remember as a low point of his life.\n\nMcCain finally was released, along with other POWs, in 1973.\n\nIn 1977, McCain became the Navy’s liaison to the U.S. Senate, setting into motion his future career path as a politician.\n\nAfter returning to the United States, McCain’s first marriage to the former Carol Shepp fell apart, and the couple eventually divorced in 1980. He later married Cindy Hensley, daughter of a wealthy Arizona beer distributor. The two met in Hawaii. She was 17 years younger than he was. McCain retired from the Navy in 1981, and his new marriage brought him to the Phoenix area.\n\nThe POW backstory was ready-made for a politician.\n\nPolitical success – and scandal\n\nIn 1982, McCain ran for and won the seat being vacated by the retiring former U.S. House Minority Leader John Rhodes, R-Ariz. Though McCain was called a carpetbagger, he prevailed in a tough four-way GOP primary. He faced no serious competition in the general election.\n\nMcCain pushed back on the charge that he was a political opportunist with no roots in Arizona. He said his Navy family was forced to move often.\n\n“As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi,” McCain said.\n\nMcCain was somewhat lucky in his first U.S. Senate race in 1986. Veteran U.S. Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., declined to run on the Republican side. Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a popular Democrat with presidential ambitions, also decided not to try for the retiring Goldwater’s seat. A self-inflicted political wound briefly made things interesting — McCain had made an ill-advised reference to Phoenix-area retirement community Leisure World as “Seizure World,” a place where 97 percent of the people voted and “the other 3 percent were in intensive care” — but he still wound up easily defeating Democratic opponent Richard Kimball.\n\nDec. 26:John McCain and Jeff Flake stood up for U.S. values and unity: Arizona Republic editorial\n\nDec. 20:McCain 'headed back to Washington' after the holidays, says Arizona governor\n\n“Occasionally, my sense of humor is ill-considered or ill-timed, and that can be a problem,\" McCain later conceded in his 2002 book, \"Worth the Fighting For.\"\n\nEarly in his first Senate term, McCain and fellow U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and three other senators participated in two April 1987 meetings with federal thrift regulators who were investigating California-based Lincoln Savings & Loan. The troubled business was part of Charles H. Keating Jr.'s financial empire.\n\nKeating had donated and helped raise money for both Arizona senators. The McCain family even vacationed with Keating in the Bahamas. Once the meetings were made public, McCain and DeConcini found themselves at the heart of a major national scandal that resulted in 23 days of Senate ethics hearings.\n\n“I was judged eventually, after three years, of using, quote, poor judgment, and I agree with that assessment,” McCain would later say.\n\nThe federal government seized Lincoln Savings & Loan in April 1989 and prosecuted Keating for fraud.\n\nDec. 18:Doctor: McCain's setback 'normal' during brain cancer treatment\n\nDec. 17:Sen. John McCain returns to Arizona, will miss vote on tax bill\n\nThough DeConcini, who was determined to have acted inappropriately, would not run for a fourth term in 1994, McCain sought a second Senate term in 1992 and was able to overcome the Keating Five stigma. The controversy also didn’t do much to hinder his presidential runs in 2000 and 2008 and was largely forgotten during his later years in the Senate.\n\n\"It's ancient history,\" Bruce Merrill, the late Arizona State University professor emeritus and longtime political pollster, said of the scandal upon Keating’s death in 2014. \"It's amazing he (McCain) survived that, and I guess one could argue that his political skills brought him through that.”\n\nMcCain had seven children, including television commentator and author Meghan McCain. His family lived in the central Phoenix area for years.\n\nFollow Dan Nowicki on Twitter: @dannowicki\n\nDec. 14:McCain trying to 'get rested up' after cancer treatment, friends say\n\nDec. 13:'The View': Joe Biden tells Meghan McCain, 'If anyone can make it, your dad can'\n\nNov. 14:McCain blasts Army for considering recruits with history of self-mutilation, vows action\n\nNov. 6:Sen.

Tim Walz will join her on the ticket.\n\nThe decision came two weeks after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection. He quickly endorsed Harris as his pick for president.\n\nTwo days after Biden's announcement, Harris visited the president's former campaign headquarters in Wilmington. They are now being used as hers.\n\nTuesday's decision came as Harris prepared to campaign in Philadelphia. She and Walz spoke late Tuesday afternoon at Temple University's Liacouras Center.\n\nREAD:Why Joe Biden's decision to step out of the presidential race had to happen in Delaware\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, Gov. Tim Walz address rally, country together for the first time\n\nPhone service had long stopped working. The crowd stood. Noise erupted throughout the Temple University basketball arena.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz walked out to address some 10,000 people in the first campaign rally uniting the coming Democratic ticket in Philadelphia. Harris was on a mission to introduce her newly announced running mate for the first time on a national stage.\n\n“I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future,” Harris said, backed by a chorus of cheers. And, she added, “I’m here today, Pennsylvania, because I found it.”\n\nHarris walked the packed arena through the Minnesota statesmen’s biography, from service in the Army National Guard for 24 years, to a career teaching, to even working as a football coach.\n\nHarris touted Walz’s service as a congressman, as well as a governor, assuring the crowd he would be “ready on day one.” Some efforts she highlighted in Minnesota included protecting reproductive freedoms, as well as rights for union workers and universal free school meals in Minnesota.\n\n“We agree on many things,” Harris said. “And one of them is that when the middle class is strong, America is strong.”\n\nIn fact, Harris called the entire election a question of “fundamental freedoms.” She stuck to these issues, as well as bringing down inflated prices, but did not dig into immigration reform. She voiced support for ensuring voting rights, gun safety and the “freedom of the woman to make decisions about her own body.”\n\nWalz may be a hunter and Midwest gun owner, Harris said, but together, the duo plans to support greater gun safety reform.\n\n“That’s what this election is about,” Walz said, his remarks echoing just after Harris. “What direction will this country go in?”\n\nThe pair felt their Republican challengers needed less introduction.\n\nThe vice president landed a familiar line, highlighting her experience as a prosecutor as she told the crowd: “I know Donald Trump’s type.” And Walz took shots of his own at his now-direct competition, calling Sen. JD Vance’s views harmful and “backward.\"\n\n“These guys are creepy, and yes, just weird as hell,” Walz said. He added that he can’t wait to get on the debate stage.\n\nHarris has rapidly ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket, wasting no time after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on July 21. She secured the Democratic nomination last week, earning the majority of her party's delegates just one day after voting opened. Her campaign raised more than $200 million and gained some 170,000 volunteers in the same timeframe.\n\nLeaving Philadelphia, Harris and Walz now plan to visit western Wisconsin, Detroit, Raleigh, N.C., Savannah, Ga., Phoenix and Las Vegas, according to the campaign.\n\n“We are the underdogs in this race,” Harris said. “But we have the momentum.”\n\n— Kelly Powers\n\nGov. Shapiro gets love on the Harris-Walz rally stage, after VP pass\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro seemed moved by an electric crowd at the Liacouras Center when he walked onto the stage.\n\nThe politician closely eyed as a vice presidential pick may not have gotten the VP nod — but he got a long, loud standing ovation at the first Harris-Walz rally. At one point, he even lost his Philadelphia crowd, as they briefly chanted: “We want Shapiro.”\n\nBut he reeled it back in, correcting them to “He’s a weirdo,” as he finished his ongoing critiques of the Republican nominee for vice president, Sen. JD Vance.\n\n“Y’all fill my heart, and I love you so much,” Shapiro said.\n\nShapiro looked to boost Gov. Tim Walz, while also using his time with the crowd to paint former President Donald Trump and his own running mate as threats. Shapiro touched on common Democratic themes this election season, like abortion rights, voting rights and more. He said it was the Republican presidential nominee who “ripped the decision” away from women at the fall of Roe v. Wade, while he was in office.\n\nShapiro called Vice President Kamala Harris a friend of two decades, as well as what he believes the country needs in just over 90 days.\n\n“Freedom is on the ballot... But let me tell you something Philly,” Shapiro said. “Let me tell you something Pennsylvania, let me tell you something America — I am more optimistic than I have ever been before.”\n\n— Kelly Powers\n\nFirst Harris-Walz rally kicks off in Philadelphia to packed arena\n\nCue the mic.\n\n“This ticket is sick,” said Jaime Harrison, as the Democratic National Committee chair kicked off the first Harris-Walz rally. He had the arena yelling as he called on the Philadelphia crowd to support Harris for president.\n\n“Now’s the time to have her back,” Harrison said. “Because she’s always had ours.”\n\nSpeakers began to address the Liacouras Center, aiming to warm up the crowd while a line continued at the doors and around the block. They had no issue. Early speakers played up the momentum of this rapidly mobilized Democratic ticket, warned about the danger of Republican challengers, of fighting corporate \"greed-flation\" and more, as cheers filled the packed arena.\n\nSpeakers included U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, Sen. Bob Casey Jr. and more in rapid succession.\n\n“I know we have some union workers in this audience,” Casey said to the rally, calling this a race for working families. (Walz is seen to bring pro-union and suburban-to-rural appeal to help Democrats clinch a 2024 win.)\n\nOne voice joined the stage as the first woman to hold her office, too.\n\n“I need you to know this is history in the making,” said Cherelle Parker, met with applause and ovations as she took the stage.\n\nParker is the first woman to serve as Philadelphia’s mayor, while Harris looks to be the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to even reach a major party ticket.\n\n“Are you ready Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, to welcome Kamala Harris?” the mayor said, as the room awaited its main act.\n\n— Kelly Powers\n\nLiacouras Center hits capacity ahead of Harris and Walz's arrival\n\nEvent organizers have told the crowd that the main venue is at capacity and they are opening an overflow space for folks to watch indoors. The overflow space is located next to the arena at Pearson-McGonigle Hall, also a Temple University building.\n\nThe arena holds about 10,000 people and was packed long before Harris and Walz were set to take the stage. U.S. Sen. Tom Carper and State Treasurer Colleen Davis could both be seen in attendance inside.\n\nRally attendees make their way toward Temple University's Liacouras Center\n\nWith an hour and 15 minutes until Harris and Walz are scheduled to speak, a steady stream of people are arriving at the Cecil B. Moore subway station, named for the former Philadelphia City Council member and civil rights activist. They're heading west toward 16th Street, where the line to enter the Liacouras Center starts, wrapping around several blocks.\n\nRough guesses estimate about 1,000 in line.\n\nTraffic is stopped on Broad Street as far south as Oxford Street and north as Diamond Street. A few blocks from the Liacouras, there’s not much else going on, with a few folks selling water and T-shirts on a humid and gray Tuesday afternoon.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\nSupporters wait eagerly to attend rally\n\nAs we hit the listed kickoff time of 5:30 p.m., there are still several hundred if not thousands of folks waiting to enter the arena. The line has moved in spurts.\n\nKina Jackson chipped away at a lemon water ice as she walked through the line to enter the Liacouras Center Tuesday, the envy of at least one reporter.\n\nJackson lives in Osaka, Japan, but is visiting family in Philadelphia, the city where she was born and raised.\n\nJackson said the fervor behind Harris reminds her of the enthusiasm for the first run of the Obama campaign. She was happy to be around others excited about Harris’ campaign, citing how voting in the American election by mail-in ballot from overseas can feel isolating.\n\nJackson was initially nervous about Biden leaving the race, fearful the Democrats would pass over Harris for another candidate. She’s pleased with the choice of Walz as Harris’ running mate.\n\n“I think it’s a nice perspective to add to the ticket,” Jackson said, adding that she enjoyed seeing videos earlier today of Walz with his family and at a state fair.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\nAttendees from near and far bring support for Harris' campaign\n\nTanya Lopez has been living blocks from the Liacouras Center on N. 16th Street for 13 years. She said she has never seen a crowd like the one that filled her street Tuesday afternoon – including the day when Trump held a rally here in June.\n\nLopez remarked at the diversity and enthusiasm of the rally-goers.\n\n“I think it shows a lot to the world and our nation of how powerful this is,” she said.\n\nLopez described herself as conservative on some issues and liberal on others, but is excited about Harris’ candidacy. She believes Harris is a stronger choice than Biden to connect to younger voters.\n\n“We live in a social media era,” she said.\n\nLopez added about Trump: “He’s a convicted felon. You know how many felons I know that can’t get a job.”\n\nOthers traveled further to support Harris and her VP pick. Couple Spencer Knoll and Andrew Petrick drove about two and a half hours from West Chester, New York to attend Tuesday’s rally.\n\nKnoll wore a neon green shirt with Kamala in black text, in the style of Charli XCX’s album \"Brat.\" Petrick’s shirt was the inverse, black with neon green.\n\n“Biden did a great job,” Knoll said. “(Harris)’s so vibrant and happy. That’s what we need.”\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\nTemple University awaits first view of next Democratic ticket\n\nLiacouras Center is buzzing before 3 p.m.\n\nTemple University’s 10,000-seat arena lies in wait for the first campaign rally with Harris, the assured Democratic nominee, and her newly minted running mate, Walz.\n\nThe vice presidential pick, announced just this morning, meant the Minnesota statesman beat out a familiar name here in Philadelphia: Gov. Josh Shapiro. Shapiro still plans to attend Tuesday night's rally, he said earlier in the day, as he aims to keep traveling across Pennsylvania to drum up support against Republican challengers former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance.\n\nWalz already called joining the ticket “the honor of a lifetime” in his first public comments post-selection. But in a few hours, the former teacher and outspoken Midwestern Democrat will step onto the national stage − literally.\n\nCrowds have already started to gather outside and inside the basketball stadium, with a stream of attendees trickling past security on Temple’s main campus. It’s not clear if any guests like Megan Thee Stallion − a Grammy-winning rapper who opened the Harris rally in Atlanta last month − should be expected on stage, but remarks are eyed to begin around 5:30 p.m.\n\nHarris' campaign has not lost any time since President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on July 21. Following their stop in Philadelphia, the new duo plans to visit western Wisconsin, Detroit, Raleigh, N.C., Savannah, Ga., Phoenix and Las Vegas, according to the campaign.\n\n— Kelly Powers\n\nWho will play Walz on SNL?\n\nWe know Maya Rudolph has been confirmed for this season of Saturday Night Live, meaning she'll again play Harris. But the question is now, who's going to play Walz?\n\nIt's hard not to look at the Minnesota governor and think Steve Martin would be the perfect doppelganger. Martin has hosted the show 16 times and made dozens of special guest appearances, too, so he's already comfortable on SNL.\n\nMORE:Who will play Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live?\n\nTemple University prepares for Harris, Walz rally\n\nThe line outside Temple University was buzzing early Tuesday afternoon, hours ahead of a rally held by Harris and her running mate.\n\nBy 1:30 p.m., security was streaming people inside. Harris and Walz are expected to speak about 5:30 p.m.\n\nShapiro, a close contender for the VP pick, is expected at the rally. He's set to speak before Harris and Walz, according to the governor's office.\n\nWhen will Walz debate Vance?\n\nThe exact details of the 2024 vice-presidential debate have yet to be decided. Before Biden exited the race and Harris assumed the top spot on the Democratic ticket, the campaign had accepted an invitation from CBS News for a vice-presidential debate on either July 23 or Aug. 13.\n\nAt the time, Trump’s campaign said Vance would wait to agree to proposed dates for a debate until after Democrats finalized their ticket at the party’s national convention, which is scheduled to take place Aug. 19 to 22.\n\n— Rachel Barber, USA Today\n\nBiden: Harris made a 'great decision'\n\nA little more than an hour after Harris officially announced in a fundraising text message that she had chosen Walz, Biden weighed in.\n\nThe president called Harris' choice a \"a great decision.\" He said he's known the governor for nearly two decades, first during his time in Congress and then as a governor.\n\n\"The Harris-Walz ticket will be a powerful voice for working people and America's great middle class,\" Biden wrote on X. \"They will be the strongest defenders of our personal freedoms and our democracy. And they will ensure that America continues to lead the world and play its role as the indispensable nation.\"\n\nBiden added that every generation of Americans \"faces a moment where they are asked to defend American democracy.\"\n\n\"That moment is now,\" Biden said.\n\nHope Walz, Gwen Walz, Gus Walz: Meet the family of Tim Walz\n\nWalz and his wife, Gwen, share two children, Hope and Gus.\n\nIn March, Walz shared his family’s struggle to conceive and the IVF journey that brought them their daughter.\n\nWalz and Gwen married in 1994. The two met in western Nebraska, where Gwen began her English teaching career.\n\nAlongside her three sisters, Gwen was raised by her parents, Val and Linn, in Glencoe, Minnesota. Val and Linn were educators and small business owners.\n\nGwen has received degrees from Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter and Minnesota State University in Mankato.\n\nREAD:Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is Harris' VP pick. Who is his family?\n\nWalz vs. JD Vance\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as Harris’ pick for running mate, will now go up against Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the official Republican vice-presidential candidate. The pair are expected to face off directly in a debate, though that event has not yet been scheduled.\n\nWalz, a former teacher, has spent almost two decades in politics as both a congressman and now governor. Vance began his political career in 2022, following fame from his best-selling book, “Hillbilly Elegy.”\n\nREAD:Tim Walz vs. JD Vance: How Kamala Harris, Donald Trump's VP picks match up\n\nThe two are opposite on a slew of issues, including abortion, climate change and immigration. But they face a similar challenge in the months leading up to Election Day of making a pitch to voters about why they're the right man for the job – and that their running mate is the right man or woman for the White House.\n\nVance held a campaign event in Philadelphia Tuesday afternoon.\n\n— Savannah Kuchar, USA Today\n\nDonald Trump reacts to Walz, says VP pick will 'unleash hell on earth'\n\nFormer President Donald on Tuesday wrote in a fundraising text to supporters that \"TIM WALZ WILL UNLEASH HELL ON EARTH!\"\n\n\"He's already pulling in MILLIONS to WIPE MAGA OUT,\" the message said.\n\nIn a statement attached to the text, Trump claimed Walz would \"unleash HELL ON EARTH and open our borders to the worst criminals imaginable,\" as well as \"rubber stamp Kamala’s GREEN NEW SCAM and light TRILLIONS of dollars on fire.\"\n\nWhere is Minnesota?\n\nFor those who may have failed their U.S. states exam in elementary school − or who never had to take such a test at all − Minnesota is a Midwestern state that shares a border with Canada.\n\nThe Dakotas are to its west, while Wisconsin borders it to the east. Directly south is Iowa.\n\nWhile Minneapolis is the state's most populated city, Saint Paul is its capital. These two make up the metropolitan area known as the Twin Cities.\n\nSen. Chris Coons: Harris made a 'great choice'\n\nDelaware Sen. Chris Coons on Tuesday called Walz a \"great choice.\"\n\nCoons, who serves as co-chair for Harris' presidential campaign, touted the Minnesota governor's \"strong record of leadership\" as a high school teacher, a National Guard, a congressman and governor.\n\n\"He will be a terrific partner for Vice President Harris on the campaign trail and in governing,\" Coons' statement said. \"Annie and I look forward to campaigning with Tim and Gwen and to helping make sure that the Harris-Walz ticket is successful this November!”\n\nShapiro: Work in Pa.

Josh Shapiro issued a statement Tuesday morning after news broke that Walz had been chosen as Harris' vice presidential pick.\n\nIn the statement, Shapiro said the decision was \"deeply personal\" for both him and Harris.\n\n\"Pennsylvanians elected me to a four-year term as their Governor, and my work here is far from finished – there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this Commonwealth,\" Shapiro said.\n\n\"In just 19 months, we’ve made a meaningful, positive impact in peoples’ lives, and I’m proud of how Americans all across the country have taken notice of what we’re accomplishing here in Pennsylvania,\" he continued. \"I’m excited to continue working to protect and advance real freedom, deliver good schools, safe communities, and economic opportunity.”\n\nShapiro added that Walz \"is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket,\" saying he will \"help Kamala move our country forward.\"\n\nShapiro will be campaigning for Harris \"all across\" Pennsylvania, he said.\n\nRELATED:Shapiro to campaign for Harris after Walz VP pick; says work in PA 'far from finished'\n\nWhy Tim Walz?\n\nWalz is a pro-union Democrat who can speak to the concerns of blue-collar workers in Midwestern states.\n\nHis ability to bridge the divide between progressive policies and conservative values had resonated with his constituents, who elected him to serve six terms in Congress before he ran for Minnesota governor.\n\nIt’s also a talent the Harris campaign will seek to wield as it crisscrosses the nation in an effort to sway voters of all stripes – especially those with conservative leanings in swing states.\n\nDuring his tenure, Walz sat on the House Agriculture Committee, Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Armed Services Committee, and proved a solid supporter of key Democratic issues – voting, for example, to raise the federal minimum wage, protect abortion rights and advance the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTim Walz on Israel, Gaza\n\nAs speculation swirls about when Iran will attack Israel − as it vowed to do after last week's assassination of senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh − voters are carefully eyeing Walz' stance on the Jewish state and Gaza.\n\nIn March, he called for a ceasefire when speaking with Minnesota Public Radio, saying, \"It has to be a working cease-fire.\"\n\n“I've asked for these humanitarian pauses to get folks out,” he said. “I want this thing to end; I don't want a cease-fire to last for a week or something like that. We need a permanent solution.”\n\nFollowing Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, he ordered Minnesota's flags to be flown at half-staff and attended a vigil at a local synagogue.\n\nWalz is a Lutheran.\n\nReproductive rights a key issue for Walz\n\nWalz has long used his position to protect access to reproductive care in Minnesota and beyond.\n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Minnesota became the first state to codify abortion rights via the state legislature.\n\nThe Protection of Reproductive Options Act, which Walz signed in January 2023, enshrines women’s rights to reproductive freedom without interference from politicians.\n\nOne year later, during a roundtable event with members of Planned Parenthood, Walz called Minnesota an “island of decency” that welcomes women from other states seeking abortions.\n\nSince the bill’s passage, Minnesota has seen an influx of out-of-state patients seeking care.\n\nDuring his State of the State address this year, Walz briefly disclosed his own family’s painful struggle to conceive and their use of in vitro fertilization, a procedure that has come under attack in the conservative movement to restrict reproductive freedom.\n\n“Your personal decisions about your family are no one’s business but your own,” he said at the time. “You have my pledge as long as I am governor, IVF will continue to offer a lifeline of hope for Minnesota families.”\n\n— Sam Woodward, USA Today\n\nTim Walz bio\n\nA Midwesterner through and through, Walz was born and raised in rural Nebraska by a public school administrator and a community activist. He spent summers working on his family farm before enlisting in the Army National Guard at 17.\n\nHe spent the next quarter century serving his country while holding down a series of positions as a school teacher – first at a Native American reservation in South Dakota, then overseas in China, then back home in Nebraska and finally in Minnesota, where he and his family relocated in 1996.\n\nWalz decided to run for office a decade later, in 2006, seeking to represent a staunchly Republican-held district in the southern part of the state.\n\nHis win against the six-term incumbent came as somewhat of a surprise to political observers, but Walz proved a popular candidate who styled himself as a plain-spoken moderate able to connect with the district’s mostly rural voters.\n\nWHO IS TIM WALZ:Tim Walz is Kamala Harris' VP pick: Minnesota governor named running mate: Live updates\n\nWalz holds a bachelor’s degree in social science education from Chadron State College in Nebraska and a master’s of science degree in educational leadership from Minnesota State University Mankato.\n\nHe is married to Minnesota First Lady Gwen Walz, also a former educator, and has two children, Hope and Gus.\n\n— Sam Woodward, USA Today\n\nIs Minnesota a swing state?\n\nVoters in Minnesota, Walz' home state, have a history of choosing Democrats in the presidential election, and Biden carried the state in 2020.\n\nYet according to the Minnesota Post, many political observers consider the Midwestern state a \"second tier\" battleground state, meaning it's certainly not a shoe-in for either candidate.\n\nHarris and Walz have planned a battleground states tour where they will hit seven cities in five days. As of Tuesday morning, however, Minnesota was not on that list.\n\nThe tour includes: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Detroit, Michigan; Durham, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nPa. Gov. Josh Shapiro, Walz were finalists for VP pick, sources say\n\nPennsylvania Gov. John Shapiro and Walz were Harris' final two contenders for vice president, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter.\n\nOthers under consideration were: Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nHarris made her decision Monday, according to several media reports.\n\nWho is Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz?\n\nAn Army National Guard veteran who worked as a high school teacher and football coach, 60-year-old Walz spent more than a decade in Congress before taking office as governor in 2019. He was reelected in 2022.\n\nWalz has recently gained traction due to his direct and candid nature. He also may have inadvertently started the Democrats’ viral labeling of conservative opponents, particularly the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, as “weird.”\n\nREAD:Who is Tim Walz? What to know about the governor who is Harris' VP pick\n\nUSA Today contributed to this report.\n\nGot a story tip or idea?

He was the Rays’ second child and only son. The family was of modest means and lived in a frame house on 26th Street near the Drake University campus.\n\nBOB RAY, 1928-2018:\n\nCHAPTER ONE: ICE CREAM AND POLITICS\n\nThe future five-term governor of Iowa spent his childhood playing pickup baseball games at Drake Park. He played basketball and tennis while attending Grant, Callanan and Roosevelt schools.\n\nRay developed a lifelong obsession with ice cream at Reed’s Ice Cream on Forest Avenue, where he often stood in line for nickel ice cream bars several times a day. In high school, he worked part-time at Mrs. Smith Butcher Shop on Cottage Grove.\n\nRay was not a standout student, his mother and former teachers would say. He was bright and had an unusual ability to remember anything he saw or heard, but seldom studied hard.\n\n“I know in high school, the teachers would talk to me and they’d say, ‘If he’d just open his book and work hard, he’d be an A-plus student,’” Mildred Ray told journalist John Bowermaster for the 1986 book “Governor: An Oral Biography of Robert D. Ray.”\n\nClassmates remembered Ray largely as a loner. He was friendly, they told Bowermaster, but introverted and quiet. Yet his political chops first appeared in seventh grade at Callanan Junior High School.\n\nAn early win\n\nClassmate George Lilly, who later owned a Volkswagen dealership in the metro, nominated Ray for seventh-grade class president. Ray made banners and posters and gave speeches. He won the office and the admiration of another Callanan student, a young Marvin Pomerantz.\n\nPomerantz would grow up to become one of the most successful real estate developers and businessmen in Des Moines. A Republican, he served in Ray's inner circle of advisers throughout the governor's career and was a top fundraiser for Republicans and Ray.\n\n“Even in seventh grade, I remember being amazed by his political skills,” Pomerantz, who died in 2007, told Bowermaster.\n\nRay’s father and maternal grandfather were staunch Republicans. The two often groused about President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal.\n\nA young Ray listened to the discussions and asked questions of his elders, but Ray was seldom impressed by their answers. He was a Republican at the time because that’s how he was raised, but he could have easily swayed Democrat or independent.\n\nThe love of his life\n\nRay made another important connection while in high school. The Rays attended University Christian Church, now known as First Christian Church, at 25th Street and University Avenue. So did the Hornberger family.\n\nRay took an interest in their daughter, Billie Lee, during a summer church camp, where the two met and began courting. She was named queen of the camp and Ray was named king.\n\nRay graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1946 at age 17. With the permission of his parents, he joined the U.S. Army and spent two years in Japan as part of the first wave of relief troops after World War II.\n\nRay enjoyed his service to his country, but was awestruck and saddened by the destruction that World War II had brought to Japan. He struggled with seasickness on the long boat trip to Japan, and, while there, homesickness for Iowa. But his experiences there began a lifelong fascination with Japan and Southeast Asia that would later influence the creation of the Iowa Sister States program and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nHe returned to Des Moines and enrolled at Drake with the help of the GI Bill. He started a restaurant with his future brother-in-law in downtown Des Moines. Neither really knew what they were doing and sold it before it drove them into debt.\n\nRay worked as a meat cutter at a Cottage Grove butcher shop to help pay for school. He studied business administration and teaching but did not student teach. He considered becoming a coach. He also worked as a reading clerk in the Iowa Senate, which gave him his first exposure to state politics and how bills are made into laws.\n\nAgain, Ray proved popular among classmates. He pledged the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and was elected student body president at the same time that famed running back Johnny Bright was blazing up and down the turf at Drake Stadium.\n\nRay worked as a newspaper carrier for The Des Moines Register and rose to district circulation manager while attending Drake Law School. He was offered a job in the Register’s circulation department but turned it down to begin practicing law.\n\nRay continued to date Billie Lee Hornberger, and the couple married in 1951 while he was still a law student.\n\nAfter he finished law school, the Rays joined another couple and spent four and a half months touring Europe.\n\nWhile on the trip, Ray developed what became his lifelong interest in photography, which 28 years later would provide Ray and Iowans powerful insights into the suffering of Southeast Asian refugees.\n\nCHAPTER TWO: PRACTICING LAW, EARLY LOSSES\n\nThe Rays returned from Europe nearly broke. Billie Ray went back to teaching school.\n\nBob Ray shopped around for a job practicing law at firms in Des Moines and elsewhere.\n\nHe eventually landed in the offices of Verne and James Lawyer, two high-profile trial lawyers in downtown Des Moines.\n\nVerne Lawyer, who hired Ray, was a colorful character in Des Moines, with wide-ranging connections. He owned a private plane and jetted around the country. Lawyer once arranged for his friend, famed trial lawyer F. Lee Bailey, to marry an airline stewardess at a club on Fleur Drive. Bob and Billie Ray were witnesses.\n\nLawyer immediately saw Ray had political potential and would prove a powerful early ally.\n\nRay defended criminal cases. He once won a sodomy case, which led to him defending more sodomy suspects.\n\n“Once you get a reputation for winning a case like that, they keep coming back to you, even if you don’t want them to,” Ray told Bowermaster.\n\nThough Ray was a talented and fast-learning lawyer, the lure of politics soon enveloped him. He ran for Polk County attorney in 1956 at age 27. Polk County, then as now, leaned heavily Democratic, and Republicans were little more than sacrificial lambs in the county attorney’s race.\n\nHe lost by 10,000 votes. Still, he showed early flair. Billie Ray sewed costumes for several women she and Bob Ray had known at Drake or around town, and they wore the outfits in public appearances for Ray, including the Iowa State Fair parade that fall. They became known as the Ray Girls and would be a feature of Ray campaigns for the rest of his career.\n\nRay also eschewed the traditional red, white and blue color scheme favored by political candidates in favor of cardinal and gold, reminiscent of Iowa State University’s colors.\n\n“It wasn’t that he particularly favored Iowa State, but he wanted something to be different and stand out,” said David Oman, a former Ray chief of staff. “They became his signature colors.”\n\nRay made his second run at public office in 1958, this time, aimed at the Iowa House. This bid, too, ended in defeat.\n\nAgain, Ray learned. He ran his first television ads, which most candidates at the time were not doing. In one spot, a union electrician explained why he favored Ray.\n\nThe Iowa Republican Party was disorganized in the 1958 campaign. To revitalize the party, Ray worked with Leo Oxberger, one of Ray’s law school classmates, whom Ray would appoint as a judge in the Iowa Court of Appeals in 1976.\n\nThey joined social clubs and community charitable organizations: the March of Dimes, Rotary, Eagles, Moose Lodges. The idea was to spread the word about Republicans wherever possible.\n\nRay said he was doing it to help build his law practice, but he also built a network of contacts that would become the backbone of his statewide campaigns for years to come. Through those clubs and early contacts, he cultivated dedicated local campaign leaders who supported him in each of Iowa’s 99 counties.\n\nDefeated in his bids for elective office, Ray ascended the rungs of internal party leadership. He became head of the Polk County Republican Party in 1962. The following year, at age 35, Ray became the youngest man in 100 years to be elected state chairman of the Iowa Republicans.\n\nThe party struggled with its identity. Conservatives and moderates battled for control of the party both in Iowa and nationally.\n\nThe national GOP convention selected conservative Barry Goldwater to challenge President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 election. Johnson, riding on the nation’s sympathies after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy a year earlier and pursuing an aggressive domestic agenda, cruised to a landslide victory. Democrats widened their majorities in the U.S. Senate and House.\n\nIn Iowa, popular incumbent Gov. Harold Hughes, a Democrat, easily won re-election to his second two-year term, and Democrats took five of Iowa’s six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Democrats carried heavy majorities in both houses of the Iowa Legislature.\n\nRay had planned to go back to his law practice with the Lawyer brothers after the 1964 elections. But the trouncing was so bad, Ray believed he needed to stay on as party chairman.\n\nCHAPTER THREE: GRITTY CAMPAIGNER\n\nIn 1965, Ray took on more executive responsibilities as state GOP chair. He hired more full-time staff. He held schools for candidates to educate them on the issues and drill them so they could defend their positions when questioned by the press, public or opponents.\n\nUnder Ray’s guidance, Republicans hosted $1 fundraisers called Buck Nights statewide. The cheap events brought in farmers, business people and everyday Iowans who rallied around a cheery new slogan: “It’s fun to be a Republican!”\n\nRay ordered tighter controls on how candidates could spend Republican Central Committee money and increased television advertising.\n\nThe results in 1966 were better-coordinated campaigns and huge gains for Republicans in the Legislature. The GOP won three of the state's then-six congressional seats from Democrats and seated 88 new Republicans in the Iowa Legislature.\n\nHughes again won re-election as governor that year. He also befriended Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, the younger brother of President Kennedy and a former U.S. attorney general. The younger Kennedy convinced Hughes to run for U.S. Senate, clearing the way for a wide-open governor’s race in 1968.\n\nRay decided to run for office again, this time for governor.\n\nConservative opponents\n\nRay faced a three-man race for the Republican nomination, squaring off against Donald Johnson of West Branch, a former national commander of the American Legion, and newspaper publisher Robert Beck of Centerville. Johnson and Beck were more conservative than Ray.\n\nAmong other moderate stances, Ray opposed the death penalty. “No man has a right to play God,” Ray said in a campaign appearance.\n\nRay also favored limited abortion rights for women in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the mother’s health. He also opposed a proposal circulating in the Legislature that would have denied state welfare benefits to women with more than one child out of wedlock.\n\n“Heaven help us when we don’t have enough compassion to help those who need us,” Ray said in October 1968.\n\nRay’s views would be considered liberal by GOP standards now, the late Arthur Neu, a former Republican lawmaker and lieutenant governor under Ray, said in a 2012 interview.\n\n“He would be cut to pieces in a primary today,” Neu said.\n\nRay was supported by the Republican inner circle, but he was considered a city man and wasn’t well-known outside Polk County. Residents of smaller cities and rural communities viewed Des Moines, considered the big city, with skepticism.\n\nIn one campaign appearance, a Republican candidate for the U.S. House introduced Ray as “Bob Day.”\n\nBoosted by plane crash\n\nIt took a nearly fatal plane crash to make Ray a statewide name.\n\nOn April 22, 1968, Ray was flying in a small plane with a pilot and campaign staffer when the plane went down near Clear Lake.\n\nAll aboard survived but were badly injured. Ray suffered a broken ankle and leg, which left him laid up in a Mason City hospital. But the campaign marched on.\n\nBefore he ran for governor, Billie Ray made her husband promise she would not have to make speeches on the campaign trail. She would be there with him, but she didn’t want to be out front.\n\nWith her husband injured, the campaign collected Billie Ray from Des Moines. She appeared before crowds and gave an update on her husband’s health. She never talked policy, but Iowans took a liking to the loyal wife and schoolteacher.\n\n“Mrs. Ray was always fantastic with Iowans,” said Oman, the Ray adviser. “She was natural and real. People responded to her like she was one of them, just like they did with Governor Ray.”\n\nWhen Ray returned to the campaign trail on crutches, his grit resonated with Iowans. He won the primary, then took on Democrat Paul Franzenburg, the state treasurer, in the general election.\n\nThe tumultuous 1968 presidential campaign is remembered for the assassination of Robert Kennedy, violence at the Democratic convention in Chicago and the increasing unpopularity of the Vietnam War. It culminated with the landslide election of Republican Richard M. Nixon to the White House.\n\nAnd in Iowa, 40-year-old Robert Ray became governor.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR: FRESHMAN GOVERNOR\n\nThe love affair between Iowans and Ray as their governor did not begin immediately. His first year was marked by a steep learning curve.\n\nHughes, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate in 1968, left office early to begin his transition to Washington, D.C. Lt. Gov. Robert Fulton, a Democrat, assumed the governor’s chair for 16 days to finish out Hughes’ term, but there was little focus on the transition to the new governor.\n\nRay came into an empty office without even a pad of paper, he said later, and was immediately confronted with the troubles of the day.\n\nUnder Hughes in the previous session, lawmakers raised taxes statewide. Farmers, in particular, were struggling with a new formula that taxed more of their land at a higher rate. Agriculture industries suffered, too. Hog prices plummeted.\n\nRepublicans controlled both houses of the Legislature, which in theory could have translated into smooth working relationships between the governor and lawmakers.\n\nIn reality, Republicans in the Legislature were more conservative than Ray, and they often found themselves at odds.\n\nLeaders in the Iowa House privately groused that the new governor didn’t understand the legislative process.\n\nRay stood his ground. He vetoed a bill that would have expanded the government’s powers to wiretap citizens. He supported the distribution of birth control pills in mental health institutions. And he fought off an effort to reinstate the state’s death penalty.\n\n“They thought they were going to be able to tell me what to do,” Ray told Bowermaster, his biographer. “They were wrong.”\n\nCalm amid strife\n\nHis first term also was marked by social strife. Students loudly and sometimes violently protested the Vietnam War, racial inequities and other issues on the state’s three university campuses.\n\nBombs exploded at Drake, a private college, and Iowa State University and the University of Iowa in 1970. There were no fatalities, but tensions ran high.\n\nStudents held sit-ins and confronted campus administrators. In one incident at the University of Iowa, several students used profanity in a protest with a university official present. Some lawmakers thought the campuses were out of control and wanted Ray to enforce strict discipline.\n\nRay refused.\n\n“We’re living in a time when young people are restless and do things older people don’t like,” Ray told the Register in 1970. “But I’m not willing to condemn all for a few who do things out of the ordinary to seek attention.”\n\nIn other states, governors used the National Guard to quell student unrest. This proved deadly on the campus of Kent State in Ohio, where in May 1970 troops opened fire on a group of unarmed students, killing four and wounding nine others.\n\nOne night in 1970, a group of University of Iowa students decided to block Interstate Highway 80 by lying across the road. Ray had the National Guard, the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation and the Iowa State Patrol at his disposal.\n\nRay quietly sent in state troopers to escort the students off the interstate. The situation was defused without serious incident.\n\n“That was a moment where Ray’s touch was just perfect,” said David Yepsen, a longtime Register political reporter who was then a UI student. “At the time, the Iowa State Patrol was second only to God in the respect of Iowans. Sending them in, instead of the Guard, really calmed things down. It was a classic Bob Ray moment.”\n\nIn the summer of 1970, a Chicago concert promotion company rented ground near Wadena in northeast Iowa. The plan was to host a Woodstock-style concert for as many as 30,000 people. Seven out of 10 people surveyed by the Register’s Iowa Poll thought the event should be stopped. A similar concert near Chicago ended in a riot.\n\nRay decided to visit the rock festival himself. He spoke to the crowd of about 25,000.\n\n“Look, I don’t want what happened in Chicago last night to happen here,” Ray told the crowd on a 100-degree late July day. “You’re here to have a good time, so please, have a good time, but we want you all to leave here knowing you had a good time. Try to stay off the stuff, OK?”\n\nAbout a dozen people were arrested. There was no violence or riot.\n\n“There was something very simple and honest about what Ray did there that resonated with even young people,” Yepsen said. “He wasn’t pretending to be one of them. He just wanted people to be peaceful. It worked.”\n\nCHAPTER FIVE: TOUGH IN TOUGH TIMES\n\nRay survived a tough re-election challenge in the fall of 1970 from Robert Fulton, the former lieutenant governor, who had helped engineer Hughes’ successful U.S. Senate campaign.\n\nFarmers still leaned against Ray because of their property tax burdens. Ray won by 34,000 votes, the narrowest victory in his career.\n\n“Bob Ray had not become Bob Ray yet,” Yepsen said. “He wasn’t always viewed as saintly as he is today.”\n\nIn 1971, the national economy struggled through a recession. The state budget surplus was exhausted, and Iowans of all stripes begged for tax relief.\n\nRay’s approval rating dipped to an all-time low: 41 percent.\n\nRay dug in on tax policy. He pushed for a plan that shifted the state’s revenue stream from property taxes to income taxes. He worked with lawmakers to create an education funding plan that equalized per-pupil funding, putting schools in poorer regions of the state on more equal financial footing with those in better-off areas.\n\nThe school plan shifted much of the burden of paying for schools to the state. This eased local property taxes, which lessened the burden on farmers and improved funding for schools, which pleased many voters statewide.\n\n“School funding was one of the most important pieces of legislation we worked on,” said Neu, the former lawmaker. “It set Iowa schools on the path to being the best in the nation. It’s a plan a lot of other states copied.”\n\n‘For the little guy’\n\nRay seemingly sought to have a personal relationship with every Iowan with whom he had contact. He sent handwritten notes to every person who assisted him during his trips around the state, even if they only greeted him or hung up his coat. He also tried to read every letter that came to his office, and took pleasure in surprising constituents late in the evening by phoning them to respond to their questions or complaints.\n\n\"People often thought they received a crank call, hang up and Governor Ray would have to call back,\" Oman said.\n\nBut the moment that many believe cemented Ray in the hearts and minds of Iowans came in spring 1972.\n\nOn March 5, 1968, a Wisconsin Air Guard plane had crashed into the home of Emma McCarville of Cresco. Her home was destroyed. On Dec. 9 of that same year, an Iowa Air National Guard plane wrecked the farm home of Peter and Marie Tjernagel, near Story City.\n\nPeter Tjernagel died 52 days after the crash, which Marie Tjernagel believed was related to the financial stress brought onto the family.\n\nThen for years, the Iowa attorney general and the U.S. Air Force wrangled over who should pay the families for their losses. The Air Force wanted Iowa to pay; Iowa officials believed it was the federal government’s responsibility.\n\nDes Moines Register reporter Nick Lamberto wrote about the families’ struggles, which came as news to Ray. When President Nixon visited Rathbun Lake for its dedication in early 1972, Ray asked him about the problem. Nixon referred it to a subordinate.\n\nRay wrote a letter to the Nixon aide and also had it published in the Register. A school class in Story City gathered a 15,000-signature petition urging the federal government to settle.\n\nIn April 1972, Ray, as commander in chief of the Iowa Air National Guard, took dramatic action. He grounded all Air Guard planes until the two families were made whole.\n\nThe federal government was furious, but eventually paid the families.\n\n“That was the moment people began to see Bob Ray as somebody who stood up for the little guy,” Yepsen said. “He took on the whole federal government for two Iowans. That was when they knew how tough he was.”\n\nChallenge from right\n\nWhen Ray decided to seek a third term in 1972, he faced a Republican challenger: Lt. Gov. Roger Jepsen.\n\nBefore a 1988 amendment to the Iowa Constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected separately rather than as a single ticket.\n\nJepsen, who represented the Iowa GOP’s conservative wing, believed it was his time to run the state’s highest office. Many in the Republican legislative caucus supported Jepsen, who had been a legislative colleague in the Iowa Senate before winning the lieutenant governor’s office in 1968.\n\nRay girded for the challenge by building what supporters called the most impressive campaign effort of his career.\n\nHe again used the political machinery he built in the early 1960s, tapping GOP county chairmen and all those friends he had made rebuilding the party, to build a substantial lead in money and support. Ultimately, Jepsen dropped out of the race before the primary.\n\nMeanwhile, Ray continued to be an innovative campaigner. He introduced telephone solicitations and computerized mass mailings. That fall, Ray ran against Franzenburg again, cruising to victory with 58.6 percent of the vote.\n\nCHAPTER SIX: ‘GOVERNORRAY’\n\nThe old saw about Ray goes that by the time he left office in 1983, he had served as governor so long that a generation of schoolchildren thought Governor Ray was one word. Children would ask their teachers who the “Governorray” was of neighboring states.\n\nThough possibly apocryphal, the story is emblematic of Ray’s widespread popularity in Iowa. By the middle 1970s, he polled at a career-high 82 percent approval. Even farmers, who previously believed the governor didn’t understand the relationship of agriculture to the state’s finances, polled 61 percent in favor of Ray.\n\nRay led trade missions to Asia, including promoting Iowa beef in Japan, and he was among the first U.S. governors to visit China after Nixon's historic visit in 1972. Those missions helped farmers, but it also brought the likable Ray and his staff close to the Iowans over the long trips, Oman said.\n\n\"You can't overestimate his likability,\" Oman said. \"You have to like a person to vote for him and he got to know so many Iowans on a first-name basis through these trips.\"\n\nJepsen, the combative lieutenant governor, left politics for a time and returned to the insurance business. Neu, the newly elected lieutenant governor, had a more collegial relationship with Ray and the Legislature.\n\nThe state and national economy improved in Ray’s third term, and Ray and the Legislature began restructuring state government. Together, they created the Iowa Department of Transportation, which merged half-a-dozen separate departments under one umbrella.\n\nThe new agency issued driver’s licenses with photographs. The renewal date for vehicle registrations was matched with the vehicle owner’s birthday rather than having all licenses expire at the end of the year, which had created jams at renewal stations.\n\nRay signed a Democratic-backed bill to remove sales tax from groceries and prescription drugs, which cost the state about $29 million in revenue. He also signed into law a bill that gave public employees collective bargaining rights.\n\nThe governor’s agenda drew criticism from Republicans Terry Branstad and Chuck Grassley, who were both state lawmakers at the time, before Branstad’s promotion to governor and Grassley’s to Congress.\n\nBut Ray was so popular, it was difficult for legislators in either party to oppose him.\n\n“One of the reasons legislators felt more inclined to oppose him in 1969 and 1970, even in 1971 and ’72, was because his popularity was in the 50 to 60 percent range,” Grassley told Bowermaster. “By 1974, it was between 70 to 85. So it wasn’t bad for a legislator to be lined up with him.”\n\nNixon had resigned in disgrace after the Watergate scandal destroyed his administration, and Vice President Gerald Ford succeeded him. Ray became chairman of the National Governors Association in 1975.\n\nFord twice offered Ray the cabinet position of secretary of the interior, but Ray chose to stay home.\n\nMeanwhile, a change in the Iowa Constitution had extended the governor’s term from two years to four. In 1974, Ray easily won re-election against James Schaben to secure the four-year term.\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN: WELCOMING REFUGEES\n\nIn the early 1970s, Ray was greeted outside his office in the Capitol by a woman wearing the traditional garb of the Yankton Sioux tribe.\n\nThe woman’s name was Maria Pearson, also known as Running Moccasins. She had come to Ray to protest the treatment of Native American graves uncovered during a road construction project in Glenwood. Twenty-six graves had been unearthed during the project. Most were reburied, but the remains of a mother and child were sent to a state lab for study.\n\nRay asked what he could do to help.\n\n“You can give me back my people’s bones and you can quit digging them up,” Pearson recalled in her 2000 book, “Give Me Back My People’s Bones: Repatriation and Reburial of American Indian Skeletal Remains in Iowa.”\n\nRay saw to the return of the remains, and he worked with the Legislature to ensure more care was taken with Native American burial grounds.\n\nThe result was the Iowa Burials Protection Act of 1976, long before the 1990 federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.\n\nAs another term unfolded, Ray’s humanitarianism stretched well beyond the borders of Iowa.\n\nThe U.S. failures in Vietnam left deep scars on the American psyche. The nation that had helped defeat Hitler and the Axis in World War II and kept advancing communist forces at bay in Korea had failed in its mission in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn 1975, not long after Ray’s fourth inauguration, 130,000 South Vietnamese refugees fled the country after Saigon fell. Laos, on the border of Vietnam, fell to communist troops later that year.\n\nIn July, Ford appealed to the nation’s governors to help resettle Southeast Asians. He offered $500 to help with the costs for each refugee. Only one governor responded: Ray.\n\n“I didn’t think we could just sit here idly and say, ‘Let those people die,’” Ray told Iowa Public Television for a documentary on refugee resettlement in Iowa.\n\nRay formed the Governor’s Task Force for Indochinese Development. The governor’s office received a specific appeal from the Tai Dam, an ethnic group from Vietnam.\n\nThe Tai Dam were a closely knit group of about 3,500 people. They hoped to keep their community and culture intact, and wanted to resettle in one place together.\n\nThe U.S. State Department resisted settling a large group in one location. Ray pressured federal officials, including Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, to change their minds. They relented. The Tai Dam refugees started arriving in Iowa in October.\n\nOpening state’s door again\n\nAccompanying the refugees was a State Department official named Ken Quinn, a native of the Bronx, N.Y., who had grown up in Dubuque.\n\nWhile Quinn was assigned to the Vietnam-Cambodia border, he had been the first State Department official to report on the massacres of the Khmer Rouge regime of Cambodian dictator Pol Pot.\n\nQuinn, better than most, knew the terrible conditions faced by refugees. He came to Iowa to give a speech thanking the state for accepting the Tai Dam people.\n\n“After I spoke, I sat down next to Governor Ray, and he tapped me on the leg and said, ‘You would be a good person to have around,’” Quinn said.\n\nJust more than a year later, Quinn returned to Iowa on special assignment to assist Ray’s administration with resettlement efforts.\n\nIn 1979, Ray watched a “60 Minutes” report about the plight of other Southeast Asian refugees from Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. They were called “boat people” because they fled persecution on boats made of oil drums. Many drowned. Others starved to death or died of disease in refugee camps.\n\nRay ordered Quinn to use his contacts to see if the governor could again open Iowa’s borders, this time to 1,500 refugees. Quinn worked the system.\n\nThe move was controversial. A September 1979 Register Iowa Poll showed 51 percent opposed resettling more refugees. Ray’s office was flooded with mail.\n\n“It was split right down the middle,” Quinn said. “About half supported it, and half opposed.”\n\nThe letters that irked Ray most came from those who said refugees would take jobs away from needy Iowans. Ray replied to some of those letters with phone calls in the late evening.\n\n“Ray had an aide count up all the help-wanted ads in an edition of the Sunday Register,” Quinn said. “He would call these people at 9:30 or 10 o’clock at night and say, ‘Just go get one of those jobs before they arrive, and everything will be fine.’”\n\nPhotos of suffering\n\nIn October 1979, Ray and the governors of Michigan and New Jersey took a trip to visit refugee camps in Thailand. Quinn accompanied the group.\n\nThe delegation witnessed suffering, starvation and death, and Ray took photos along the way. The conditions left him and the others badly shaken.\n\nAt one point, Tai Dam refugees took Ray into a hut. On the wall was a map of Iowa filled with pins where Tai Dam people had resettled in the state. Ray, Quinn recalled, choked back tears.\n\nRay and Quinn returned to Iowa and were met at the Des Moines airport by Yepsen, the Register political reporter.\n\nYepsen wanted the scoop on what the conditions were like in the refugee camps.\n\n“I saw people die,” Ray told Yepsen, which became the headline of the next morning’s Register. Accompanying the article were Ray’s photos, which Yepsen had convinced the governor to let the Register develop and publish.\n\n“There was no politics in his feelings about that issue,” Yepsen said. “He truly believed it was the right thing to do to help them, and he went about convincing the people of Iowa it was right, too.”\n\nHe met opposition. Some in the governing body of the Disciples of Christ Church, of which Ray was a member, believed they should not get involved with the politically sensitive issue.\n\nRay traveled to St. Louis to speak to the church’s national convention. He delivered what Register religion reporter Bill Simbro described as more of a sermon than a political speech. Ray noted that Missouri’s motto is the “Show Me State.” Ray believed there was a moral imperative in the slogan.\n\n“Don’t tell me of your concerns for human rights, show me,” Ray said. “Don’t tell me of your concerns for these people when you have a chance to save their lives, show me. Don’t tell me how Christian you are. Show me.”\n\nThe speech turned the tide at the convention, and the church supported aid to the refugees.\n\nBack in Iowa, Ray teamed with the Register’s editorial pages for a statewide fundraising campaign that became known as Iowa SHARES. Donations poured in — more than $2.1 million in today’s money — to aid the refugees. The charity sent doctors, nurses, food and supplies to help.\n\n“Governor Ray was a deeply moral man,” Quinn said. “He believed it was our moral duty to help those people. He could not just let them die.”\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT: TERRACE HILL, BOTTLE BILL\n\nDemocrats couldn’t move Ray out of the governor’s chair, but he did make a move in 1976 — to Terrace Hill.\n\nTerrace Hill is a mansion built by millionaire businessman Benjamin Franklin Allen between 1866 and 1869 on land that overlooks downtown Des Moines. After Allen went broke, he sold the mansion to real estate magnate Frederick Hubbell, whose descendants gave the mansion to the state in 1971.\n\nBillie Ray led a massive project starting in 1974 to remodel the mansion into a governor’s residence and a reception hall for visiting dignitaries.\n\nIn 1976, Bob and Billie Ray and their three daughters moved in, leaving a colonial house at 2900 Grand Ave., which had been the Iowa governor’s official residence since 1947.\n\nHis favorite legislation\n\nThe move to the gilded hallways of Terrace Hill was symbolic of Ray’s stature in Iowa. In the middle of his fourth term, he was a confident governor who commanded the executive branch with a calm demeanor admired even by his opponents.\n\nTimes were good in Iowa during the middle ’70s. Farm prices were strong, and unemployment was below 3 percent, half the national average.\n\nIn 1976, Ray’s approval rating stood at 82 percent, according to the Register’s Iowa Poll. Through the remainder of his governorship, it never dipped below 71 percent.\n\nRay was considered a vice presidential candidate in 1976, but Ford picked Bob Dole, a U.S. senator from Kansas who had more international experience. Ford lost the White House to Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe stable times allowed Ray to pursue a pet project, one that he would later say was his favorite piece of legislation during his 14 years as governor.\n\nRay was distressed by the amount of litter along Iowa roads. He pushed for a nickel deposit on beverage cans and bottles sold in Iowa. His aides studied similar bills in Oregon and Vermont. They concluded the bill would not only reduce litter but also increase recycling and ease the burden on landfills.\n\nThe bottle bill, as it came to be known (although it covers cans as well), met opposition from unions, who believed the bill would cost jobs; aluminum manufacturers, who worried about rising costs; and grocers, who would be burdened by collecting and refunding the deposit.\n\nRay, however, refused to bow.\n\nSpecial interests put out “unbelievable” propaganda, Ray told Bowermaster, his biographer.\n\nStill, Ray had the upper hand. Environmental groups such as the Sierra Club joined with the Boy Scouts of America and the powerful Farm Bureau to support the bill. A Register Iowa Poll showed 71 percent of the public favored it.\n\nIt passed both houses, and more than 200 people attended the signing at the Capitol rotunda.\n\n“It was a perfect, if not the perfect, Bob Ray legislation,” Bowermaster wrote. “It wasn’t very sexy, though energy conservation was a hot topic during the 1970s, but it had good, strong public support.”\n\nCHAPTER NINE: THE FINAL TERM\n\nIn 1978, Ray cruised to another easy victory, this time against a three-term legislator, Jerry Fitzgerald, 37, to earn a then-record fifth and ultimately final term.\n\nHis final four years in office would prove memorable. Ray received Pope John Paul II during his historic 1979 visit to Iowa at Living History Farms in front of nearly 300,000 people. Ray took a photograph from the helicopter he rode to the event, which was published in the Register the following morning.\n\nHe greeted Iowa native Kathryn Koob, one of the hostages held by Iran, who was released in early 1981.\n\nMany believed Ray would use the term to position himself as a candidate for national office, either as a vice presidential nominee or a potential presidential candidate.\n\nAs the 1980 Iowa caucuses approached, political campaigns courted him heavily for an endorsement in the first-in-the-nation contest.\n\n“Every day there was either a candidate or somebody from a campaign wanting time with the governor to discuss an endorsement,” said Oman, Ray’s chief of staff. “He listened to them all, and he considered some of them.”\n\nRay no longer had the perceived weakness in foreign affairs that led Ford to pass him over for Dole for the vice presidential nod in 1976.\n\nRay’s work with refugees had made him a national spokesman on the issue, and he had traveled extensively abroad to promote Iowa exports, including stops in China and the Soviet Union in the summer of 1979.\n\nWhile Ray never openly ruled out a White House run, he also never said he wanted national office. And when the 1980 caucuses arrived, he remained neutral, refusing to endorse anyone before the voting.\n\nAfter the caucuses, Ray endorsed U.S. Senate leader Howard Baker, a moderate Republican from Tennessee with a reputation for compromise so renowned that he was known as the “Great Conciliator.”\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush won the Republican Iowa caucuses and ultimately became the vice presidential running mate of future President Ronald Reagan.\n\n“Some people believe Ray could have been Bush’s vice presidential nominee, but I think Bob Ray just liked being governor of Iowa,” said Yepsen, the political reporter. “He was comfortable in that job. He was good at it.”\n\nBudget troubles\n\nRay convinced the Legislature to refund a $50 million surplus to taxpayers, giving back as much as $250 per person. The refund came at a precarious time for state finances. Revenues were leveling off and dropping.\n\nAdvisers suggested using the surplus for a one-time expenditure, such as a prison, but Ray was adamant. His fellow Republicans had rebuffed an idea to repeal the state sales tax on utilities, a move that was popular in other states.\n\nRepealing the utility tax would have been similar to his support for repealing sales taxes on groceries and prescription drugs. Ray believed it was pure tax relief, but he found no support. So instead of letting the Legislature find a way to spend the surplus, Ray pushed for the refund.\n\nThat move would prove costly in 1980 when state revenues plummeted. The state’s cattle industry struggled. Interest rates and inflation climbed to as much as 20 percent. A recession loomed, and Ray found himself needing to cut spending in a hurry.\n\nIn 1980, Ray cut the budget three times for a total of $172 million, almost 10 percent of the state’s total budget. The recession continued through 1981. Ray resisted lawmakers’ pleas for income and sales tax increases, instead lurching forward with minimal budgets.\n\nIt “was a tough year,” Ray said. “Nobody could have predicted the recession would be as deep or as long-lasting as it was.”\n\nPrivate sector beckons\n\nOn Feb. 18, 1982, Ray announced he would not seek a sixth term as governor. He would turn 54 later that year.\n\nAs governor, Ray earned $55,000 a year. Privately, he worried that his prime earning years might be behind him. Turning down federal posts had cost him a higher salary. He doubted he could return to trial law, having been away from the courtroom for nearly 20 years.\n\nLt. Gov. Terry Branstad won the 1982 governor’s race. Branstad, a former Iowa House member from Leland, was more conservative than Ray. At 36, he was the youngest man ever elected to the state’s highest office — four years younger than Ray when he had taken the oath the first time.\n\nThough never as popular as Ray as measured by Iowa Polls, Branstad won four consecutive four-year terms, serving 16 years, two more than Ray. After a stint out of public life, Branstad was re-elected governor again in 2010 and 2014, becoming the longest-serving governor in U.S. history.\n\nRay spent the summer of 1983 as part of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations, a position helped by a nod from then-Vice President George H.W. Bush.\n\nThree months after he left office, Ray joined the Cedar Rapids insurance firm Life Investors Inc., now known as AEGON. His salary was reported at $300,000, with bonuses and stock options. The couple kept their home in Des Moines but lived in Cedar Rapids.\n\n“It was a conscious decision on his part to leave Des Moines for a while,” said Oman, Ray’s former chief of staff. “Governor Branstad was new, and it wouldn’t be fair for him to be hanging around looming. The Rays loved their time in Cedar Rapids.”\n\nHe served nearly seven years at Life Investors, then in 1989 took the helm at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa. There, Ray oversaw the mergers of IASD Health Service Corp. and Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Dakota, setting the stage for the company to become Wellmark, Iowa’s largest insurer.\n\nRay, no longer the politician, was a successful businessman. But he was not done being a public leader.\n\nCHAPTER 10: LIFELONG LEADER\n\nIn April 1997, popular Des Moines Mayor A. Arthur Davis resigned when his five-year battle with colon cancer made him too weak to continue.\n\nCity officials set a November election to finish Davis’ term, but needed someone in the interim to officiate over everything from the relocation of Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway to tax assessment complaints.\n\nThey turned to Ray.\n\nRay, then 68, had recently retired as president and CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa and appeared headed off to the sunset. He accepted on the condition he not be asked to run for the office on a permanent basis.\n\n“When I was governor, I used to say there is no more difficult job than being mayor of a city,” Ray told the Register in 1997. “You can’t do much of anything without somebody disagreeing with you, and then you’re right there, looking one another in the eye. It’s day-in-and-day-out activity on the street level. So why would I want to do it? Because I might be able to do some good.”\n\nRay held the mayor’s chair until City Councilman Preston Daniels was elected to the job at the end of the year.\n\nAlso in 1997, as a legacy of the 1996 Iowa Sesquicentennial, which Ray chaired, he helped found the Institute for Character Development at Drake University (Character Counts In Iowa), which has blossomed into The Robert D. and Billie Ray Center at Drake. The Character Counts program has served over 500,000 Iowa school-age youth. The center also assists Iowans from preschoolers to corporate and community leaders as a state and global resource in the areas of leadership, ethics and civility.\n\nHelping his alma mater\n\nThen another voice from Ray’s past came calling: his alma mater, Drake University.\n\nIn 1998, Drake President Michael Ferrari, who had presided over the school’s financial and academic resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s, had resigned to take the top post at Texas Christian University.\n\nDrake was in the middle of a $100 million fundraising campaign. It would take at least a year to find a new president.\n\nSchool leaders turned to Ray, one of the school’s most prestigious alumni and a longtime member of Drake’s board of trustees.\n\nRay accepted, but with one condition: He did not want to be an interim president. He wanted the full title and responsibility.\n\n“Governor Ray did not believe he could be as effective as he wanted to be if labeled an interim president,” said Don Adams, a longtime Drake vice president who served as Ray’s chief of staff during his yearlong presidency at Drake.\n\nRay became an active leader on campus and beyond. Some faculty members were skeptical about the selection of a trustee to run the school. Ray solved the problem by inviting the president of the faculty senate to join his Cabinet.\n\n“Bob Ray wanted total transparency,” Adams said. “He didn’t want anyone to think he was there on somebody else’s agenda.”\n\nRay held the post until the hiring of David Maxwell, an experienced administrator who was head of the National Foreign Language Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\nMaxwell met privately with Ray as they prepared for the leadership change. Ray planned to return to the board of trustees, but he wanted to make sure Maxwell was comfortable with that.\n\nRay “didn’t want me to feel like he was going to be second-guessing me from the board,” Maxwell recalled. “I said to him, ‘The very fact that you would ask that question tells me we’re going to have a good relationship.’ He was always very generous in that way.”\n\nRay continued his service to Iowa through work on dozens of boards and commissions. A speaker and course program for lifelong learners age 50 and above at Drake, called the Ray Society, is named in his and Billie Ray’s honor.\n\nEPILOGUE: LEGACY\n\nBob Ray was Iowa’s most popular politician of the 20th century. The late Washington Post political columnist David Broder once wrote that “among governors of both parties, few men enjoyed greater respect than Ray.”\n\nHe was not without critics. Some called him timid, lukewarm and uninspiring. “A man whose personality had all the zing of his favorite treat — a scoop of plain vanilla ice cream,” noted a 1997 Register profile of Ray.\n\nYet retired Register columnist John Carlson perhaps best assessed Ray’s hold on Iowa:\n\n“Ray’s greatest talent seemed to be correctly assessing the mood of Iowans and having an uncanny sense of what they would and wouldn’t tolerate,” Carlson wrote. “He always, always remembered that Iowans are moderate by nature and never, ever are they extreme.”\n\nOne of the last formal honors Ray received was the Hoover Presidential Library Uncommon Iowan Award, in October 2015.\n\nRay was too ill to attend the ceremony, and Quinn, who worked on refugee issues with Ray while on loan from the State Department, accepted the award on Ray's behalf.\n\nQuinn recounted that Ray was the first governing leader anywhere in the world to offer to accept the Vietnamese boat people, who were drowning at sea. Ray’s Iowa SHARES campaign rushed doctors and nurses, food and medicine to starving Cambodian survivors of the genocidal Khmer Rouge. And he welcomed the Tai Dam people of Laos to be resettled in Iowa together, allowing them to keep their cultural heritage intact.\n\n“Governor Bob Ray displayed the global moral leadership that thrust Iowa to center stage of international humanitarian diplomacy,” Quinn said, “and placed himself in the pantheon of Iowa's greatest historic figures.”\n\nBut Quinn also described a scene that offers perhaps a greater tribute than any award. Thirty-five years after the end of the Vietnam War, Ray was walking through a grocery store in Des Moines with his wife, Billie, when they encountered an Asian man pushing a shopping cart. The man recognized the governor, walked over from his cart and extended his hand. He told Ray, “You saved my life. I just want to say, ‘Thank you.’”\n\nBOB RAY TIMELINE\n\n1928: Robert Dolph Ray is born on Sept. 26 to accountant Clark Ray and his wife, Mildred.\n\n1940: Ray wins his first election, as president of his Callanan Junior High School seventh-grade class.\n\n1944: Ray meets Billie Lee Hornberger while attending a youth camp sponsored by University Christian Church.\n\n1946: Ray graduates from Roosevelt High School in Des Moines at age 17.

Barack Obama.\n\n“Few of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did,\" Obama said Saturday in a written statement. \"But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own.\"\n\nThe unsuccessful White House bids were spotlight moments in a long political career that began with his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982. After two terms, McCain ascended to the U.S. Senate in 1987, replacing legendary Republican U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater, who in 1964 was the only other Arizonan to top the national ticket of a major U.S. political party. McCain was re-elected to the Senate in 1992, 1998, 2004, 2010 and 2016. He became Arizona’s senior senator in 1995 and chairman of the influential Armed Services Committee in 2015.\n\nOften called a maverick, McCain was a complicated personality and will be remembered as the most important political figure to emerge from Arizona in the past 50 years.\n\nSENATOR'S BIOGRAPHY: John McCain's American Story\n\nHe was ensnared by the “Keating Five” scandal of the late 1980s and was deemed by the Senate Ethics Committee to have demonstrated poor judgment by joining four Senate colleagues in meeting with federal thrift regulators on behalf of political benefactor Charles H. Keating Jr., a savings-and-loan tycoon and developer.\n\nIt was in the wake of that scandal, in the 1990s and early- to mid-2000s, that McCain's \"maverick\" reputation began to take shape, as he led fights for campaign finance reform and comprehensive immigration reform and against Big Tobacco. During his 2000 presidential run, McCain famously decried leaders of the Religious Right as “agents of intolerance,” a gutsy fight to pick for a Republican.\n\nThe 'maverick'\n\nIn 2015, his own presidential ambitions in the past, McCain clashed with Republican Donald Trump in a public feud that extended into Trump’s time in the White House.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, McCain sided with two other GOP senators and all Democrats and cast a crucial vote — a literal thumbs-down on the Senate floor — that stalled Republican efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act, a top Trump priority.\n\nUnlike many of Trump’s GOP punching bags, McCain had the stature to go nose-to-nose with the president.\n\nAt one point in the early 2000s, Democrats encouraged McCain to consider switching parties, and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry approached him about serving as his running mate. But later, McCain veered to the right, a source of frequent frustration to his previous admirers on the other side of the aisle.\n\nAlthough some on the right sneered at what they viewed as McCain’s coziness with the national media — for years after his presidential run, he was a mainstay on the Sunday television public-affairs shows — McCain often kept local media at arm’s length and once wrote in a book that his long relationship with The Arizona Republic, the state’s largest newspaper, could fairly be described as “antagonistic.” However, the relationship with The Republic and other local media improved in later years.\n\nMcCain also had a love-hate relationship with his media-promoted reputation as a maverick, relying on it or distancing himself from it as the political circumstances warranted.\n\n“That was a label that was given to me a long time ago,” McCain told The Republic in 2010. “I don't decide on the labels that I am given. I said I have always acted in what I think is in the best interests of the state and the country, and that’s the way that I will always behave.”\n\nTwo presidential runs\n\nMcCain proved himself to be a thorn in the side of his GOP rival, Bush, at least early in the first term of the younger Bush’s presidency. The McCain vs. Bush fight in 2000 had taken a bitter turn in the South Carolina primary, where McCain and his allies accused their conservative opponents of trying to smear him and his family.\n\nHowever, he and Bush reconciled as McCain geared up for his second presidential run. A classic Senate hawk, McCain was a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and strongly supported Bush’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. McCain also was a champion of the surge strategy that Bush employed in Iraq in 2007.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential race, McCain had to overcome the lingering distrust of many conservatives who resented his maverick record, which included votes against key Bush tax cuts as well as McCain’s successful push for bipartisan campaign-finance-reform legislation.\n\nHis decision to gamble on the untested and little-known Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate was cheered by the conservative wing of the Republican Party but may have hurt the GOP ticket among independent voters.\n\nHowever, McCain never had much of a chance of defeating Obama, given the political atmosphere of the time.\n\nVoters were widely dissatisfied with Bush, whose approval numbers were bad, and war fatigue had set in. If that wasn’t bad enough, the U.S. economy melted down in September 2008, making it unlikely that another Republican would succeed Bush. The political-science models pointed to a Democratic victory.\n\n“You can't win with conditions this bad for the incumbent party,” Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said after the election. “And that's McCain's consolation: He did reasonably well under extremely difficult conditions. It was never meant to be.”\n\nLooking back at the race in an August 2017 interview with The Republic, McCain largely concurred, though he stressed that Obama deserves the credit for his victory.\n\n\"One, Barack Obama was a very, very strong candidate and that's the most important thing,\" McCain said. \"Second, when the stock market collapsed, it really sent us into a real drop. Third of all, I guess, Americans were ready for a change, too.\n\n“But I'd like to emphasize the first thing I said: Barack Obama was an incredibly impressive candidate and he did a great job campaigning,” he added.\n\nTaking on new foes\n\nTwo years after his White House defeat, the perception of McCain as an establishment moderate was still strong enough to attract a Senate primary challenger from the right: former six-term U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth, a professional broadcaster who was known as a fierce foe of illegal immigration.\n\nIn the year of the conservative “tea party” uprising, McCain took no chances and greatly outspent Hayworth, destroying him with an unrelenting barrage of hard-hitting TV campaign commercials. In one memorable ad aimed at Hayworth’s conservative base, McCain rebranded himself as a border hard-liner by calling for the completion of “the danged fence” between the United States and Mexico. After dispatching Hayworth in the primary, McCain effortlessly clinched a fifth Senate term in the 2010 general election.\n\nNear the end of that term, McCain found himself feuding with celebrity-billionaire-turned-presidential-candidate Trump.\n\nIn a notorious July 18, 2015, jab at McCain, Trump said McCain was “a war hero because he was captured” and that he liked “people that weren’t captured.”\n\nMORE:Here's a blow-by-blow account of the Donald Trump vs. John McCain feud\n\nTrump also derided McCain as weak on immigration and border security. McCain returned the criticism on a number of issues, including Trump’s approach to foreign policy. In October 2016, McCain finally withdrew his endorsement of Trump after a 2005 recording surfaced of Trump talking about women in crude and vulgar ways.\n\nTheir duels may have helped McCain in that they made Democrats’ election-year efforts to tether McCain to Trump, who had made a series of inflammatory comments, all but impossible. McCain effortlessly defeated U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, and dramatically outperformed Trump, who also carried Arizona on Election Day but by a much slimmer margin.\n\nA POW in North Vietnam\n\nJohn Sidney McCain III was born Aug. 29, 1936, at the Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone. His father, John S. McCain Jr., and grandfather, John S. “Slew” McCain Sr., would become the only father-son team of four-star Navy admirals in U.S. history. During World War II, Slew McCain was in charge of aircraft carriers fighting the Japanese in the Pacific and had a destroyer named in his honor in 1953. The youngest McCain followed in the footsteps of his namesakes, attending the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and becoming a naval aviator.\n\nIn July 1967, during the Vietnam War, McCain survived a fiery maritime disaster on the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal that killed 134 people and nearly sank the ship in the Gulf of Tonkin. McCain was getting ready to take off from the deck when another plane accidentally fired a Zuni missile and hit his plane or one next to it, spilling fuel. McCain was wounded by shrapnel and narrowly escaped death himself in the blaze that followed as bombs and planes began exploding.\n\n“The crew’s heroics kept her afloat,” McCain recalled in his 1999 memoir “Faith of My Fathers.” “They fought the inferno with a tenacity usually reserved for hand-to-hand combat. They fought it all day and well into the next, and they saved the Forrestal.”\n\nOn the 40th anniversary of his getting shot down over Hanoi, North Vietnam, McCain told The Republic that the Forrestal disaster may have affected him more deeply in the long run.\n\n“To be honest with you, the Forrestal fire seems to be a more impactful date I remember more than that of when I was shot down,” McCain said at the time.\n\nSurviving the Forrestal crisis — the “Inferno at Sea” as the Aug. 11, 1967, cover of Life magazine dubbed it and the worst naval disaster since World War II — was just the beginning for McCain.\n\nOn Oct. 26, 1967, McCain was piloting an A-4 Skyhawk attack bomber that had taken off from the USS Oriskany when a missile blew off one of its wings. Seriously wounded, he was captured and would spend more than five brutal years as a POW.\n\nHe refused early release, which was offered to him because he was the son of a Navy admiral and would have served North Vietnamese propaganda purposes. While in custody, McCain was routinely beaten and at one pointed confessed that he was a “black criminal” and an “air pirate,” which he would remember as a low point of his life.\n\nMcCain finally was released, along with other POWs, in 1973.\n\nMORE:How John McCain's POW release 45 years ago started his path to politics\n\nIn 1977, McCain became the Navy’s liaison to the U.S. Senate, setting into motion his future career path as a politician.\n\nAfter returning the United States, McCain’s first marriage to the former Carol Shepp fell apart, and the couple eventually divorced in 1980. He later married Cindy Hensley, daughter of a wealthy Arizona beer distributor. The two met in Hawaii. She was 17 years younger than he was. McCain retired from the Navy in 1981, and his new marriage brought him to the Phoenix area.\n\nThe POW backstory was ready-made for a politician.\n\nPolitical success — and scandal\n\nIn 1982, McCain ran for and won the seat being vacated by the retiring former U.S. House Minority Leader John Rhodes, R-Ariz. Though McCain was called a carpetbagger, he prevailed in a tough four-way GOP primary against state Sen. Jim Mack, R-Tempe; Rep. Donna Carlson-West, R-Mesa; and Mesa civic activist Ray Russell. He faced no serious competition in the general election.\n\nMcCain pushed back on the charge that he was a political opportunist with no roots in Arizona. He said his Navy family was forced to move often.\n\n“As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi,” McCain said.\n\nMcCain was somewhat lucky in his first U.S. Senate race in 1986. Veteran U.S. Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., declined to run on the Republican side. Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a popular Democrat with presidential ambitions, also decided not to try for the retiring Goldwater’s seat. A self-inflicted political wound briefly made things interesting — McCain had made an ill-advised reference to the East Valley retirement community Leisure World as “Seizure World,” a place where 97 percent of the people voted and “the other 3 percent were in intensive care” — but he still wound up easily defeating Democratic opponent Richard Kimball.\n\n“Occasionally, my sense of humor is ill-considered or ill-timed, and that can be a problem,\" McCain later conceded in his 2002 book, “Worth the Fighting For.”\n\nEarly in his first Senate term, McCain and fellow U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and three other senators participated in two April 1987 meetings with federal thrift regulators who were investigating California-based Lincoln Savings & Loan. The troubled business was part of Charles H. Keating Jr.'s financial empire.\n\nKeating had donated and helped raise money for both Arizona senators. The McCain family even vacationed with Keating in the Bahamas. Once the meetings were made public, McCain and DeConcini found themselves at the heart of a major national scandal that resulted in 23 days of Senate ethics hearings.\n\nMORE:John McCain gets into 'a hell of a mess' with the Keating Five scandal\n\n“I was judged eventually, after three years, of using, quote, poor judgment, and I agree with that assessment,” McCain would later say.\n\nThe federal government seized Lincoln Savings & Loan in April 1989 and prosecuted Keating for fraud.\n\nThough DeConcini, who was determined to have acted inappropriately, would not run for a fourth term in 1994, McCain sought a second Senate term in 1992 and was able to overcome the Keating Five stigma. The controversy also didn’t do much to hinder his presidential runs in 2000 and 2008 and was largely forgotten during his later years in the Senate.\n\n\"It's ancient history,\" Bruce Merrill, the late Arizona State University professor emeritus and longtime political pollster, said of the scandal upon Keating’s death in 2014. \"It's amazing he (McCain) survived that, and I guess one could argue that his political skills brought him through that.”\n\nMcCain had seven children, including television commentator and author Meghan McCain. His family lived in the central Phoenix area for years.\n\nJohn McCain's American Story\n\nChapter 1: John McCain is a study in contradiction\n\nChapter 2: John McCain was destined for the Naval Academy\n\nChapter 3: John McCain was 'a very determined guy' as a POW\n\nChapter 4: John McCain's political ambition emerged after POW return\n\nChapter 5: John McCain's political career began after Arizona move\n\nChapter 6: Ever-ambitious, John McCain rises to the Senate\n\nChapter 7: John McCain 'in a hell of a mess' with Keating Five\n\nChapter 8: After Keating Five, John McCain faced new scandal\n\nChapter 9: John McCain becomes the 'maverick'\n\nChapter 10: 'Ugly' politics in John McCain's 2000 presidential run\n\nChapter 11: John McCain was frequent foe of Bush in early years\n\nChapter 12: John McCain goes establishment for 2nd White House run\n\nChapter 13: John McCain had rough start to 2008 presidential race\n\nChapter 14: John McCain clinches 2008 GOP presidential nomination\n\nChapter 15: John McCain takes on Obama for president in 2008\n\nChapter 16: John McCain fails in second bid for president\n\nChapter 17: 'Complete the danged fence,' John McCain proclaims\n\nChapter 18: John McCain wins 6th term, reclaims 'maverick' label", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/06/27/analysis-democratic-debate-trump-health-care-immigration/1578354001/", "title": "Democratic debate: Trump wasn't big theme; health care, border were", "text": "It wasn't all about Donald Trump.\n\nAt the opening Democratic debate Wednesday night, the 10 contenders on stage focused less on the Republican incumbent – after all, there was little disagreement there on the threat they said he posed to the republic — and more on the direction of the Democratic Party.\n\nOn that there was a real debate – one that's just getting started.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for abolishing private health insurance coverage in favor of a government-run system. \"I'm with Bernie (Sanders) on Medicare for All,\" she declared, a friendly reference to her biggest rival to lead the party's most liberal voters. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar cautioned that she was \"concerned about kicking half of America off their health insurance in four years.\"\n\nWhen former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke said he would keep private coverage as an option, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio demanded almost angrily, \"How can you defend a system that's not working?\"\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe two-hour debate spotlighted differences over how far left the Democratic Party should move, though it clearly has moved left on some economic and other issues since the last election, and what voters it should target. That divide is likely to be in even sharper relief Thursday night. The second-day debate will feature another 10 contenders, including former vice president Joe Biden standing side-by-side with Sanders on the Miami stage.\n\nThat would be \"Uncle Joe\" from Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the Vermont senator who proudly calls himself a democratic socialist. Biden has led national polls of the Democratic contenders, and Sanders generally has been second.\n\nAt Wednesday's forum, hosted by NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo, the candidates avoided the name-calling and derisive nicknames that Trump used four years ago to dominate the Republican primaries. That contest also included a field of candidates so large that their early debates had to be held over two nights.\n\nWho are they?:Meet the people running for president in 2020\n\nThat said, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro went after his fellow Texan, O'Rourke, over their differences on immigration. Castro, suggesting O'Rourke didn't \"do your homework on this issue,\" began a back-and-forth exchange that reflected long-standing grievances between the two on the topic.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan clashed with some heat on U.S. involvement in Afghanistan.\n\nKlobuchar slapped down Washington Gov. Jay Inslee after he bragged that he was the only candidate who had \"passed a law protecting a woman's right of reproductive health.\"\n\n\"I just want to say there are three women up here who have fought pretty hard for a woman's right to choose,\" she said dryly.\n\nThe imperative to deny President Trump a second term was nearly religious in its intensity. Asked to name the biggest geopolitical threat facing the USA, Inslee replied to scattered applause: Donald Trump. (Trump, aboard Air Force One on his way to the G-20 summit in Japan, tweeted a one-word review of the debate: \"BORING.\")\n\nHow best to achieve Trump's downfall was the subject of a sectarian divide.\n\nAppeal to liberal voters, especially younger ones, with a promise of free college tuition, which Warren backed? Or target more moderate working-class voters from places such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin who helped put Trump in the White House?\n\n\"We are not connecting to the working-class people in the very states I represent, in Ohio, in the industrial Midwest,\" Ryan said. \"We've lost all connection. We've got to change the center of gravity of the Democratic Party from being coastal, elitist and Ivy League, which is the perception to someone from the forgotten communities that have been left behind for the last 30 years.\"\n\nThe candidates, many of them not particularly well-known nationally, tried to tell viewers a bit about their personal stories. Warren noted that she grew up in Oklahoma. De Blasio mentioned that he was raising an African American son, Dante. Gabbard talked about her service in the Iraq War as a member of the Hawaii Army National Guard. Klobuchar said she weighed proposals on gun control by asking herself, \"Does this hurt my Uncle Dick in his deer stand?\"\n\nFirst O'Rourke, then New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, then Castro launched into Spanish in an answer or two, a not-so-subtle appeal to Hispanic voters.\n\nClosing comments:`We can't return to the same old approach,' and other lines from the Democratic debate\n\nNone of the contenders clearly dominated the evening, and no one made the sort of cringe-worthy misstep that could undermine their campaign. O'Rourke sometimes seemed to struggle to get into the conversation. Warren's command of policy details projected strength in the first half of the evening, although she faded a bit in the second half. At that point, Booker came across as confident and passionate; scorekeepers said he ended up with the most talking-time, a little more than 11 minutes.\n\nWhen journalist Dan Rather tweeted afterward, \"One last thought, how many people think Julian Castro had a good night?\" there was a quick response: \"Me,\" Julian Castro replied.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/05/18/final-vanderburgh-county-primary-election-numbers-tell-stories/624046002/", "title": "Final Vanderburgh County primary election numbers tell stories", "text": "EVANSVILLE -- Bruce Ungethiem was the hero of the wildly successful 2012 campaign to defeat Evansville-Vanderburgh consolidation. Two years later, he parlayed his enhanced public profile into a seat on the county's executive governing body.\n\nBut on primary election night this month, Ungethiem lost Vanderburgh County's northernmost sections to a Gibson County resident in House District 64. He garnered just 38 percent of the local Republican vote against Matt Hostettler, a resident of Fort Branch, Indiana.\n\n\"Bruce did not work as hard as he should have,\" Vanderburgh GOP Chairman Wayne Parke said. Ungethiem did not return a phone message.\n\nIt's not the only revealing tidbit in the final certified primary returns approved by the Vanderburgh County Election Board on Friday.\n\nAlex Burton — the 26-year-old newcomer who electrified Democrats in 2015 by leading the party's primary field of at-large City Council candidates — came in third in a three-candidate field for a precinct committee position.\n\nBurton and then-mayoral candidate Gail Riecken each lost in the November 2015 balloting — but in her election night remarks, Riecken singled out Burton as a young man with a bright future. The Indiana Democratic Party had already named him a 2014-2015 \"Emerging Leader.\"\n\nBut in the May 8 primary election, Burton got just 20 votes for a 4th Ward precinct committeeman position. David G. Hatfield got 21 votes. Gina Robinson Ungar, a Bernie Sanders delegate to the 2016 Democratic National Convention, won the job with 31 votes.\n\nBurton said he didn't campaign because he will soon move out of the precinct.\n\n\"I've been in this home-buying process,\" he said. \"There was no campaigning or anything.\"\n\nNow working as a program manager for the Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation, Burton demurred when asked whether he still has political aspirations.\n\n\"We'll see what happens. It's too early. I'm buried in what I'm doing here at the school corporation,\" he said.\n\nThe final primary election results also contained numbers that can't be good for 8th District Democratic nominee William Tanoos. The Terre Haute disability lawyer seeks to upend Republican Rep. Larry Bucshon in the 19-county congressional district.\n\nTanoos was the only Democratic candidate on the 8th District ballot in Vanderburgh County. But while 4,097 Democrats voted locally, just 3,080 of them checked Tanoos's name. That means roughly one in four Democrats left their 8th District ballots blank.\n\nMaking his first run for public office and living in Terre Haute, Tanoos may not be as familiar to local Democrats as U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly, a north-central Indiana resident who was elected in 2012. But Donnelly garnered 3,637 votes in Vanderburgh County — almost 600 more than Tanoos.\n\nThe numbers suggest Tanoos has work to do to get local Democrats as fired up to work for him as for Donnelly, who will face a determined challenge this fall from statewide and national Republicans.\n\nOther numbers of interest in the final certified vote returns:\n\n* Rachel Covington, a former Evansville resident who teaches English to Japanese students in Japan, got 756 votes in Vanderburgh County in the Republican 8th District primary. Facing a 14-hour time zone difference and living 6,500 miles away, Covington campaigned online only. Parke had said he couldn't name a single Republican who supported her. In the end, 7,924 people in the congressional district's 19 counties voted for Covington.\n\n* Democrat Mary Hart, Pigeon Township's longtime trustee, wasn't the only incumbent who lost her job in this month's nomination contests. German Township Trustee Sherri Schlitt, a Republican, lost to Tricia Gerteisen by a 321-172 margin.\n\n* Including five provisional ballots approved by the election board Friday, a total of 12,424 votes were cast in Vanderburgh County. That's just short of 11 percent of registered voters. In 2014, the most recent non-presidential year midterm election, 8,104 people voted in Vanderburgh County.\n\n* 8,327 votes — 67 percent of the total — were cast in the Republican primary. The Democrats' 4,097 votes were 33 percent of the total. Democrats had not trailed far behind the GOP in early voting, but once all the ballots were cast, the final picture reflected the competitive imbalance between the parties. The GOP offered an array of high profile, colorful and sometimes acrimonious nominating contests, while Democrats had just a handful of contested township positions.\n\n* Among the county's 22 vote centers, Washington Square Mall saw the most action and St. Lucas United Church of Christ the least. 1,302 votes were cast at the mall. St. Lucas hosted 99 voters.\n\nAlso in Friday's election board meeting, members voted to formally dismiss a complaint filed against Democratic Board of Commissioners candidate Jeff Hatfield by Republican Party secretary Hobart Scales. Scales had alleged, among other things, that the Democrat produced and paid for campaign materials without filing the required paperwork.\n\nBut Scales withdrew his complaint on Tuesday — the same day Hatfield produced an affidavit signed by elections supervisor John Gerard stating he showed Scales all of Hatfield's papers. On Friday, GOP Chairman Parke disavowed Scales' complaint and said he had chewed out the young party officer.\n\nMore:Webb: Keep another kid from dying in a school shooting\n\nMore:Court terms you might hear during Terrence Roach's trial on Aleah Beckerle's disappearance\n\nMore:Evansville mom suing city, driver over fatal chase that killed her children", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/12/biden-apec-summit-san-francisco-criticisms/71407439007/", "title": "In Joe Biden's world, the US is a beacon of democracy.

To many born after 9/11, there’s a bigger existential question about whether the U.S. is still a beacon for other countries to emulate.\n\nBiden is stuck in the middle, trying to mediate between his ideal about how he should lead and the widespread frustration of his citizens.\n\nIt will soon come to head as Biden welcomes the leaders of more than a dozen countries, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, to a major economic and trade summit for Pacific powers in San Francisco.\n\nA series of polls in the past two weeks have shown widespread discontent among the public with the direction the country is headed. Americans do not believe Biden’s leadership on the world stage has been effective. His lackluster support inspired a primary challenger, and last week the chief strategist for Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns suggested Biden should not seek office again.\n\nThe threat of a government shutdown and a bitter dispute with hard-right Republicans over the White House’s funding request for wars in Israel and Ukraine have also cast a shadow over the summit, where Biden hoped to convince potential allies the U.S. is a reliable partner.\n\n“This will be a tough time for President Biden to do it,” said Peter Feaver, who worked for multiple presidents on the National Security Council. “This is a hard test for the administration.”\n\nIt is the second time in six months that a poorly-timed dispute with Congress has disrupted Biden’s plans to woo Pacific countries he hopes to draw away from China.\n\nHe had to return home from an overseas trip early – canceling stops in Papua New Guinea and Australia – during the debt ceiling fight with House Republicans in May. He promised to roll out the red carpet for Australia's prime minister during a state dinner instead. But that gathering in late October ultimately had to be scaled back in the face of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nBiden is in another battle with House Republicans over federal spending now. A year out from the general election, the Democratic president is also navigating a difficult reality: Voters surveyed are saying they prefer Donald Trump, who is promising to negotiate an end to Russia's war against Ukraine, carry out mass deportations and ban refugees from any nation he considers a security threat.\n\nBiden's domestic agenda got a shot in the arm last Tuesday when Democrats and abortion rights prevailed in off-year elections the president and his team view as indicative of a 2024 landscape that might work in their favor.\n\nAnd his diplomatic efforts yielded some success last week when Israel announced that it would implement short humanitarian pauses in northern Gaza that will help civilians leave embattled areas and aid to be delivered more quickly.\n\nBut whether that’s enough for voters is at the heart of the question.\n\nThe agreement fell short of the cessation in fighting of at least three days that Biden had sought from Israel. John Kirby, a chief White House spokesman on national security, was quick to argue that the pauses were a “direct result of his personal leadership and diplomacy here.”\n\nVoters concerned about Biden’s leadership\n\nBiden, who turns 81 next week, has struggled to persuade Americans he has the mental fitness to be president.\n\nA survey of registered voters in battleground states released last week by The New York Times and Siena College found a large majority of the electorate, 71%, believe Biden is too old to be president. On the question of mental sharpness, 62% said Biden doesn’t have it.\n\nThe poll showed Biden trailing Trump in five out of six states that are likely to determine the winner of next November’s election.\n\nIn response to the first survey, former Obama adviser David Axelrod said there is “legitimate concern” pulsating through the Democratic Party about Biden’s reelection prospects.\n\nThe president must decide whether it “is wise” for him to continue his candidacy and “whether it's in HIS best interest or the country's,” Axelrod said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“Biden obviously has lost a step,” Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher, chair of the House committee on competition between the U.S. and China, said in an interview.\n\nHe pointed to Biden’s comment last year about “a minor incursion” into Ukraine. “I'm not sure that anybody, like, fears Biden on the world stage in a way that would help us.”\n\nThe president has made foreign policy a pillar of his reelection argument. But in a CNN poll published last week, just 36% of Americans viewed him as an effective world leader. That compared with 48% who viewed Trump that way.\n\nBiden dismissed the bad polling during comments at a fundraiser, and his campaign denied, in response to a query from USA TODAY, that there’s a disconnect between the president’s focus on American leadership abroad and the anxiety that voters are feeling about domestic issues such as the economy.\n\nTo the extent that there is, deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said, it is the campaign's job to bridge that gap.\n\nFulks went on to warn: “Now is not the time for a rookie.”\n\nIt is not a time “to honestly put someone back who has already driven our country, both foreign policy wise and economically, to the brink of destruction that President Biden has gotten to work to bring back,” he said.\n\nTurmoil in Congress ahead of Xi meeting\n\nDemocratic lawmakers were far more concerned about the message Biden’s dispute with Congress over foreign assistance sends to leaders who are attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit this week in San Francisco. Especially Xi.\n\nBiden is scheduled to meet with the Chinese president Wednesday to discuss the wars and the future of Taiwan before the larger summit begins.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Jake Auchincloss said that by slow-walking an aid package that includes money for Israel, Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific, “We are undercutting the strength of whatever message President Biden is able to deliver.”\n\n“Congress should be sending President Biden into his meeting with Xi Jinping in a position of strength,” said Auchincloss, a Democrat who sits on the China committee.\n\nThe government will shut down on Friday, as the summit concludes, unless Congress reaches a consensus or Republicans muscle through a short-term fix. House Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled a two-step bill, which keeps federal funding at its current levels for some parts of the government until January and other parts until February, to his caucus over the weekend. The House and Senate would need to pass the legislation and Biden would have to sign it by the end of the week to avoid a shutdown.\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat and ranking member on the China panel, said House Republicans are creating “chaos and dysfunction” that is harming Biden’s efforts on the world stage.\n\n“I think the CCP has used specifically those particular issues and their propaganda around the world to try to shape peoples' attitudes toward democracy versus authoritarian governments. So it really undercuts us in different ways,” he said, using another name for China.\n\nBut, he noted, China is facing economic issues that are worse than those of the United States. The costs of goods are higher than Americans would prefer, yet job growth has been strong and the unemployment rate remains low.\n\n“In contrast, America's economy is doing relatively well. So I don't think that they should be gloating about anything, walking into that kind of meeting, although we could do better to improve our hand, too,” he said.\n\nThe conversation is expected to yield little in the way of immediate results, but the administration believes the in-person meeting between Biden and Xi is necessary to stabilize relations between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nIt will precede two days of roundtables among representatives from APEC’s 21 members, which include Russia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan and other economies.\n\nBiden's foreign policy flex\n\nBiden is scheduled to leave Washington on Tuesday for the summit, which concludes Friday. The White House declined to say last week whether it was considering changes to his schedule in light of the government funding deadline.\n\nThe summit will provide Biden with an opportunity to demonstrate his foreign policy acumen to Americans who have lost confidence in his ability to lead the country.\n\n“I think Americans are reacting to a sense that events are spinning faster and faster. And they're reflecting their anxiety, I think, in their analysis of the incumbent,” Auchincloss said.\n\nThat said, “I feel very confident that the president's handling of Ukraine, of Israel, of Taiwan, is going to age very well. That years from now, when people are looking back at the Biden presidency on foreign policy, it’s going to be regarded as a significant strength of the administration.”\n\nHe suggested that Americans are engaged in revisionist history about Trump’s record, pointing to George W. Bush, who left office deeply unpopular at the beginning of a decades-long conflict with Afghanistan and after a war with Iraq, but is rated more favorably now.\n\nFeaver, who served on the National Security Council under Bush, said the same could happen with Biden. But, he said, “That's very thin consolation right now.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/07/arizona-congressional-district-3-democratic-candidate-yassamin-ansari-progressive-stance/75504910007/", "title": "How progressive is Yassamin Ansari?

Ten names will be added twice a month, so be sure to check back for updates.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the first 70 names.\n\nRuby Diamond (1886 - 1982) and Smiley Bruce (1919 - 2002)\n\nRuby Diamond was one of 13 members of the Florida State College’s 1905 graduating class and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry.\n\nMiss Ruby, as she preferred to be called, once deadpanned that she \"wasn't taught to do a blessed thing on earth but smile.”\n\nHowever, Diamond had a reputation as a shrewd businesswoman. And it appears her passion was to give away her wealth.\n\nRuby’s father, Julius Diamond, was a wealthy Tallahassee merchant.\n\nWhen Julius died, Ruby inherited a large fortune. She sold the family business and home and moved into the Floridian Hotel, where she assembled a collection of antique snuff bottles shipped in from all over the world.\n\nDiamond is representative of a class of wealthy, single, 19th century progressive women philanthropists. Columbia University philosopher John Dewey, a spokesman for that era of progressives and creator of the Dewey Decimal System, was a friend who visited and corresponded with Diamond.\n\nShe never married. The city became her family. Tallahasseans would often see Ruby Diamond taking drives around the city in a 1963 powder-blue Cadillac, chauffeured by Smiley Bruce, a former custodian for the state, bus driver and ice man.\n\nShe and Bruce were inseparable in his 25 years chaufering Miss Ruby. His recollection of their relationship informs E. Lynne Wright’s novel “It Happened in Florida: Remarkable Events That Shaped History.\" Others drew comparisons of Diamond and Bruce to the 1987 play “Driving Miss Daisy,” a story about another single, elderly, eccentric, Jewish woman.\n\nMiss Ruby fought for lower taxes and racial equality, helped establish Temple Israel, and founded the “Diamond Vegetable Basket,” to provide seeds and fertilizer to any Leon County resident who received welfare assistance.\n\n“At Christmastime she sent me out to get people who didn’t have any place to go and had me collect them up and carry them to different cafes,\" Bruce told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nShe always picked up the bill.\n\nRuby Diamond established scholarships at FSU for disadvantaged students and contributed to at least 37 charitable organizations. She was an active member of the Oleander Garden Circle, Tallahassee Historical Society, LeMoyne Art Foundation, and the Tallahassee Junior Museum.\n\nIn 1970 FSU named its largest auditorium in her honor, housed in the iconic Westcott Building.\n\nA year later, Diamond donated property valued at $100,000 to the university. And in 1981, she donated more property to help fund an endowed chair of national excellence in the College of Education.\n\nDiamond died in 1982, bequeathing to Smiley that blue Cadillac. The church leader at Friendship Primitive Baptist Church and foster grandparent then turned his hand to selling boiled peanuts in his retirement.\n\n\"He always liked to do something,\" said his grandaughter Regina Webster. \"He never could stay still. He liked to be around people. He loved to talk.\n\nRobert Butler (1786 - 1860)\n\nRobert Butler was an American military officer, a veteran of the Battle of New Orleans raised by Andrew Jackson after Butler’s parents died of yellow fever.\n\nWhen Spain ceded Florida to the U.S., Butler represented the U.S. at ceremonies in St. Augustine where Spanish Gov. Jose Maria Coppinger handed over possession of the city and territory and left for Cuba.\n\nIn 1824, when Tallahassee was founded and a crew of Jackson’s former officers were seemingly in charge of affairs, Butler was appointed the Survey General of Florida.\n\nHis first job was to establish the prime meridian, which serves as ground zero for all real estate transactions – the reference point for all surveys of property deeds in the state.\n\nInterim Gov. George Walton selected a spot about 200 yards south and east of the Capitol. Walton drove a cedar stake in the ground, next to the ampitheater at today's Cascades Park, and Butler would approve and certify all land surveys in the state until 1848 using the stake as the prime meridian.\n\nButler was a Jackson man. He organized Tallahassee’s first fraternal organization, the Masonic Jackson Lodge.\n\nHe married Jackson's daughter Rachel Hays, and gave Lake Jackson its name. Butler and Hays had a 900-acre plantation that extended from its shore and included the mounds built by Native Americans.\n\nNearby he built a holding pond to power a mill.\n\nWaist high tombstones for Robert and Rachel are located off Crowder Road near Lake Jackson Mounds State Park. They are off of the right fork of the park’s Butler Mill Trail, where a keen eye can spot remnants of the mill project.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown (1785 - 1867)\n\nThomas Brown the pioneer – not Tom Brown, the namesake of Tallahassee’s premier city park – was among a group of War of 1812 veterans who later settled in Tallahassee once it was named the Florida capital.\n\nBefore he moved to town, Brown, as the chief clerk of the Richmond, Va., post office, invented the post office letter box.\n\nIn 1828 Tallahassee, Brown built a hotel on Adams Street, between Pensacola and Lafayette streets, south of the present-day state Capitol campus. Originally called Brown’s Inn, the hotel underwent many name changes, including being called City Hotel for a couple of years.\n\nThe hotel provided the connections that enabled Brown to remain politically active. He served as president of the legislative council in 1838, was a member of the constitutional convention in 1839, and served in the first session of the Florida House of Representatives in 1845.\n\nIn 1849, Brown became the only Whig Party member elected Florida governor. He promoted agriculture and worked to improve the transportation and education systems.\n\nIntrigued by the rich soil in the Lake Okeechobee watershed, he explored whether to drain the Everglades to create more farmland. The initiative resulted in Fort Myers emerging as a bustling village.\n\nHe persuaded the legislature to endorse building a plank toll road from Jacksonville to Lake City. Under his tenure, a steamship line was initiated on the St. Johns River. And in 1853, the East Florida Seminary opened in Ocala. Closed by the Civil War, the school reopened in 1866 in Gainesville and would become the University of Florida.\n\nAt the end of his term as governor, Brown retired from public life. A Mason for more than 60 years, he served as the long-term secretary for the Tallahassee lodge and compiled a book on Masonry.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown is buried at the Old City Cemetery in Tallahassee.\n\nRev. Herbert Clarke Alexander (1929 - 1994)\n\nHerbert C. Alexander was a transitional figure who straddled two eras; between those who tried to work through Jim Crow and those who fought it.\n\nAlexander was a high school dropout from Palatka who joined the U.S. Army and then earned a degree in religion from Florida A&M University in 1957.\n\nHe would teach five years at Bond Elementary, and then at the old Lincoln High before leaving Tallahassee for the University of Tennessee where he would earn a Ph.D.\n\nAlexander would return to Tallahassee as FAMU’s Vice President of Student Affairs in 1969.\n\nIt was a turbulent time with the anti-war and Civil Rights movements flourishing and universities and the city struggling to meet student’s demands.\n\n“Herbert was never at the forefront of activism. But he was a man of impeccable character, who certainly always espoused the goals of the Civil Rights movement,” said the late Charles Smith, FAMU’s then Dean of Graduate Studies at Alexander’s passing.\n\nSmith participated in many of the marches and demonstrations students organized.\n\nAlexander was also a preacher, who ministered at Baptist churches in Valdosta, Quitman, and Tallahassee, where he followed his mentor, the Rev. C.K. Steele as pastor of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church..\n\nYet although Steele was a driving force in the 1956 Bus Boycott, Alexander’s conciliatory nature in the VP role did not always mesh well with the demands of 1970s-era students.\n\nHe said he grew weary in the job and stepped down in 1972.\n\n“I have great faith in young people. I see in them the energy, enthusiasm, that I feel I am losing,” Alexander told the Associated Press.\n\n“If the powers that be will not be unduly restrictive on them, they will find solutions to almost all kinds of problems we struggle with,” said Alexander.\n\nAlexander remained on the FAMU campus as the director of the business ethics program. In that role, his relentless positive voice about the nature of man became a magnet for students. They would line up outside his office to talk and seek advice.\n\n“He didn’t have the talent to turn them away,” said then Dean Sybil Mobley.\n\nAlexander was a recipient of the FAMU Distinguished Alumni Award in Religion and the Martin L. King Jr. Leadership Award.\n\nRob Roy Ashmore (1916 - 2010)\n\nRob Roy Ashmore held court for more than 60 years in a store that evolved into Ashmore Antique’s. Once a drug store, the place became a junktique emporium/pecan shop on West Brevard Street in Frenchtown, across from the Old Lincoln High and just down the street from the Governor’s Mansion.\n\nThe eclectic store with an eccentric owner became a landmark for generations of college students and politicians.\n\nWhen he passed, longtime social services lobbyist Jack Levine wrote of Ashmore, “no one knew more Florida governors more personally than Rob Roy.”\n\nThe reason governors made their way to his store, Ashmore told Levine was, “because I’m famous. I can’t say the same for some of them.”\n\nAshmore Antiques came to be after World War II when Rob Roy took over his cousin’s store.\n\nHe stocked it with funky junk, retro furniture, and abstract odds and ends, and bought pecans from teens and the homeless to sell.\n\nCollege students flocked to the store where the proprietor seemed more interested in spinning tall and small tales than he was in selling anything.\n\nCandidates would ask to put their posters in his window and after the election instead of trashing them, Ashmore used them to paper the store’s walls.\n\nThe place became an improv political museum, decorated with more than 200 posters and framed photographs of a who’s who of politicians from former President Harry Truman to former Mayor John Marks.\n\nAfter the store’s popularity attracted England’s Duke of Windsor in 1952, it became a campaign stop for candidates. In 1968 presidential candidates Hubert Humphrey, Shirley Chisholm and George Wallace visited and snacked on pecans with Rob Roy.\n\nAshmore once spent an afternoon drinking Coca-Cola and munching on fresh-shelled pecans with Gov. Claude Kirk. Kirk persuaded Ashmore to help move his daughter out of an FSU dorm room. A laborer Ashmore brought along asked why he kept calling the other man \"governor.\" The worker did not recognize Kirk, which delighted Ashmore.\n\nAshmore's tales also included cruising around town with Gov. LeRoy Collins in the governor’s limousine and supplying Gov. Lawton Chiles with tobacco snuff for hunting.\n\n“I’m not supposed to tell you because he took on big tobaccy – but he liked to pinch it when he was out shooting birds,” Ashmore said.\n\nA Sopchoppy native, Ashmore credited a lesson he learned working for at an uncle’s Jackson County drug store for his store becoming a Tallahassee landmark.\n\n“I learned quick that being nice back was good for business,” Ashmore said.\n\nAshmore closed his store in 2008. The city has purchased the building with the intent of turning it into a local cultural center and African American museum.\n\nThomas Irwin Brown Jr. (1914 - 1973)\n\nThomas Irwin Brown, no relation to the Floirda Gov. Brown, was a coach, athletic director and longtime county commissioner.\n\nA Pulaski County Georgia native, Brown played football at Clemson. In 1944, he was hired to coach the Leon High School football team. Brown also operated a laundry business, service station and built an apartment complex near Florida State University.\n\nGov. LeRoy Collins appointed Brown to the Leon County Board of County Commissioners in 1958 following the death of Commissioner William Kelley.\n\nHe would serve 14 years, being reelected three times.\n\nAs a politician, Brown followed a conservative philosophy that supported consolidation of city and county governments, expansion of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, construction of the truck route that became Capital Circle, a county library, and an addition to the courthouse.\n\nHe served as the Commission’s chair 1963-1964, 1967-1968, and 1972.\n\nBrown also served as president of the Tallahassee Kiwanis Club and director of the Tallahassee Booster and Quarterback clubs. He coached a Babe Ruth League baseball team for 20 years.\n\nIn 1977, the City of Tallahassee dedicated a 255-acre recreation park in Tom Brown’s memory. As a fitting memory for a coach, Tom Brown Park features several softball and baseball fields, racquet and tennis courts, a disc golf course, a 3.1-mile-long bike and nature trails, and a fenced area for dogs to frolic.\n\nBrown died in 1973, and is buried at Roselawn Cemetery.\n\nEdward Bradford (1798 - 1871)\n\nEdward and brothers Thomas, William, Henry, and Richard arrived in Tallahassee from Enfield, North Carolina, in 1829. Direct descendants of William Bradford, governor of the Plymouth Colony, and English statesman Oliver Cromwell, the brothers would establish five plantations along what is now Thomasville Road in north Leon County.\n\nTallahassee’s northeast suburbs were once the site of a Bradford agricultural enterprise powered by the labor of enslaved individuals at Edgewood, Horseshoe, Pine Hill, Walnut Hill, and Water Oak plantations.\n\nRecords of transactions with New York cotton brokers between 1840 and 1866 indicate it was a prosperous business worth millions in today's money.\n\nThe Leon County 1860 Agricultural Census found 130 slaves worked Pine Hills and assessed the plantation’s value at $949,510 when adjusted for inflation.\n\nAccording to the Census, the brothers held 585 people as enslaved workers.\n\nA book titled \"Slavery and Plantation Growth in Antebellum Florida, 1821–1860\" noted that the Bradfords held a large barbecue for its enslaved workers on July 4th and that Christmas week was a time of no work except for tending livestock. Bradford's wife would commission gifts for the \"black folks\" including shawls, brightly colored printed dresses and bandannas, new hats and Sunday shoes, according to the author. It was a different scene at the nearby Chemonie plantation where there was no celebration.\n\nEdward's nephew Capt. Richard H. Bradford was the first soldier killed in Florida in the Civil War.\n\nEdward also owned the Horseshoe Plantation east of Lake Iamonia. When he died in 1871, Horseshoe became known as Bradfordville, which is today an unincorporated village of 19,000.\n\nDale Mabry (1891 - 1992)\n\nDale Mabry is a Florida name most people associate with a Tampa-area highway but Dale Mabry the man was a Tallahassee native, and his hometown didn’t appreciate when Tampa appropriated his name.\n\nMabry was the son of former Florida Supreme Court Justice Milton H. Mabry and Ella Dale Bramlett.\n\nOn February 21, 1922, Captain Dale Mabry lost his life at age 30 when the rudder system malfunctioned on the 410 foot long airship \"Roma\" that he was piloting over Norfolk, Va.\n\nFrom a height of 1,000 feet, the Roma with 43 people onboard, went into a dive straight to the ground.\n\nJust before the airship impacted the ground, it encountered power lines that caused the vessel to burst into flames.\n\nMabry and 34 airmen died in the accident, which at the time was the worst aviation disaster in U.S. history.\n\nWhen Mabry’s body was removed from the twisted and burnt wreckage he was still holding the wheel to steer the airship.\n\nThe US Army would never use hydrogen in any of its airships again.\n\nIn 1929, Tallahassee named its first airfield in his honor. Dale Mabry Field was dedicated on November 11, Veteran’s Day.\n\nA few years later, Tampa wanted to name its airfield after Mabry, but Tallahassee would not agree to change the name of its airfield. Tampa officials finally decided to just name a new road leading to the airfield after Mabry.\n\nMabry will one day have his Tallahassee moment again with the opening of the Dale Mabry Army Airfield Museum on the campus of Tallahassee State College.\n\nHelen Grissett (1916 - 2016)\n\nHelen Turner Grissett was a long-time educator whose love for animals made her a legendary director of what once was the Tallahassee Junior Museum, and today is the Tallahassee Museum – 52 acres of historical buildings and exhibits of animals and natural Florida.\n\nGrissett received a B.A. from Florida State College for Women in 1940 and a M.A. from the University of Florida in 1950. She taught at Caroline Brevard Elementary for two years, at Leon High for five, and Ruediger Elementary for a decade.\n\nIn 1964, she was appointed director of the fledgling Junior Museum and helped make into reality what psychology professor Howard Baker called at Grissett’s retirement in 1971, “the best idea from Tallahassee in our generation.”\n\nGrissett loved animals. Her idea of a mini zoo of petable animals became the Museum’s most popular feature.\n\nToday, the Museum is home to red wolves, black bears, white-tailed deer, red and grey fox, the Florida panther, bobcats, and cougars, along with many birds, and reptiles.\n\nGrissett was the last director to live on site, which made her view her park responsibilities as a 24-hour job.\n\nWhen a veterinarian had given up on a fox and said it would not survive, Grissett stayed up all night and nursed it. The fox lived.\n\nOne time Grissett took a baby goat, another time, a baby fawn to bed with her when they were sick to keep them warm while they recovered. And she used her bathtub as a hospital bed for alligators.\n\nThe Tallahassee Junior Museum held a Helen Grissett Day, June 13, 1971, when Grissett retired. A plaque on the Museum’s early childhood education building recognizes Grissett’s contribution to the Museum.\n\nMrs. Jessie Moon (1904 - 1982)\n\nMarion County’s Jessie Moon may be Leon County school systems' most successful innovator.\n\nJesse Moon earned a degree from Florida State College for Women in 1934 and taught at Kate Sullivan and Hartsfield elementary schools before being named the first principal of W.T. Moore Elementary School.\n\nThe school opened in the fall of 1968 as the county’s first truly integrated school.\n\nStudents still living in the footprint of old plantations where the families had been for generations and neighborhoods built by a nascent “Sun Belt” economic boom, were blended into one student body.\n\n“This was a relatively new concept at the time, but the school made great advances,” said DJ Wright, who joined the faculty in 1974.\n\nMoon wanted her teachers to know their students and each summer loaded them on a bus and drove through the areas where students lived – providing a visual display of a diverse student population.\n\nAnd she wanted students to understand each other. They would participate in daily discussions of their similarities and differences; even learning how each other's hair felt to the touch.\n\nMoon pioneered the open classroom concept for Leon County. The idea employed team teaching techniques. Classrooms consisted of seven large learning centers and two rooms for specialized instruction.\n\nAnd Moon also developed a hearing-impaired program that initially served seven counties. Students were bused from 50 miles away.\n\n“She was ahead of her times,” said Roberta Trowbridge, a student teacher for the program, who would spend all but one year of her career at Moore.\n\n“Mrs. Moon would come visit in our classroom and interact with the children regularly. She had such compassion for these kids,” said Trowbridge.\n\nAway from school, Mrs. Moon was a gardener who made bouquets of flowers for teachers, students, and parents.\n\nToday they are remembered as floral displays of the warm, inviting, positive school culture Moon created at Moore.\n\n“You felt it when you went through the doors. She knew she was creating an institution of learning for children, and it has lived on as a testament to her,” said Wright, who served as Moore’s principal 1994 - 2003.\n\nIn 1980, an addition previously identified as the Hearing Impairment Program’s Center M, was dedicated in honor of Mrs. Jessie Moon.\n\nRichard A. Shine (1810 -1862)\n\nTwenty-year old Richard A. Shine arrived in Tallahassee in 1830 and left a mark on the capital city that remains visible today. They include some notable tourist attractions .\n\nShine was a builder and supervised construction of the 1845 state Capitol, known today as the Historic Old Capitol. Other projects include the First Presbyterian Church, the Bloxham House at 410 Calhoun St., the Chittenden House at 323 Park Ave, and the main house of Goodwood Museum and Gardens.\n\nAccording to Census information from 1840, Shine was listed as the owner of 30 slaves. Historian Andrew Frank said Shine was known to have used slaves on his projects in Tallahassee and also hired them out as skilled laborers.\n\nThe bricks for the construction projects were made at a 50-acre brickyard located between Mahan Drive and Miccosukee Road that Shine owned. Remnants of the kilns were visible as late as 1934, according to the Tallahassee Historical Society Annual.\n\nBut he was also an engineer who made the deep cut along Mahan and under Magnolia Drive to lay the tracks that brought the Pensacola-Georgia Railroad to east Tallahassee in 1857. That cut, dug by enslaved people, is still in use today.\n\nA Quartermaster General of the Confederate army and Florida Militia, died in 1862, at the height of the Civil War. No written account of his death has been found. The Shine family tomb is in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nSeeking clues:Help solve mystery of two portraits found at Goodwood Museum\n\nMarion Franklin Tinsley (1927 - 1995)\n\nMarion F. Tinsley was so good at checkers that he ran out of human opponents. The Florida A&M and Florida State math professor spent the last five years of his life beating increasingly more powerful computers.\n\nTinsley earned a doctorate at The Ohio State University in 1957 and then taught math at FAMU for 26 years and 10 years at FSU. He also served as a part-time minister at Tallahassee Christian Church.\n\nTinsley won the world checkers championship in 1954 and today is recognized as the greatest checker player ever.\n\nHe was world champion from 1954 – 1958, and again from 1975 – 1991. He also claimed four consecutive Florida Open championships, 1974, 75, 76, 77.\n\nHe claimed he was a mediocre checkers player until at age 14 when he stumbled on a book of checkers while researching a math problem at the library.\n\n“Checkers can get quite a hold on you. Its beauty is just overwhelming, the mathematics, the elegance, the precision. It’s capable of wrapping you all up,” said Tinsley, according to a New York Times obituary.\n\nTwo of the seven games Tinsley lost during a 50-year run were to a Chinook computer program. It had a repertory of 250 billion moves and could make 3 million calculations a minute. It beat Tinsley once when he was intoxicated, and again during an exhibition when Tinsley competed in two matches at once.\n\nBefore cancer forced Tinsley to retire from competition, he fought the computer to six straight draws.\n\n“Tinsley was the Mount Everest we wanted to scale,” said program developer Jonathan Schaeffer after Tinsley withdrew from the 1994 world championship competition.\n\nBurt Norton (1943 - 1995)\n\nIt was 1966, about the time the Beatles released the landmark Revolver album, when Burt Norton drove into Tallahassee. He arrived in a Ford station wagon loaded with a 1960 Fender Jazzmaster, a Fender Pro Amp, a stand alone Fender reverb tank, and a few clothes.\n\nThirty years later when Tallahassee music community gathered for a memorial concert in his honor, the Tallahassee Democrat wrote, “no doubt there would have been a music scene in Tallahassee without Burt Norton. But just as certainly it would have been entirely different.”\n\nBurt Norton was the man behind Norton Audio and Music on Jackson Bluff Road. Tallahassee’s first rock n roll music store. It stocked the name brands that powered the Woodstock Generation. It became known as Norton Music, “The Guitar Store;” a mecca for musicians and fans.\n\nNorton provided services for his products, never charged for guitar string installations or setups.\n\n“It was just a given, Burt was always there,” recalled John Paul Waters before the 1995 tribute concert for Norton. “He didn’t make a big deal about it. Whatever you were looking for in the music world, he was a great resource.”\n\nPeople poured into the store – students, musicians, transients – to share stories and talk music.\n\n“I always found it interesting how I could wait on a farmer early in the morning and a state supreme court justice toward closing time,” recalled Ken Norton, who worked the counter at his brother’s store.\n\nEventually Norton decided Tallahassee needed a recording studio. So, he went off to Nashville and toured the studios where Roy Orbison recorded.\n\nHe opened a 16-track recording studio at the Jackson Bluff location.\n\nFor the next 10 years, Sweet Bay studios recorded dozens of local groups. Among those who cut songs or albums at Sweet Bay were LaBamba/Flipside, Meisburg and Walters, Bill Wharton, Drew Reid, BB Jam, Dixie Drive, Rainbow Band, Tallahassee Band, McKenzie Brothers – and a teenage country singer from Quincy, Billy Dean.\n\nIn 1986, amid growing competition from other music stores, Norton closed the store and took a job with the state. He passed away in January 1995 at age 52.\n\nLaura Mae Thompson Dixie (1925 - 2017)\n\nLaura Mae Thompson hailed from the Chaires neighborhood east of town and became a key organizer in the Civil Rights Movement in Tallahassee.\n\n“The Mother of the Movement in Tallahassee,” is how Bethel Missionary Baptist Rev. R.B. Holmes eulogized Dixie.\n\nDixie was an activist. Served as vice president of the Leon County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Was a board member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and president of AFSCME Local 2847.\n\nVisiting people who were sick, taking in first-generation Florida A&M students, and feeding people were the foundations of Dixie’s approach to community organizing.\n\nDixie didn’t like speaking in front of crowds and avoided the spotlight. She was the person that others depended on when funds needed to be raised, voters needed to be registered, or when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., needed a place to stay during a Tallahassee stop.\n\nDixie was persistent. When the pace of desegregation at W.T. Edward Hospital proved to be slow, she quietly went to work.\n\n\"I had a long fingernail file and they had these signs also where, you know, they had the patients segregated,\" she recalled in a recorded interview.\n\n\"They had a white wing, black wing, white bathroom, colored bathroom, white eating dining room, colored dining room, and so I took my fingernail file and went 'round and unscrewed every one of those segregation signs off the door ... the supervisor said, 'I can't picture nobody doing that but Dixie,' but they still couldn't prove that I did it. I was acting just as innocent as I could be.\"\n\nCharles Saxon Ausley (1907 - 1972)\n\nThere were some impressive shoes Charles Saxon Ausley had to fill. Tallahassee appreciated the work of his dad, the physician Charles, so much they named Ausley Road on the west side in his honor. And his grandfather George Saxon was the founder of the Capital City Bank, the city’s oldest operating business.\n\nCharlie, who carried both men’s names, set out to be, in the words of the Tallahassee Democrat, a “good citizen.”\n\nHe left his mark on the community. In 1930, he teamed with future Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins to create the Ausley McMullen law firm, one of Tallahassee’s oldest law firms.\n\nAusley wrote the first charter of the Florida State Foundation, founded the Tallahassee Jaycees, served as president of the Chamber of Commerce, and as corporate officer of the Tallahassee Democrat and director of the Orange Bowl committee.\n\nCharlie also was a municipal judge, city commissioner, and state senator – filling in for Collins when he resigned to join the Navy during World War II.\n\nWhen he died, a Tallahassee Democrat editorial acknowledged he served as the newspaper’s legal counsel but also extolled him as a “good citizen.”\n\nWrote the editorial board, “In the 42 years since he returned to Tallahassee with his law degree from the University of Florida, there was hardly a worthwhile project or mission on which his help was not sought and given without hesitation. It is such good citizens as Charlie Ausley who have made Tallahassee the place for the good life it is.”\n\nGene Calvin Cox (1935 - 2009)\n\nGene Calvin Cox is the winningest football coach ever to walk a Tallahassee sideline.\n\nIn a 27-year run as head football coach at Leon High School, the Lions were 238 – 67 and won two state championships, 14 district championships, seven regional championships and eight conference championships.\n\nMore than 100 players would sign a college scholarship.\n\nA Lake City native, Cox played at Columbiana High, and was listed behind Lee Corso on the running back depth chart for the 1954 Florida State University team, which won the Sun Bowl.\n\nAfter coaching at high schools in Jefferson and Suwannee counties, Cox became head coach at Leon and a football legend.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions ran off 25 straight wins in 1968, 1969, and 1970. On two other occasions, Leon won sixteen straight games. And in 1984 –1985 the Lions posted a 19-game winning streak.\n\n“He was so serious about and so intense that when you came to college at FSU, that it was really easier than what we were used to at Leon – the intensity of the workout and at practice. And you knew how to win,” said former FSU quarterback Wally Woodham.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions became a feeder program for Bobby Bowden’s teams at FSU.\n\nThe 1979 11 – 0 Seminoles featured seven Lions, including two quarterbacks, Woodham and Jimmy Jordan, along with QB coach Billy Sexton. The Lion-led Noles only loss was to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl.\n\nCox retired from Leon in 1990 but would return to the sidelines for Aucilla Christian Academy a year later. When he successfully retired as coach after the 1995 season, his 313 wins were the most ever in Florida.\n\nIn 1997, the Tallahassee Sports Commission, the Leon County School Board and the Leon County Commission renamed Capital Stadium to Gene Cox Stadium.\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam (1926 - 2006)\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam dance students started performing revues at halftime of Leon High School football games in 1947. A New York trained ballet instructor, Gilliam had a studio in the Randall-Lewis House where students from age 2-and-a-half to 16 learned tap and ballet.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, troupes of Gilliam students publicly performed in dance reviews to popular songs. Gilliam outfitted dancers in calico dresses and bonnets for a “Gal in Calico” performance, and in Spanish-theme costumes for \"The Lady in Red.”\n\nBefore Tallahassee desegregated Gilliam opened her studio to Black girls for ballet lessons.\n\nCarla Richardson joined the classes in 1964 and said she and about a half dozen other girls were not fully aware of the controversy Gilliam created by agreeing to enroll them.\n\nIt was a bold stance. Gilliam lost a lot of her white students, and ultimately her downtown studio.\n\nLooking back, Richardson said she and her classmates were unaware of the controversy Gilliam provoked by welcoming them into her studio. They were younger than 10 at the time and would learn more about race relations when the city integrated public schools.\n\n“I just think we didn’t realize at the time this woman was a civil rights activist. She was phenomenal. A single woman who risked her business to teach African American girls,” said Richardson.\n\nOne of those girls was Joyce Warner Tobias, Miss Black America 1971.\n\n“Miss Patsy contributed to her winning. Joyce used dance as her talent in the competition,” said Richardson.\n\nGilliam closed her School of Dance in the early 1970s, and worked as the superintendent at Lewis State Bank.\n\nAlexis Roberts McMillian was among the group of little girls who showed up at Gilliam’s studio in 1964.\n\n“I attribute my agility and movement – that is good for a pretty-plus senior citizen – to my ballet lessons,” said McMillian. “I stuck it out through the 11th grade as one of the last students she had until she stopped teaching. Those classes were finally desegregated ... We raise a glass of cheer to Helen Patsy Gilliam.”\n\nAlvan S. Harper (1847 - 1911)\n\nNorristown, Pennsylvania’s Alvan S. Harper studied photography in Philadelphia. A chance meeting with Tallahassee Judge J.T. Bernard at the 1876 Centennial may have led Alvan and Agnes Harper to move to Tallahassee where they set up a studio to take “artistic photographs.”\n\nHarper posed portraits with backdrops in his studio and photographed residences, buildings, farming, hunting, railway activity and political leaders.\n\nHis portfolio includes hundreds of views of late 19th century Tallahassee street scenes, and about 1,300 portraits of men, women, and children taken between 1884 and 1910.\n\nAlvan had a special interest in Tallahassee’s African American community. While Jim Crow was enforced, he portrayed Black people in a way that defied the legal restrictions they faced. The Museum of Florida selection of his photographs has been made into a traveling exhibition, and his quiet contributions to civil rights were recognized by the University of Florida, the NAACP, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n\nIn 2017, a “Trolley ride through Alvan S. Harper’s Tallahassee” was held at the Pensacola Museum of History.\n\n\"Some of Harper's best negatives were lost when his studio was torn down in the 1920s,\" according to a state archives report. \"The negatives had been given to a Tallahassee historian who, because they were dirty, left them on a porch where they were mistaken for trash and taken to the dump.\"\n\nAbout 2,000 Harper negatives were found, however, in 1946 in the attic of a house the Harpers owned. The negatives were turned over to the State Library.\n\nAlvan and his wife Agnes never had children. Both are buried in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence (1918 - 2013)\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence was the final principal for segregated Lincoln High School. Lawrence grew up on a farm near Old. St. Augustine Road and Chaires Crossroad. He and his brother would walk the seven miles to attend Lincoln High School as students.\n\nUpon graduation and service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Lawrence would teach in Live Oak and Quincy before returning to Tallahassee. In 1957, he was named principal of his alma mater and would keep his students focused on education during the turbulent 1960s. Lawrence encouraged both academic and vocational students to pursue the highest level of education. He was Lincoln’s principal until the school closed in 1967.\n\nDuring his 25 and more years as a principal at “Black” elementary, junior high and high schools, Lawrence advocated and promoted a higher level of service and financial commitment for the education of Black children.\n\nAdditionally, he assumed responsibility for his teachers, encouraging them to pursue graduate degrees and to this end, made promotions into leadership positions in the Leon County School System possible.\n\nMany attributed Lawrence’s ability to create alliances and negotiate helped make Leon County’s transition to integrated schools look effortless while integration elsewhere came under duress and sometimes violence.\n\nAfter integration, Lawrence became principal of the newly created Lincoln-Griffin High School. He later moved on to Nims Middle School, before retiring in 1978,\n\nIn 1996, he received a Florida A&M University’s Distinguished Alumni Award, and in 2012 the Tallahassee Urban League bestowed its Legend Award to Freeman D. Lawrence.\n\nHe was remembered in his obituary as \"one of God's best servants.\"\n\n\"I once bought a three-piece suit just so I could look like Mr. Lawrence,\" then Sen. Bill Montford said at his funeral. \"In education, we as a state are always looking for the answer. I would suggest to you, we had the answer at the original Lincoln.\"\n\nMargaret Leonard (1942 - 2022)\n\nJournalism and justice inspired Margaret Leonard.\n\nRaised in Macon and Atlanta by parents who were reporters, Leonard would report for the Chattanooga Times, Miami Herald, and the St. Petersburg Times before she joined the Tallahassee Democrat as a government reporter in the 1980s.\n\nBefore making Tallahassee home, Leonard made history in 1960 as a Tulane University student when she became the “first unmistakably Southern white student\" to join the Freedom Riders to register Black people to vote in Mississippi.\n\nA teenage Leonard was repeatedly arrested as the Freedom Riders registered voters. She was jailed and spent time in the notorious Parchman Prison.\n\nLeonard told an oral history project in 2001 the experience traumatized her and inspired her journalism.\n\n“I wrote a lot about prisons, power stuff,” she said. “That was the question that I was interested in my whole life: What do people do when they have power, and what do you do about it if you don’t have it?”\n\nLeonard was open and frank in discussions with friends. As an editor, her comments were pointed but softened by a lilting Georgia accent.\n\nLate in life, after suffering a brain aneurysm, Leonard carried a dictionary to help her reprogram her brain with words she needed to keep her job.\n\nLeonard had an aversion to the limelight and praise for her work. Before she died, she asked her obituary not to begin with her role as a Freedom Rider.\n\nWhen she passed her family asked in lieu of flowers for contributions to the Equal Justice Initiative.\n\n“We’ve come a long way, but we ain’t through,“ Leonard reflected in 2012, in an article recognizing her wor\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadell (1875 - 1963)\n\nThe roots of Tall Timbers, the research station & land conservancy north of Tallahassee, were nourished by a passion for quail hunting.\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadel of Staten Island, New York, first came to Leon County in 1894 with his father to shoot quail, such as the bobwhite, the number one game bird of the South.\n\nHis uncle, Edward, had purchased a 2,200-acre quail hunting plantation known as Hickory Hill that sat on the north shore of Lake Iamonia. Henry would visit every winter and when Edward passed away in 1919, he inherited the property and built a home he named Tall Timbers.\n\nBeadel then devoted much of his time to scientific wildlife research. And in 1926, he began experimenting with controlled burns to study fire's effect on wildlife and plants.\n\nSix years later, he organized the Cooperative Quail Study Association, made up of 21 owners of quail lands in the Tallahassee-Thomasville-Albany area.\n\nAnd in 1958, Beadel founded the Tall Timbers research station with a mission to study game birds, fire and plant ecology, wildlife, and land conservation among other things.\n\nWhen Gov. Farris Bryan presented Beadel with a plague in 1961 to recognize his contributions to wildlife research, the Tallahassee Democrat observed Beadel possessed an “outstanding color motion film libraries on quail and wildlife in the Southeast.”\n\nToday, the Tall Timbers research station holds 158,000 acres in conservation easements.\n\nJames Cullen Lawrence (1932 - 2024)\n\nJames Cullen “J.C.” Lawrence grew up in the Allen subdivision, a neighborhood north of Florida A&M University. The family home was on Canal Street, now part of FAMU Way, where the Anita Favors Lake and Plaza is today.\n\nCherry Lawrence, a younger sister, said the Bronough Street bridge runs right through her childhood bedroom.\n\nJC was known as “Cowboy” while growing up. He starred in basketball at FAMU High, earned a master’s degree in education at FAMU and when he returned after serving in the U.S. Army, he became a role model for the Allen neighborhood kids.\n\nIn 1959, James Cullen Lawrence was named the first Black supervisor over the City of Tallahassee playgrounds and parks. He was put in charge of two recreation centers and the Jake Gaither Golf Course as well.\n\n“It was huge for a Black man to be named manager of a golf course in Tallahassee. That kind of opportunity did not come easy for Black folks,” said Deloris Harpool, who was a teenager and neighbor at the time.\n\n“His appointment was uplifting. It made us feel like we had a chance,” said Harpool.\n\nLawrence was an all-around volunteer. He initiated the first Black Pee Wee Football League of Tallahassee, coordinated the Jake Gaither Alumni Golf Association, and served as treasurer of the Tallahassee branch of the NAACP.\n\nAt the recreational centers, Harpool and Cherry said he “molded the maturity” of a younger generation.\n\nCherry said JC played the role of “a real big brother” for many. He modeled a standard of behavior that demonstrated respect for others. And he expected his young charges to follow his lead when it came to the rules governing playgrounds, rec centers, and golf courses.\n\n“Although he knew us as kids (from Canal St.), he was pretty strict about that. At the dances we attended, skating activities, and basketball games held there, we were all well behaved. He was someone that we really did look up to and we obeyed,” said Cherry.\n\nDelores said JC received the same level of respect given the principal at school.\n\nIn 2002, the previous Dade Street Recreation Center was renamed the Lawrence-Gregory Community Center to honor James C. Lawrence, retired Recreation Superintendent and Beulah Gregory, Supervisor of the Tallahassee Dade Street facility\n\nWilliam May Walker (1905 - 1974)\n\nThe Honorable W. May Walker was a Crawfordville native who practiced law in Tallahassee and became known as the hardest working judge in Florida.\n\nWalker served as a county judge from 1932 to 1940 and then as a Circuit Court judge until his death in 1974.\n\nTallahasseans of his era remember Judge Walker for ending Miami Sen. Lee Weisenborn’s efforts to move the state capital away from Tallahassee.\n\nFor three years, Weisenborn and allies filed challenges to a bond issue to raise the money to build a new state Capitol complex downtown.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs lost an appeal to the Supreme Court in 1968, Walker issued an injunction against any further challenges, telling Weisenborn anymore lawsuits would be “for what purpose I do not know.”\n\nAnother famous case involved a 1959 sexual assault of a FAMU student by four white defendants. At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Walker denied defense counsel’s motion for acquittal and sentenced all four defendants to life at the Florida State Prison in Raiford.\n\nAt his passing, former Leon County Judge Charles McClure recalled Walker had a talent to get to the crux of a case. McClure said “it seemed as if he could always come up with the right decision. It was second nature to him, and things would very logically fall into place.”\n\nThe 2nd Judicial Circuit Historical Society records Judge Walker as one of the most distinguished jurists ever to serve the state.\n\nGeorge Langford (1923 - 2019)\n\nGeorge Langford, founder of the Municipal Code Corporation, was the 1989 Florida Entrepreneur of the Year. The visionary publisher is also remembered as the father of the Seminole Boosters.\n\nLangford was a World War II veteran and University of Virginia Law graduate. He came to Tallahassee in 1951 with an idea: Codify the regulations of cities and towns, and publish them in books that are called the city codes.\n\nHaving all a city’s ordinances at one’s fingertips in a book turned out to be a hugely successful idea. Langford’s Municipal Code Corporation became a multi-million-dollar enterprise with a 40,000-square-foot printing press near the airport.\n\nThen in the mid-1970s a financial crisis threatened the Florida State University football team. The athletic department was $600,000 in debt and school president Stanley Marshall said if money was not found cuts would be made.\n\nA call was placed to Langford for help. All people can recall is he was “recruited.” In any event, he is credited with resurrecting the Seminole Boosters, which wiped out the debt.\n\nHe would lead the Boosters for three years – a defining moment for FSU athletics that included the hiring of Bobby Bowden as the head football coach.\n\n“The decision to recruit George Langford ... was one of the most important events that has occurred in our 64-year history,” said then Seminole Boosters President Andy Miller when Langford passed.\n\nLangford held a permanent seat on the FSU Foundation Board of Trustees, chaired FSU’s first Capital Campaign, was a founder of Springtime Tallahassee, and involved in dozens of civic organizations.\n\nHe raised money for MaClay School, Tall Timbers, the Monticello Opera House, Springtime Tallahassee, The Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce, the United Way, St. John’s Episcopal Church and St. Peter’s Anglican Church.\n\nThe George and Marian Langford $1 million endowment to FSU’s Department of Classics came about after Langford asked then-president Sandy D'Alemberte which department never had received a financial gift.\n\nLangford was recognized for his unwavering commitment and dedication to FSU in 2000 when the Boosters named a grassy area outside Doak Campbell Stadium where fans and vendors gather The Langford Green.\n\nNic Gavalas (1922 - 2014)\n\nTwenty-eight-year-old Nicholas George Gavalas arrived in Tallahassee after World War II and became a founding member of several civic-minded organizations and created the iconic Florida tie.\n\nThe son of a master tailor, Gavalas and his wife Janet opened Nic’s Toggery downtown at Monroe Street and Pensacola Street.\n\nThe store catered to college students and turned into a college hangout. Nic was warm and engaging with customers. He carried the latest fashions. The store quickly joined the ranks of Esquire Magazine’s Top 100 Men’s Store in the United States.\n\n“It was a gathering spot,\" former FSU football player Ron Schomburger, told Tallahassee Democrat’s Gerald Ensley when Gavalas died.\n\n“We’d go in to look at the clothes but have a good conversation with him and his employees. It was like talking to an old friend,” said Schomburger, about Nic.\n\n“To my generation, Nic was a legend,” said ESPN broadcaster Lee Corso, a former Seminole quarterback. “He was like a father figure to me.”\n\nA founding member of Seminole Boosters, Nic designed a Sammy Seminole tie to promote Florida State University athletics.\n\nBut it was his Florida tie that features an outline of the state that became ubiquitous, especially when the Legislature was in town. Former U.S. Senator and Gov. Bob Graham claimed to have worn one for more than 20 years.\n\nNic Gavalas’ legacy continues with Nic’s Toggery, the Official Clothier of the Florida State Seminoles, and with two stores, one downtown and a second one in north Tallahassee.\n\nWilmoth H. and Kathleen Baker (1928 - 2006 and 1929 - 2007)\n\nWhen Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker opened Baker’s Pharmacy in 1958 only one other pharmacy in town would hire a Black pharmacist and there were only certain stores where Black people could shop.\n\nKathleen had a pharmacy degree from Xavier University, and she convinced her husband Wilmoth to pursue one at Florida A&M University where she taught.\n\nThe couple then decide to open a pharmacy in a duplex where Wilmoth’s father had a practice. Sort of a one-stop medical facility for a segregated community.\n\nMoney was tight. When the couple opened their store in August 1958 on South Adams Street, the shelves were stocked with only one of each item – because that was all the Bakers could afford.\n\nWilmoth and Kathleen worked 12-hours a day, seven-days a week to make the pharmacy what former FAMU interim-President Henry Lewis III would call a “beacon of light for this community.”\n\nIt was eclectic. The Bakers sold medicine and almost everything else – from sewing thread to birthday and Christmas gifts.\n\nThe counter at their soda fountain drew college students, professionals, the elderly and unemployed. There they swapped news, traded gossip, and sold tickets to social events.\n\nBaker’s Pharmacy was also the internship training ground for nearly 200 FAMU pharmacy students, including Lewis, who would go on to become a Leon County Commissioner, Dean of the College of Pharmacy and a FAMU interim president.\n\nThe pharmacy closed in 2002. Here is an excerpt from a letter to the editor Lewis sent to the Tallahassee Democrat at the time.\n\n“Baker’s Pharmacy was a safe and clean place to take your girlfriend. It was a place where health care was a fundamental right, regardless of your ability to pay. Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker were mother and father away from home for hundreds of FAMU students in their quest for a college degree. The Bakers were a shining example of how a married couple should be and how to raise a family.”\n\nPaul Dirac (1902 - 1984)\n\nPaul Dirac may be the most distinguished Tallahassean ever.\n\nThe 1975 Compton Encyclopedia Yearbook declared him an equal to Sir Isacc Newton and Albert Einstein.\n\nEinstein once said about a Dirac paper, “this balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.”\n\nDirac won the 1933 Nobel Prize in physics for his Relativistic Wave Equation. He anticipated the string theory in 1962 with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and the Dirac membrane.\n\nTheoretical physicist Stephen Hawking said Dirac “changed our picture of the universe.”\n\nIt was a twist of fate, and lakes, that made him a Tallahasseean.\n\nDirac held the Lucasian Chair in Mathematics at Cambridge University in England – Newton was the first to hold the chair. As Dirac was approaching the mandatory retirement age of 70, FSU offered him a visiting professorship.\n\nIt was 1969. He liked the place. Became a familiar face at seafood restaurants. Would walk to work. Was often spotted swimming at Silver Lake and Lost Lake.\n\nDirac didn’t want to retire so he said goodbye Cambridge, hello Florida. He joined the FSU faculty full time in 1971.\n\n“FSU has a good physics department,” said Dirac when asked why he was here.\n\n“Here I escape the harsh winters of the North. I like swimming in the lakes, rivers, sinkholes and the sea. There are lots of swimming opportunities around Tallahassee. To some extent that is what brought me here.”\n\nDirac received many honors, including the Royal Medal, the Copley Medal, the Max Planck Medal and the inaugural J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize. He once turned down a knighthood because he did not want to be addressed by his first name but later consented and became a member of the Order of Merit in 1973.\n\nPaul Dirac passed away in Tallahassee and was buried at Roselawn Cemetery. His papers are held at the Paul A.M. Dirac Science Library at Florida State University. The street in Innovation Park where the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is located is named Paul Dirac Drive in his honor.\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos (1907 - 1977)\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos is the mother of Vo-Tech education in Leon County.\n\nWhen she was named principal of the Lively Continuation School in 1935, the Vienna, Ga., native was one of just two female vocational school directors in the country.\n\nCsikos would travel throughout Florida to construct a bureaucratic infrastructure for vocational education and became a stalwart lobbyist for job training in the Legislature.\n\nCsikos was born in 1907 and moved to Tallahassee eight years later. She graduated from Leon High School in 1926.\n\nShe was one of two teachers hired by Lewis M. Lively in 1931, one of two for 52 students at his school who trained office skills to students not college bound. She taught shorthand and typing.\n\nEvelyn also worked as a stenographer for the Legislature. When she was named director of what would become Lively, World War II was on the horizon and she would change the focus of vocational education.\n\nNorth Florida became a hub of activity for wartime preparation. Aircraft mechanics would join shorthand and accounting in the Lively curriculum, along with the operation of new technology like mimeographing.\n\nCsikos embraced the change and wangled millions of dollars from the federal and state governments to fund vocational and technical education for students not bound for college but wanting skills to earn a living.\n\nUpon her retirement in 1973, Csikos predicted the future of vocational education would be in middle and high schools because she said many college graduates “are learning a college diploma alone won’t get them a job.”\n\nIn retirement, Csikos developed the curriculum for the Pat Thomas Law Enforcement Program.\n\nCsikos died at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital while recovering from a heart attack in 1977.\n\nRear Admiral David Betton Macomb (1827 - 1911)\n\nDavid Macomb was the youngest son of David Macomb Sr., and Mary Tiffin Worthington. Mary’s father was the governor of Ohio, and her family opposed the marriage.\n\nThe couple moved to Tallahassee in 1824. They settled along Lake Iamonia, and had five children, David B. the youngest.\n\nThe senior Macomb gained notoriety for a duel with Prince Murat, shooting off Murat’s little finger. He then moved the family to Texas. Tuberculosis claimed Mary and the senior Macomb ended his life by slashing his throat a few months later.\n\nAt age 9, David and his siblings were left orphaned, and raised by family in Ohio.\n\nWhen he was 22, David was appointed a third assistant engineer in the U.S. Navy and explored the North Pacific and the Sea of Japan. When the Civil War broke out, Macomb would be aboard one of the first Union vessels to enter the conflict, and at war’s end he was on the ship that fired the final shots.\n\nHe also distinguished himself as an inventor.\n\nMacomb was the chief engineer of the USS Niagara in April 1861 when it became the first U.S. Navy ship to form up the blockade of Charleston. Niagara would later participate in the bombardment of the Pensacola Naval Yard.\n\nHe returned to Charleston in 1865 aboard the USS Canonicus, which fired the final shot as the rebels retreated to Sullivan’s Island as the South surrendered.\n\nThe Canonicus was then sent in pursuit of a Confederate ironclad, the chase took the Canonicus to Havana where she became the first American ironclad to enter a foreign port.\n\nAmong the inventions Macomb contributed to the U.S. Navy were a hydraulic lift used aboard ironclads, and he made and installed the first fresh-water maker used on a U.S. Navy vessel.\n\nMacomb retired February 27, 1889, with the rank of commodore. He was later promoted to rear admiral.\n\nA street in the Frenchtown neighborhood, and the destroyer the USS Macomb – known as the Mighty Mac by its crew – are named in honor of Rear Admiral Macomb.\n\nDr. Kamal Abdou Yousef, aka King Love (1936 - 1999)\n\nKing Love was someone no one understood but everyone talked about. He reigned in Tallahassee for six years.\n\nKing Love was the creation of Kamal Abdou Youssef. A child prodigy pianist who played for the King of Egypt at the Cairo Opera House in 1949, Yousef graduated from medical school in 1956, moved to New York City in 1969, and then West Palm in 1977.\n\nYoussef, a pathologist, established a successful practice.\n\nPeople say Youssef changed when the first Gulf War started in 1991. He became involved with an anti-war group, was diagnosed with manic depression and then became estranged from his family.\n\nThat’s when King Love came to be, a man with a white beard, a golden crown and a red cape holding a megaphone, and waving signs at intersections around town.\n\nOne would find the King at the corner of Tennessee and Monroe streets during the morning commute and at Apalachee Parkway and Magnolia Street in the afternoon. An electronic megaphone amplified shouts of “Yip, Yip, Yip,\" as he skipped through the crosswalk with signs that promoted love, denounced God, and one adorned with photos of JFK and Princess Diana that encouraged people to “Return to Camelot.”\n\n“I think it was the Gulf War that pushed him over the edge. Before that, he was a normal, very loving person,” his son Anwar told a Tallahassee Democrat reporter who tracked down the family after Yousef’s passing.\n\n“It was like his heart was being torn out. We lost all contact with him after the Gulf War,” said Anwar. “It was all quite sudden.”\n\nKing Love arrived in Tallahassee around 1993 and endeared himself to Tallahasseeans.\n\nTallahassee Police arrested him several times on petty theft, trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. Two college students who took him in briefly said Yousef was knowledgeable, a good conversationalist, but could become agitated and erratic.\n\nYousef’s Florida arrest record dates to 1991. A FDLE report listed eight different spellings of his given name and listed his occupation simply as “King.”\n\nHe used his monthly social security checks to publish “love declarations.” They were a mix of brotherhood tinged with paranoia.\n\n“I realize that people have been cheated of real paradise on Earth,” the King told break magazine in 1995. “They have been cheated of their innocence, falsely convicted as sinners and their wages of sin is hell and everlasting fire and wailing and gnashing of teeth. For some, hell is here and now.”\n\nWhen his health began to decline and in his final year, Youseff gave up the King Love persona.\n\nHe shaved his beard, stopped wearing crowns and robes, and quit ranting about politicians. Kamal Abdu Yousef began attending Baptist Celebration Church, which invited an Egyptian priest when it held services for Yousef after he died alone in his apartment.\n\n“I wish to thank the people of Tallahassee from the depth of my heart. People here tolerated him and didn’t harm him. In other societies they would have clobbered him to death. I know it,\" said his brother Nagaui A. Michael, a retired New York City attorney, before the service.\n\n“If I could say one thing to him right now it would be I’m sorry. Because I did not believe in him. Fortunately, the people of Tallahassee did.”\n\nFred Mahan (1886 - 1960)\n\nOn the east side of town where Hillcrest Avenue meets U.S. 90 there’s a 76-year-old marker that designates the highway from Tallahassee to Monticello as Fred Mahan Drive.\n\nFred Mahan was a horticulturist from Dodge City, Kansas, who had a passion for highway beautification.\n\nHe also created the Mahan Pecan, a pecan with a bigger nut and lighter shell, at his Monticello nursery.\n\nIn the 1920s, he would own the second-largest pecan and ornamental shrubs business in the southeast.\n\nCoronet Magazine described him as a “strange philanthropist who bestows beauty instead of dollars\" while \"spreading scenic bounty across the state he loves.”\n\nAt the height of the Great Depression, Mahan donated thousands of plants to the county unemployment relief commissions for beautification projects to employ the jobless.\n\nWhen a road company got a contract to remove tree stubs and make other road improvements along U.S. 90 between Tallahassee and Monticello, he contributed thousands of crepe myrtles, camellias, ligustrum, palms, and Pyracanthas to landscape the roadway as part of the project – creating 45 additional jobs.\n\nThe 26-mile long project from the east side of Tallahassee to the Monticello courthouse would take 15 years to complete.\n\nWhen it was completed in 1948 and Mahan recognized with a marker then-state senator and future Gov. LeRoy Collins called Fred Mahan Drive “a corridor of goodwill\" that connects the two cities.\n\nIt is said during his life Fred Mahan donated nearly 400,000 trees, shrubs, and flowers, to schools, churches, cemeteries, hospitals, parks, squares, and public thoroughfares.\n\nCalvin Jones (1938 - 1998)\n\nCalvin Jones would say, “The dirt don’t lie.” Jones would know. He made some of the most important discoveries of ancient humans in Florida during a 30-year career at the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research.\n\nJones had an uncanny ability to look at a piece of land and predict whether artifacts would be found.\n\nWorking in advance of interstate construction near Tampa, Jones discovered the earliest tangible evidence of humans on the peninsula, dating to 12,000 years ago.\n\nAcross north Florida he uncovered a prehistoric site at Lake Lafayette, found the sites of nine Spanish era missions, and discovered the Apalachee burial mounds at Lake Jackson – which at the time was called the American pyramids.\n\nJones was a Texan, descendant of Creek and Cherokee natives.\n\n“I can’t talk mythology, but I know what's in the ground,” Jones told the Tallahassee Democrat’s Gerald Ensley in 1997.\n\nFor years on his morning commute to work Jones had eyed a hillside opposite the State Capitol, suspecting it had a story to tell.\n\nHe got permission to poke around in 1987 and made his most heralded discovery – the 1539-40 winter encampment of Hernando de Soto.\n\nJones unearthed pottery, coins, and chain mail, to link the land to De Soto’s expedition – the first verified DeSoto camp from his exploration of the continent.\n\n“You cannot disturb the earth without leaving imprints,” Jones said.\n\nDaniel Dale Green (1955 -2002)\n\nTallahassee Police Department Sergeant Daniel Dale Green was shot and killed in an ambush while responding to a home-invasion on Melody Circle.\n\nGreen was a 13-year veteran with TPD, having served as an expert sniper, trainer, field supervisor, and a K-9 patrol officer.\n\nAs he approached the scene, Green observed a suspicious car with its engine running. He called in the vehicle’s description and tag number. The dispatcher then heard gunshots.\n\nA second officer rushed to the scene; Green had been shot four times in the back of the head.\n\nThe suspect fled north, Green was rushed to the hospital, and law enforcement swarmed into the northwest sector where they sealed off Sharer Road near the Fun Station.\n\nGunfire was exchanged with the suspect who then surrendered.\n\nAt Tallahassee Memorial Hospital TPD officers, sheriff deputies, and Highway Patrol troopers stood watch. About 21 minutes after the suspect was taken into custody, Sgt. Dale Green’s death was announced.\n\nGreen left behind a wife and three children.\n\nA Tallahassee native, Green was remembered as a “lover of music, fishing, and camping.”\n\n“Everybody just loved him,” said then-city commissioner John Paul Bailey the night of the shooting.\n\nBailey, a retired police officer, had served with Green before Bailey's 1996 retirement.\n\nIn May 2014, Desoto Street was renamed Sgt. Dale Green Way\n\nJune Fouts Strauss (1930 - 2010)\n\nJune Fouts of Jacksonville arrived at the Florida State University campus in 1948 where she met Buddy Strauss, from a pioneer Tallahassee family.\n\nThe two married in 1950, raised six children, and June became Tallahassee’s volunteer extraordinaire.\n\nA 1998 Tallahassee Democrat profile concluded no one had done as much to promote art and theater in Tallahassee or help as many abused children get a new start than June Fouts Strauss.\n\nBusinessman Mark Goldman said a photograph of Strauss should be listed in the dictionary with the definition for “superlative.”\n\n“And I’m not prone to superlatives,” Goldman told the Democrat’s Dorothy Clifford.\n\nStrauss served as a homeroom mother at Blessed Sacrament School (now Trinity Catholic) for 17 consecutive years (1957 – 1975).\n\nAnd she helped organize iconic Tallahassee organizations and clubs. Strauss was a founding member of the boards for the LeMoyne Art Foundation, the Southern Shakespeare Festival, Florida State University School of Theatre’s Patrons Association, and the Governor’s Club.\n\nIn 1985, she established the first Boys Town USA campus outside of Omaha, Nebraska, where the 106-year-old residential care facility for youths was founded. She would serve on the organization’s National Board of Trustees for six years.\n\nIn 1986, Strauss played a key role in raising money to create the Tree House emergency shelter for abused and neglected children.\n\nStrauss was the Tallahassee Democrat Volunteer of the Year for the Arts in 1980 and the Department of Children and Families nominee for the social services Volunteer of the Year in 1998.\n\nShe deflected any credit for accomplishments sent her way, saying the accolades belong to others.\n\n“I'm a facilitator - someone else had the original idea,\" Strauss said.\n\nThe second Tree House site, established in 1989 is named the “June Strauss Tree House.”\n\nDr. Eva Wanton (1935 - 2014)\n\nIn remote west Africa you will find a library named for a Tallahassee language professor.\n\nDr. Eva Wanton of Thunderbolt, Ga., accepted a one-year appointment as a Florida A&M University foreign language teacher in 1964 and then decided to make Tallahassee home.\n\nAt FAMU she would go on to become a full professor, a dean, an associate vice president, and a special assistant to interim president Castell Bryant.\n\nShe described her relationship with the school to Tallahassee Democrat columnist Gerald Ensley as a “love obsession.”\n\nStudents loved her back.\n\nIn 1997 when a university reorganization plan eliminated Wanton’s position, they launched a petition drive and held rallies on her behalf. Wanton was promoted to Vice President of Academic Affairs.\n\n\"I was kind of in awe of her brilliance,\" Eddie Jackson, the late FAMU communications director, said at her passing.\n\n\"Her control and mastery of English was so great and so graceful. It was a joy to hear her speak. Whenever I saw she was going to speak (at an event), I knew I was in for a treat.”\n\nWanton loved to travel. One trip took her to Ghana where she came across a village where animals and children shared the same water supply.\n\nBack home she told her church what she had seen. The Africare Ministry at Bethel Missionary Baptist Church dug the village a well and adopted their school.\n\nIf you go to Mampong, Ghana and stop at the Bong Rong School you can visit the Dr. Eva C. Wanton Library and Computer Laboratory.\n\nIt was dedicated in 2017 to the professor who connected the village to a Tallahassee church that helped raise the money to build, equip and staff the school.\n\nJudge Joseph Woodrow Hatchett (1933 - 2021)\n\nJoseph Woodrow Hatchett of Daytona Beach came to Tallahassee to study at Florida A&M University and became a man of many firsts.\n\nHatchett was the first Black Florida Supreme Court Justice, the first and only Black man to win a statewide election, and the first Black federal appeals court judge in what was once the Confederacy.\n\nHe accomplished this after Jim Crow prevented him from having lunch or staying overnight in the hotel where the Florida Bar examination was administered.\n\nHatchett passed the bar and today the federal courthouse in Tallahassee is named in his honor.\n\nA FAMU and Howard law school graduate, Hatchett was remembered by former clerks, and colleagues as a jurist who never lost faith in law as an instrument of justice.\n\nA former clerk said in Hatchett’s 600 opinions you find a deep compassion for protecting the rights of people, especially the oppressed.\n\nGov. Reubin Askew appointed Hatchett to serve on the Florida Supreme Court in 1975. The next year he stood for reelection and became the first Black man since Reconstruction to win a statewide election in the South, and remains the only Floridian to do so.\n\n“I wonder if Judge Hatchett could have imagined ..., the United States Courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida’s Capitol, just blocks from his alma mater, would be named the Joseph Woodrow Hatchett U.S. Courthouse and Federal Building,” former Hatchett clerk and now Eleventh Circuit Judge Charles R. Wilson said at the courthouse designation ceremony in 2023.\n\nRomulus Thompson (1906 - 1996)\n\nAfter Leon schools decided to form a Leon High School Redcoats Marching Band in 1939 a statewide search found Romulus Thompson, the Crestview High School band director and a former assistant director at DeFuniak Spring schools.\n\nThe 34-year-old Thompson moved to Tallahassee, rallied the community to help outfit the unit and recruited 89 \"students interested in learning how to play band instruments.\"\n\nThomas designed the Redcoats uniform in the style of the West Point Military Academy, substituting a rich red for West Point gray – and placed an order with the Fitchheimer Company, West Point’s supplier.\n\nDuring the 1940s, under Thomas’ direction, the Leon High School Marching Redcoats became one of the highest rated and most well-traveled bands in the state.\n\n“Of course, we had the finest students you ever saw, absolutely outstanding. There was no reason it couldn’t be a great success,” Thompson said at the 50th reunion/anniversary of Leon’s first band.\n\nThompson's leadership style, enthusiasm, and success both in Crestview and Tallahassee drew comparisons to Professor Harold Hill from the musical “The Music Man.”\n\nAt both locales, he had a band ready to march in parades and entertain at halftime of football games.\n\nThe Redcoats performance at the Northwest Florida Music Festival in the mid-1940s led a judge from Northwestern University to proclaim “I have never seen a more ingeniously planned performance on the field. This performance would be a sensation at any contest in the United States.\"\n\nThompson stayed at Leon until 1950 when he accepted the band director position for Jefferson County High.\n\nIn 2000, the state honored Thompson as a Great Floridian and installed a plaque at Leon High School at Meridian Road.\n\nLydia Smith (circa 1820- 1885)\n\nLydia Stout was the free, well-educated mulatto cousin of George Proctor son of Antonio, a scout on the mission to find a location for a state Capitol. Sometime in the 1840s, George persuaded Lydia to leave the Bahamas and come to Tallahassee and be the governess for six children.\n\nJohn Proctor told the Federal Writers’ project his father George set off to California to look for gold and Lydia apparently came to town to help his mom Nancy.\n\nOnce here Lydia would marry the Rev. James Smith.\n\nLydia and James would embark on careers in teaching; they opened two schools. And the couple did missionary work through the Methodist Church in post-war Tallahassee.\n\nHistorian Lee Warner in \"Free Men in the Age of Servitude,\" a three-generation account of the Proctor family, finds an 1850s Floridian editorial by Charles Dykes that praised Lydia's teaching skills and called on the community to encourage this “well-known colored lady” in her church work.\n\nWarner is convinced that Lydia also was the subject of a Freedmen’s Bureau inspector’s 1865 report from Tallahassee that described a school of “interesting girls” with a “mulatto woman of education,” who announced she intended “to make ladies of these girls.”\n\nThe Smiths would open a school known as The Academy in post-war Tallahassee with about 100 students.\n\nTheir last known residence was 314 West Park Avenue.\n\nBill Peterson (1920 - 1993)\n\nA Toronto, Ohio native, Bill Peterson coached FSU football from 1960 through 1970. He inherited a club that went 4 – 6 before his arrival and 3-6-1 in his first season.\n\nPeterson then introduced the country to FSU football. He recorded the program's first victory over the University of Florida in 1964, beat an until-then-undefeated and top-ranked Kentucky, and had a breakthrough season in 1967 for a football program that began playing in 1948.\n\nThe Seminoles went 7-2-2 that year with stunning performances against Joe Paterno's Penn State University and blue-blood programs like Texas A&M, and the University of Florida – again.\n\nBefore the largest television audience the team had ever performed, the Seminoles fought the Nittany Lions to a 17 – 17 tie in the Gator Bowl.\n\nSeminole faithful say that day on Dec. 30, 1967, FSU, the football team and the university, landed on the national stage.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers offered Peterson a job.\n\nHe turned down the NFL, telling the Tallahassee Democrat his family liked Tallahassee and it was a good place to bring up children.\n\n“I’m going to stay right here and work toward one more objective – a national championship for FSU,” Peterson said.\n\nThe newspaper responded with an editorial that “Coach Pete already is number one in the eyes of Tallahassee.\"\n\nWill Peterson, a grandson, said the coach uncharacteristically clipped and saved the piece.\n\nHe also signed FSU's first Black football player. He hired Bobby Bowden as an assistant, he introduced a pro-type passing game to college football, and he posted a 60% winning percentage.\n\nTwelve of his former assistants went on to become head coaches, including Super Bowl winners Joe Gibbs, and Bill Parcells – and two-time NCAA National Championship coach Bobby Bowden.\n\nAnd there are the Petersonisms that delighted Tallahassee.\n\nOne day he told his players “to line up alphabetically by height” for photos. Another time he announced to friends that, “The greatest thing just happened. I got indicted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame.”\n\nPeterson's relationship with the city was such that when Will did a search of the Tallahassee Democrat 1960 archives Coach Bill Peterson was mentioned more times than governors Claude Kirk, Leroy Collins, and Farris Bryant.\n\nAt his passing, legendary sportswriter Steve Ellis wrote Peterson is “one of the single most significant contributors to the success of Florida State Athletics.”\n\nSharyn Heiland Shields (1946 - 2023)\n\nAtlantic City native Sharyn Shields earned a Master of Arts in dance at Florida State University. She met her husband John, taught at Tallahassee Community College, the University of Florida and Hunter’s College in New York, and then returned to Tallahassee where she became a fervent scholar of archaeology.\n\nShields worked as a Historic Preservation Grants supervisor for the state of Florida, and as an exhibit manager for the Institute of World War II in the FSU history department.\n\nWhile a FSU masters student, Shields began to research Benjamin Chaires' Verdura plantation, which was in east Leon County. Her thesis provided the first historical overview of the three-story, 15-room, 10 column mansion that sat on a 9,000 acres farm maintained by 300 enslaved people.\n\nThe thesis led to \"Whispers from Verdura: The Lost Legacy of Benjamin Chaires,\" published in 2015.\n\nChaires had brought the railroad to Tallahassee, established the city’s first bank, and was a delegate to the Florida Constitution Convention. He died in 1838.\n\nAfter the Civil War, through mismanagement and family scandal his heirs lost the plantation. The mansion burned in the 1880s; only rubble and a couple of columns remain today, along with Shields' account.\n\nTallahassee Community College history professor Bob Holladay said 20 years of research enabled Shields to illustrate “the grandeur of the Old South, the horror of slavery that accompanied it, and the ultimate tragedy of hubris that befell it.”\n\nNathaniel (1932 – 2000) and Julian “Cannonball” Adderley (1928 - 1975)\n\nJulian Edwin Adderley and older brother Nathaniel Carlyle were the sons of Florida A&M University professors who grew up to be Florida’s music ambassadors to the world. In middle school, Nat and Julian played for what would become the FAMU Marching 100, and in high school they jammed with Ray Charles in Tallahassee night clubs.\n\nAfter college and military service the brothers moved on to New York City in the 1950s and became international jazz legends.\n\nTrumpeter Nat joined the Woody Herman sextet, Julian, a saxophonist known as “Cannonball,” landed with the Miles Davis sextet.\n\nThe two also formed The Cannonball Adderley Quintet, and in 1960 scored a national hit with the “Work Song,” inspired by a chain gang at work on Tallahassee’s Pensacola Street.\n\n“They used convict labor to pave the street. The convicts used that call-and-response method to sing as they worked,” recalled Adderley in a 1994 AP interview about the lyrical playfulness he fused with soul, jazz, funk and blues in what became his biggest hit and a jazz standard.\n\nCompeting amidst a British invasion of American popular music in the mid-1960s, Cannonball topped the jazz, R&B, and pop charts in 1966 with “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.”\n\nWhen a stroke claimed Cannonball a month before his 47th birthday, Gov. Reuben Askew declared September 15, 1975, Julian “Cannonball’ Adderley Day across the state of Florida.\n\nNat died in 2000 of complications from diabetes. He was 68.\n\nHit parade:A roll call of some of the musical artists who hit the big time with Tallahassee ties | TLH 200\n\nBoth are buried in the Southside Cemetery in Tallahassee.\n\nThe Adderley Amphitheater at Cascades Park and the music institute at FAMU is named in their honor.\n\nJean McCully (1930 - 2014)\n\nA Sparta, Tenn., nurse met an internist at a Memphis hospital in 1961, they married and moved to Tallahassee. Al McCully would be the third urologist to open a practice in the city, while Jean is remembered as a volunteer extraordinaire – Tallahassee’s “can-do woman.”\n\nShe raised money for the Girl Scouts’ overnight camp. Served on the Boys and Girls Club of the Big Bend, The Girl Scouts, and the James Madison Institute. Was president of the Garden Club.\n\nShe also was an original volunteer with the Red Hills Horse Trials. Jean cooked breakfast for the judges and then led botanical tours of the grounds.\n\nMcCully joined Friends of the Library when the library was housed in a former Elks Club and promoted construction of the block-sized downtown facility and its six branches\n\nIn 1983, Jean McCully successfully lobbied the director of Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare to bring hospice under the hospital umbrella. In a single day, she raised $60,000 to bring ballet superstar Mikhail Baryshnikov to Tallahassee for a performance to benefit the program.\n\n“It’s not like she would strut on stage. You never knew she was involved,” recalled Marjorie Turnbull at McCulley’s passing.\n\n“You had to ask, ‘Jean, did you do that?’”\n\nThe Jean McCully Family House at the Big Bend Hospice campus on Mahan Drive recognizes her work for the community.\n\nRomero Mitchel Sealey (1889 - 1928)\n\nR.M. Sealey arrived in Tallahassee from Fort Myers in 1916 to become principal of Leon High School and over the next 12 years would shape the course of Florida public education for much of the 20th century.\n\n“Few men have had such an overwhelming and beneficial impact on a city [Tallahassee] in such a short amount of time,” Florida State College of Women President Edward Conradi wrote upon Sealey’s death in 1928. “His accomplishments as both a leader and a friend are truly unparalleled.”\n\nIn Fort Myers, Sealey led the Gwynne Institute and had solicited Thomas Edison and Henry Ford as supporters to build that city’s first high school. He continued to promote public education in Tallahassee as the Superintendent of Leon County Schools and then the state Superintendent of High Schools, where he standardized high school curriculums and testing requirements.\n\nSealey also established the Florida Education Association and organized Tallahassee’s first Boy Scout Troop.\n\nWhile enroute to the National Education Association convention in Boston in 1928, the 39-year-old Sealey suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in Washington, D.C.\n\n“Although he was a man among men. He was never too busy to talk to a boy or girl about concerns and to provide the advice and encouragement to help them achieve their goals,” said Bunyan Stephens, pastor of the First Baptist Church.\n\nThe entire student body of Leon High School attended the service and burial at Oakland Cemetery. The Tallahassee Dailey Democrat described the funeral as one of the largest in city history.\n\nSealey Elementary School on Allen Road is named in his honor.\n\nJohn McIver (circa 1800)\n\nOn April 9, 1824, John McIver led the first group of white settlers to Tallahassee. A horse-drawn wagon from North Carolina carried seven pioneers; two white men, two women, two children, and a mulatto man on a mission to build a log cabin to serve as a capitol building for the new Florida territory.\n\nThe group pitched a camp on a hillside south of the present-day intersection of Apalachee Parkway and North Monroe Street. Tallahassee Democrat columnist Gerald Ensley speculated it was probably located along present-day Gaines Street.\n\nReplica in the works:City to recreate first Capitol – a log cabin – for bicentennial celebration this year\n\nTLH 200:Cascades bicentennial journey: Waterfall to baseball field to brownfield to pinnacle park\n\nMcIver said the site was on a southern slope overlooking what could very well be a picture book fairyland.\n\n“To the southward and westward, the country opened to view like a magnificent park, gently undulated and studded with beautiful basins of limpid water, at their feet a crystal fountain gushing from the declivity of the hill; to the eastward the view was more confined by the thick foliage of the undergrowth which served to screen the view through not the sound, of a beautiful cascade,” he wrote in the “Memorial of John McIver of the City of Tallahassee.\"\n\nThe group cleared a site on top of the hill, two Gadsden County planters sent slaves to help build a cabin and two annexes. The work was completed in time to accommodate the Legislature’s first Tallahassee session that November, and within a year more than 50 homes and two hotels were constructed.\n\nMcIver would stay in town. He would become the first Territorial Clerk of the City of Tallahassee and the auctioneer for the sale of the first house lots sold.\n\nLucille Baldwin Holliday Brown (1922 - 2019)\n\nBorn and raised in the historic Smokey Hollow neighborhood, Brown is remembered as someone who loved history, books, and laughter. Brown worked as a librarian in Leon County Schools at Bond Elementary, Bellevue Middle School, and Griffin High School – and sold encyclopedias in her spare time.\n\nIn the 1940s, Brown and Gladys P. Anderson pushed to open the library at the then Black-segregated Lincoln High to the adult public. Principal Gilbert Porter explained to the Tallahassee Democrat that there was a “dearth” of reading material in Black households.\n\nIn addition to its collection of books the school library also had subscriptions to the Tallahassee Democrat, several Florida newspapers, the Atlanta Constitution, The Baltimore Afro-American, the Sunday New York Times, and the Christian Science Monitor.\n\nBrown worked for the county school district for 39 years and in the latter part of her career took a night job at the public library.\n\n“Back then, there was never an African American that had worked in a library,” recalled Riley Museum Founder Althemese Barnes at Brown’s passing. “So, we were happy to see her there.”\n\nBlanche \"Bunky\" Atkinson (1929 - 2022)\n\nBlanche Younis Atkinson was born in Tallahassee to Lebanese immigrant parents who ran a peanut/hamburger stand on Adams Street where the House Office Building stands now.\n\nShe was a registered nurse with the Leon County Health Department and married to Glenn F. Atkinson. They would have four daughters.\n\nBunky went to work for the county’s civil defense during the Cuban missile crisis and stayed with the agency as its mission shifted from war to peacetime concerns of natural disaster response and hazardous waste management.\n\nAtkinson was director of Civil Defense and Emergency Preparedness for Leon County in 1985 when Hurricane Kate roared through Tallahassee’s urban forest and paralyzed city roads with downed trees that left most of the city without electrical power.\n\nAtkinson wanted to impose a curfew until the roads were cleared, but state emergency management officials told her there were no procedures to do so.\n\nSo, she wrote an outline for how a community could require residents to remain indoors after the sunsets and presented it to County Commission Chairman Lee Vause and Tallahassee Mayor Hurley Rudd to sign.\n\n“She knows how to get things done. She’ll talk you out of an arm and a leg,” recalled former Tallahassee Police Chief Melvin Tucker at Atkinson’s retirement in 1987.\n\nA curfew was imposed from 7 p.m. Friday, Nov. 22, to 7 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 23, 1985. It allowed for only law enforcement, and road and utility workers to be outside.\n\nBy Saturday afternoon enough tree litter was cleared from the roads and electricity restored to lift the curfew.\n\n“I think it’s the only 24-hour period in Tallahassee history where there was not a single crime, not a single arrest. Everybody stayed home,” Atkinson told Tallahassee Democrat’s Gerald Ensley on the 25th anniversary of Kate.\n\nClyde Spencer (1916 - 2005)\n\nClyde Edward Spencer had a life-long love for trains. After he graduated from high school in New Smyrna Beach he got a job with the railroad, married Sara Lee Boynton, and moved to Tallahassee.\n\nSpencer was the railroad round-house foreman in charge of maintenance of all the locomotives that moved troops and supplies between Tallahassee and Fort Gordon Johnson during World War II.\n\nIn 1948 he left the railroad and with proceeds from a patent for a device that extracted gum turpentine out of wooden barrels. He then opened the Royal Sandwich Company.\n\nFrom a Gamble Street storefront, he catered to state office buildings and universities.\n\nSpencer deployed trucks and vending machines, supplying sandwiches, soda, and cigarettes to 125 locations across the city and at the airport in the 1950s.\n\nOnce Florida State University fielded a football team, Spencer, a founding member of the Seminole Boosters, would employ up to 150 teenagers a game to hawk Coca-Colas, hot dogs, and peanuts at Doak Campbell Stadium.\n\n“Why half the boys that have grown up in this town have worked for me out there. I’m proud when they tell me I gave them their first job,” Spencer told Tallahassee Democrat Editor Malcolm Johnson for a 1974 article on a change in federal child labor laws.\n\nSpencer closed his sandwich and concession businesses in 1975. He became a developer and built several apartment complexes near the universities.\n\nGeorge Lewis II (1913 - 1996) and Clifton Lewis (1919 - 2014)\n\nGeorge Lewis II was the great grandson of B.C. Lewis, founder of the Lewis State Bank in 1856, and served as the CEO through the 1950s and 1960s. Under George, Lewis State Bank provided home and business loans to the Black community when other financial institutions refused to do so. It was also the source of bail money for protesters during the bus boycott and other demonstrations.\n\nGeorge was also a member of the Florida Advisory Board of the United States Commission on Civil Rights.\n\nKnow their names:A roll call of civil rights leaders who helped shape Tallahassee\n\nClifton was in the first first-grade class at Caroline Brevard Elementary School, graduated from Leon High School as the 1936 Tallahassee May Queen, and is remembered for her love of art, people, and good government.\n\nClifton began what would become the LeMoyne Art Foundation in the lobby of the Lewis State Bank and was the first president of the board for what would become the Tallahassee Museum of History and Natural Science.\n\nShe also lobbied the Governor and Cabinet, and the Leon and Tallahassee commissions to televise their meetings on public television. Local legend holds her dissertation-length presentations at local meetings resulted in both the city and county commissions setting time limits for public comments.\n\nGeorge and Clifton convinced architect-artist Frank Lloyd Wright to design a home for them in Tallahassee. The Lewis Spring House on Ohkeeheepkee Road was completed in 1954 and served as their home until their respective deaths.\n\nThe Lewis Spring House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. In 1996, Clifton formed the Spring House Institute Inc., to transform the Lewis home into a teaching institute for the arts and humanity.\n\nRev. King Solomon Dupont (1903 - 1983)\n\nKing Solomon Dupont was the grandson of a man bought in Virginia and enslaved on a farm 12 miles west of Tallahassee. In 1957, he was the first Black candidate in a city election.\n\nDupont served as the lead pastor at Fountain Chapel AME Church and a founding member of the Inter-Civic Council, which organized the 1956 bus boycott.\n\nThe only issue the white incumbent Davis Atkinson wanted to discuss was how his opponent was “a candidate who is owned lock, stock, and barrel by the Negro InterCivic Council and the NAACP, two organizations whose only existence is for the purpose of the integration of the human races, a program of mixing just to be mixing.”\n\nDupont said he was concerned about high utility rates, and “better living quarters for low-income families.”\n\nThree plate glass windows at a Black grocery store were smashed by bricks, one which police said had an obscene note attached warning Dupont not to run. At night white youths would drive by Dupont’s church and residence hurling insults.\n\nVoter registration surged – a more than 40% increase to 13,000 – and the number of ballots cast more than doubled compared to the previous election.\n\nWith three quarters of registered voters white, Atkinson won reelection with 74% of the vote.\n\nData expert Matt Isbell's analysis of precinct results reveals a near perfect correlation (0.99) of race to vote. Tallahassee Democrat columnist Gerald Ensley also crunched the numbers and concluded no Black Tallahasseeans voted for Atkinson and 87 whites voted for Dupont.\n\nIt would be another 14 years and eight unsuccessful Black candidates before a Black person won an election in Leon County: James Ford would successfully walk the path first blazed by Dupont and win a city commission seat in 1971.\n\nDupont is included in the Tallahassee Civil Rights Oral History collection of interviews conducted by Dr. Jackson Lee Ice during the summer of 1978.\n\nHis name is one of 50 Civil Rights Foot Soldiers engraved on the Civil Rights Heritage Walk Memorial along Jefferson and Monroe streets. And both Dupont Drive and King Solomon Drive off of Wahnish Way are named in his honor.\n\nCharles Louis Napoleon Achille Murat (1801 - 1847)\n\nCharles Louis Napoleon Achille Murat was known as Achille and was the eldest son of Joachim Murat, the brother-in-law of Napoleon and King of Naples. When Napoleon was exiled, in 1815 Murat's father was executed and the rest of the family fled to Austria.\n\nSeven years later, Murat took a room in the same Washington, D.C. boarding house as Richard Keith Call, the Congressional delegate for the Florida territory.\n\nThe two became lifelong friends and by 1825 Murat bought a plantation 15 miles east of Tallahassee.\n\nHe named it Lipona, an amalgamation of his native Naples. A year later Murat married Catherine Daingerfield Willis Gray.\n\nMurat took the oath of citizenship in present-day Jefferson County and became an attorney, county judge, and director of Union Bank.\n\nMurat would purchase three plantations in the area. While he spent much of his life trying to recoup his family’s lost fortune, he lived long enough to see Union Bank foreclose on The Lipona.\n\nHistorians consider Murat a man of eccentric ways.\n\nHe had an aversion to water internally or externally. He never drank it without adding whisky to it.\n\nHe rarely bathed. Once, while onlookers feared he would be scalded after falling into a vat of syrup on a sugar plantation, Murat’s only comment was, now “Kate will make me wash.”\n\nMurat kept a shaggy dog to use as a spittoon and cooked and ate all kinds of animals. Among his culinary experiments was an alligator-tail soup, which he wrote was “a little better than turkey buzzard soup.”\n\nHe found New Orleans to be home to “\"the worst descriptions of French literature,” North Carolina “a bad imitation of Virginia,” and Charleston, S.C., “the city par excellence.”\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson was caught in a storm at sea with Murat and described him, as “a philosopher, a scholar, a man of the world; very skeptical but very candid, and an ardent lover of truth,” with “manners elegant to perfection.”\n\nBut the historical record does not always support Murat’s account of frontier Florida.\n\nHe and David Macomb dueled at Lake Iamonia either because Murat’s hungry slaves stole Macomb’s hogs or because Macomb supported Kentucky Sen. Henry Clay in a dispute with President Andrew Jackson.\n\nMurat’s bullet pierced Macomb’s cloak without touching skin. Macomb shot off the little finger on Murat’s right hand.\n\nMurat would pass in Tallahassee with Catherine by his side. His last words were said to profess his love for her.\n\nAchilles and Catherine are buried in the St. John’s Cemetery. Their graves are marked by unobtrusive shafts of marble.\n\nHerb Morgan (1943 - 2003)\n\nHerb Morgan was among the 1974 class of young reformers elected to the Florida House of Representatives. He would represent Tallahassee for 12 years in the Legislature.\n\nMorgan chaired the Appropriations Committee for six years and the agenda-setting Rules Committee for two. He used the positions to pass landmark growth management regulations, enhance services for those with disabilities, save the Historic Old Capitol from demolition, and create the FAMU/FSU College of Engineering.\n\nAn insurance executive, Morgan also served on the boards of Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare and Tallahassee Community College.\n\nAt his passing, Morgan was remembered as a loyal, helpful friend and a man of integrity. Former Congressman Al Lawson who served with Morgan in the House said he and others had nicknamed the Tallahassee lawmaker “St. Morgan.”\n\nIn 1991 Florida State University awarded Morgan the James D. Westcott Distinguished Service Medal, the school’s recognition for those “whose life and work exemplifies the Vires, Artes and Mores, which the university seeks to nurture in its students.”\n\nThe Herb Morgan Presidential Scholarship is available to business students in their junior year.\n\nMarie Louise Morris DeVere DeMilly (1818 – 1898)\n\nTwelve-year-old Marie (Maria) DeVere arrived in Tallahassee in 1831. Her family migrated from France to join the abolitionist community that sprouted in today’s Frenchtown neighborhood.\n\nAgents swindled her father out of the land grant from General Marquis de Lafayette, and then yellow fever claimed both parents, leaving Marie and seven siblings orphaned in a “strange country of a strange language without any means at all.\"\n\n“It was a terribly sickly year. People were dying on every side, and we were all prostrated with sickness. Thank God, we met kind friends,” Marie recalled in an 1876 letter to a younger brother.\n\nThe children were divided up among Tallahassee families. Maria is listed as a member of the St. John Episcopal Church in the 1832 parish registry.\n\nShe would marry John Louis DeMilly four years later, and they built a two-story home at 303 North Gadsden, where Capital City Bank has offices today.\n\nIn 1847, they leased another home at 100 Bronough Street, it’s now called “The Columns” and are the offices of the James Madison Institute. Marie ran it as a boarding house.\n\nThe 1860 census shows the couple also owned the famed City Hotel on Adams Street.\n\nMarie was mother of 15 children – eight passed in childhood. A family memorial stands in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nAntonio Proctor (circa 1750 – 1855)\n\nGov. William DuVal considered Antonio Proctor “indispensable” to Florida’s beginnings.\n\nProctor is best known as a scout and interpreter for the Simmons/Williams expedition that selected the site for Florida’s capital city.\n\nBorn a slave in Santo Domingo, Proctor’s linguistic skill was his ticket to events that connect the revolution to Florida’s transition from a Spanish colony to a U.S. territory.\n\nProctor served as a translator, at different times, for the three main powers that jockeyed for control of the North American continent – the Spanish, British, and U.S. governments.\n\nProctor was an interpreter for the British at the Battle of Lexington.\n\nHis service to Spain during the War of 1812 led to a royal order from the king that granted him his freedom and 185 acres of land along the Sebastian River.\n\nWhen the U.S. acquired Florida, DuVal hired him. He was on the Simmons and Williams expedition as a scout. Then as an interpreter he helped the U.S. negotiate the Treaty of Moultrie Creek and the Treaty of Payne’s Landing.\n\n“Proctor’s skills proved indispensable. Invaluable to the United States at a period when no other person could have preserved the peace of the country,” wrote DuVal.\n\nProctor retired to Tallahassee in 1826 with his son George, an architect and builder. He passed at the home of Henry L. Livingston – off of present day Calhoun Street, in 1855.\n\nCharles U. Smith (1923 – 2015)\n\nA tall, lanky engaging man with a distinctive moustache, Charles U. Smith was an outspoken professor and organizer.\n\nSmith grew up in Birmingham, played football at Tuskegee University, was the second Black man to earn a Ph.D at Washington State University and became chair of the Florida A&M University sociology department in 1951.\n\nSmith encouraged, supported, and participated in the student protests of the 1950s and ‘60s. A dedicated researcher, he documented the civil unrest in Tallahassee and across the south as it unfolded in 14 books and numerous academic papers.\n\nIn a segregated community where few dissidents spoke out, Smith consistently attended city commission meetings to criticize commissioners’ decisions. A 1956 lease that kept the Capital City Country Club segregated until 1971 was a frequent complaint.\n\nSmith was the first Black professor at Florida State University and the first Black chair of the Leon County Democratic Party. He also served as director of FAMU graduate studies from 1979 until his retirement in 1997.\n\nHe led the effort to rename Canal Street FAMU Way, after the roadway received a multi-million-dollar expansion.\n\nNow, family and friends want to rename the pedestrian bridge that spans South Monroe Street and connects FAMU Way to Cascades Park, the Dr. Charles U. Smith Crosswalk. They say it is a fitting honor for someone who spent a lifetime dedicated to changing the political and physical landscape of the city where he lived.\n\nDavid Shelby Walker (1815– 1891)\n\nDavid Shelby Walker of Russellville, Ky., moved to Tallahassee in 1837, where he was admitted to the Florida Bar and opened an office downtown.\n\nWalker would marry Philoclea Edgeworth Alton of Leon County in 1842 at St. John’s Episcopal Church. He was a kindred spirit with Bishop Francis Huger Rutledge who refused to justify slavery on theological grounds.\n\nDuring the next five decades in Tallahassee, Walker would serve as the state Superintendent of Public Education, a member of the Florida House of Representatives, the Florida Senate, a justice of the Florida Supreme Court and governor.\n\nAs the state’s first post-Civil War governor, he dedicated his administration to public education. His first message to the Legislature urged a law “for the education of colored people.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/04"}]}

As a Gen Z Republican, I ...", "text": "After a resounding series of losses on Super Tuesday, Nikki Haley announced she was suspending her campaign for president, locking in the Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden rematch that America was dreading.\n\nDespite surprisingly winning both Washington, D.C., and Vermont in the Republican primary, Haley’s deficit of delegates against Trump was too much to overcome in the race for the GOP nomination.\n\nRepublican primary voters were too consumed by the promise of what they would call the glory years of Trump's presidency returning to truly evaluate Haley's campaign for what it was: our best chance at denying a second Biden term and retaking the White House.\n\nThe fact that Trump was able to win the GOP nomination while under four criminal indictments, refusing to step on a debate stage and still refusing to concede his last election serves as a testament to how strong his grip on the party base is.\n\nUnfortunately for the countless principled Republicans like myself, we cannot justify a vote for Trump, no matter how bad a Biden presidency has been. I find myself now in the middle of two candidates I view as severely damaging to the future of our country.\n\nNikki Haley lost Super Tuesday.Her voters still have a chance to be heroes and defeat Trump.\n\nHaley is better suited to beat Biden in November\n\nThere is no doubt that Haley was better poised to win in a general election against Biden than Trump is. A poll released last month showed her beating Biden in a head-to-head election.\n\nHaley also is far more palatable to centrists than both Trump and Biden and was even capable of capturing a significant portion of voters who favor Biden over Trump.\n\nRepublicans would rather lose elections than abandon Trump\n\nHaley was not my first choice for president, but she was far from my last. I certainly prefer her to Trump as the Republican nominee, and it's frustrating that the GOP base is entirely unconcerned with electability when selecting their candidate of choice.\n\nHowever, what has become abundantly clear this time around is that a significant portion of Republican voters would rather lose elections than abandon Trump, and that is a pill the anti-Trump conservatives have to swallow.\n\nTrump is vulnerable:Sure, Nikki Haley lost big on Super Tuesday. But warning signs for Trump are flashing.\n\nRepublicans losing young voters. Trump won't help.\n\nFor young conservatives like me, the only choice we've known for president is Trump. While a majority of Gen Z Republicans support the former president, the GOP has a major numbers problem when it comes to my generation, spanning from 1997 to 2012.\n\nPolling suggests that only 21% of Gen Z identifies as Republican compared with 36% as Democrat. The 30% of Gen Z who identifies as independent is unlikely to support Trump in large numbers come November, but Haley’s support among independents could have unlocked a new source of votes for the GOP.\n\nEven if Trump loses this year, which is a strong possibility, the loyalty expressed in this cycle gives me no reason to think we won’t see a repeat in 2028 and beyond. I honestly don’t know what will break through to those who support Trump anymore. The only way to be rid of Trump at this point might be for him to win an election and be precluded from running for a third term.\n\nUntil then, it seems the GOP is stuck with Trump as our perpetual nominee. Instead of winning elections, the GOP is relying on Democrats to lose them. Instead of appealing to new voters, the GOP will rely on the same base it always has. If neither party will give us candidates worth voting for, I simply won’t.\n\nDace Potas is an Opinion fellow for USA TODAY.

The Inflation Reduction Act that Biden signed into law in August 2022 capped the out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $35 a month for all seniors on Medicare, according to the White House. Several pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, followed suit and limited the monthly cost of the drug to $35 per month as well. But there is no evidence Biden limited the cost of insulin beyond this.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe price of insulin was also never set at $400, though many paid about this much. The price a person pays for insulin depends on a variety of factors, including what type of insulin they are using, insurance status and whether they're eligible for a rebate from the drugmaker, according to NBC News. While estimates vary, one government study published in December 2022 reported that in 2019, the average insulin user with private insurance spent $456 on insulin annually, while those with Medicare spent $449 a year and those without health insurance paid $996, comparatively.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nBiden claim: He is endorsed by Border Patrol agents\n\n“The border patrolmen endorsed me, endorsed my position.”\n\nThis is partly false.\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council – the labor union that represents more than 18,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents – posted to X, formerly Twitter, minutes after Biden made the claim and said, “To be clear, we never have and never will endorse Biden.”\n\nBut the union, which endorsed Trump in 2020, supported the proposed bipartisan border agreement that Biden backed and Trump opposed, NBC News reported in February.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nBiden claim: Illegal border crossings dropped 40% after his June directive\n\n“I've changed (the law) in a way that now you're in a situation where there are 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally.”\n\nBiden took executive action on June 4 that authorized the U.S. to turn away migrants who enter the country illegally when crossing levels are high. The policy is triggered anytime unlawful crossings hit an average of 2,500 people a day in a given week.\n\nIn remarks posted on June 26, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said Border Patrol encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border had dropped by over 40% since Biden took action.\n\nHowever, immigration experts have cautioned that it’s difficult to point to any one reason for a drop in crossings at the border, PolitiFact noted in its fact check on this claim.\n\nImmigration rights organizations have sued the Biden administration over the new asylum restrictions at the border.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: Everybody wanted Roe v. Wade overturned\n\n“I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.”\n\nThis is not an accurate summary of public opinion on the question. Numerous polls show most Americans were not in favor of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022. For example, a poll conducted by Pew Research Center in July 2022 found that 57% of respondents said they disapproved of the overturning of the landmark decision. Another PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll conducted in May 2022 (before the case was decided) found that 64% of respondents were opposed to reversing Roe v. Wade.\n\nThere is little evidence opinions have changed much since the decision. A Marquette Law School poll conducted in February 2024 found that 67% of adults opposed the ruling, while a Gallup poll from June 2023 found that 60% of respondents said overturning Roe v. Wade was a “bad thing.”\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nBiden claim: Historians voted Trump ‘worst’ president in history\n\n“(Trump) was the worst in all of American history. … He can argue (the historians) are wrong, but that’s what they voted.”\n\nBiden was presumably referring to the 2024 Presidential Greatness Project Expert Survey, which is a joint project from University of Houston professor Brandon Rottinghaus and Coastal Carolina University professor Justin Vaughn.\n\nThe survey respondents in late 2023 voted Trump the lowest in “overall presidential greatness,” behind James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson and Franklin Pierce. Abraham Lincoln was rated highest. Joe Biden ranked at No. 14.\n\nRespondents included scholars who had recently published peer-reviewed academic research in related scholarly journals or academic presses and current and recent members of the Presidents & Executive Politics Section of the American Political Science Association, which the survey described as “the foremost organization of social science experts in presidential politics.”\n\nOut of 525 respondents invited to participate, the survey received 154 usable responses, yielding a 29% response rate.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: I brought in National Guard during 2020 Minnesota unrest\n\n“If I didn’t bring in the National Guard, that city (Minneapolis) would have been destroyed.”\n\nIt was Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, who activated the state’s National Guard to respond to unrest following the death of George Floyd, according to a press release issued by Walz’s office on May 28, 2020.\n\nWalz said at the time that he was responding to “local leaders’ request for Minnesota National Guard assistance to protect peaceful demonstrators, neighbors and small businesses in Minnesota.”\n\nCNN reporter Daniel Dale also looked into the claim back in 2020, detailing the timeline of events provided to the network by Walz’s press secretary, Teddy Tschann. In a statement to CNN, Tschann said Walz activated the National Guard at the request of the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, before the governor spoke with the White House.\n\n“Did President Trump ‘call out’ the Guard? No,” Tschann said in the statement, according to CNN.\n\nOn May 30, 2020, the Minnesota National Guard posted on Twitter, now X, that Walz had “announced the full mobilization” of the Guard for the first time since World War II.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nBiden claim: Trump praised Hitler, saying he did 'some good things'\n\n\"This is a guy who says Hitler has done some good things\"\n\nBiden's quote of Trump is a reference to comments the former president allegedly made while talking with his White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly, in 2018 during a trip to Paris, according to excerpts from an upcoming book by Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender.\n\n“Well, Hitler did a lot of good things,” Trump reportedly told Kelly, according to a CNN report.\n\nTrump later denied that he made the comments and denied that the conversation took place. Liz Harrington, a Trump spokesperson, told CNN the claim is \"totally false.\"\n\n\"President Trump never said this,\" Harrington said. \"It is made up fake news, probably by a general who was incompetent and was fired.\"\n\nTrump has previously faced criticism for saying immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and describing his political opponents as \"vermin,\" reminding many of language used by authoritarian leaders.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nTrump claim: Record ‘approval rating’ from VA\n\n“I had the highest approval rating in the history of the VA.”\n\nThis is both false and a mischaracterization of what the quarterly customer experience surveys from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs measure.\n\nThe Veteran Signals surveys track the proportion of servicemembers who express having trust in the VA. It's not a presidential approval rating.\n\nIt has topped 80% twice: It was at 80% in 2020 during Trump’s administration, and it reached a high of 80.4% in May under Biden.\n\nTrump made a similar version of the claim during a May rally in Wisconsin, according to a report from Wisconsin Watch.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: More illicit drugs coming into US under Biden\n\n“The number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we’ve ever had by far.”\n\nThis is false. When measured by weight, drug seizures are trending down.\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Border Patrol and Office of Field Operations seized nearly 549,000 pounds of illicit drugs in 2023, according to federal data. That’s down 16% from 2022, when 656,000 pounds of substances were confiscated. More than 900,000 pounds were seized in 2021, according to federal data.\n\nMost of the drugs involved were marijuana (150,000 pounds) and methamphetamine (140,000 pounds).\n\nFentanyl seizures were up, however, with the 27,000 pounds in 2023 accounting for nearly twice the 14,700 pounds confiscated in 2022.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: Biden indicted me because I’m his political opponent\n\n“He [Biden] indicted me because I'm his opponent.”\n\nThis is false. Trump was indicted and convicted in New York for falsifying business records related to a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. But there is no evidence Biden or his administration had anything to do with these charges. Since the charges were brought by the state of New York, Biden and the federal government are not party to the indictment and have no say in the charges, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\n“When you’re dealing with state prosecutions, it’s district attorneys elected by the voters of their jurisdiction,” said Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University. “That has nothing to do with the federal government.”\n\nThe idea of Biden interfering in Trump's prosecution is further weakened by the fact that the agency under his purview declined to file charges. The Justice Department had the authority to pursue a case against Trump over the hush money circumstances but chose not to do so.\n\nIn Trump's two federal cases, things are a bit different. The charges he faces cover the hoarding of hundreds of classified documents in Florida and a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election from Biden in Washington.\n\nThere is no law that prohibits a president from involving himself in a federal case, experts acknowledged. But they also said Biden has kept himself separate from the prosecution of Trump.\n\nAdditionally, Biden publicly vowed not to speak to Attorney General Merrick Garland about any specific case. And a key reason for the November 2022 appointment of Jack Smith as special counsel for the federal cases against Trump was to add a layer of separation between the investigation and the Biden Administration.\n\n-Brad Sylvester and Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: Food prices have 'doubled and tripled and quadrupled' under Biden\n\n\"You look at the cost of food where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled.\"\n\nThe cost of food has gone up under Biden, but not to the extent Trump claimed.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's all-food consumer price index shows food prices rose by 25% from 2019 to 2023.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in consumer behavior and led to supply chain disruptions, driving large increases in some foods. In 2022, food costs increased faster than any year since 1979, \"partly due to a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak that affected egg and poultry prices,\" according to the department's report.\n\nBut grocery prices have stabilized over the last year, increasing by just 1.2% in the past 12 months, according to the Consumer Price Index report from March 2024.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nTrump claim: No sex with porn star\n\n“I didn’t have sex with a porn star.”\n\nThis is disputed.\n\nOn May 30, a New York state jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records tied to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels testified at trial that she had sex with Trump in July 2006 following a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.\n\nTrump has denied the sex happened.\n\nThe trial focused on a $130,000 payment that was arranged by Trump’s then-personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, ahead of the 2016 presidential election, the Associated Press reported.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: Biden called African Americans ‘super predators’\n\n\"He did a crime bill. 1994. Where you called them super predators. African Americans. Super predators. And they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it.\"\n\nWhile Biden once warned of “predators” in 1993 while advocating for a 1994 crime bill he sponsored as a senator, he never referred to African Americans as “super predators.” Rather, it was then-first lady Hillary Clinton who linked that term to the 1994 crime bill, as USA TODAY previously reported\n\nWhile campaigning for her husband in 1996, Clinton praised the 1994 crime bill for curbing gangs, saying, \"We need to take these people on, they are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators. No conscious, no empathy,\"\n\nNotably, she did not connect this comment to Black people.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTrump claim: Unprecedented numbers of murders by immigrants under Biden\n\n“People are coming in and they’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen.”\n\nWhile Trump has made a version of this claim before, there is no data that points to a wave of homicides being led by people living illegally in the U.S.\n\nA review of 2024 crime data by NBC News suggests the opposite might be true. Overall crime levels have fallen in cities where a Texas program has transported migrants from the border, the network reported in February.\n\nCrime is down year over year in Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, New York and Los Angeles, according to the report. Washington experienced an increase, but officials do not attribute that spike to migrants, NBC News reported.\n\nTrump previously made a version of the claim during a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nResearch suggests immigrants actually commit fewer crimes than people born in the U.S.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: The US southern border is the most dangerous place in the world\n\n“We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world”\n\nThis is false. While deaths, disappearances and violence do occur at the U.S. southern border, there is no evidence to suggest it is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nStatistics on border deaths vary. Customs and Border Protection data shows 171 people died at the border in fiscal year 2022, some in CBP custody and others while attempting to cross the border. The International Organization for Migration, a U.N.-related organization, documented 686 deaths and disappearances of migrants on the US-Mexico border in 2022.\n\nPlaces all over the world and even in the U.S. have more frequent deaths. For example, there were more than 700 murders in Chicago in 2022, according to the Chicago Police Department. Chicago is 228 square miles, while the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,951 miles long.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTrump claim: Corporate tax cut from 39% to 21%\n\n“The corporate tax was cut down to 21% from 39% plus beyond that.”\n\nTrump was off with one of his numbers.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did lower the corporate tax rate to 21%. But it started at 35%, not the 39% that Trump claimed.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what Trump meant with his reference to “plus beyond that.” He promised business leaders that he would lower the corporate tax rate to 20%, The New York Times reported June 13.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nBiden claim: Trump told Americans to inject bleach to treat COVID-19\n\n\"He said it’s not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm, you’ll be all right.\"\n\nBiden is referring to comments Trump made during a press conference early in the pandemic when he suggested disinfectants might be a possible treatment for COVID-19. But he overstates what Trump said.\n\nTrump's statement came after Bill Bryan, an undersecretary of science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, discussed a new study that found sunlight and household disinfectants effectively killed the virus on surfaces or in the air.\n\n\"And then I saw the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute, and is there a way we could do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump, though, never directly instructed people to inject bleach or any other disinfectant. Some states issued warnings following Trump's comment, as did Lysol, which told people not to inject or ingest its products as a coronavirus treatment.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nBiden claim: No American troops died anywhere in the world during his presidency\n\n“The truth is, I’m the only president this century that doesn’t have any - this decade - that doesn’t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like (former President Donald Trump) did.”\n\nBiden’s comment came following a reference to hostilities in Afghanistan during Trump’s term in office.\n\nBut the notion that no troops have died in the world during Biden’s time in office is wrong.\n\nThirteen U.S. service members were killed in a suicide bombing attack near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in August 2021, when Biden was president, as thousands tried to flee the Taliban’s takeover of the country, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nAmong the deaths were 11 Marines, one Navy hospital corpsman and one Army soldier.\n\nBiden remarked on the deaths at the time, calling them “tragic.”\n\nMore recently, three U.S. Army Reserve soldiers were killed in January at a base in Jordan in what was described as a drone attack by Iran-backed militants.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Hunter Biden's ongoing legal troubles sure to hang over campaign\n\nIn early June, a jury found Hunter Biden – Joe Biden's son – guilty of three federal gun charges, making him the first child of a sitting president to be convicted at trial. The situation has been politically charged as it coincides with the elder Biden's ongoing campaign for reelection.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have investigated Hunter Biden's foreign business deals, repeatedly alleging that Joe Biden was involved in influence peddling during his time as vice president. The White House has denied that allegation, calling it baseless innuendo.\n\nJoe Biden, who earlier said he wouldn't pardon his son, released a statement shortly after the jury's verdict was announced reiterating that position.\n\n“I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,” he said. “Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.”\n\nHunter Biden is expected to stand trial again in September in California, where he faces tax charges.\n\nBut even before his legal troubles, the president's son has been a frequent target for misinformation. Here are some of the claims we've already debunked:\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Vast differences between Biden, Trump on gender identity, LGBTQ+ issues\n\nWith Pride Month winding down, LGBTQ+ issues – specifically, those related to gender identity – remain pivotal for voters in both parties.\n\nThe candidates have taken widely different positions on those issues, with President Joe Biden – hailed as the most LGBTQ-friendly president in U.S. history – marking his first day in office with an executive order on LGBTQ rights.\n\nHis administration is challenging Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, with the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case. He also unveiled in April a set of sweeping changes to Title IX rules that protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination based on their gender identity, but a federal judge blocked their enforcement in four states.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump vowed in May to roll back transgender student protections “on Day 1” of his presidency by reversing an executive order issued by Biden in 2021. Trump also vowed in February 2023 to punish medical professionals and facilities that provide gender-affirming care to transgender minors and said he would support banning transgender women from women’s sports.\n\nHere are some of the false claims related to LGBTQ+ issues that we’ve debunked:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate background: Israel’s war against Hamas sparks unrest in US as peace deal remains elusive\n\nThe Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip in response, plunged President Joe Biden into the second major international conflict of his term. He has been forced to balance America’s military support for Israel with calls from the left to broker a ceasefire deal as casualties mount in the Palestinian territory.\n\nBiden said in May that it is “time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,” laying out a proposal that called for Israel to cease military operations in the Gaza Strip and Hamas to release hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nBut a peace deal has proved elusive, leading to unrest on college campuses across the country after pro-Palestinian demonstrators set up protest camps. Former President Donald Trump cheered police crackdowns on demonstrators, calling them “a beautiful thing to watch.” But he’s also called on Israel to finish its war, saying the violence is hurting its standing among the international community.\n\n“Israel has to be very careful, because you're losing a lot of the world, you’re losing a lot of support, you have to finish up, you have to get the job done,” Trump told Israeli outlet Israel Hayom in an interview posted in March. \"And you have to get on to peace, to get on to a normal life for Israel, and for everybody else.”\n\nThese are some claims related to the Israel-Hamas war that we’ve already addressed:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts spotlight on US involvement in foreign wars\n\nRussia’s war against Ukraine entered its third year in February, and the conflict has had political implications in the U.S., where pushes to approve war aid for Ukraine have been met with contentious debate over the extent of American involvement in foreign wars, the Associated Press reported.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has remained committed to supporting Ukraine and its effort to join NATO, signing a 10-year bilateral security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on June 13.\n\n“Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine’s credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term,” Biden said at a press conference about the agreement. “A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine’s own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime … in the future.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has said he could end the war within 24 hours of returning to the Oval Office, but he’s offered few details about his plan. The Washington Post reported Trump’s plan could include pressuring Ukraine to give up territory, which Ukraine has opposed.\n\nHere are some fact-checks about claims related to the war in Ukraine:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Fight over immigration reform plays out during presidential campaign\n\nImmigration has become one of the most heated topics of the 2024 election, as President Joe Biden grapples with high levels of crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border and former President Donald Trump vows to deport millions of migrants if re-elected.\n\nThe situation at the Southwest border – where U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded nearly 2.5 million migrant encounters in fiscal 2023 – prompted Biden to take executive action earlier this month to implement new restrictions on asylum access.\n\nThe action came after Republican lawmakers in February blocked an immigration bill blocked by Biden that would have revamped the country’s immigration and border policies.\n\nBiden blamed the legislation’s failure to gain traction in Congress on opposition from Trump.\n\n“Now, all indications are this bill won't even move forward to the Senate floor,” Biden said at the time. “Why? A simple reason. Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump thinks it's bad for him politically.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has pledged to reinstate policies from his first term in office and limit asylum access if elected in November. He also wants to institute a merit-based immigration system and deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement “to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals,” according to his campaign website.\n\nHere are some immigration-related claims we previously debunked:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Biden and Trump face age-related concerns, though both insist they're fit to serve\n\nAt 81 years old, Joe Biden is currently the oldest U.S. president ever elected. His age has been a concern for voters and a frequent target for critics, including Donald Trump, who often suggests Biden's age makes him unfit to be president.\n\nTrump is 78 years old, three years younger than Biden, but he has also faced criticism related to his age and mental acuity, including when he confused Joe Biden for Barack Obama in multiple campaign speeches.\n\nEither man would be the oldest person to take the oath of office if sworn in next January.\n\nIn February, Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur released a report indicating Biden wouldn't face charges for his handling of classified documents that included multiple comments about Biden's age and memory, describing him as an elderly man with \"diminished capacities,\" including memory loss. However, Biden and his administration pushed back, with Biden saying his \"memory is fine\" during a televised speech.\n\nWhile Trump's doctor said multiple times he was healthy during his presidency, there were – and still are – reports of him slurring words during his speeches. Late in his term, Trump was recorded slowly descending a ramp after a speech at at U.S. Military Academy at West Point, during which he used both hands to drink a glass of water. Trump dismissed concerns raised about his age after that incident, claiming the ramp was long, steep and \"very slippery.\"\n\nHere are a few of the age-related claims we've already addressed:\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Election integrity remains key issue – even without evidence of widespread voter fraud\n\nThroughout the campaign one question has persisted: Will the candidates and their supporters trust – and abide by – the results of the election?\n\nMost recently, former President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee led by his daughter-in-law said they will mobilize 100,000 people in battleground states to ensure “transparency and fairness.” The move has drawn criticism from opponents who say it has the potential to lead to voter intimidation.\n\nState-level recounts, reviews and audits of the 2022 midterm elections found no indication of systemic problems with voter fraud. That’s significant because baseless allegations from Trump and his allies have penetrated the Republican Party and eroded confidence in the process.\n\nClaims questioning the integrity of the election frequently center around a handful of predictable themes that include assertions of widespread voter fraud and election “hacking.”\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked several false claims about the integrity of the elections:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate background: Trump’s conviction, pending trials loom over debate, election\n\nThe first former U.S. president convicted of a felony will take the debate stage as an ex-president for the first time in an attempt to convince voters to give him his old job back.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s felony conviction and his three pending criminal trials continue to loom large over both the race and the debate – his first of the presidential election cycle – with President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush-money payments intended to silence two women, including adult film actress Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 election. Days before the debate, the judge in that case lifted the gag order restrictions that protected the witnesses and jurors. He is scheduled to be sentenced July 11 – days before the start of the Republican National Convention, during which he is expected to formally receive the party’s nomination.\n\nTrump also faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and allegedly conspiring to steal the 2020 presidential election, including his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Trump and several allies were indicted in August by a Georgia grand jury that accused them of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, where Trump lost to President Joe Biden by about 12,000 votes.\n\nTrump’s legal problems have been the subject of an array of false or misleading claims on social media:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

JD Vance of Ohio, called Woodward \"a hack\" and said he didn't know the writer was still alive when asked about the book at a campaign rally in Detroit. Vance said he's never talked with Trump about the former president's phone calls with Putin.\n\n\"Even if it's true, look, is there something wrong with speaking to world leaders?\" Vance said. \"Is there anything wrong with engaging in diplomacy?\"\n\nWoodward, who has covered American presidents for 50 years, is best known for his reporting as a Washington Post reporter on the Watergate scandal during the Nixon administration. Woodward has authored more than 20 books on U.S. presidencies.\n\nIn \"War,\" he recounts an episode in 2024 at Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida in which the former president asked a senior aide to leave the room so he could conduct a phone call with Putin.\n\n“According to Trump’s aide, there have been multiple phone calls between Trump and Putin, maybe as many as seven in the period since Trump left the White House in 2021,” Woodward writes.\n\nHarris responded to Woodward's reporting that Trump sent COVID test kits to Putin during an appearance Tuesday on The Howard Stern Show.\n\n\"That is just the most recent stark example of who Donald Trump is – that he secretly sent COVID test kits for the personal use of Putin of Russia, an adversary to the United States,\" Harris said.\n\n'Totally inappropriate'\n\nFormer top U.S. intelligence official Rolf Mowatt-Larssen said former presidents are traditionally given a lot of leeway in who they remain in touch with, but that virtually all of them have resisted talking to leaders of countries that are openly hostile to U.S. interests – especially during times when they are at war with American allies, as Russia is now with Ukraine.\n\n“It’s totally inappropriate,” Mowatt-Larssen, whose 23 years at the CIA included two tours in Moscow, the second as station chief, told USA TODAY.\n\n“Just the idea of him calling Putin, even if it's just a social call, which you have to assume is not, undermines U.S. policy by talking to a leader of a country that is war with an ally that we are supporting militarily and financially,” he said.\n\nAlex Plitsas, a former U.S. defense and intelligence official, told USA TODAY, \"For me, the most important piece of this will be what they were talking about. I’m sure they weren’t exchanging dinner recipes.\"\n\n\"What could go wrong?\" quipped John Bolton, who served as Trump's national security advisor from April 2018 to September 2019 and has since become a vocal critic of the former president.\n\nMore:Biden confident 2024 election will be fair. But he does have one worry.\n\nWhite House feared Putin would use nuclear weapon, Woodward reports\n\nOther revelations in the book detail President Joe Biden and his administration's outlook on the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nIn September 2022, the Biden administration believed there was a 50% chance Russia would use a tactical nuclear weapon on Ukraine based on U.S. intelligence at the time, Woodward reports.\n\n“That f---ing Putin,” Biden told advisers in the Oval Office shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to Woodward's book. “Putin is evil. We are dealing with the epitome of evil.”\n\nMore:Putin draws a nuclear red line for the West\n\nBiden also had profanity-laced assessments of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Woodward writes.\n\n“That son of a bitch, Bibi Netanyahu, he’s a bad guy. He’s a bad f---ing guy!” Biden said of the Israeli prime minister to one of his associates in the spring of 2024 as Israel’s war in Gaza intensified, according to Woodward's book.\n\nTrump has not said which side he supports two and a half years into Russia's war in Ukraine. The former president has said repeatedly that, if elected, he would end the conflict in less than 24 hours yet he's given no details how that would happen.\n\nTrump last month met with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy in New York, one day after Zelenskyy met with Biden and Harris at the white House.

He OK?", "text": "Donald Trump started the weekend bizarrely telling a rally crowd that late golf great Arnold Palmer had a large penis, and ended it pretending to be a McDonald’s worker who doesn’t give a hoot about the minimum wage.\n\nIt was the kind of Saturday/Sunday we should expect from a presidential candidate who keeps getting weirder, more petty and less tethered to reality. Still, even with the expectation of inappropriateness and lame stunts, Trump’s weekend was jaw-dropping.\n\nLet’s start with the McDonald’s bit because, quite frankly, I’m still processing Saturday’s extended riff on Palmer’s genitalia.\n\nTrump pretends to work at McDonald's in fabulous Dukakis-esque moment\n\nOn Sunday, the Trump campaign took over a McDonald’s in Feasterville, Pennsylvania, thanks to a franchisee, Derek Giacomantonio, who agreed to close the restaurant to the public for the day. That allowed Trump’s handlers to stage-manage a fake “shift,” with Trump making some fries and working the drive-thru window.\n\nHe was at it for less than a half-hour, which I’m sure was exhausting. The customers he served were supporters who had been prescreened and, according to The Washington Post: “No one ordered food. Instead, the attendees received whatever Trump gave them.”\n\nI assume that was a Sad Meal and a large Orange Dukakis. (Trump wearing a McDonald’s apron drew comparisons to Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis’ disastrous 1988 photo-op in an M1 Abrams tank. Both moments featured candidates looking dumb and wholly out of place.)\n\nTrump has no evidence to support claim Harris never worked at McD's\n\nWhat made the elaborate stunt particularly ridiculous was the reason behind it. Trump wasn’t trying to appeal to voters who work in the fast-food or service industries. He was trying to make an inconsequential and unfounded point.\n\nTrump has claimed without evidence that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris never worked at a McDonald’s when she was in college, as she has often claimed.\n\nHe has literally nothing to back up the accusation, and also: Who cares? It’s a tiny part of Harris’ background and work experience. But because Trump is the smallest person on the planet, he has to make a big to-do about it because he thinks it’s a sick burn.\n\nOpinion:Trump's MAGA base might want to brace themselves – Harris could win\n\n“I’ve now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala,” Trump lied, uselessly.\n\nTrump's McDonald's trip showed no empathy for minimum-wage workers\n\nAs if to hammer home that Trump’s McDonald’s visit was a stunt and he doesn’t care about working people, Trump responded to a question about raising the minimum wage with this: “Well, I think this. These people work hard. They’re great. And I just saw something – a process that’s beautiful.”\n\nI’ll take that as: “I can’t be bothered to care about minimum-wage workers, I’m too busy pretending I’m making a point.”\n\n(I wonder if McDonald’s ran a criminal background check on Trump before letting him work there. I know for a fact he’s out on bond and has a number of felony convictions.)\n\nTrump tells crowd some things about Arnold Palmer's manhood\n\nIt’s possible many Americans missed Trump’s drive-thru theater-of-the-absurd performance Sunday because they were still trying to recover from his Saturday riff on Palmer, the late PGA great, and his penis.\n\n“Arnold Palmer was all man. And I say that in all due respect to women, and I love women,\" Trump said, preparing to answer a question absolutely no one has been asking. \"But this guy, this guy, this is a guy that was all man. This man was strong and tough. And I refuse to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there, they said, ‘Oh, my god, that’s unbelievable.’”\n\nHe said he refuses to say it, and then he said it. Trump continued: “I had to tell you the shower part of it because it’s true. What can I tell you? We want to be honest.”\n\nOpinion:An abortion ban killed her. Trump used Fox town hall to mock her grieving family.\n\nNo we don’t. We don’t need to be honest when we’re running to be the guy in charge of the nuclear codes and we’re standing in front of a large crowd of people and we randomly start talking about the size of a guy’s penis. We don’t need that at all.\n\nThat’s called “weird,” and when you’re 78 years old, it’s called “troubling,” as deteriorating mental acuity can bring with it a loss of inhibitions.\n\nA penis riff near the end of a presidential candidate isn't a great move\n\nThe moment earned Trump headlines like:\n\nTrump isn't doing much to knock down concerns about his mental acuity\n\nFor a candidate who suddenly – and quite belatedly – has the media noting that he’s old, not making much sense and refusing to release his medical records, telling a bawdy tale about a beloved athlete’s ding-a-ling isn’t what you’d call “helpful.”\n\nAnd the fact that the same candidate forced his campaign to create a fake fast-food photo-op highlighting a nonissue? That shows, again, that Trump is vindictive, utterly self-obsessed and wildly erratic.\n\nNot the kind of weekend you want near the end of a campaign.\n\nBut it fits, since Trump is not the kind of candidate anybody should want as president.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on X, formerly Twitter, @RexHuppke and Facebook facebook.com/RexIsAJerk", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/07/19/biden-step-down-obama-pelosi-democrats-election/74454694007/", "title": "Trump is gaining momentum exactly as Biden is losing his ...", "text": "There has never been more pressure for President Joe Biden to step down than there is right now. Since his debate performance in June and subsequent public appearances, prominent Democrats and voters alike have called for him to bow out of the race.\n\nBiden seems to be growing more receptive to it, too, if news reports are to be believed. He said Tuesday that he would consider quitting the race if \"some medical condition\" occurred, less than a day before he tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nWhether Biden actually drops out is a decision only he can make. It may, however, be the best thing for the party.\n\nIf he is seriously considering bowing out, he needs to make a decision soon. Time is running out between now and the election, and it's not like the Republicans are backing down any time soon. It's a difficult decision ‒ one that cannot be made alone ‒ but it's one that the president needs to consider in the coming days seriously. If he doesn't drop out, he will need to prove to members of his own party and the rest of the country that he is still capable.\n\nObama joins other Democrat bigwigs to suggest Biden should drop out\n\nI knew Biden was in trouble the second he lost former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In last week's interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” the congresswoman said the decision to continue running was “up to the president,” as opposed to saying whether or not she thought he should.\n\nThat same week, she expressed concerns about his effect on the Democratic Party. While Pelosi hasn’t publicly called on Biden to drop out, apparently she has told the president in private that his staying in the race could cost Democrats the White House and make it harder to win back the House of Representatives.\n\nWhat about Kamala?Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. So why is Joe Biden holding her back?\n\nShe isn’t the only person trying to get Biden to see the writing on the wall. Former President Barack Obama has told allies that he’s worried about Biden’s viability as a candidate. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has privately made the case to Biden about dropping out of the race; House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has expressed similar beliefs.\n\nOn top of major party leaders, nearly 20 House Democrats and one Democratic senator have publicly called on Biden to drop out of the race since his performance at the June debate.\n\nPressure is mounting, and there seems to be no end in sight. Democrats need Biden to make his plans clear, one way or the other.\n\nPolling shows shifting Biden support\n\nIt’s making it more difficult for the president to argue that he still has supporters within the Democratic Party ‒ especially once you factor in polling data. According to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, nearly two-thirds of Democrats say Biden should withdraw from the race.\n\nOther surveys suggest that Vice President Kamala Harris could fare better than Biden in a general election. The Economist/YouGov Poll found that 79% of Democrats would support Harris replacing Biden on the ticket. A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos survey also showed Harris polling slightly ahead of former President Donald Trump, 49%-47%.\n\nPolling from right before the assassination attempt on Trump last Saturday doesn't exactly quell fears about the president's election viability. In a New York Times/Siena College poll, Trump is leading in Pennsylvania and close behind in Virginia, two consequential states in the Electoral College. A CBS News' poll shows Trump leading slightly in seven battleground states, including Pennsylvania.\n\nRepublican election lies:Republicans really want you to think noncitizens are voting in droves. They're not.\n\nEmerson College Polling conducted since Saturday found Trump leading by a wider margin in swing states when compared with polling from March.\n\nWe can expect polling to get worse for Biden and the noise for him to step away to get louder.\n\nWe all learned in 2016 and 2020 that polling isn’t the be-all and end-all for a candidate, but it’s hard to ignore how this perception is already hurting Biden and will continue to hurt him in the race.\n\nShould Biden bow out? A Gen Z perspective.\n\nThe hard truth is that replacing Biden with a younger Democrat would solve a lot of the party’s concerns about this presidential election. In a year defined by voter apathy, a shake-up within the executive branch could breathe new life into the party and increase turnout come November.\n\nA new candidate would certainly mitigate some of the issues Gen Z has with Biden, namely his age and his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. I could see this being an inflection point for a disaffected generation that continues to believe politicians do not represent them.\n\nI know replacing a candidate this close to an election would be a complicated process.\n\nEven so, if Democrats are serious about getting Biden off the ticket ‒ and it seems like they are ‒ something needs to be done soon.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter, @sara__pequeno and Facebook facebook.com/PequenoWrites", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/08/allan-lichtman-2024-election-professor-predicted-president/73613080007/", "title": "Meet the Nostradamus of American presidential politics", "text": "Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University in Washington, D.C, has correctly predicted the outcome of nine out of the 10 most recent presidential elections since Ronald Reagan's re-election in 1984.\n\nSo how does he do it?

Specifically, by applying the science of plate tectonics to American history and politics.\n\nLichtman developed the metrics for his predictions with the help of an earthquake specialist from Moscow in 1981 and uses 13 historical factors or “keys” to determine presidential races—four of those factors are based on politics, seven on performance, and two on the candidate’s personality. The incumbent party would need to lose six of those factors, or “keys,” to lose the White House.\n\nIn a recent phone interview with USA Today, Lichtman shared how he developed his method and what his thoughts are on the 2024 presidential race between the two party's presumptive nominees: President Joe Biden, and former President Donald Trump.\n\nHow did you become interested in presidential politics?\n\nI grew up in a very political family and we’d always discuss politics at the dinner table.

Get this: In 1963 he was a member of the Soviet Scientific Delegation that came to Washington D.C. under JFK and negotiated the most important treaty by far in the history of the world: the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n\nKeilis-Borok said, “In Washington, I fell in love with politics and always wanted to use the methods of earthquake prediction to predict elections.” But, he said, “I live in the Soviet Union – elections? Forget it. It’s the supreme leader or off with your head. But you, you’re an expert in American history and politics, together we can solve the problem.”\n\nSo, we became \"The Odd Couple\" of political research and we re-conceptualized presidential elections in earthquake terms: As stability – the party holding the White House keeps the White House, and earthquake – the party is turned out.\n\nWith that in mind, we looked at every American presidential election from the horse-and-buggy days of politics, the election of Lincoln in 1860 to the election of Reagan in 1980, using Keilis-Borok’s mathematical method of pattern recognition.\n\nIt was that retrospective investigation that led to the \"13 Keys to the White House\": simple true-false questions that probe whether or not there’s going to be stability or earthquake, and our six-key decision rule, or the six keys that go against the White House party.\n\nWhat did we see in 2020?\n\nVery interesting election, where I did correctly predict Trump would lose and Biden would win.\n\nIn 2019, Trump was only down four keys. Remember, it takes six keys to count out the White House party. I hadn’t made a prediction yet, but things were looking pretty good. Then the pandemic hit.\n\nWhen I predicted Trump’s victory in 2016 – which you can imagine did not make me very popular in 90% Democratic Washington D.C. where I teach – Trump actually sent me a note on the Washington Post article where I predicted his win that said, “Congrats Professor, good call.”\n\nHe appreciated my call but he didn’t understand the meaning of the keys. The keys primarily probe the strength and performance of the White House party.\n\nThe big message: It is governance, not campaigning, that counts. Trump didn’t understand that. So when the pandemic hit, instead of dealing substantively with the pandemic like the keys would have indicated, he tried to talk his way out of it. Of course, it didn’t work; the economy tanked, and he lost two additional keys: The short- and long-term economy. That put him down six keys, enough to predict his defeat.\n\nYou don’t plan to unveil your 2024 prediction until around August, but what are you thinking and seeing now?\n\nForget the polls, forget the pundits.\n\nPolls six months, five months, even closer to the election have zero predictive value.\n\nForget all of the pundits who have said Biden’s too old. Democrat’s only chance to win is with Biden running for re-election. One of my keys is incumbency, he obviously wins that. Another key is party contest, he’s not been contested. That’s two keys off the top that Biden wins. That means six keys out of the remaining 11 would have to fall to predict his defeat.\n\nI’ve also said while I have no final prediction, a lot would have to go wrong for Biden to lose.\n\nAre there any upsets on the horizon that we should keep an eye out for?\n\nRight now, Biden is only down, for sure, two keys: The mandate key, because the Democrats lost seats in the House 2022 elections; and the incumbent charisma key because Biden is no JFK. But there are four very shaky keys:\n\nThird-party: Now, to win the third-party key, the third-party candidate has to get at least 5% of the popular vote. Very few have gotten that. There has to be a stabilization of the vote for the third-party candidate as we get closer to the election, and right now, RFK Jr. is all over the map. I’ve seen him as low as 3% and as high as 15%. That key is shaky but uncertain.\n\nSocial unrest: I thought it was pretty well locked in, in favor of the incumbent but the campus protests made it shaky.\n\nAnd of course, the two foreign policy keys: Success and failure – both shaky, given that we have two very uncertain wars raging in the Middle East and in Ukraine.\n\nBiden would have to lose all four of those or some other unexpected event like a sudden recession, to lose.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/01/03/trump-pressured-georgia-election-official-call-washington-post-report-says/4119948001/", "title": "Trump is heard on audiotape pressuring Georgia secretary of state ...", "text": "President Donald Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" enough votes to reverse his loss to President-elect Joe Biden in Georgia, according to an hourlong recorded phone call obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nThe revelation comes after Trump has publicly disparaged election officials in Georgia, blaming his loss in the state on widespread voter fraud, though the Justice Department found no such evidence of fraud that would change the outcome of November's election.\n\n\"There's no way I lost Georgia,\" Trump insisted Saturday during the call, audio excerpts of which were published by the Post Sunday. \"There's no way. We won hundreds of thousands of votes.\"\n\nTrump and Raffensperger exchanged tweets about the conversation Sunday morning: Trump said Raffensperger was \"unwilling, or unable\" to answer questions about fraud. \"He has no clue!\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Respectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true. The truth will come out,\" Raffensperger responded.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nDuring the call, the president insulted, complimented and pleaded with Raffensperger to cooperate with him in altering the election results.\n\nTrump called Raffensperger a \"child,\" a \"schmuck\" and “either dishonest or incompetent” for not supporting claims of widespread voter fraud in Atlanta, the state's largest city, the Post reported.\n\n“The people of Georgia are angry, the people in the country are angry,” Trump said. “And there’s nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you’ve recalculated.”\n\n“Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong,\" Raffensperger responded.\n\nTrump asked for Raffensperger to \"find\" enough votes to alter the result of the election.\n\n“So look. All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state,\" the president said.\n\nGeorgia officials tallied votes for the presidential election three times, including in an audit required by state law and a recount requested by the president. Each count determined that Biden won the state, the first Democrat to do so since 1992.\n\nBiden won the state by a margin of 12,670 votes, or 0.25% of the roughly 5 million ballots cast.\n\nOthers on the call Saturday included White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and prominent conservative lawyer Cleta Mitchell, the Post reported.\n\nThe president's unsubstantiated claims of a mass election conspiracy have been supported by large parts of the GOP base, as well as Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who face Democrats in Georgia's Senate runoff Tuesday.\n\nRaffensperger, a Republican and a Trump supporter, has repeatedly denounced the president's claims of election fraud as unfounded.\n\nHis refusal to support the president's effort to overturn the state's election results have earned him intense backlash from other Republicans, including protests at his house and a letter from Perdue and Loeffler calling on him to step down from his office.\n\nThe president's claims have found strong support outside Georgia as well.\n\nMore than 140 Republican members of the House of Representatives will contest Congress' official counting of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. A dozen sitting and incoming Republican senators, including Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, will also contest the count, ensuring the long-shot effort will be debated in the upper chamber.\n\nThis is not the first time the president has pressured Georgia officials to alter the results of the state's election.\n\nOn Dec. 5, Trump urged Gov. Brian Kemp to demand the state Legislature act to overturn Biden's victory in Georgia. Kemp refused and has been subjected to a steady barrage of Trump attacks in the weeks since.\n\nThe president's comments on the phone call resulted in a seismic reaction from across the political spectrum.\n\n\"We now have irrefutable proof of a president pressuring and threatening an official of his own party to get him to rescind a state's lawful, certified vote count and fabricate another in its place. It captures the whole, disgraceful story about Donald Trump's assault on American democracy,\" said Bob Bauer, senior legal advisor to the Biden presidential campaign.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said in a statement that Trump's conversation with Raffensperger amounted to \"a pathetic, rambling, delusional rant\" and that his actions merit \"nothing less than a criminal investigation.\"\n\nLegal and election experts expressed concern about the president's conduct, indicating his comments were improper and possibly illegal.\n\nNeal Katyal, who was acting solicitor general during President Barack Obama's administration, said the Trump call to Raffensperger \"demonstrates an impeachable, perhaps criminal, offense. It is a behind-the-scenes look at how Trump carries out the presidency, abusing his power for his gain.\"\n\nBarbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia Miller Center, said Trump's call \"strikes at the heart of American democracy\" and amounts to constitutional violations of Article II and the presidential oath of office.\n\n\"It is a violation of the oath of office, whereby this president is supposed to carry out the office of the presidency,\" Perry said. \"And then you look to Article II of the Constitution, which grants executive power to the president, but in no way, shape or form says that the president is supposed to tinker with the election returns.\"\n\nUnder Article II, the president is supposed to \"take care that the laws are faithfully executed,\" Perry said.\n\nEdward B. Foley, a professor of constitutional and election law at The Ohio State University, said his concern is \"the health and integrity of the electoral process that allows voters to choose their leaders. That requires politicians in the system to accept the counting of the votes and the result of the process.\"\n\nErwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley School of Law, said if the audio is taken literally, \"the president is asking the Georgia secretary of state to falsify election returns and come up with enough votes to have Trump carry Georgia.\"\n\nHe also noted Trump appeared to vaguely threaten criminal action against Raffensperger.\n\n\"Trying to pressure someone to engage in election fraud could be seen as a criminal attempt, though I am not sure Trump will ever be prosecuted for it.\"\n\n“It is absolutely outrageous and completely unacceptable,\" Guy-Uriel Charles, the Edward and Ellen Schwarzman professor of law at Duke University, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"It seems pretty clear that the president was asking the secretary of state to commit election fraud. The very nature of the ask is outrageous,\" Charles said. \"The process is done for all intents and purposes.\n\n\"I think it's fair to exhaust all legal remedies; I think it's fair to file lawsuits, even those with little legal standing. But trying to exert pressure on state and local officials to overturn the results of an election should not be tolerated,\" he said. \"That's a red line that should not be crossed.\"\n\nGeorgia Bureau of Investigation spokesperson Nelly Miles said Sunday that there have been no requests for the agency to review the communication.\n\nContributing: Nicholas Wu, David Jackson, Courtney Subramanian", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/24/why-nikki-haley-still-gop-presidential-race/72714006007/", "title": "Why is Nikki Haley still running? Despite SC loss, she is fighting on", "text": "CHARLESTON, S.C. – Her chances of securing the 2024 Republican presidential nomination are vanishing fast. But Nikki Haley isn’t giving up — at least not yet.\n\nAfter suffering defeats against former President Donald Trump in Iowa, New Hampshire and the U.S. Virgin Islands and losing to “none of the above” in the Nevada primary, the former South Carolina governor was banking on the results of her home state primary to turn the race around.\n\nIt wasn’t even close. Projections now show Haley losing South Carolina and most, if not all, of its delegates will likely go to Trump. For most politicians, a loss of this magnitude in their home state would end their campaign. No major-party nominee since 1972 has lost their home state.\n\nAddressing a crowd of supporters chanting \"Nikki\" on Saturday night, the former U.N. ambassador conceded the election to her former boss, who was leading her by around 20 percentage points when she took the stage.\n\n\"America will come apart if we make the wrong choices. This has never been about me or my political future,\" Haley told a cheering crowd. \"I am a woman of my word. I'm not giving up this fight.\"\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nHaley has pledged to remain in the GOP presidential race until at least Super Tuesday, when 15 states and one territory will vote on March 5. More than half of the delegates needed to win the GOP nomination will have been awarded after that day.\n\nTrump has an overwhelming lead in nearly all of the upcoming contests, and without the victory in South Carolina or a dramatic event that changes the course of the competition, Haley will not have the momentum she needs to pull off an upset anywhere else.\n\nSo why stay in the race against those odds?\n\n“I’m not giving up this fight when a majority of Americans disapprove of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden,” Haley said. “South Carolina has spoken. We’re the fourth state to do so. In the next ten days, another 21 states and territories will speak. They have the right to a real choice, not a Soviet-style election with only one candidate. And I have a duty to give them that choice.”\n\nShaping the future of the Republican Party\n\nHaley’s candidacy is as much about shaping the future of the Republican Party as it is about standing up to Trump. As the ex-president’s sole remaining GOP competitor, Haley has argued over the last week that she owes it to voters to stay in the race.\n\nShe has accused Trump of rejecting traditional conservative principles and making divisive comments that shrink the GOP’s voting base rather than expand it. Where the ex-president added to the national debt and complimented Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Haley has said the GOP should stand for fiscal responsibility and promote democracy.\n\nNot only that, Trump is distracted by his legal troubles, and he is “so obsessed with his own demons from the past, he can’t focus on delivering the future Americans deserve,” Haley said Tuesday.\n\nIn stump speeches across states that hold their contests early, Haley has also insisted that she’s better equipped than Trump to beat President Joe Biden in the November general election. She’s pointed to polling, including a recent survey conducted by the Marquette Law School, that shows her up by double digits against Biden. A RealClearPolitics average of national polls shows Haley leading Biden by 5 points. Trump is up by 2 points over Biden in that same survey.\n\n“This battle is about who can win in November, defeat the Democrats, and finally get our country back on track,” Haley’s campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, told reporters on Friday. She argued that Trump’s rhetoric and four criminal indictments could dissuade key voting blocs, such as suburban women, from backing Republicans up and down the ballot in November.\n\n“Trump has shown that he lost those demographics, which is why we have lost in many elections since he was elected in 2016. And so, we’re going to fight to bring more people into the party so that we can once again win elections,” Ankney said.\n\nPressing for younger political leaders\n\nHaley, 52, has billed herself as a next-generation leader, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump, 77, and Biden, 81.\n\nHighlighting concerns about both of their ages during her Tuesday speech, Haley called Trump and Biden “two old men who are getting older.”\n\nAge concerns have plagued the 2024 elections, particularly on the Democratic side, with many Americans expressing concern about the octogenarian commander-in-chief’s mental acuity.\n\nHaley had demanded competency tests for both men. If he's elected again, Trump would be in his 80s, too, by the end of a second term.\n\nHaley told reporters on Saturday as she voted at her local polling place on Kiawah Island that she hopes Republican voters across the country will recognize that there is another choice before them.\n\n“We can leave the drama and the chaos, we can lead the incompetence, and we can go to something that is normal. And that’s what people want, especially the younger generation. They just want to know what normal feels like,” Haley said.\n\nAnti-Trump donations pouring in\n\nWhen Trump warned after the New Hampshire primary that anyone who donated to Haley would be “permanently barred from the MAGA camp,” she received an influx of cash. Haley raised $2 million in the 48 hours after the threat, her campaign said. Federal paperwork the campaign filed this week showed Haley outraising Trump in January.\n\nThe money has kept her campaign afloat.\n\nHaley had $13 million in the bank at the end of last month. Trump had a much larger war chest, his campaign filing showed. But his campaign had to tap into it in January to get the former president through the first several contests. He had $30 million left at the end of last month.\n\nIt’s unclear what either of the campaigns’ finances look like now. Haley’s campaign manager declined to say Friday, in response to a question from USA TODAY, how much the candidate had raised in February and how much cash she had left.\n\n“Our grassroots digital and mail programs are continuing to grow by the day. And so we are fully confident that we will have the resources to compete moving forward,” Ankney said.\n\nHaley’s campaign said earlier in the week, however, that Trump’s attack on Haley’s husband, who is deployed with the U.S. military overseas, helped the candidate raise $1 million in the 48-hour period that followed the South Carolina rally where he made the remark. It said she raised another $5 million from major donors during a fundraising swing this month, but she also spent an additional $2 million in South Carolina on ads.\n\nHaley’s campaign said Friday that it was advertising in Michigan and announced a seven-figure national ad buy.\n\nThe two days after the South Carolina primary will be a critical time period for Haley’s fundraising efforts, based on her previous fundraising cadence.\n\n“As long as she has the resources to run a robust campaign that allows her to communicate with voters in every state that she’s made a priority, she’s going to continue to do that,” Rob Godfrey, a senior aide to Haley during her time as governor, said.\n\nLooking to beat Trump with delegates\n\nIn order to secure the GOP nomination, a candidate must win 1,215 delegates. Trump currently has 63, and Haley has 17.\n\nThere are 50 delegates up for grabs in the Palmetto State. Whoever wins statewide on Saturday will receive 29. Three delegates will go to the popular vote winner in each of the state’s seven congressional districts for a total of 21 additional delegates.\n\nIf Trump wins by a large margin in the state, he could leave South Carolina with all 50 in his column.\n\nTrump could lock up the nomination in mid-March, after more than half of the party’s delegates have been allotted. His campaign projects he will become the presumptive nominee no later than March 19.\n\nHaley’s future political ambitions\n\nSome political strategists and pundits have pondered whether Haley has an ulterior motive for sticking it out against Trump. Namely, they question whether she is setting herself up for a future presidential bid.\n\n“If the party ever turns away from Trump, she can say that she was the voice against him,” Ryan Williams, the national press secretary for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, said with a heavy dose of skepticism. “I don’t think that’s gonna happen.”\n\nOthers have wondered whether Haley plans to launch a third-party bid.\n\nThe centrist group No Labels floated putting Haley on a potential bipartisan unity ticket, and Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, who is challenging Biden in the Democratic primary, said he was open to being Haley’s running mate if she ran as an independent.\n\nHaley hasn’t ruled out the idea, but she also hasn’t endorsed it. Haley’s campaign manager said Friday that the former U.N. ambassador was “focused on winning the Republican nomination.”\n\nIf Haley is pushing forward because of long-term political ambitions, she’s kept it close to her chest.\n\n“People say I’m trying to set up a future presidential run. How does that even work?” Haley she said with a laugh on Tuesday. “If I was running for a bogus reason, I would have dropped out a long time ago.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/08/george-bush-dick-liz-cheney-donald-trump/75133193007/", "title": "George W.

Liz Cheney and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The Cheneys have gone so far as to say they will vote for Trump's opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSpeaking of dynasties, former President George W. Bush does not plan to endorse his party's standard bearer this year, and he won't say how he or former first lady Laura Bush will vote in November, a spokesperson confirmed over the weekend.\n\nIt's a dynamic that would have been unthinkable even 10 years ago: The GOP's most recent president and presidential nominee who came before the party's current pick won't publicly back him.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nAmericans never would have expected Romney not to receive Bush's support in 2012 − or the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., not to get Bush's backing in 2008. Former President Bill Clinton supported then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008, even after he defeated former first lady Hillary Clinton in that year's Democratic primary.\n\nMany of these prominent Republicans who have split with Trump have made themselves clear: It's both policy and personality differences that are fueling this fissure in the Republican Party. And those are differences that could decide the presidential race between Trump and Harris.\n\n\"What's happened to the Republican Party today, you know, is indefensible,\" Liz Cheney said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"And I hope to be able to rebuild ... after this cycle.\"\n\nTrump and allies say the party has already been rebuilt via the MAGA movement, and the vast majority of Republican voters remain with them while the critics are \"Republicans in Name Only.\"\n\n\"Dick Cheney is an irrelevant RINO, along with his daughter,\" Trump said in a weekend Truth Social post.\n\nIn the meantime, the political world is trying to get used to the idea that the Cheneys – among the most conservative political figures of the last half-century – are backing Harris, a product of liberal California. Some cited Bill Murray's character in the 1984 film Ghostbusters: \"Human sacrifice! Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!\"\n\nPolicy and personality\n\nSome of the Republicans who have balked at Trump's rise over the last 8 years genuinely disagree with him on the issues facing the nation, including items that were party dogma for decades. Amid Trump's gradual GOP takeover, starting with his 2016 election, the Republican Party has become more interventionist in the economy and more isolationist in foreign policy.\n\nTrump built his 2016 campaign in part by attacking the kinds of Republicans who are attacking him now, the party's more traditional prior leaders. That includes several members of the Bush administration, including Dick Cheney.\n\nTo be sure, Trump attacked Obama and Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent, over just about everything. He also had harsh words for Bush and Cheney, particularly over the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2007-08 financial crisis. The New York businessman condemned long-time Republican support for free trade and international military alliances.\n\nIn the meantime, some Republican leaders counter-attacked Trump over tariff proposals that would wreck free trade. They also said his disdain for NATO and other military alliances can only embolden American adversaries Russia and China.\n\nThese Republicans have chafed at any number of Trump actions: His expressions of sympathy for the near-insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021; his near-constant threats to prosecute political opponents, from President Joe Biden to Liz Cheney; and his semi-joke to be a \"dictator\" only on day one with respect to border security and energy production.\n\nIn her ABC interview, Liz Cheney said of Trump: \"At the end of the day, I think it's important for people to recognize, he's not a conservative.\"\n\nSometimes it's personal for Bushes, Cheneys, Romneys\n\nThere is also some personality to these arguments between Trump and a slice of his party.\n\nDuring Trump's presidency, Liz Cheney and Romney became two of the most prominent Republicans to speak out against him. The ultimate: In early 2021, Cheney and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach Trump over the violence of Jan. 6. Romney also voted to convict Trump in his Senate trial.\n\nThe former president retaliated, including in backing a Republican challenger to Cheney's congressional seat in 2022. Cheney lost in a blowout despite recruiting a Republican star – former Wyoming congressman and Vice President Dick Cheney – to cut an ad for her denouncing Trump as the biggest threat to democracy in the nation's history.\n\nThe elder Cheney used similar language Friday in announcing he would vote for Harris.\n\n\"In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Cheney said. \"He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.\"\n\nOther Republicans – including Bush, Romney, and Trump's own vice president, Mike Pence – have refused to endorse a second term. None have said they would actually vote for Harris. While Bush has largely bowed out of political life, Trump's attacks have touched him as well. After all, Trump launched personal criticism of Jeb Bush in the 2016 Republican primary, dubbing him \"low energy.\"\n\nBush has occasionally tangled with Trump, but it has rarely been direct. For example, during a 2021 ceremony in Pennsylvania to mark the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, Bush made a point of saying that \"so much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear and resentment.\"\n\nAfter the attempted insurrection by Trump loyalists on Jan. 6, 2021, Bush issued a statement saying that he and Laura Bush found it \"a sickening and heartbreaking sight.\"\n\nWhile, again, not citing Trump by name, Bush added: \"This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic – not our democratic republic.\"\n\nLaura Bush has also rarely weighed in on politics in recent years. However, she called some of the Trump administration's border policies \"cruel\" and \"immoral\" in a Washington Post op-ed published in 2018. \"It breaks my heart.\"\n\nWill Dick Cheney sway other Republicans?\n\nThis isn't just any Republican. Few people have done more to promote conservative causes than Cheney, who enhanced the powers of the vice presidency to promote issues like oil-and-gas production and military action to remove Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein.\n\nCheney was also not shy about tangling with Democratic adversaries, of which he had more than a few.\n\nWhen Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy questioned Cheney's ties to the oil business in 2004, Cheney responded with an expletive suggesting that the Vermont senator perform an anatomical impossibility. (“That’s sort of the best thing I ever did,\" Cheney later told radio host Dennis Miller.)\n\nStill, Cheney's decision to join Team Harris drew ridicule from some remaining Republicans.\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders, a former Trump press secretary who also appeared on ABC's \"This Week,\" said she doesn't understand how any of the dissident Republicans can consider themselves conservative while saying they are voting for Harris.\n\n\"That doesn't make you a conservative,\" Sanders said. \"It certainly doesn't make you a Republican. I think it makes you somebody who wants to protect the establishment.\"\n\nSanders and others also pointed out that anti-Trump Republicans are a distinct minority. In his first two elections, Trump received 88% and 94% of the Republican vote, according to exit polls; he is on track to again win more than 90% of the GOP vote overall.\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to look at this. In her appearance on ABC News, Liz Cheney said that President Ronald Reagan – a godfather of the conservative movement, winner of two landslide elections in the 1980s – would never have endorsed Trump.\n\nTrump's agenda \"is not the party of Ronald Reagan,\" she said.\n\nTrump and allies, meanwhile, often cast him as legatee of Reagan. The actor Dennis Quaid, who is portraying Reagan in a new film, told CNN anchor Chris Wallace that the two were men of different times, but \"I do feel that the principles of Ronald Reagan and the principles of Donald J. Trump are very similar.”\n\nWallace didn't agree: \"I've got to say, I think Reagan would have been appalled by Trump's behavior.\"\n\nOthers wonder at the new-found Democratic respect for Dick Cheney.\n\nMeghan McCain, John McCain's daughter, said on the social media site X: \"Seeing all of these extreme progressives suddenly become Dick Cheney fans is objectively hilarious.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/21/joe-biden-drops-out/74255359007/", "title": "Joe Biden endorses Kamala Harris after he drops out of 2024 ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news of Joe Biden stepping aside from his 2024 presidential campaign on Sunday, July 21.

Harris responded that she's honored to have Biden's endorsement, and her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination.\" The president and vice president spoke several times on Sunday morning ahead of his announcement.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBiden said he would speak to the nation later this week to provide more details about his decision.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nIn his statement, Biden reflected fondly on his four years in office, saying the U.S. has built the “strongest economy in the world” while touting efforts to lower prescription drug prices, expand health care, tackle climate change and appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe decision upends the 2024 campaign 107 days before Election Day, with Democratic National Committee members now tasked with choosing an alternative nominee to take on Trump, whose polling lead has swelled while Democrats have fought internally.\n\nBiden's departure will soon mean the end of a five-decade career in Washington that began in 1972 with an upset victory for U.S. Senate in Delaware. He served as a senator for 36 years, then as Obama's vice president from 2009 to 2017. Biden returned to public life to run against Trump in the 2020 presidential election. He framed the race as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\" and defeated Trump 51%-47% in the popular vote.\n\nIt marks an extraordinary turn for Biden, who for three weeks remained defiant in the face of growing calls from Democratic lawmakers that he withdraw after a disastrous June 27 debate with Trump raised scrutiny over the president's mental fitness.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live updates.\n\nLouisiana Democratic delegation endorses Harris\n\nWhile President Biden's delegates at the upcoming Democratic National Convention are not formally obligated to follow his lead and back Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement at the top of the ticket, the Louisiana delegation is already onboard.\n\n\"This evening, the LA delegation to the @DemConvention met virtually, and by an overwhelming majority vote, officially endorsed Vice President @KamalaHarris to be our 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee,\" the state party reported on X.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC endorses Harris\n\nIn a sign of coalescing Democratic Party unity around Harris, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, BOLD PAC, announced Sunday night that it is endorsing President Biden's chosen successor.\n\nJust a few days ago, BOLD PAC stood squarely behind Biden amid growing calls for him to drop out.\n\n\"President Biden's tenure will be remembered for his accomplishments that stand among the best in history,” said BOLD PAC Chair Rep. Linda Sánchez, D-Calif., in the statement Sunday.\n\n\"As we look ahead, we know that these accomplishments would not have been possible without Vice President Kamala Harris and CHC BOLD PAC is proud to endorse her for president. This administration has led with working families in mind and shown an unwavering commitment to Latinos. There is so much work left to do and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Make no mistake, Latinos nationwide will bear the brunt of the consequences of a Trump second presidency, just like they did in the past. BOLD PAC will remain laser focused on doing what it takes to ensure that Trump remains a one-term president. Vice President Harris is the leader we stand behind at this critical moment.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nHow Harris would run against Trump\n\nA campaign ad from Harris' 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign sheds light on how she might run against Trump if she becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe ad, which was shared Sunday afternoon by a pro-Harris account on X, characterizes Harris as the antidote to Trump. It leans heavily on her work as a prosecutor and contrasts that record with Trump's alleged misdeeds.\n\n\"She prosecuted sex predators, he is one,\" the narrator notes, followed by the recording of Trump's crudely phrased statement that he grabs women by their genitals.\n\nThe ad goes on to draw similar comparisons. Whereas Harris prosecuted for-profit colleges that swindled students, Trump ran a for-profit university that was sued by former students who said they were misled by false claims. Trump agreed to a $25 million settlement\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nDemocrats raise nearly $50 million online since Biden’s exit\n\nDemocrats have raised nearly $50 million online since President Joe Biden announced his decision on Sunday to drop out of the 2024 race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nActBlue, the leading site processing Democratic donations, said as of 9 p.m. ET it has raised $46.7 million from supporters, making Sunday its biggest fundraising day of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nMost of the Democratic Party has coalesced quickly around Harris as the nominee, making her the strong favorite to take on Trump in November.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Manchin is considering seeking Democratic nomination\n\nSen Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is considering switching his party affiliation from independent to Democratic to seek the party's presidential nomination after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will exit the 2024 race, according to Manchin's adviser Jonathan Kott.\n\nHe is the first Democrat to openly consider challenging Vice President Kamala Harris for the nomination. Manchin, 76, previously flirted with the idea of launching an independent campaign for the presidency, and at one point even floated appearing on a ballot with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, but decided not to in mid-February.\n\nManchin is unlikely to receive much support from Democrats, given his record of bucking some of the party’s major legislative proposals and his decision to register as an independent in May.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris makes the rounds\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spent her afternoon working the phones, calling Democratic Party leaders and members of Congress as she sought to quickly coalesce lawmakers and potential competitors around her candidacy. Among the Democratic officials she spoke to were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising star in the party who leads a must-win battleground state, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford, according to a source familiar.\n\nHarris has plans to be in Milwaukee on Tuesday and Indianapolis on Wednesday at previously scheduled events.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a key progressive Democrat, endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination Sunday night as Harris continues to coalesces most of the Democratic Party around her bid.\n\n“Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States. I pledge my full support to ensure her victory in November,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement on X.\n\n“Now more than ever, it is crucial that our party and country swiftly unite to defeat Donald Trump and the threat to American democracy. Let’s get to work.”\n\nWhile 35 congressional Democrats publicly called for Biden to end his campaign prior to his announcement, Ocasio-Cortez was among those who remained behind the president.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump raises questions about the next debate\n\nIs Trump laying the groundwork to forgo a debate against Harris (or any other Democrat)?\n\nIn a Truth Social post late Sunday, Trump noted that his Sept. 10 debate with Biden \"was slated to be broadcast\" on ABC.\n\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Trump gave a somewhat equivocal answer to the debate question: \"I don’t know who I'm going to debate. So far, we haven’t determined who is going to be on that side. But I think whoever it is, I’d like to debate. Yeah, sure.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTennessee Democrats become first delegation to formally endorse Harris for president\n\nTennessee’s 77 Democratic delegates voted by conference call Sunday afternoon to formally endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination, becoming the first delegates previously pledged to Biden in any state to formally back her.\n\nThe decision comes as much of the Democratic establishment, including former President Joe Biden, has quickly coalesced behind Harris following Biden’s announcement to end his 2024 campaign.\n\n“It’s very compelling to me that the president decided not to run and to endorse her,” Chip Forrester, one of the Tennessee delegates, told USA TODAY. “He has worked with her for four years. He chose her as his running mate four years ago. For the president to have that kind of confidence is important to me.”\n\nForrester said Harris also holds as strong “strategic position” because she will inherit Biden’s $240 million cash on hand that his campaign reported at the end of June.\n\nThe Harris campaign took over the Biden campaign committee following Biden’s announcement to drop out.\n\n-- Joey Garrison and Melissa Brown\n\nPotential lawsuits to keep Biden as Democratic nominee would be fruitless: election experts\n\nRepublicans argued Democrats will be ignoring 14 million voters who supported President Joe Biden in the primaries after he declined to become the nominee, but election experts said Sunday that potential lawsuits aiming to keep Biden as the nominee would be fruitless.\n\n“Democrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters,”House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement. “After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket, trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters.”\n\nBut David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced election laws and is now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said potential lawsuits from Republicans or allies of former President Donald Trump couldn’t force the Democratic Party to stick with Biden because parties choose their own nominees.\n\n“These claims are less than frivolous,” Becker said. “That would not succeed and will not succeed in any state.”\n\nBiden was not yet the Democratic nominee because the party has not yet held its convention scheduled for late August. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that Colorado election officials couldn’t keep Trump off the state’s primary ballot because allowing states to set qualifications for federal office would lead to “chaos.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Who will be Kamala Harris' VP? Here's the possible contenders.\n\nJohn Kerry supports Kamala Harris as party’s next nominee\n\nJohn Kerry, former Secretary of State under the Obama administration, in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, indicated he will join in on supporting Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s next nominee.\n\n“President Biden deserves the gratitude of every American for his extraordinary presidency…I know how difficult today’s selfless decision must have been for someone who spent his entire life in service to country,” he said.\n\nHe added that “now is the time to listen to the only person who has ever beaten Donald Trump, and join with President Biden in every effort to make Vice President Harris the next President of the United States.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nElection expert says no way to hold more Democratic presidential primaries\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced elections law and who now advises state and local officials who conduct elections, slammed the door Sunday on the potential for holding more presidential primaries before the Democratic National Convention in late August, calling it a “fantasy.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee after winning state primaries. Some political analysts, such as GOP podcaster Mike Murphy, have suggested Vice President Kamala Harris would be a stronger nominee if she beat potential rivals in a new set of primaries.\n\n“She needs to become a winner, which means winning a nomination process,” Murphy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “That would give her a lot more strength coming out of the convention.”\n\nBut Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said states such as Arizona and Florida are still holding local primaries into September, so there is no way election officials could create a new set of primaries within days or weeks.\n\n“The idea that election officials who are already running elections could somehow put together a snap primary in days, and voters would know what to do and where to show up and to cast ballots for candidates we can’t even imagine who might be running is fantasy. There is no feasible way to hold any kind of primaries right now,” said Becker, who is also executive director of the Election Official Legal Defense Network. “There is no way to do open primaries.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nLaPhonza Butler, only Black woman serving in U.S. Senate, backs Harris\n\nCalifornia’s Laphonza Butler, the only Black woman serving in the U.S. Senate, applauded Biden’s service and urged support for Harris. Butler was tapped to serve in the seat when Biden picked Harris for his running mate.\n\n“The threat to all that progress remains, and we must now do everything we can to ensure Vice President Harris succeeds,’’ Butler, the first woman of color to head EMILY's List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, said in a statement. “There's no one better prepared for this challenge.’’\n\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, was the second Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Others vying to make similar history praised Harris’ bid for president.\n\nAngela Alsobrooks, a Democrat and a Black woman running for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, said she is 100% behind Harris.\n\n“She will provide a clear and stark contrast to the regressive vision Donald Trump has for this country,’’ she said in a statement. “She will make this race about the future and the kind of country our children deserve to inherit.”\n\n-- Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nHarris takes over Biden campaign committee\n\nThe former Biden campaign is now officially the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe campaign formerly known as Biden for President in a filing Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission changed its name to the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe move makes Harris’ bid for the Democratic nomination official, with her campaign apparently assuming control of Biden’s campaign funds. The move also allows Harris to begin raising money for her presidential bid. Harris named Keana Spencer her treasurer.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nEmily’s List endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nEmily’s List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“.@kamalaharris was made for this moment,” they wrote. “Throughout her career, she has been a steadfast fighter for women and reproductive freedom — a role that is more important than ever before.

The pledged delegates for each state are bound by state rules to vote for their candidate X number of times under state law,\" O'Brien explained. \"If Biden has enough to win, then he can decline, which will throw it immediately into a brokered convention. I don't know what it means with Harris on the ticket and much of this would come down to state law on whether or not she wins those pledged delegates.\"\n\n− Darren Samuelsohn\n\nNational Ice Cream Day: A fitting day for Biden\n\nIt’s no secret: Joe Biden loves ice cream.

Biden's voice sounded faint, he struggled to complete sentences and finish thoughts, and he failed to rebut many of Trump's claims on the debate stage.\n\nBiden's campaign was in a free fall over the past few weeks with his future in doubt. Instead of focusing solely on Trump, Democrats spent as much time and energy debating whether Biden could even defeat his predecessor.\n\nFundraising for the Biden campaign took a dramatic hit.

Here's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021 in a lightning takeover following the withdrawal of US troops, the radical Islamist group appeared keen to distance itself from its earlier period of rule in the 1990s, presenting itself as more moderate and committed to the internal peace process.\n\nAmong its new commitments, the Taliban pledged to honor women’s rights within the norms of “Islamic law.”\n\nThe group’s spokesman Suhail Shaheen said at the time that women would be allowed to continue their education up to university – a break from the strict restrictions under the Taliban regime that ruled between 1996 and 2001.\n\nThe promises of a softer approach were met with skepticism, both within the country and abroad. Over a million Afghans have reportedly fled since the Taliban retook power.\n\nSixteen months on, the Taliban appear to have reneged on their word. Women and girls are facing blanket bans on education after a series of decrees steadily eroded their rights in almost all aspects of life and upended the gains they had fought tirelessly for over the past two decades.\n\nJust days after retaking power, the Taliban reinstated the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice as a public morality watchdog tasked with enforcing the Taliban’s version of Islamic law. The ministry has since been central to the systematic chipping away of women’s rights in the country.\n\nHere are some of the ways women’s rights have been eroded:\n\nEducation\n\nThe Taliban announced on September 12, 2021, that women could attend universities with gender-segregated classrooms while wearing compulsory hijabs. But in March 2022, the government barred girls from attending secondary school. Girls’ secondary schools were set to resume on March 23, 2021, after months-long closures imposed after the Taliban takeover. The group ordered them shut just hours after they were due to reopen. The move devastated many students and their families, who described to CNN their dashed dreams of becoming doctors, teachers or engineers.\n\nIn its latest step in the clampdown on women’s education, the Taliban on Tuesday suspended university education for all female students. A letter published by the education ministry said the decision was made in a cabinet meeting and the order would go into effect immediately.\n\nA female student walks in front of a university in Kandahar province, Afghanistan, on December 21. The Taliban have banned university education for women nationwide, provoking condemnation from the United States and the United Nations. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPublic spaces\n\nWomen’s access to public spaces has been significantly curtailed under the Taliban.\n\nOn November 10, women were banned from entering all parks in Kabul. Women had previously been allowed to visit parks three days a week, and men on the remaining four. The new rules mean that women are no longer allowed to do so, even if accompanied by male relatives.\n\nThe same day, a Taliban official in Kabul announced that women would be barred from using gyms across the country. A spokesperson from the ministry of virtue said the ban was being introduced due to people ignoring segregation orders and women not wearing the hijab.\n\nWomen in Afghanistan can no longer work in most sectors. The Taliban ordered working women to stay at home after their seizure of power in August 2021, saying they were not safe in the presence of the group’s soldiers.\n\nTravel\n\nWomen’s right to travel within Afghanistan and abroad has also been restricted.\n\nLate last year, it was announced that women would require a male escort to travel long distances within the country. Any woman traveling further than 75 kilometers (46 miles) was required to be accompanied by a male chaperone. Mohammad Sadiq Hakif Mahajer, spokesman for the virtue ministry, told CNN at the time that the new law was meant to prevent women from coming to any harm or “disturbance.”\n\nThe new rules also called on drivers not to allow women who weren’t wearing the hijab into their cars.\n\nAnd in March, Afghanistan’s airlines were ordered to stop women from boarding flights unless accompanied by a male chaperone, Reuters reported.\n\nWomen’s attire\n\nThis summer, Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada ordered women to fully cover themselves, including their faces, in public. The decree suggested that women should stay at home where possible, as this was the “best option to observe the sharia hijab.”\n\nPrior to the order, hijabs were only mandatory for women studying at university and girls studying at secondary school. This was mandated in the immediate aftermath of the Taliban’s return to power, when the new government said female students, lecturers and women in employment must wear hijabs in accordance with the group’s interpretation of sharia law.\n\nTaliban authorities have also ordered female television journalists to cover their faces while presenting.\n\nA member of the Taliban replaces a sign of the Department for Women's Affairs with one of the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice at a government building in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in October 2021. Javed Tanveer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLegal setbacks\n\nSince sweeping back to power, the Taliban has abolished the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, a key body to promote women’s rights through law. In its place, the new regime set up the notorious Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, which has become instrumental in curtailing the rights of women.\n\nIt has also rolled back the Elimination of Violence against Women Law, signed in 2009 to protect women from abuses – including forced marriage, leaving them without recourse to justice, according to the UN.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nOver the past year, the Taliban’s restrictions on women have increased international concern and are likely to further isolate the country on the world stage.\n\nCommenting after the decision to ban women from university, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the move will “further alienate the Taliban from the international community and deny them the legitimacy they desire.”\n\nUS Ambassador Robert Wood, the alternate representative for special political affairs, echoed this sentiment, telling a United Nations Security Council briefing that the “Taliban cannot expect to be a legitimate member of the international community until they respect the rights of all Afghans, especially the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls.”\n\nThe restrictive new measures could stir further unrest within the country. In the wake of the ban on university education, women on Thursday took to the streets of Kabul to protest the decision. The Taliban arrested five women taking part in the protest, according to the BBC.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/07/26/afghanistan-beauty-salons-closed-by-taliban/70469710007/", "title": "Taliban closes beauty salons in Afghanistan, despite protests", "text": "Associated Press\n\nThe Taliban announced Tuesday that all beauty salons in Afghanistan must shut down now as a one-month deadline to close them ended, despite rare public opposition to the order. The ruling is the latest curb on the rights and freedoms of Afghan women and girls following edicts barring them from education, public spaces and most forms of employment.\n\nSadiq Akif Mahjer, spokesman for the Taliban-run Virtue and Vice Ministry, did not say whether it would use force against salons that do not comply.\n\nThe Taliban said it decided to ban beauty salons because they offered services forbidden by Islam and caused economic hardship for the families of grooms during wedding festivities. Among those services is eyebrow shaping, the use of other people’s hair to augment a woman’s natural hair and the application of makeup, which it said interferes with the ablutions required before offering prayers.\n\nGrooms’ families have been required by custom to pay for pre-wedding salon visits by brides and their close female relatives.\n\nIts earlier announcement of a one-month deadline for salons to wind down their businesses led to a rare public protest in which dozens of beauticians and makeup artists gathered in Kabul, the capital. Security forces used fire hoses and tasers and shot their guns into the air to break up the protest.\n\nThe announcement had come just a few days after the Taliban had said that they were working for the betterment of women in the county.\n\nMore:A female soccer player flees the Taliban, and finds a new life in Worcester\n\nUnited Nations protests\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations said it was engaged with Afghanistan authorities to get the prohibition reversed.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he supports efforts by the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), which has called on the de facto authorities to reconsider closing beauty salons.\n\n“UNAMA has said that this restriction on women’s rights will impact negatively on the economy and contradicts support for women’s entrepreneurship, and we’re seeking a reversal of the bans,” U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Monday.\n\nThe ban also drew concern from international groups worried about its impact on female entrepreneurs.\n\n“This isn’t about getting your hair and nails done. This is about 60,000 women losing their jobs. This is about women losing one of the only places they could go for community and support after the Taliban systematically destroyed the whole system put in place to respond to domestic violence,” said Heather Barr, associate women’s rights director for the New York-based group Human Rights Watch.\n\nDespite initial promises of a more moderate rule than during their previous time in power in the 1990s, the Taliban have imposed harsh measures since seizing control of Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces pulled out.\n\nThey have barred women from public spaces such as parks and gyms and cracked down on media freedoms. The measures have triggered fierce international criticism, increasing the country’s isolation at a time when its economy has collapsed, and worsening a humanitarian crisis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/08/29/harris-biden-us-withdrawal-afghanistan-taliban/74954296007/", "title": "Abandoned by Biden and Harris, Afghan women suffer under Taliban", "text": "It's hard to believe that in 2024, millions of women aren't allowed to attend school past age 12, to bare their faces on the street or even to speak while in public.\n\nYet, that is the case for women in Afghanistan, living under the Taliban's terror-inducing rule.\n\nFor the Biden-Harris administration, the consequences of America's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 still echo today.\n\nWill Vice President Kamala Harris be held accountable in this year's election for the administration's chaotic retreat, which enabled the Taliban to seize power again? It's doubtful.\n\nThe Taliban strip women of equal rights, dignity\n\nLast week, Taliban rulers formally codified strict new morality policies into law, including a ban on a woman's ability to speak and bare their faces in public.\n\n\"According to this law, the Ministry (for Prevention of Vice and Propagation of Virtue) is obligated to promote good and forbid evil in accordance with Islamic Sharia,\" the Justice Ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe new laws are set out in a 35-article document regulating every aspect of Afghans' lives. Article 13 requires that women veil their bodies and cover their faces in public and that their clothes cannot be form-fitting or short. Women are also banned from singing, reciting or reading aloud in public. They also cannot look at men who they are not related to by blood or marriage.\n\nThe rules affect men, too. All men must grow beards, and no one can play music in their cars.\n\nThe media also must abide by sharia law; the publication of images containing living beings is now banned.\n\nPenalties for violations include \"warnings of divine punishment, verbal threats, confiscation of property, detention for one hour to three days in public jails, and any other punishment deemed appropriate.\"\n\nAfghan woman athlete:I'm proud to compete at the Olympics despite the Taliban\n\nWhere's the outcry from women in America?\n\nAfghan women have long endured abuse at the hands of the Taliban, who first seized full control of the country in 1996. But after the terrorist attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, American and allied forces pushed the Taliban from power.\n\nThat set off two decades of war that ended with the Afghan government's collapse and the Taliban's return to rule in 2021, soon after President Joe Biden ordered U.S. forces to abandon the country.\n\nSince then, the Taliban have steadily escalated restrictions on human rights, including banning females older than 12 to receive an education.\n\nDespite these atrocities, there has been little outcry recently from women's groups in America, where gender parity has made extraordinary progress in the past few decades. Their silence about the suffering of Afghan women is stunning.\n\nHow is this justice?Judge sends sex trafficking victim who fought back to prison.\n\nAt the Democratic National Convention last week, a Planned Parenthood mobile clinic was on site to offer abortion pills to women and vasectomies for men. Though Planned Parenthood released a statement on Israel and Gaza in December, my search on the organization's website for a statement on Afghanistan or the Taliban turned up zero results.\n\nWhile Afghanistan may seem far from the United States, that distance should not encourage silence. In fact, it is because women in America enjoy so many rights that we should be the first to speak in defense of fellow women stripped of basic human rights by a radical regime.\n\nBiden and Harris are responsible for the Taliban's takeover\n\nBiden, along with Harris, initiated a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan that resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and more than 100 Afghans when a bomb explode near the Kabul airport.\n\nThe disorganized exit meant that the U.S. military abandoned up to 200 U.S. citizens and tens of thousands of Afghan allies to oppression under Taliban rule.\n\nDuring Harris' DNC acceptance speech Thursday night, the Democratic presidential nominee left out any mention of the botched withdrawal and Afghanistan's ongoing suffering. She did claim that her administration would be pro-military and tough on tyrants. How could she be tough on tyrants but silent about the Taliban?\n\nBefore America's sudden exit, Afghan women were able to attend schools and universities and even hold elected office. Now, they face terrible oppression that denies them basic human dignity.\n\nHarris should be held accountable for America's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and for the devastating cruelty the administration's choices unleashed.\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY.

No, the crowd replied.\n\nTrump added a notable name to his Democratic attack list: former first lady Michelle Obama, who ripped the former president in a weekend speech.\n\n\"She was nasty,\" Trump told the Atlanta crowd.\n\nThe former first lady told Harris supporters about Trump: \"I hope that you’ll forgive me if I’m a little angry that we are indifferent to his erratic behavior, his obvious mental decline, his history as a convicted felon, a known slum lord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse, all of this while we pick apart Kamala’s answers from interviews that he doesn’t even have the courage to do.\"\n\nReplied Trump: \"That was a big mistake she made.\" He did not elaborate.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nTrump: Harris running a 'campaign of demonization and hate'\n\nAt one point, former President Donald Trump accused Vice President Kamala Harris of \"running a campaign of demonization and hate,\" drawing accusations of hypocrisy. \"She's a hater,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats pointed out that Trump is the one who has attacked Harris' intelligence, ethnicity, and competence.\n\nEarlier, Harris said Trump is \"fixated on his grievances, on himself and on dividing our country,\" citing Sunday's Madison Square Garden rally as the latest example.\n\n\"It is absolutely something that is intended to and is fanning the fuel of trying to divide our country,\" Harris said.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nJohn Legend calls Trump a 'career con artist'\n\nJohn Legend on Monday opened for a concert and rally supporting Vice President Kamal Harris at Temple University's Liacouras Center in Philadelphia, with the musician saying the Democratic presidential nominee would be a president for \"every American\" if elected.\n\n\"The contrast could not be clearer,\" Legend said, adding that former President Donald Trump was focused on serving Wall Street, billionaires, big corporations, and \"whichever dictator wrote him a nice note or gave him a hug.\"\n\nThe voters have a choice, Legend said — they could either pick Harris or \"you can stand with a career con artist who's far more interested in himself than in you.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and rockstar Bruce Springsteen are scheduled to attend the Philadelphia event.\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nMichelle Obama to campaign for Harris on Saturday\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama will stump for Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania, the Harris campaign announced Monday night.

Some Democrats thought Trump's remarks referred to the House's role in settling — or perhaps trying to overturn — contested election results for the White House.\n\n\"It's incumbent upon them to be transparent and to tell the voters exactly what their secret is, and if it is not an effort to overturn the election with Mike Johnson as the Speaker of the House, then tell us what it is,\" said Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who before being elected to Congress served as a federal prosecutor and later a lead counsel during Trump's first impeachment.\n\nBut the Trump campaign said the former president was simply referring to a campaign strategy in which he tunes in to virtual rallies in key House districts that will determine which party controls the chamber for the next two years.\n\n\"President Trump has done countless tele-rallies reaching millions of Americans across the country in key regions that also helps bolster Republicans in congressional races,\" said Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung.\n\n— Riley Beggin and Josh Meyer\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries blasts Trump rally as 'racist'\n\nTop House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement that former President Donald Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden Sunday featured \"racist, dangerous and un-American statements\" from the president's supporters.\n\n\"The unadulterated hatred directed at Puerto Ricans, the Jewish community, women, Latinos, African-Americans, Muslim Americans and decent people of every race by Donald Trump and far right extremists is disqualifying,\" he said. \"These people are unfit to govern and must forever be banished to the dustbin of history in November.\"\n\nComedian Tony Hinchliffe who spoke before Trump on Sunday, referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage,” joked about a Black person in the crowd “carving watermelons” and said Latinos don't use birth control. Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson falsely referred to Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is half-Black and half Indian-American as “Samoan-Malaysian” and a “low IQ former California prosecutor.” Businessman Grant Cardone referred to Harris's nonexistent “pimp handlers.”\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nWhat are the swing states? See polling, past results for key states for 2024 presidential election\n\nJust more than a week away from Nov. 5, all eyes are on seven states that are likely to decide the 2024 presidential election.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been cycling through these battleground states hosting rallies, giving interviews and bringing celebrities along for the ride, as they try to persuade any remaining undecided voters and mobilize their supporters.\n\nNational polls and state polls alike are showing an incredibly close race. That means small margins of voters in these states could have big consequences for the Electoral College. Here is what to know about the battleground states: Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump to Christians: Get out there and vote\n\nDuring a religious summit near Atlanta, Trump talked about the role of faith in his life − particularly in surviving the July 12 assassination attempt − and in the presidential election.\n\n“We have to get all the Christians to get out there and vote,\" Trump told the supportive group.\n\nTrump, who is counting on religious voters in Georgia and other battleground states, said Christians don't always turn out for elections.\n\n\"I shouldn't scold anyone,\" he said, \"but Christians aren't known for being very solid voters, you know.\"\n\nFaith summit organizers ended the event by praying with Trump.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nHarris campaign turns Trump comedian’s Puerto Rico insult into TV ad\n\nThe Harris campaign quickly seized on a highly ridiculed insult about Puerto Rico from a comedian during Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, turning the remark into a 30-second television ad.\n\nThe new ad features a clip of comedian Tony Hinchliffe referring to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage” before Trump is heard saying, “Puerto Rico.”\n\n“I will never forget what Donald Trump did,” Harris says in the ad as she criticizes Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria in 2017 while he was president. “He abandoned the island and offered nothing more than paper towels and insults. Americans deserve better.”\n\nThe Harris campaign has highlighted the insult in its appeal to Puerto Rican voters, who represent a significant share of voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nMariah Carey joins Kerry Washington for GOTV video\n\nThe Queen of Christmas will need to wait just a little longer.\n\nMariah Carey posted a playful video on social media Monday of her singing the intro of the song “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” before Kerry Washington burst into view.\n\n“No, no, no, no, no. It’s not your season yet,” Washington says, decked out in a VOTE shirt and hat. “It’s voting season.” She proceeds to ask Carey if the pop star has registered and made a plan to vote.\n\nMore:Actress Kerry Washington says voters are 'the real fixers' at Wisconsin stop for Harris\n\n“It’s my season, before it’s her season,” Washington joked. The actress previously played a political uber-fixer on the hit-show Scandal and has been campaigning for Kamala Harris.\n\n“So now all we need is youuuuu,” the pair sang.\n\n–Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris to sit with host Charlamagne tha God for second interview\n\nHarris will sit down with radio host Charlamagne tha God on Tuesday morning for an interview a week out from Election Day, the Hill reported. The interview will air at 7 a.m. on his radio show “The Breakfast Club.”\n\nThis marks Harris’ second interview in weeks with the popular host. Earlier this month, he hosted an “audio town hall” with her in Detroit, where she faced wide-ranging questions about her candidacy and the 2024 race.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMore:Harris says she remains open to reparations in interview with Charlamagne Tha God: 5 moments\n\nTrump attends 'National Faith Advisory Board Summit' near Atlanta\n\nBefore his rally tonight outside Atlanta, Trump made a stop at a religious forum hosted by former spiritual adviser Paula White.\n\n\"That is a lot of religion out there,\" Trump told the cheering crowd at the inaugural National Faith Advisory Board Summit.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nMore:An Ohio college was in crisis. Then presidential politics made things worse.\n\nJD Vance responds to racist, vulgar comments from Trump’s MSG rally\n\nDuring a Wisconsin campaign event on Monday, Republican Vice-Presidential nominee JD Vance responded to racist and crude remarks about Puerto Rico, Blacks, Jews and women made at Donald Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, saying that “we need to stop being so offended at every little thing in the United States of America.”\n\n“I’m so over it,” Vance said, of the outraged response.\n\nVance was asked by a reporter about how he and Trump would unite the country if they are elected, after Trump’s rally on Sunday night. where speakers called Kamala Harris the “antichrist” and “the devil” and a comedian made racist jokes.\n\nVance, who also spoke at the Madison Square Garden rally, said he had not yet listened to the controversial comments.\n\nEarlier in his speech on Monday, Vance argued that Harris was “endangering the life” of Trump. He criticized Harris for calling Trump a fascist and her running mate, Tim Walz, for comparing Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally to a pro-Nazi event.\n\n–Karissa Waddick\n\nMore:Steve Bannon, to be released from prison on Tuesday after 4-month sentence\n\nWho is Tony Hinchcliffe, aka 'Kill Tony, the Trump-supporting comedian?\n\nComedian Tony Hinchcliffe, known as Kill Tony, has been known for years for his offensive material, but he became front page news on Sunday night at a rally for Donald Trump thanks to comment targeting Latinos, Blacks and Jews one week from Election Day.\n\n\"I don't know if you know this, but there's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now,\" Hinchcliffe said in New York City. \"I think it's called Puerto Rico.\"\n\nHe went on to say that Latinos \"love making babies\" and made a vulgar remark about immigrants entering the country.\n\nThe 40-year-old proceeded to point out a Black man out in the crowd, claiming the two had \"carved watermelons together.\"\n\nMore:Donald Trump is in a strong poll position - does it matter?\n\nThe Trump campaign has attempted to distance itself from the comedian. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt took to Fox News where she dismissed Hinchcliffe's comments.\n\n\"It was a comedian who made a joke in poor taste,\" she said Monday morning. \"Obviously that joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or our campaign.\"\n\nHinchcliffe's comments have sparked outrage and criticism from both sides of the aisle and he has long been known for his insult-style comedy, as a recurring figure on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" and garnering millions of subscribers on his own weekly podcast \"Kill Tony.\"\n\n−Sam Woodward\n\nWalz rips Trump over 'garbage can' of the world remark\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz tore into former President Donald Trump at a Monday event in Waukesha, Wisc. for saying the U.S. is the \"garbage can for the world\" in a speech last week.\n\n\"Very difficult to love this country when Donald Trump can only love himself. That's why he has a difficult time doing that,\" the Democratic vice presidential nominee told a small group of invited Kamala Harris supporters at the Co-Pilot Cafe.\n\n\"Their closing argument last night was clear to the rest of the world. It's about hate, it's about division, it's about, dividing us,\" Walz said, referring to the former president's Sunday night rally at Madison Square Garden in New York. The event featured several speakers who made racist comments about Harris, Puerto Ricans, Latinos in general, and Blacks.\n\nWalz said that, while the Harris campaign has a to-do list, \"Donald Trump has an enemies list. It just gets longer and longer every day.\"\n\nHe spoke after Waukesha Mayor Sean Reilly, a lifelong Republican who became an independent after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and recently endorsed Harris.\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nMore:Trump vows to go after his enemies if elected. Meet two enforcers ready to carry that out\n\nNevada Supreme Court upholds counting mail ballots without postmarks after Election Day\n\nThe Nevada Supreme Court ruled Monday the state could count mailed ballots that arrive without a postmark up to three days after Election Day.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and former President Donald Trump’s campaign committee had sought to block the counting on ballots without postmarks. But the high court noted that state law says if “the date of the postmark cannot be determined,” ballots received within three days of Election Day “shall be deemed to have been postmarked on or before the day of the election.”\n\nTossup states such as Nevada have become a legal battleground over rules in the closely contested election. Republicans have focused many of their cases on the rules for voter registration and counting mailed ballots.\n\nBut few votes are at stake in the postmark dispute because only 24 arrived that way during the primary, according to the trial judge.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Election official in Reno, Nevada tells AP she was forced out before 2024 election\n\nTrump to address the press on Tuesday morning\n\nThe Trump campaign has been secretive about this week's non-rally schedule as Election Day nears on Nov. 5. But it did let one cat partially out of the bag Monday: The Republican presidential nominee will be speaking with the media on Tuesday.\n\nTrump \"will deliver remarks to the press in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday,\" said a short announcement. The event takes place at his Mar-a-Lago home.\n\nNo word on topic or whether he will take questions.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nBallot box attack an ‘attempt to disenfranchise,’ Washington state Dems chair says\n\nWashington state’s Democratic leader is speaking out after reports that hundreds of votes were destroyed after a ballot box was set on fire early Monday morning.\n\nAuthorities, including the FBI, are investigating after someone allegedly stuck an incendiary device to a ballot box at a public transit center in Vancouver, Washington, which ignited flames, according to local news reports. The result is hundreds of burned ballots, elections officials said.\n\nShasti Conrad, chair of the state Democratic Party, said in a statement to USA TODAY that this represents “an attempt to disenfranchise” voters. State Democrats trut that law enforcement and other officials will \"find those responsible and hold them accountable,\" she added.\n\nThe attack in Washington is the second ballot box fire that police have responded to in the Pacific Northwest region. In nearby Portland, police responded to a fire at a ballot box on Monday morning at an elections office.\n\nConrad and others stressed how people concerned about their ballot was destroyed should check its status at VoteWA.gov or by calling their county's auditor or elections department to find out where their ballot is in the process of being counted. To get a replacement ballot, Washington state voters can call the Clark County elections office at 564-397-2345 or send an email to elections@clark.wa.gov.\n\n−Phillip M. Bailey\n\nKids pick Harris in Nickelodeon contest to win the presidency\n\nChildren across the country selected Kamala Harris to win the White House in Nickelodeon’s nationwide “Kids Pick the President” contest, the network announced Monday.The virtual survey of more than 32,000 of the nation’s children showed 52% supported Harris and 48% supported Donald Trump. The contest is intended for entertainment purposes only and is not a scientific poll. “Kids Pick the President” has accurately predicted the outcome of every election but two since 1988. Kids chose John Kerry over George W. Bush in 2004 and Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016.\n\nVoters in the 2024 election must be 18 years old on or before Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\n- Rachel Barber\n\nHarris to Black men: You’re not in Trump’s club\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris warned Black men thinking about backing former President Donald Trump in 2024 that her Republican rival doesn’t care about them like she does.\n\n“Part of what we have to help people understand is, don't think you're in Donald Trump's club,” Harris, the Democratic nominee, told football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe in an interview on his podcast, “Club Shay Shay.”\n\n“You're not,\" she added. \"He's not going to be thinking about you.”\n\nHarris specifically brought up racial disparities in colon cancer and prostate cancer deaths, and the need to do medical screenings. According to the American Cancer Society, Black men are about 40% more likely to die from colon cancer than other groups and 70% more likely to die from prostate cancer.\n\nBoth candidates have rushed to popular podcasts as a strategy to reach undecided voters in this razor-thin contest.\n\nHarris and her allies have been keen on making direct appeals to Black men as surveys for months have shown Trump making slight gains with segments of that demographic. A recent ABC News/Ipsos survey, however, showed Harris winning 85% of the Black male vote.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\n‘Fixated on his grievances’: Harris responds to Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally\n\nVice President Kamala Harris accused Republican nominee Donald Trump of “fanning the fuel of trying to divide our country” in response to the former president’s campaign rally at Madison Square Garden that included racist remarks from speakers.\n\n“Donald Trump's event in Madison Square Garden really highlighted a point that I've been making throughout this campaign,” Harris said Monday before boarding Air Force Two to head to Saginaw, Michigan.\n\n“He is focused and fixated on his grievances, on himself and on dividing our country and it is not in any way, something that will strengthen the American family, the American worker,” Harris said.\n\nComedian Tony Hinchliffe, among the speakers at the Sunday night Madison Square Garden event in New York, referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage,” and joked about a Black person in the crowd “carving watermelons.”\n\nConservative commentator Tucker Carlson provided a made-up ethnicity for Harris in his remarks, calling her “Samoan-Malaysian” and a “low IQ former California prosecutor.” In his speech, businessman Grant Cardone said Harris has “pimp handlers.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden casts last ballot as president\n\nPresident Joe Biden cast his early-voting ballot in the 2024 general election on Monday, his last as president.\n\nThe president waited in line at the Department of Elections office in Wilmington, Delaware, with about 50 people ahead of him. He chatted with people as he waited his turn.\n\nAfter casting his vote, he shook hands with few people and posed for a photo. Asked if the experience was bittersweet, he said it \"just sweet.\"\n\nBiden decided to abandon his plans to seek re-election in July after a disastrous debate performance, paving the way for his Vice President Kamala Harris to win the Democratic nomination.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus condemns Puerto Rico insults at Donald Trump's rally\n\nTony Hinchliffe, a comedian who called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage\" at a Trump rally Sunday night, was leveling \"a direct attack on countless hardworking Americans,\" a caucus representing Hispanic members of Congress said in a statement Monday.\n\n\"This type of language emboldens prejudice, encourages violence, and undermines the values of unity and respect that our country is built on,\" CHC Chair Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif. said. \"It’s deeply troubling to see Republican leaders celebrate this rhetoric instead of promoting unity and truth.\"\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus has an all-Democratic membership, while Republicans have their own Congressional Hispanic Conference.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nElon Musk and his PAC sued by Philadelphia DA over $1 million giveaway\n\nPhiladelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner sued Elon Musk and his political action committee Monday to stop them from giving away $1 million each day to a swing state registered voter who signs their petition.\n\n\"America PAC and Musk are lulling Philadelphia citizens ... to give up their personal identifying information and make a political pledge in exchange for the chance to win $1 million,\" according to the legal complaint.\n\nThe lottery violates Pennsylvania's law requiring all lotteries in the state to be regulated by the government, according to the complaint. It also allegedly violates Pennsylvania consumer protection laws because Musk and his America PAC \"have not published a complete set of lottery rules or shown how they are protecting the privacy of participants’ personal information.\"\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department has already sent the PAC a warning letter, saying the giveaway could violate federal election law, according to a Wednesday CNN report. Federal law prohibits paying people to register to vote, and some legal experts say the giveaway could violate that law because you have to be registered to sign the petition.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi and Josh Meyer\n\nSteve Bannon to be released from prison Tuesday\n\nSteve Bannon, former White House chief strategist under the Trump administration, will be released from a Connecticut prison on Tuesday – a week out from Election Day – after serving a four month sentence.\n\nHe reported to prison for contempt of Congress after defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. He was also fined $6,500.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Bart Jansen\n\nActress Kerry Washington says voters are 'the real fixers' at Wisconsin stop for Harris\n\nWisconsin needed handling. So the Harris campaign sent Kerry Washington.\n\nWashington, who played the fictional uber-fixer Olivia Pope on the hit ABC series \"Scandal,\" rallied Kamala Harris supporters on Sunday as an exclusive new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll showed a dead heat in Wisconsin between the vice president and former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Harris campaign is leaving nothing to chance in the Midwest in the final days of the presidential race and has been putting every celebrity and national politician available on the road.\n\n\"You here in Wisconsin have the capacity to save the soul of this county, to really stand between us and a man who has said that he wants to be a dictator on day one, to stand between us and a man who said he wants generals more like Hitler’s generals,\" Washington told a roomful of Black women on Sunday at a private Harris campaign event at a cafe.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nCan early votes be counted before Election Day?\n\nLaws that dictate when early votes are received, processed and counted vary by state.\n\nSome places, like Alabama, Washington, D.C. and Idaho cannot begin counting votes until after the polls close on Election Day. Others, like Florida, Arizona and Nevada, can begin processing days before. Releasing results early is a felony in some states.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nVirginia asks Supreme Court to allow purge of suspected noncitizens from voter rolls\n\nVirginia Republicans have asked the Supreme Court to let them reinstate a purge of suspected noncitizens from voter rolls.\n\nVirginia Attorney General Jason Miyares filed an emergency petition with the high court hours after a federal appeals court on Sunday upheld a lower court's ruling stopping the purge.\n\nU.S. District Judge Patricia Giles on Friday blocked a state program that had removed about 1,500 names since Aug. 7 because federal law prohibits voter purges within 90 days of an election. She also ordered the state to restore the registrations of those canceled during that period.\n\nMiyares told the high court that decision violates \"Virginia law and common sense.\" He asked for a high court decision by Tuesday.\n\n– Bart Jansen and Maureen Groppe\n\nDonald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally sparks backlash\n\nDonald Trump's campaign stops on Monday come after his highly-touted Madison Square Garden rally courted controversy. A warm-up act from a comedian sparked a political furor with a key constituency Trump is hoping to win over in his bid for a second term in the White House.\n\nDuring the early stages of the rally, the comedian Tony Hinchliffe, who goes by the stage name Kill Tony, mocked Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage” and also said Latino people have too many children. While Trump's campaign later sought to distance itself from the joke, it had already garnered condemnation from fellow Republicans, major celebrities and others.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nHarris would take cognitive test, says Trump should too\n\nHarris said she would take a cognitive test, and challenged Trump to take one as well, in an interview with CBS over the weekend.\n\nTrump called for Harris to take and \"pass a test on Cognitive Stamina and Agility,\" in a post on Truth Social earlier this month. He wrote at the time, \"she is slow and lethargic in answering even the easiest of questions.\"\n\nHarris hit back, telling CBS anchor Norah O’Donnell, \"This is what he has resorted to.\n\n“And I think he actually is increasingly unstable and unhinged,” she continued, “and has resorted to name calling because he actually has no plan for the American people,\"\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nSenate poll roundup: Republicans remain ahead in Montana, ties in Pennsylvania and Michigan\n\nSeveral new polls released Monday and over the weekend show Democrats have an advantage in Arizona and Wisconsin's Senate races, while Republicans have an edge Montana, Nebraska and Texas.\n\nAnd two new polls from InsiderAdvantage in Pennsylvania and Michigan show Senate races there in a statistical tie. In Michigan, Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin has consistently polled a few percentage points ahead of her opponent, former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers.\n\nThe race in Pennsylvania has been tighter, with incumbent Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, typically polling around one percentage point above GOP candidate David McCormick.\n\nA poll from The Hill and Emerson College show Montana GOP candidate Tim Sheehy ahead of incumbent Sen. Jon Tester by four percentage points in the race that is likely to determine control of the U.S. Senate next year. Sheehy has consistently polled ahead of Tester in the state.\n\nIncumbent Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Deb Fischer of Nebraska also remained ahead in polls against challengers in their states, according to a poll from the New York Times and Siena College.\n\nRep. Reuben Gallego, D-Ariz., remained ahead in polling against GOP candidate Kari Lake according to a poll from Trafalgar Group and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., ahead of GOP challenger Eric Hovde by two percentage points in Wisconsin, according to a poll from USA TODAY and Suffolk University.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWhen do we find out who won the election?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nHow many days until Election Day? See the countdown clock\n\nThere are just eight days until Election Day on Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nAre schools closed on Election Day?\n\nIt depends on your school or district, as well as the state where you live. However, many public schools will be closed for Election Day, which is Nov. 5.\n\nSchools across the country are used as polling places where voters can cast their ballots on Election Day, along with community centers and other local gathering places.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat time do polls open on Election Day?\n\nIt depends where you live.\n\nIn some states like Arizona and Connecticut, polling locations can open as early as 6 a.m. on Election Day, which is Nov. 5. In other places, locations will open later in the morning, at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m.\n\nYou can find your polling location and its hours by contacting your state and local election office or visiting usa.gov for more information.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nJB Pritzker hits Donald Trump after former president's allies accuse him of fascism\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker says Donald Trump “demonstrates all of the qualities of somebody who is using peoples’ fears to advance a cause that is antidemocratic” but declined on Sunday to directly label him a fascist.\n\n“You can put whatever label you want on it, but you’ve heard him say antidemocratic things,” Pritzker told USA TODAY. “And at the same time, he says things that are motivational to some of the worst elements of peoples’ thinking – racism, sexism, you know, xenophobia, the concern about immigrants and so on.”\n\nPritzker added, “So there’s no doubt that you can take some quotes of Donald Trump’s and read them in the most extreme texts that there are out there, and say, he must be reading those, or someone is telling him those, and he is drawn to them.”\n\nThe governor's comments came after former White House chief of staff John Kelly in an interview with The New York Times last week said the 2024 presidential candidate fits the bill for a fascist.\n\nLast year, after Trump pledged to root out fascists and referred to liberals as “vermin,\" Pritzker said the Republican’s comments were “frightening to those of us who know the history of Europe in the 1930s and 40s.” Kamala Harris said last week on CNN that she thinks Trump is a “fascist.\"\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump-aligned group is already planning lawsuits over election results\n\nA Trump-aligned group that has filed lawsuits in several swing states challenging voter registration lists is already planning to sue over this year's election results, one of the group's founders told USA TODAY.\n\n\"We feel compelled to file in defense of this beautiful country,\" said Marly Hornik, who co-founded United Sovereign Americans in 2023. \"We already have signs and numbers coming in of errors inside of the process.\"\n\nThe organization, which describes itself as nonpartisan, is regularly represented by Bruce Castor, a lawyer for former President Donald Trump in his impeachment trial for the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Lawsuits from both the group and Republican organizations suggest widespread voter fraud could be happening – without providing proof that it is.\n\nThe claims feed into the false narrative from Trump that he didn't lose the 2020 election, which critics fear is a precursor to claiming similar election theft if he loses again. Numerous counts and audits showed President Joe Biden won the last presidential election. Nearly all of more than 60 lawsuits from Trump allies in the wake of that election failed.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nNew polls show slim leads for Republicans in Nebraska and Texas Senate races\n\nNew polls from The New York Times/Siena College, conducted between Oct. 23 and Oct. 26, show tight Senate races in both Nebraska and Texas.\n\nIn Texas, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a Trump-endorsed, two-term incumbent is leading his Democratic opponent Rep. Colin Allred 50% to 46% among 1,180 voters in Texas, according to the poll. Democrats have been eyeing the seat as one they could possibly flip to keep control of the Senate, pouring millions of dollars into the race.\n\nIn Nebraska, Republican Sen. Deb Fischer is leading her independent opponent Dan Osborn 48% to 46% among 1,194 voters in Nebraska. Five percent of likely voters said they were undecided or didn’t answer.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nCourt rejects Mississippi’s 5-day grace period for mailed ballots − but policy for 2024 is uncertain\n\nA federal appeals court revived a Republican lawsuit against Mississippi’s grace period for mailed ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they arrive up to five days after Election Day.\n\nBut the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t block the state law that allowed the grace period. Instead, the appeals court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola for further review.\n\nGuirola had rejected the lawsuit in the July from the state and national Republican Parties that challenged the grace period approved during the COVID pandemic. “The upshot: These statutes ‘mandate holding all elections for Congress and the Presidency on a single day throughout the Union,’” Judge Andrew Oldham wrote for the three-judge appeals panel.\n\nIf the case were appealed to the Supreme Court it could potentially have brought implications because more than a dozen states have grace periods for mailed ballots postmarked by Election Day to arrive up to 10 days afterward.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nCourt refuses to revive Virginia policy to remove suspected noncitizens from voter rolls\n\nA federal appeals court on Sunday rejected a Republican case from Virginia that sought to reinstate a purge of suspected noncitizens from voter rolls.\n\nU.S. District Judge Patricia Giles on Friday had halted the state program that removed about 1,500 names since Aug. 7 because federal law prohibits removing names from voter rolls within 90 days of an election. She also ordered the registration of those who were removed to be restored.\n\nThe state appealed but the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Giles’ ruling.\n\n\"For the second time in three days, a federal court ruled Virginia's purge of eligible citizens is unlawful,” said Ryan Snow, a lawyer with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “We urge the Supreme Court to stop this madness and make it clear that it is unacceptable to block eligible citizens from voting.\"\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nHarris and Trump locked in a dead heat in key battleground state, new poll shows\n\nA new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that Trump and Harris are almost tied in Wisconsin, 48% to 47%, among 500 likely voters. The results are within the poll’s margin of error of 4.4 percentage points. The poll was conducted Oct. 20 to 23.\n\nIn Door County, Wisconsin, which has been a bellwether for the state, Harris has a slight edge. Harris leads Trump in that area, 50% to 47%, the poll of 300 likely Door County voters found. The results are still within the margin of error of 5.7 percentage points.\n\nWisconsin, which has 10 electoral votes, is among several important swing states that both Trump and Harris are eyeing to help catapult them to the presidency.\n\n− Rebecca Morin and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDoes Puerto Rico vote in the 2024 presidential race?\n\nNo, Puerto Rican residents cannot vote for president.\n\nThey can help choose each party's nominee for president, however. The political parties have the ability to include them in the primary selection process.\n\nTrump won Puerto Rico's 2024 GOP primary, winning 23 of the territory's Republican delegates.\n\nWhile Puerto Ricans on the island can’t vote for President, more than two-thirds of Boricuas live in the United States where they can vote for president.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMore:Does Puerto Rico vote for president? What to know about the island's role in the election\n\nTrump faces backlash from Bad Bunny, Puerto Ricans amid fight for Latino vote\n\nPuerto Ricans, including Grammy-winning artists Bad Bunny and Ricky Martin, widely condemned Trump after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who goes by the stage name Kill Tony, derided the island as a “floating island of garbage” at the former president’s campaign rally in Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe backlash comes as Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris are locked in a tight race - and are counting on Latino voters to help get them to the White House. Puerto Rican voters living in the United States make up the second largest Latino group in the country, including in key battleground states like Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the face of a growing uproar, senior Trump advisor Danielle Alvarez on Sunday night issued a statement addressing Hinchcliffe's bit. “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,” she said.\n\n− Rebecca Morin and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhere do Trump, Harris stand in the polls?\n\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris are neck-and-neck in national polls. Trump leads Harris by 0.1 percentage points in Real Clear Politics' average of national polls, well within the margin of error of each survey included.\n\nIt's also a tight race in battleground states across the country. For example, according to Real Clear Politics' average of polls in Michigan, Trump leads by just 0.2 percentage points.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nElection Day is Nov. 5.

She represented Uganda in the 2011 and 2013 World Cross Championships in Punta Umbria and Bydgoszcz, The Standard reported.\n\nIn 2022, she won the Padova marathon in Italy, according to Kenyan online news site TUKO.co.ke. Cheptegei also won gold at the World Mountain and Trail Running Championships in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in 2022, The BBC reported.\n\nCheptegei posted her fastest marathon performance (2:22:47) to place second in the Abu Dhabi marathon in December 2022. That time ranks her as the second-fastest female Ugandan marathoner of all time, according to World Athletics statistics.\n\nHer mother, Agnes Ndiema-Cheptegei, described her daughter as \"a good child, very polite and she didn't have a lot of issues,\" Reuters reported.\n\nWhat happened to Rebecca Cheptegei?\n\nPolice said Cheptegei was attacked by a boyfriend, Dickson Ndiema Marangach, who snuck into Cheptegei's home in Endebess in western Kenya ahead of the attack while she and her two children were at church, Kenyan and Ugandan newspapers reported.\n\n\"Upon returning, Dickson, who had procured petrol, began pouring it on Rebecca before he set her ablaze,\" Trans-Nzoia County police commander Jeremiah Ole Kosiom told The Star newspaper in Nairobi, Kenya. “The two were rescued by neighbors who put out the fire and rushed them to hospital.\"\n\nMarangach was also burnt in the attack, which police described as a domestic dispute. He is still in intensive care but is improving and stable, the BBC reported.\n\nJoseph Cheptegei, Cheptegei's father, said her daughter and Marangach had been separated for a long time and were involved in a land dispute involving her land in western Kenya. The two were scheduled to appear before the Directorate of Criminal Investigations in Kenya, The Standard reported.\n\n\"The land … has brought problems,\" he told reporters Thursday, adding that he was asking the government to protect her children and properties \"so that no one will get into her home and take anything.\"\n\nKosiom confirmed Rebecca Cheptegei and Marangach had quarrels over her land and said police are continuing to investigate.\n\nRebecca Cheptegei is third woman athlete to die in Kenya in 3 years\n\nCheptegei was the third elite female athlete killed in Kenya since October 2021.\n\nPeter Ogwang, Uganda's minister of state for sports, said Kenyan authorities were investigating the killing, which has shone a spotlight on violence experienced by women in the East African nation.\n\nKenyan Sports Minister Kipchumba Murkomen described her death as a loss \"to the entire region\".\n\n\"This tragedy is a stark reminder that we must do more to combat gender-based violence in our society, which in recent years has reared its ugly head in elite sporting circles,\" he said in a statement.\n\nNearly 34% of Kenyan girls and women aged 15-49 years have suffered physical violence, according to Kenyan government data from 2022. The survey also found that 41% of married women have faced violence.\n\nAfrican countries collectively recorded the largest number of killings of women, both in absolute terms and relative to the size of the continent's female population, according to a 2022 report by UN Women and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nIn April 2022, Kenyan-born distance runner Damaris Muthee, who competed for Bahrain, was found strangled in the house in Iten, Kenya, where she was training, the BBC reported.\n\nIn October 2021, Olympian runner Agnes Tirop, 25, a rising star in Kenya's highly competitive athletics scene, was found dead in her home in the town of Iten, with multiple stab wounds to the neck. Her husband, Ibrahim Rotich, was charged with her murder and has pleaded not guilty. That case is ongoing.\n\nAfter Tirop's murder, athletes set up the group Tirop's Angels to combat domestic violence. One of its founders, Joan Chelimo, told Reuters that female athletes were at high risk of exploitation and violence at the hands of men drawn to their money.\n\n\"They get into these traps of predators who pose in their lives as lovers,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Potential voter fraud cases are referred to district attorneys for investigation, and if necessary, possible prosecution.\n\nHere's a look at how many voter fraud cases were reported in Wisconsin last year, plus what you can do if you suspect voter fraud.\n\nHow many cases of voter fraud are reported in Wisconsin?\n\n“Cases of voter fraud in Wisconsin are exceedingly rare,” said WEC Public Information Officer Riley Vetterkind.\n\nElection officials reported nearly three dozen cases of suspected election fraud in Wisconsin between June 2022 and June 2023, of which occurred during the 2022 partisan primary, 2022 general election and the 2023 spring election Primary.\n\nAccording to the 2023 annual report, most cases of voter fraud involved voters who voted twice in the same election, once in-person and then again via absentee by mail. Suspected voter fraud cases were just slightly higher compared to the previous year, when the WEC reported 23 cases of voter fraud between May 2020 and June 2022.\n\nIn keeping with state law, suspected cases of voter fraud in Wisconsin are reported to the public in the annual report published by the WEC. You can find previous reports here. However, Vetterkind told the Journal Sentinel that such reports are limited as they only include “referrals to district attorneys made by municipal clerks” that the WEC is aware of.\n\n“It is possible that other suspected election frauds, irregularities or violations have been referred without the Commission’s knowledge,” Vetterkind said.\n\nEmphasizing that such cases are alleged, Vetterkind said district attorneys would need to be contacted to determine if individuals were convicted of fraud.\n\nWhat is the most common type of voter fraud in Wisconsin?\n\nThe most common form of voter fraud in Wisconsin historically is committed by residents who are also serving a felony sentence, and therefore have lost their right to vote, the WEC said in 2021.\n\nThe WEC works with the state Department of Corrections and receives lists of citizens convicted of felonies to remove them from eligible voter lists. The Commission also provides lists of ineligible citizens to municipal clerks to screen for voter registration, according to its website.\n\nIf someone who is convicted of a felony registers to vote, it is caught during the WEC’s “felon audit,” which occurs after the election and results in prosecution referrals, according to the WEC.\n\nIn 2023, the Associated Press reported that the WEC referred 23 cases of felons allegedly voting in the 2022 midterms to district attorneys.\n\nHow often are ballots boxes tampered with?\n\nBallot boxes were reinstated in Wisconsin this past summer, following a two-year period where the state Supreme Court had ruled the practice was illegal. Challenges to ballot drop boxes stemmed from unfounded allegations by Republicans and former president Donald Trump that absentee voting was rife with fraud after his 2020 election loss.\n\nIn 2022, an Associated Press survey of almost all U.S. states found no evidence of drop box vandalism, theft or fraud that could have affected the 2020 election results. However, just a week ahead of the 2024 election, two ballot boxes in Oregon and Washington were set on fire, damaging hundreds of ballots.\n\nAs of Oct. 29, Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Paulina Gutiérrez said there has been no cause for concern regarding damage to Milwaukee ballot boxes. All drop boxes in the city are made of heavy-duty steel, bolted to the ground and monitored by 24-hour surveillance cameras.\n\nFind more information about ballot drop box safety and security measures here.\n\nWhat to do if you suspect possible election fraud:\n\nIf you have any information about possible election fraud, you can file a report with local law enforcement or file a sworn complaint with the WEC. State law prohibits the WEC from starting an investigation without a sworn complaint.\n\nYou can find more information about filing a complaint here.\n\nRELATED:You can track your absentee ballot in Wisconsin.

Multiple auditors had said they're worried about people bringing guns into more polling places, as permitted under a new Iowa law; about disputes among voters over wearing masks — which aren’t required on Election Day despite the COVID-19 pandemic; and about the possibility that some Iowans may be inspired by recent national political rhetoric to challenge whether others are qualified to vote.\n\n– Jason Clayworth, Des Moines Register\n\nNo more putting ‘I Voted’ stickers on Susan B. Anthony’s headstone in NY\n\nWhat has become an Election Day ritual in Rochester, New York, will look different this year.\n\nDespite the coronavirus pandemic, people are welcome to make the pilgrimage to Mount Hope Cemetery to pay tribute to Susan B. Anthony at her gravesite. But in a departure, visitors won’t be able to place their “I Voted” stickers directly on the famed suffragist’s headstone.\n\nDuring a springtime restoration project, it became clear that the fragile marble marker had sustained damage from a combination of adhesive residue and the solvents and methods needed to remove it, Patricia Corcoran, president of nonprofit Friends of Mount Hope Cemetery, wrote in an email.\n\nIn an effort to protect the \"iconic gravesite,\" the group had clear plastic sleeves made for Anthony’s headstone and that of her sister, Mary S. Anthony, for use during election season, and people can put their \"I Voted\" stickers on the sleeves.\n\n– Marcia Greenwood, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nFBI investigating fire set in Boston ballot drop box\n\nA fire was set Sunday in a Boston ballot drop box holding more than 120 ballots in what Massachusetts election officials said appears to have been a \"deliberate attack,\" now under investigation by the FBI.\n\nThe fire that was set around 4 a.m. in a ballot drop box outside the Boston Public Library downtown, Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin’s office said.\n\nThere were 122 ballots inside the box when it was emptied Sunday morning, and 87 of them were still legible and able to be processed, Galvin’s office said. Voters can go online to see whether their ballot was processed. Those who used that drop box between Saturday afternoon and 4 a.m. Sunday and can’t confirm the status of their ballot online should contact the Boston Elections Department immediately, officials said.\n\nIn Ohio, advocates work to protect nursing home vote during pandemic\n\nAs the leader of an outreach team with the Franklin County Board of Elections, Shirley Royer rolls her cart into county jails, nursing homes, psychiatric facilities and hospitals to make sure eligible voters get their chance to cast ballots.\n\n\"I'm the poll worker, and I'm here,\" Royer will say, reassuring the elderly and frail that she can assist with reading ballots, marking them properly and keeping them private and secure.\n\nShe and other elections officials across the state mask up and have continued to head out during the pandemic. But COVID-19 has complicated their field work. Senior communities that had long been polling sites cannot safely operate as voting locations this year. Many residents still can't come and go freely. And family members calling by phone sometimes find it difficult to ascertain whether a loved one has voted successfully.\n\n\"Never have we faced anything like this,\" Royer said.\n\n– Rita Price, The Columbus Dispatch\n\nElection problems: What to know\n\nThis cheat sheet from Columbia Journalism Review offers tips for media organizations reporting on Election 2020.\n\nVoting problems aren't failures. They happen every year and, as CJR notes, hiccups such as voting machines not working or polling places opening late don't mean anything is \"rigged.\"\n\nSome problems, however, are significant.

The Attorney General's office said it does not have that authority but will be on the lookout for voter intimidation in the upcoming election.\n\n\"We are not able to use any of our New Hampshire election laws to prohibit a voter from entering to vote if they have a firearm, and that includes if the polling place is a school,” said Assistant AG Nicholas Chong Yen, according to NHPR.org.\n\nThe website said some New Hampshire poll workers and voters have expressed concern about the presence of armed individuals at polling places.\n\n– Jorge L. Ortiz\n\nWorried about voter suppression? Lawyers set up national hotline to answer questions about election laws\n\nNearly 24,000 lawyers are volunteering to help voters across the country navigate changes in what has become an unprecedented election cycle. Organizers of Election Protection, a national coalition of civil rights and voting rights groups, said the number of volunteers has quadrupled since the 2016 presidential election and the 2018 midterm elections. They’re bracing for even more calls as Election Day nears and in the days and weeks following.\n\nThe Election Protection hotline (866-OUR-VOTE) is available all year, but calls have ramped up in recent weeks as millions started casting ballots early in some states. The hotline has received more than 100,000 calls since July, averaging about 7,000 a day, organizers said. At this point in 2016, the group had fielded 21,000 calls since January of that year.\n\n– Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nHeadlines from elsewhere and resources on voting\n\nFrom ProPublica: Their Electionland project goes deep on issues that can affect eligible voters' ability to cast a ballot.\n\nTheir Electionland project goes deep on issues that can affect eligible voters' ability to cast a ballot.

A survey by Savanta for Queen Mary University of London carried out between 8 and 17 April found that 46% of those polled intend to vote for Khan, with 33% opting for the Tory candidate, Susan Hall.

Nevertheless, \"this election is critical for the capital's future\", with the next mayor overseeing the \"root and branch\" reform of the Metropolitan Police, addressing the chronic lack of affordable housing in the capital and trying to secure Transport for London's financial future.\n\nDespite being the overwhelming favourite with pollsters, bookies and political commentators, Khan \"is haunted by the spectre of defeat\", said George Eaton in The New Statesman. Khan and his team are said to fear the vote, which takes place on the same day as local elections, may be \"far closer than most believe\", partly due to the replacement of the supplementary vote system in mayoral elections with first-past-the-post voting. The change was introduced in 2021 by Boris Johnson's government and \"widely interpreted as an attempt to tilt the odds in the Tories’ favour\".\n\nWho is standing?\n\nKhan has said he wants to \"send a message\" to the Tories in seeking to become the first politician to hold the mayor of London office for three terms. He has urged voters not to \"let the Tories do to London what they've done to our country\", as he hit out at the \"hollow, desperate and divisive narrative\" put forward by the party.\n\nHe will face off against the Conservatives' Hall, a London Assembly member and former council leader. She is a vocal supporter of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Donald Trump and is hoping to ride a \"populist (if not yet popular) ticket to City Hall\", said Londonist. Since emerging from a shortlist of relative unknowns last year, Hall has endured a series of media missteps, including what The Mirror described as a \"meltdown\" on LBC when she was forced to admit she did not know the price of a bus fare, just days after criticising a decision to freeze fares in the capital. Her campaign was faced additional criticism for an attack ad in which the capital was presented as a crime-riddled Gotham-like metropolis, using footage which actually showed New York City.\n\nWhile Khan and Hall are the only candidates with a serious chance of winning in May, there are 13 people standing for election. These include the Liberal Democrats' Rob Blackie, an anti-Brexit campaigner and adviser to start-up technology companies, and Reform UK's Howard Cox, a small-business adviser with a track record of campaigning for lower petrol prices. Hackney councillor and NHS inequalities adviser Zoë Garbett will be looking to build on growing support for the Greens in the capital.\n\nIn alphabetical order, here is the full list of candidates:\n\nFemy Amin, Animal Welfare Party\n\nCount Binface, Count Binface Party\n\nRob Blackie, Liberal Democrats\n\nNatalie Campbell, Independent\n\nHoward Cox, Reform UK\n\nAmy Gallagher, Social Democratic Party\n\nZoë Garbett, Green Party\n\nTarun Ghulati, Independent\n\nSusan Hall, Conservative and Unionist Party\n\nSadiq Khan, Labour Party\n\nAndreas Michli, Independent\n\nBrian Rose, London Real Party\n\nNick Scanlon, Britain First\n\nWhat will be the key issues?\n\nKhan is looking to focus on his environmental and council-house-building policies as key achievements of his tenure, as well as the introduction of universal free school meals for primary pupils and freezing single Tube and bus fares until 2025.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph earlier this month, Hall re-iterated her plans for better policing, a greater focus on women and scrapping the ultra low emission zone (Ulez) – Khan's \"soft underbelly\" since he controversially expanded the charging zone to include outer London in August, said the paper.\n\nBut with both main candidates \"promising to bring better, greener transport to London, crack down on crime, and build more homes, according to their campaign websites\", said the London Evening Standard podcast, \"it appears that the only issue the two disagree on is Ulez\" – which Hall has made one of the centrepieces of her campaign.\n\nWhat do the polls say?\n\nA YouGov poll last week put Khan 19 points ahead of his Conservative rival but the mayor's aides insist that a \"perfect storm\" of factors could oust him from City Hall, said The New Statesman's Eaton.\n\nChief among these is the change to a first-past-the-post voting system, which is seen as the big wildcard in May's election. Forced through by the government, the change in how the mayor is elected is \"expected to improve the Conservative mayoral candidate's chances of winning in a city which has been increasingly Labour-leaning in recent years”, said On London. This is because they will not have to assemble a coalition of more than 50% of the voters; they just need the most votes.\n\nLooking at the last election, in 2021, Khan secured 40% of first preference votes, with his Tory rival Shaun Bailey on 35%. The new system will mean closing the gap should be easier for the Conservatives.\n\nIn a bid to counter this, Khan has warned against voting for other parties, arguing that a vote for the Greens or Liberal Democrats in a first-past-the-post system \"means one less vote for the Tories to get\".\n\nOn top of changes to the electoral system, Khan also faces the \"obstacles of incumbency\" in seeking a third term, said The Guardian, although the latest polls still give him a comfortable lead – albeit one growing less comfortable as election day nears.\n\nSky Bet still has Khan as the strong favourite to win at 1-25, with Hall an outsider at 8-1, so barring some 11th-hour scandal the race looks Khan's to lose.", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Alexandra Zagalsky", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Harriet Marsden", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Rebecca Messina", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/27"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959704/brexit-what-changed-after-the-uk-pulled-out-of-the-eu", "title": "Brexit: what changed after the UK pulled out of the EU | The Week", "text": "At 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK ceased to be a member state of the EU and Boris Johnson, then prime minister, proclaimed that Britain would “rediscover the muscles that we have not used for decades”.\n\nBut what’s changed since that day and is the country reaping the Brexit dividends it was promised?\n\nHow is it affecting the economy?\n\nThe broad consensus is that Brexit has had a substantially negative, but not catastrophic, effect on Britain’s economy: economists often liken it to a slow puncture. Given the turmoil of the period since Britain left the EU, it is hard to disentangle it from other factors, such as Covid and supply-chain snarl-ups, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rocketing energy prices.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nEconomists try to do so by measuring Britain’s performance against comparable countries, or modelling a “doppelgänger” UK that hasn’t left the EU. Last month, Bloomberg Economics concluded that Brexit is costing the UK economy £100bn a year, leaving it 4% smaller than it would have been. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) similarly thinks it will end up 4% smaller than it would have been.\n\nIn the real world, the UK has underperformed compared with every other G7 nation; it is the only economy yet to return to the size it was in late 2019.\n\nWhy has Brexit had these impacts?\n\nSterling depreciated by about 10% after the 2016 vote, and has remained at around the same level since, raising import prices and inflation. The second factor is the significant hit to business investment, driven by uncertainty and the fact that Britain is no longer inside the EU single market. A series of large companies have chosen not to invest in the UK: Bloomberg estimates that investment has trailed the G7 average by 19%. Trade has also been affected by new technical barriers and border checks. Trade figures are hard to interpret, and estimates vary, but the OBR thinks that both imports and exports will be around 15% lower than they would have been. In services, the effect has not been as drastic as feared, but the consultants EY found last year more than 7,000 finance jobs had moved from London to the EU because of Brexit.\n\nWhat about the new trade deals?\n\nWhile it’s good to have them, nearly all the post-Brexit trade deals replace agreements the UK had signed as a member of the EU. For example, the Government says the deal it made with Japan in 2020 will increase the UK’s GDP by 0.1% – but only relative to not having a deal with Japan, and the UK had one before Brexit. The three genuinely new deals – free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand, and a digital trade agreement with Singapore – don’t come close to making up the shortfall. (The Government expects the first two to add 0.08% and 0.03% to the UK’s GDP). Deals with India and the Pacific trade bloc are still a possibility, but really big trade agreements aren’t currently on the table: the US has suspended negotiations, and the UK isn’t pursuing a deal with China.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nHas immigration been affected?\n\nOn its own terms, the Government’s post-Brexit migration policy has succeeded. As intended, there’s reduced immigration of lower-skilled workers from the EU, and increased immigration of higher-skilled workers from the rest of the world, mostly for jobs in health and social care, IT, business services and finance. The recruitment of nurses from abroad, for instance, has risen under the new system. But hospitality, agriculture, transport and retail have been badly hit by an estimated shortfall of 330,000 lower-skilled workers. At the same time, overall net immigration reached a record high of 504,000 last year – perhaps not an effect that most Brexit voters envisaged.\n\nWhat about farming and fishing?\n\nThe “Environmental Land Management schemes” being rolled out to replace the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in England are likely to be a substantial improvement: unlike the much-derided CAP, which rewarded farms largely based on their acreage, it will pay farmers for protecting nature and improving the environment. However, the transition has been difficult, and the agricultural sector as a whole is struggling with the increased difficulty of exporting to the EU; and the deals with Australia and New Zealand have been widely criticised as bad for UK livestock farmers. There have been benefits to UK fisheries since Brexit, but they have fallen far short of Brexiteer rhetoric. A recent study calculated that the UK catch will increase by 107,000 tonnes per year, or 12.4% by value for all species, by 2025. But set against this is the increased difficulty of exporting seafood to Europe.\n\nWhat other successes can Brexiteers point to?\n\nThe fast rollout of Covid vaccines is often claimed as a Brexit benefit: although technically European law allowed the UK to act independently, arguably the UK would have faced political pressure to join the EU’s common vaccine strategy. More broadly, Britain has regained regulatory independence, which ought to yield benefits, particularly for financial services. Reforms of the EU’s Solvency II rules that govern insurance, for instance, could allow £100bn to be invested in productive finance, according to the Association of British Insurers. Leaving the EU’s state aid regime gives British governments more leeway in industrial policy, although the EU and US are now giving themselves more leeway, too. And of course the UK no longer pays its contribution to the EU budget, of £12.6bn net in 2020.\n\nCan Remainers say I told you so?\n\nThere’s little doubt that, economically, Brexit has proved painful. Remainers can point to negative effects on everything from small businesses to cross-Channel traffic to universities to touring musicians. The question of the Northern Ireland border remains unresolved. A majority of the public now seems convinced by such arguments and, across the world, Brexit is widely seen as an act of self-harm. But Brexiteers argue that, in future, it should allow the UK to be nimble in crucial areas such as life sciences and the digital economy – and that even if it has disappointed so far, in the long run we’re better off as a sovereign nation than delegating decisions to a bloc beyond the reach of our elected representatives.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Alexandra Zagalsky", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Theunis Bates", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Susan Caskie", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/society/953705/how-the-2011-london-riots-unfolded", "title": "How the 2011 London riots unfolded | The Week", "text": "Ten years ago this week, riots spread across London and other major English cities, sparked by the death of 29-year-old Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police in Tottenham on 4 August 2011.\n\nThe riots – the biggest in modern English history – lasted for five days and swept the capital, from Wood Green to Woolwich.

His death happened during an intervention with officers from Operation Trident, a unit targeting gun crime in London, who were attempting to carry out an arrest, reported the BBC in 2015.\n\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), now called the Independent Office for Police Conduct, later admitted to wrongly giving journalists the impression that shots had been fired by Duggan.\n\nAt first, the shooting drew “little attention”, writes former Downing Street official Craig Oliver in a retrospective of the ensuing events in The Times. “But it turns out there was no gun (though one was found near by)” and Duggan’s relatives and friends were “distraught and incensed”.\n\nDavid Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, said he was “shocked and deeply worried” about the incident, and on Saturday 6 August 300 people gathered outside Tottenham police station to protest the shooting, saying they wanted “justice” for Duggan and his family.\n\nPart of the reason for their demonstration was down to the “alleged failure by the IPCC to provide Duggan’s family and the local community with reliable information in the aftermath of his death”, wrote The Guardian at the time.\n\nThe newspaper says “two different portraits were painted” of Duggan that week, a “hardened north London gangster and drug dealer” and a “loving family man who would never seek confrontation”.\n\nA 2014 inquest found the shooting to be lawful but concluded that Duggan did not have a weapon in his hands when confronted by police and had thrown it from the taxi.\n\nDoves are released outside Tottenham police station on 11 January 2014, during a vigil following a jury’s ruling that Mark Duggan was lawfully killed when he was shot dead by police (Image credit: Leon Neal/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nPeaceful protests turn violent\n\nAccording to the BBC, the protests started peacefully, with the demonstration outside Tottenham police station on 6 August, but a “confrontation between a teenage protester and a police officer” sparked violence, with bottles being thrown at two patrol cars, which were then set alight. Riot officers and police on horseback were “deployed to disperse the crowds”, but “came under attack from bottles, fireworks and other missiles”.\n\nThe peaceful gathering “culminated 12 hours later in a full-scale riot that saw brazen looting spread across north-London suburbs”, reported The Guardian at the time. The protest had been “good-natured”, added the paper, but what became clear over the next four hours was that as tensions “gradually escalated”, the “police made only limited attempts to talk to the demonstrators”.\n\nBy 11pm that evening, a double-decker bus had been set alight, reported The Guardian, and many local shops along the high road had been broken into. Haringey Council said the damage to roads and pavements in Tottenham was in the region of £227,000, according to the Daily Mail in 2011.\n\nBurnt out cars lie in the road after riots in Tottenham on 7 August 2011 (Image credit: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking on the morning of 7 August, Lammy described the events as a “disgrace”. “What happened here on Thursday night raised huge questions and we need answers”, he said. “The response to that is not to loot and rob… This must stop. This is an attack on Tottenham, on people, on ordinary people.”\n\nUnrest spreads across England\n\nThe day after the Tottenham riots, televisions showed “helicopter shots of rioting across London”, writes Oliver in The Times. “From Hackney to Croydon, Ealing to Bromley, shops [were] on fire or being looted.” It was agreed that Prime Minister David Cameron, who was on a summer holiday in Italy, should fly back as soon as possible. Then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson was criticised for not coming back from his holiday quickly enough.\n\n“These images of rioters driving the police from the streets quickly proved an inspiration to others”, says Matteo Tiratelli, a lecturer in political sociology at University College London, in The Conversation. Over the next five nights, roughly 15,000 people took to the streets in towns and cities across England. “Hundreds of police officers were injured and £250m worth of damage was done to shops and businesses in London alone.”\n\nRiot police walk along Clarence Road in Hackney, east London, on 8 August, 2011 (Image credit: Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\nOn the evening of 8 August, the riots claimed two lives: Trevor Ellis, 26, was found with bullet wounds in a car in Croydon and Richard Bowes, 68, was critically injured trying to put out a fire. He later died from his injuries.\n\nTwo days later, on 10 August, Haroon Jahan, 21, Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, were killed when a car hit them in Winson Green, Birmingham. According to witnesses, they had been protecting their community and local businesses from looting and destruction.\n\nHours after finding his dying son in the street, Jahan’s father called for calm: “Black, white, Asians – we all live in the same community... step forward if you want to lose your son. Otherwise, calm down and go home – please”, he said.\n\nTariq Jahan, Haroon’s father, gives a statement to the media near to where his son and two other men were hit by a car and killed in Birmingham on 10 August 2011 (Image credit: CARL DE SOUZA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAn extra 1,700 police officers were deployed in London and more than 400 people were arrested. “The Met was stretched beyond belief in a way that it has never experienced before,” Stephen Kavanagh, the Met deputy assistant commissioner at the time, told BBC Breakfast. It is thought that social media networks including Twitter and BlackBerry Messenger played a key role in fuelling the unrest.\n\nAlthough protests over Duggan’s death had sparked the original Tottenham riots, many seemed to agree that the unrest was “a long time coming” and not just a reaction to the shooting, The Telegraph said. One woman told the paper: “You had a tinder box that was waiting and that was just the match… It's frustration by young people who have been pushed to the wall.”\n\nHow did the riots end?\n\nBy 11 August, the total number of arrests in London had reached 1,009 and of those, 464 people had been charged. One hundred families had been made homeless as a result of the unrest, five people had died and 26 police officers were injured. The situation was reaching a tipping point and, by the fourth night of the riots, London increased its number of police to 16,000 by pulling in officers from other forces across the country.\n\nA damaged Currys store is pictured in Brixton on 8 August, 2011 (Image credit: Ben Stansall/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThis greater police presence on the streets was the major factor in persuading people to stay at home, according to the Reading the Riots study, which interviewed 270 people involved in the events.\n\n“I think the 16,000 police was a deterrent for everyone; they thought: ‘You know what, we’ve done enough, we’ve done what we had to do… Leave it’,” said one of the people interviewed, a 23-year-old unemployed man from Newham, east London.\n\nOther explanations for the riots ending included a lack of excitement and there being nothing left to loot. Some of those involved in the report said they were impacted by Jahan’s father’s moving speech. “When I [saw his] interview I did stop like, because that did hit me quite hard”, one interviewee said.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nThe IPCC’s investigation into Duggan’s death continued, but in September 2011 Duggan’s brother Shaun Hall said he was “not confident at all” that the watchdog would successfully establish what had happened, the BBC reported.\n\nMembers of Mark Duggan’s family, including his aunt, Carol Duggan, and his half-brother, Shaun, examine a reconstruction of the scene of the shooting on 2 December 2013 (Image credit: Oli Scarff/Getty Images)\n\nThat same month, Scotland Yard apologised to Duggan’s family for failing to inform them directly of his death. A year on from Duggan’s shooting, in 2012, his mother, Pam, said she still had “no answers about why my son died”.\n\nTo this day, questions remain surrounding the events which led to the shooting. In 2015, an IPCC report “found Duggan was probably in the process of throwing away a handgun when he was shot”. However, Forensic Architecture, a human rights research organisation based at Goldsmiths, University of London, has said this conclusion is wrong, according to a detailed report in The Guardian published in 2020.\n\nThe IPCC has called “implausible” a claim that police moved the gun. “There is no sensible reason why they [the police] would have opted to plant the firearm on the grass such a distance away from Mr Duggan thereby giving rise to the various doubts which have inevitably arisen about this matter,” the police watchdog said.\n\nThe penal response to the rioters was “enormous and unprecedented”, says Tiratelli on The Conversation, with cases “pushed from the magistrates’ to the crown courts, ensuring that longer sentences were available and costing minors their right to anonymity in the press”.\n\nThe result was that more than 2,000 people faced jail sentences “which were four and a half times longer than those same offences would normally warrant”.\n\nIn 2011, Cameron agreed to establish the Riots Communities and Victims Panel to investigate the causes of the riots and consider what more could be done to build greater social and economic resilience in communities.\n\nNotes are pinned on a ‘peace wall’ on a boarded-up window of Poundland on Rye Lane, Peckham, in August 2011 (Image credit: John Phillips/UK Press via Getty Images)\n\nA decade on\n\nOnly “a handful” of the 63 recommendations in the After the riots report have been implemented, writes David Lammy in The Guardian, which included “calling on the government to provide greater support for families, address youth unemployment, improve school attainment, improve police relations and tackle reoffending by young offenders”.\n\nOver the years, “instead of acting to strengthen the fabric of society’s fire blanket to reduce the risk of riots”, Conservative prime ministers have “decimated police forces, youth services and local authority budgets”, he adds. “I say this with deep regret: by failing to implement the measures designed to tackle society’s dissatisfaction, alienation and fragmentation, Johnson risks letting a spark set fire to the fuel all over again.”\n\nBut writing in The Times, Oliver says he believes that if the country faced a similar situation again, “the police would be quicker off the mark in terms of tightening their grip and making clear actions have consequences”.\n\nHowever, the events of 2011 made it clear that “social order isn’t as stable as we thought”, he adds. “All it takes is for a few thousand people to rebel and, as Yeats famously wrote, ‘Things fall apart... Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world’”.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Alexandra Zagalsky", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/uk/britain-asylum-seekers-system-broken-cmd-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Britain's asylum system is broken after years of political neglect ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nOn a chilly Tuesday night at London’s busy Victoria Station, a bus dropped off a group of 11 people – some wearing flip flops and without coats – and drove away.\n\n“They were cold, hungry, stressed and disorientated,” according to homelessness charity Under One Sky, whose team spotted the group and provided assistance. The individuals had “nowhere to go” until a Home Office employee was alerted, and found the group emergency hotel accommodation.\n\nThe group was made up of asylum-seekers who had been staying at Manston migrant processing center in Kent, southern England, a facility that charities and lawmakers say has become overcrowded and descended into dire and inhumane living conditions.\n\nAccording to the Home Office, officials were under the impression that the 11 individuals had accommodation arranged in London. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was “shameful” they were abandoned in the center of the city, calling it “a complete failure of duty and leadership.”\n\nBut the incident is emblematic of Britain’s dramatically overwhelmed system for dealing with asylum-seekers and illegal migrants.\n\nThe number of asylum claims processed in the UK has collapsed in recent years, leaving people in limbo for months and years – trapped in processing facilities or temporary hotels and unable to work – and fueling an intractable debate about Britain’s borders.\n\n“The system is broken,” Britain’s Home Secretary Suella Braverman told Parliament on Monday – an inarguable but jarring admission after 12 years of Conservative rule, which has seen an unending line of ministers promising and failing to clamp down on illegal migration.\n\nThe situation at the Manston processing facility is a \"breach of humane conditions,\" a Conservative lawmaker said. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nBraverman blamed a rapid increase in small boat crossings across the English Channel, organized by people smugglers on mainland Europe. The beleaguered minister described the crossings in highly charged terms as an “invasion” of Britain’s south coast. “Let’s stop pretending that they are all refugees in distress,” she said.\n\nBut the chaos facing migrants and asylum-seekers in the UK is also the result of a decade of political choices, with funding and action failing to match the heavy-handed rhetoric espoused by successive Conservative governments.\n\n“It’s shambolic and it’s cruel,” Ben Ramanauskas, a research economist at Oxford University and an adviser to Liz Truss while the previous prime minister was secretary of state for international trade, told CNN about the country’s system to deal with asylum-seekers.\n\n“Part of that is due to the culture set by the Home Office, which views most immigrants with suspicion and treats them like potential criminals,” Ramanauskas said. “It’s a deeply unfair and unjust system.”\n\nThe Home Office did not respond directly to that charge when approached by CNN, but said in a statement: “The number of people arriving in the UK who require accommodation has reached record levels and has put our asylum system under incredible strain.”\n\nSmall boat crossings rise\n\nAnother striking glimpse into the lives of migrants within Britain’s processing facilities came flying over the fence from within the Manston facility this week.\n\n“We are in a difficult life now … we fill like we’re in prison (sic),” read a letter, apparently written by a young girl and stuffed inside a bottle that was then thrown towards assembled journalists.\n\n“Some of us very sick … ther’s some women’s that are pregnant they don’t do anything for them (sic) … We really need your help. Please help us,” the letter reads.\n\nThe situation at the asylum-processing center is a “breach of humane conditions,” Conservative lawmaker Roger Gale told Sky News Monday, as dozens of charities wrote to the prime minister to raise concerns over “overcrowding.”\n\nThe facility is currently holding around 4,000 people, among them women and children, despite being intended to only hold 1,500, Gale said. Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick later told Sky News that some people at the center were “sleeping on the floor.”\n\nA letter thrown inside a bottle over the fence at Manston. Gareth Fuller/PA\n\nHe claimed the “root cause of what we’re seeing at Manston is not the government,” but the growing number of migrants traveling across the Channel onto England’s shores.\n\nThose numbers have shot up in recent years. 38,000 people have arrived in the UK by small boat this year, up from 28,000 last year and less than 2,000 in 2019, according to Home Office data.\n\nThe crossings are a relatively new phenomenon, which emerged after thousands of migrants hoping to cross into England spent months and years in the so-called Calais “jungle,” a sprawling settlement on the northern coast of France guarded by French and British border officers.\n\n“In late 2018, a couple of boats successfully navigated the channel,” giving rise to a small “cottage industry” of smugglers, Rob McNeil, the deputy director of the Migration Observatory, told CNN.\n\n“Not only did it work, but because it was a very visible spectacle it became very prominent in the British public discourse. It was front page news,” he said. “And so it became visible to other people that this was a successful technique.\n\n“Instead of having a bottleneck at Calais, you suddenly had a showerhead (with) multiple little nozzles across the French coast” from which people could launch dangerous journeys in dinghies and small vessels, McNeil said. “That’s much harder to police.”\n\nThe number of arrivals in the UK remains relatively low compared to EU member states; last year Britain ranked fourth in total asylum applications and 19th in per capita claims among European countries, according to the Migration Observatory.\n\nBut while the government has pointed the finger at increased crossings for overrunning the country’s asylum network, it has done little to reduce their impact on the UK – and a litany of ministerial decisions have made disruption worse for Britons and migrants alike.\n\nThe speed at which asylum claims are processed has slumped remarkably in recent years. 87% of claims received an initial decision within six months in the second quarter of 2014, according to the Migration Observatory, but seven years later that figure was just 6%. The fall comes after the government scrapped its six-month target in mid-2019.\n\nIt means migrants are being housed in temporary accommodation and hotels while waiting to hear news on their claim, a policy at which Braverman has repeatedly lashed out. A Home Office spokesperson told CNN there are currently more than 37,000 asylum-seekers in hotels, costing the UK taxpayer £5.6 million ($6.35 millon) a day.\n\nMany migration experts point the finger for that bill squarely back at the government.\n\n“The Home Office has clearly made decisions about allocation of resources which have impacted on processing speeds,” McNeil said.\n\n“If (asylum-seekers’) claims were processed more quickly and more efficiently, then the system would not be snarled up in the way that it is and the human experience of these people would be less unpleasant, while at the same time the costs to the taxpayer would be considerably lower,” he added.\n\n“This issue has not benefited anybody. It is important this asylum backlog is addressed as a matter of some urgency, if the government wants to take charge of the situation.”\n\nSearch for solutions\n\nTo date, the government’s policy – a deal to deport some migrants to Rwanda – has been bogged down in legal appeals and failed to transport a single person in the seven months since it was announced.\n\n“It clearly isn’t working (and) it hasn’t acted as a deterrent in any way” to other asylum-seekers, Ramanauskas said.\n\nSurrounding the Rwanda plan has been a continued swirl of provocative language on illegal migration, which the government argues underpins a strong stance but critics say is divisive and cruel towards those escaping war, instability or persecution.\n\n“What the government has done through its rhetoric over the past years is try to merge in people’s minds asylum seekers and illegal immigrants,” as part of a “quite conscious attempt to suggest all asylum seekers are inherently illegal,” Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University in London, and the author of books on the Conservative Party, told CNN.\n\nAn inflatable craft carries migrants across the English Channel. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nBut there are at least partial solutions to the UK’s seemingly intractable illegal migration crisis, experts believe.\n\nAs well as prioritizing the processing of claims by boosting funding and creating new centers around the country, Britain could ditch a rule that asylum applications must be made on UK soil – allowing people to apply at embassies before they complete a lengthy journey through Europe and across the Channel.\n\nAnd a current rule that bars asylum-seekers from working for one year should be loosened to help people provide for themselves and contribute to the economy, critics say.\n\n“It’s madness: You’re keeping people in poverty, which leads to crime – they don’t have anything to do to spend their time, which is not good for them and bad for local communities,” Ramanauskas said. Sweden, Canada and Australia are among countries that allow asylum-seekers to work immediately, while in the United States, the wait is six months.\n\nA political trade-off\n\nFor all of the heavy-handed rhetoric of successive Conservative governments, a political calculation is also at play.\n\n“It’s never done the Conservative Party any harm, since the beginning of the 1960s, to have immigration on people’s minds,” Bale said.\n\nDuring its 12 years in power – a period largely dominated by Brexit and claims by its supporters that the UK could “take back control” of its borders – the Conservatives have repeatedly sought to paint the opposition Labour Party as “remainers” who would be soft on migration.\n\nThat imperative means solving Britain’s illegal migration conundrum may not yield the political dividends the party is looking for – particularly as it struggles to get a handle on Britain’s economic crisis. “If you can’t deliver to people in their pocket, then this is a useful distraction,” Bale said.\n\nStill, even on traditionally fruitful domain, it remains increasingly possible the Conservative Party will run out of road. “There’s always a trade-off between it being in the news and voters beginning to think the government’s lost control,” Bale said.\n\nOpinion polls suggest voters are losing faith in the Conservatives to tackle the issue of immigration – a trend which, in the past, has left the party battling to fend off criticism from insurgent right-wing parties that it hasn’t done enough to reduce arrivals.\n\nThat’s the dynamic facing Rishi Sunak, Britain’s new Prime Minister, who has readily embraced the Rwanda plan and spent much of his early political capital defending his Home Secretary, Braverman, as she decries the UK’s “broken” asylum system.\n\nAfter 12 years of harsh words, and as the human impact on asylum-seekers in Britain begins to seep out of facilities like Manston, Sunak risks quickly losing the trust of Britons on all sides of the migration debate.\n\n“You have got to the point where people are entitled to ask … if it is broken, who broke it?” Bale said.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/uk/liz-truss-conservative-conference-gbr-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "UK Prime Minister Liz Truss must make the speech of her life to turn ...", "text": "Birmingham, England CNN —\n\nDespite only having been in the job a month, British Prime Minister Liz Truss must make the speech of her life on Wednesday if she’s to get her nascent premiership back on track.\n\nHer government was forced to make a screeching U-turn on Monday over a proposal to cut the top rate of UK income tax, a move seen as insensitively helping the rich at the same time as Britons are living through the worst cost-of-living crisis for decades.\n\nIt was clear on Sunday night, even as Truss addressed a private reception at her Conservative Party’s annual conference in Birmingham, that the tax cut simply didn’t have enough support from her own Members of Parliament. That meant her finance minister’s mini-budget, which also included measures to help people pay energy bills, was very unlikely to survive a vote in the House of Commons.\n\nDissent is rarely on display so soon after a new leader takes over a political party. But at this private event on Sunday night, organized by the influential website ConservativeHome, CNN saw several prominent Conservatives – including cabinet ministers – gossiping and rolling their eyes as Truss spoke to a packed room, defending the tax cut that was just hours away from being axed.\n\nOn Tuesday, Truss’ enemies turned their focus on forcing her to commit to a pledge made under the last prime minister, Boris Johnson, to raise welfare payments in line with inflation. At the time of writing, the government insists that it won’t buckle a second time, though one of Truss’ own ministers has supported doing so in a radio interview.\n\nMultiple Conservative MPs told CNN on Monday night and Tuesday morning that if she doesn’t use Wednesday’s speech to stamp her authority on the party, then they fear dissent will get worse and open disloyalty could undermine the whole government.\n\nPoor messaging\n\nAllies and enemies take different views on the merits of tax cuts but all agree on one thing: The messaging around both the policy and the U-turn has been poor.\n\n“I wouldn’t have done it in the first place, but dropping a flagship policy during our conference after insisting it would stay, then blaming everyone else, makes us look completely untrustworthy,” said one so-called “Red Wall” Conservative, a term referring to seats in northern England that traditionally vote Labour but backed Boris Johnson at the last election.\n\nTruss had tried to distance herself from the policy, telling the BBC on Sunday morning that it had come from finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng, prompting claims she was throwing him “under a bus.”\n\nKwarteng had to address the party faithful from the conference stage on Monday. He gave a short, defensive speech in which he called the tax cut a “distraction” – a term that had clearly become the official party line after the policy was dropped, given the number of ministers using it.\n\nKwarteng and his party were keen to let Britons know that “we get it” and “we need to move forward.” It may be slightly harder for Truss to simply wash her hands of this PR nightmare.\n\nAt the time of publication, CNN understands that her advisers are planning for her Wednesday speech to include a short and concise explanation for what happened and why, though probably stopping short of an apology.\n\nThey are eager to hammer home the fact that the UK has pledged to cap household and business energy bills, costing the government potentially billions of pounds.\n\n“Haven’t we pledged enough already on energy?” a senior adviser to Truss told CNN.\n\nThat may not be enough. Many in Birmingham were dismayed by how defensive Kwarteng’s speech was and how little it revealed.\n\nAdding to the sense of chaos in the party, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, told the Telegraph’s Chopper’s Politics podcast that those who forced Truss to abandon the tax-cutting plan had “staged a coup and undermined the PM in an unprofessional way.”\n\nGrant Shapps, a former transport secretary under Johnson, told the News Agents podcast that Truss had 10 days to turn her leadership around, according to a partial transcript of the interview tweeted ahead of publication.\n\nRock-bottom morale\n\nOne senior Conservative said Truss will need to “show us something that gives us hope we stand a chance of winning the next election.”\n\nIt has not yet been decided whether she plans to pull any rabbits from hats on Wednesday. Many of her MPs would like to see some big-ticket policies on investment in deprived areas or national infrastructure, the kinds of policies Johnson was wont to reveal in similar forums, according to her advisers.\n\nHowever, Truss’ pitch to be leader was as a tax-cutting, small-state Conservative. A senior adviser to the prime minister told CNN on Tuesday morning that such big-ticket policies would not be her style and unless they were sincerely “game-changing” would look “desperate” and “cynical.”\n\nFurther to this, Conservatives from across the party say that even if Truss wanted to make a big spending pledge, it would be incompatible with the economic picture she and her ministers have painted.\n\nWhich leaves Truss somewhere between a rock and a hard place come midday in Birmingham on Wednesday. The leader’s speech at the party conference is a focal point in the political calendar. It is a chance for the government to boast about its record and rally the troops for the 12 months ahead.\n\nInstead, the prime minister will spend Wednesday trying to pick up a party that she and her government tripped over and toppled to the ground. She needs to offer her allies enough ideological purity that they renew their support, while also giving those who reject her mandate to rip up Johnson’s agenda enough treats to keep them quiet.\n\nShe must do this because morale in her party is in a parlous state. MPs with huge majorities are speaking privately as though they’ve already lost their seat, talking to people at drinks events around the conference about next career moves. Truss needs to restore discipline in her cabinet and across the entire party.\n\nMultiple people, from party insiders to lobbyists to European diplomats, agreed that this looks like a party on its way out of government. That doesn’t mean it’s inevitable, and Truss could turn things around before January 2025, the deadline for calling the next general election. But unless Conservatives can pull themselves out of their dejection and torpor, that simmering sense of dread could become all-consuming. And often in politics, the most dangerous thing is not a set of policies or the rise of an opposition, but a creeping sense of inevitability that the end is nigh.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/17/deepening-droughts-saharan-dust-huge-forest-nest-news-around-states/117065366/", "title": "Deepening droughts, Saharan dust: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Money from a legal settlement will be used to provide funding to add charging stations for electric vehicles at 18 sites in seven Alabama counties. The governor’s office says grants totaling $4.1 million will help fund installing of chargers at fueling stations near interstates and other major highways. The money will provide as much as 80% of the cost of installing stations at existing sites in Jefferson, Tuscaloosa, Calhoun, Cullman, DeKalb, Greene and St. Clair counties. Many of the chargers will be along Interstate 20 from the Georgia line to Tuscaloosa. The money is from a settlement involving Volkswagen and the Environmental Protection Agency over the automaker’s violation of the federal Clean Air Act. In a statement, Gov. Kay Ivey said the grants will help with state move toward electric vehicles. Auto plants located in the state already have started the transition toward vehicles powered by electricity, she said. “This program will have a range of positive impacts in Alabama from creating cleaner air to helping to sell more vehicles manufactured right here in Alabama,” said Kenneth Boswell, director of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, which will administer the grants.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state House late Tuesday passed a state budget that would result in a $525 dividend to residents this year and leave in doubt funding for a number of programs and infrastructure projects after it failed to garner sufficient support on a key vote. House leaders left open the potential for continued talks or even possibly another vote as the special session neared its end. Special sessions can last up to 30 days. That limit would be reached Friday. “We’re gonna look for a resolution that we can all live with and be happy with, and the people of Alaska will be very grateful to us,” said House Speaker Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak. “My hope is that the talks don’t stop,” House Minority Leader Cathy Tilton told reporters after the floor session, adding later: “I would hope that we would come together and have serious conversations, where all voices are being heard.” Dividends typically have been paid using earnings from the state’s oil-wealth fund. But the budget agreement that advanced from a six-member conference committee Sunday cobbled together money for dividends of about $1,100 from various sources, including the constitutional budget reserve fund that requires three-fourths support in each the House and Senate to tap. That vote failed Tuesday night in the House. The last time the check was in the $500 range was in 1986.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Tuesday blocked a new Arizona State University policy that would have required unvaccinated students to submit to twice-weekly coronavirus testing and wear a mask, calling the decision “bad policy.” The Republican governor issued an executive order saying students at the state’s public universities and community colleges can’t be required to get a COVID-19 vaccine, submit vaccination documents, or be tested or forced to wear masks. ASU and the Board of Regents said they would comply with Ducey’s order. An ASU statement noted that it never issued a vaccine mandate but was following guidelines for universities from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by ensuring unvaccinated people continue to follow protocols like masking. Ducey’s order came after he criticized the policy in a series of tweets Monday night. He said that the rules for students attending class in person this fall have “no basis in public health” and that even the Biden administration has been more reasonable. But the governor also included a screenshot of a quote from the CDC’s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, that appeared to contradict his own position. “It is the people who are not fully vaccinated in those settings, who might not be wearing a mask, who are not protected,” Walensky is quoted as saying.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The American Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday asked a federal judge to prevent the state from enforcing its ban on gender-confirming treatments for transgender youth while a lawsuit challenging the prohibition proceeds. The ACLU requested a preliminary injunction against the new law, which is set to take effect July 28. It will prohibit doctors from providing gender-confirming hormone treatment, puberty blockers or surgery to anyone under 18 years old or from referring them to other providers for the treatment. The ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging the ban last month on behalf of four transgender youth and their families, as well as two doctors who provide the treatments. The ban is forcing some families of transgender youth to move out of state to continue their children’s treatments, if they can afford to do so, the filing contends. “The threat of harm to plaintiffs is concrete, imminent, and devastating, and far outweighs any conceivable cost to the state of maintaining the status quo while this case proceeds,” the filing says. Republican lawmakers enacted the ban in April, overriding a veto by GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson following pleas from pediatricians, social workers and the parents of transgender youth who said the measure would harm a community already at risk for depression and suicide.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Thousands of Central California farmers were warned Tuesday that they could face water cutoffs this summer as the state deals with a drought that already has curtailed federal and state irrigation supplies. The State Water Resources Control Board notified about 6,600 farmers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed who have rights to use water from the Central Valley estuary of “impending water unavailability” that may continue until winter rains come. “This is how dry things are,” water board Chairman Joaquin Esquivel told the Sacramento Bee. “The hydrology that we’re seeing is not there. … There will not be enough natural flow.” The state also must provide enough flow in the rivers to maintain populations of protected fish species in rivers while keeping “cities and communities from running out of water,” Esquivel said. It’s unclear when the allocations will be cut or whom it will affect. Some farmers have first crack at supplies under a complicated distribution system involving rights-holders. Many farmers already have been told they will get little or nothing from two large allocation systems, the federal Central Valley Project and the State Water Project. “The 2021 water year for the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin is currently the driest since 1977,” the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has warned.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis said he will begin phasing out the executive authority he has been granted during the coronavirus pandemic after creating, amending and extending about 400 orders since March 2020. The Democrat told The Denver Post that he’s now ready to let go of his unprecedented authority. “The pandemic still exists,” he said, but “our hospital capacity is no longer threatened. We have 60% of the population vaccinated. So at this point, we would go to kind of regular order, which means the Legislature passes laws, I can sign laws, and you can see the phaseout of those executive powers over time.” Polis has continued to exert his executive authority through multiple emergency mandates, enacting 17 orders in March, 13 in April, 10 in May and six so far this month. “In general, the time for these emergency actions is over, or near over. I believe in a republic, and I believe in three branches of government,” Polis said. “It’s not the role of the governor to do that long-term. It’s the role of the governor to react in an emergency.” Polis’ promise to phase out his powers was well-received news among Republican state officials who have worked for months to remove his additional authority. Republican state Sen. Paul Lundeen said he will believe it when he sees it.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state Senate on Tuesday passed legislation for the second time in about a week that legalizes the recreational use of cannabis for adults. But Gov. Ned Lamont is threatening to veto the retooled bill, arguing it opens the industry up to tens of thousands of people previously ineligible to get priority for licenses. Shortly before the bill cleared the Senate on a 19-12 vote, Paul Mounds, the Democratic governor’s chief of staff, issued a statement promising Lamont would nix the bill in its current form. The House was scheduled to take up the same legislation Wednesday, but it was unclear what would happen given the veto threat. The legislation “simply put, does not meet the goals laid out during negotiations when it comes to equity and ensuring the wrongs of the past are righted,” Mounds said in a statement. “To the contrary, this proposal opens the floodgates for tens of thousands of previously ineligible applicants to enter the adult-use cannabis industry.” He said the bill, which was amended twice Tuesday, allows “just about anyone with a history of cannabis crimes” or a member of their family, regardless of their financial means, who was once arrested for possession of drugs to be considered an “equity applicant,” given the same weight as someone from a neighborhood hit hard by the war on drugs.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill that would bar police from releasing juvenile mug shots for minor crimes. House Bill 243 by Rep. Franklin Cooke, D-New Castle, would apply to booking photos of children 17 or younger. According to the bill, mug shots could still be published if the juvenile is charged with a violent felony and if the mug shot is necessary to protect the public’s safety. The Delaware Police Chiefs Council, which represents all police departments in the state, supports the bill, according to its chair, Patrick Ogden. Jamie Leonard, president of the Delaware Fraternal Order of Police, the officers’ union, said his organization has yet to take a stance on the bill. In a Statehouse where several lawmakers in both parties – including sponsor Cooke – are retired officers or affiliated with police, proposed changes to policing laws historically need support from the police themselves. Cooke has argued that, because information such as mug shots lives forever on the internet, teenage mistakes come back to haunt people in adulthood. “I think everyone can agree that in the vast majority of circumstances, there’s no benefit to publishing juvenile mug shots – only damage to young people,” Cooke said. “I’m committed to getting this bill passed this year and ending this practice.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With all capacity limits and restrictions lifted in the district, plans for Fourth of July celebrations are back in full swing. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that he will host essential workers and military families on the South Lawn to celebrate the nation’s birthday, WUSA-TV reports. “D.C. is open and ready to welcome back visitors to celebrate the way we came together as a city and as a nation this year,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. “We have shown once again that when we come together, there is nothing we can’t do.” With the nation inching closer to Biden’s vaccination goal, the country is gearing up for an Independence Day celebration like no other. “We thank President Biden and his team for acting with urgency to get the vaccine to the American people so that we could save lives, get our country open and celebrate together once again,” Bowser said. The district will support the White House and host the annual Fourth of July fireworks celebration on the National Mall. The 17-minute display will be held Sunday, July 4, starting at 9:09 p.m. and will be launched from both sides of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. The city also plans to celebrate the return of the Barracks Row and Palisades 4th of July Parades.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Sunsets across the state in the coming days could become even more spectacular, as clouds of dust from the Sahara desert sweep in across the Atlantic coast. The plume is expected to dampen storm activity but worsen air pollution, causing trouble for some people with allergies and other respiratory problems. Some health experts say symptoms could mimic those from COVID-19. NASA is monitoring the dust, which was swept off Africa by strong winds swirling across the deserts of Mali and Mauritania. Trade winds are carrying the plume across the ocean, with the leading edge expected to arrive in Florida in the coming days. “It’s going to be a major dust outbreak,” Joseph Prospero, professor emeritus at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. Prospero pioneered research into African dust clouds. Dry winds carrying the particles could help smother storm systems by drying out the humid tropical air that feeds turbulent weather across a well-traveled route for hurricanes, experts said. “It’s been moving across the Atlantic for the past several days, and it’s expected to be in the area around Friday or Saturday,” Sammy Hadi, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Miami, told the paper.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTrenton: A nursing home director in northwestern Georgia was charged with cruelty after a sheriff said authorities discovered the facility didn’t have working air conditioning and had only one staff member looking after residents. Dade County deputies arrested Kent Allen Womack on Monday night, news outlets report. The 55-year-old was in custody at the county jail, and Sheriff Ray Cross said more charges were pending. Authorities reported to Woodhaven Senior Living in Trenton after receiving a call from a family member about the residents, from 61 to 97 years old, being evicted and having an hour to pack their belongings. Deputies who went to the nursing home learned one staff member – who wasn’t a trained nurse – had been watching the residents for 32 hours straight, according to news outlets. Every other employee quit because of the conditions. It was also discovered that the air conditioning in the building only worked near Womack’s office. “We checked the temperature in one of the air units in there, and it registered over 100 degrees,” Cross said Tuesday. The sheriff said Womack smelled of alcohol when he arrived at the facility. Cross asked if he had been drinking, and the nursing home owner responded: “I didn’t drive here.” Authorities found two small bottles of alcohol in Womack’s pocket, Cross said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Eleven inmates at a state jail have asked a judge to release them early for public health reasons amid a COVID-19 outbreak. Hilo Circuit Judge Peter Kubota granted five of the motions but denied or postponed the rest, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Most of the cases he denied were for offenders who had repeatedly violated probation in the past. As of Friday, nearly 200 inmates at the Hawaii Community Correctional Center had tested positive for the coronavirus since May 24. There were seven active cases among staff. The outbreak occurred as the jail struggled with overcrowding. The jail population exceeds operational capacity by more than 100 inmates. Deputy Public Defender Patrick Munoz, who represents some of the people asking to be released early, said the increasingly intolerable conditions at the jail represent an undue hardship for inmates. “Not only are individuals being exposed to the effects of this potentially life-threatening and long-lasting virus, but there’s also the effects on people being in an overcrowded prison afraid for their lives,” he said. “It’s like they’re on a sinking ship. Fear is overcoming them;people are beginning to panic.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Unemployed residents could get kicked out of a state benefits program if they don’t follow new job-seeking requirements that went into effect this month. People receiving unemployment benefits now have two business days to apply for a job opening after receiving a referral from the Idaho Department of Labor, the Idaho Statesman reports. If they don’t, they could lose their unemployment benefits. “Once a job is referred, the claimant must apply for the job or act on that referral,” Idaho Department of Labor director Jani Revier said. “In the past, when referrals were made, there were no consequences if they didn’t follow up.” State workforce consultants will check with the potential employer to verify that the person applied for the referred job. Previously, the labor department didn’t track whether people followed up on referrals. In March, there were 1.4 available jobs for every unemployed Idaho resident, Revier said. Property values and housing costs have climbed dramatically across much of the state in recent years, particularly during the pandemic. Idaho’s minimum wage of $7.25, meanwhile, hasn’t increased since 2009. A full-time minimum-wage worker would earn about $1,250 a month before taxes. Online rental agency ApartmentList.com says median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Boise is just over $900.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A nonprofit formed to highlight the lack of leaders of color within the city’s arts and cultural systems is asking artists of color to imagine what the nation’s third-largest city could look like without stubborn inequities in art, theater and other institutions. The first phase of Enrich Chicago’s new program, called Imagine Just, begins this month. The series of brainstorming sessions will ask artists, performers and other Chicagoans to imagine what an equitable arts and cultural scene could look like. Nina Sanchez, co-director of Enrich Chicago, sees the project as an expansion of the organization’s focus on anti-racism training and education within Chicago’s arts and cultural community. The organization was founded in 2014 by former leaders of the influential Joyce Foundation and the Auditorium Theatre. It now counts more than 50 arts and cultural organizations as partners. But the coronavirus pandemic and widespread activism during the past year in response to George Floyd’s death highlighted stubborn inequities in all aspects of life, prompting conversations about what else the organization could do to force change in Chicago’s arts and culture community, Sanchez said. Imagine Just is the result, attempting to amplify the voices of artists of color and reach leaders of local institutions that can feel out of reach, she said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Several teachers unions are seeking to block a new state law, set to take effect next month, that they say unfairly targets teachers and makes it harder for unions to collect dues. The unions representing Anderson, Avon and Martinsville school districts and the teachers that lead them filed a lawsuit Tuesday in Indiana’s federal Southern District court challenging Senate Enrolled Act 251. The law, which will go into effect July 1, sets out a new process for the collection of teachers union dues, requiring teachers to annually complete a three-step process to have union dues deducted from their paychecks. Jeff Macey, the attorney representing the teachers and their unions, said no other union or organization that allows for wage deductions is required to follow the same process. The law violates the constitutional rights of teachers, he said. “Why are teachers being singled out for these onerous restrictions?” Macey said. “No other union, no other charity, no other organization in the state has to do this to assign a portion of your wages to (them).” The lawsuit names Attorney General Todd Rokita, Secretary of Education Katie Jenner and Tammy Meyer, chair of the Indiana Education Employment Relations Board, as defendants.\n\nIowa\n\nLake City: A fire destroyed an internationally renowned western Iowa business that makes pipe organs for churches, schools and other customers around the world. The fire at Dobson Pipe Organ Builders in Lake City was reported about 4 p.m. Tuesday, officials said. Firefighters who arrived on the scene found the building engulfed in flames, which caused the building’s exterior walls to collapse. One employee of the company was burned when he discovered the fire and tried to put out the flames, according to authorities. The State Fire Marshal’s Office said it believes the fire was started by a malfunctioning fan that caused sawdust to ignite. Dobson Pipe Organ Builders was founded in 1974 by Lynn Dobson, a Carroll native who attended Wayne State College in Nebraska, according to the business’ website. During his years at the college, he built his first 12-top mechanical action organ in a shed on his family’s farm that he sold to Our Savior’s Lutheran Church in Sioux City, where it is still played. Dobson opened the Lake City factory in a former farm implement dealership on the town’s square in 1974. The company installed its 98th organ this year at St. Christopher’s Church in Chatham, Massachusetts, according to its website, and planned its 99th for Saint James Church in Sydney, Australia.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Kansas Statehouse, often dubbed the people’s house, was missing one thing for the past year: the people. Lobbyists and staff joined elected legislators in the building for the January session, but pandemic-related limits on visitors meant no school groups, curious tourists or children standing in front of John Steuart Curry’s epic painting “Tragic Prelude,” a history book textbook brought to life before their very eyes. That changed Monday, when the Statehouse once again resumed tours, bringing a sense of normalcy back to downtown Topeka as a trickle of visitors to the seat of state government turned into a waterfall. Only one person showed up for a 9 a.m. tour, leaving staff wondering how many onlookers would show throughout the day. But almost two dozen visitors came for a tour two hours later – numbers that would have been above average even before COVID-19. Not everything is fully back to normal, though. Tours to the top of the Statehouse dome have yet to resume, with staff hoping to have them back up and running later this summer. And the four-times-a-day tours require juggling for workers, with many part-time guides still laid off.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A 25-foot-tall nest is being pieced together on a massive scale at Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, already home to a family of giant wooden trolls. Artist Jayson Fann is constructing his “Spirit Nest” creation as part of a new “Playcosystem,” a new 10-acre natural playground that stresses the importance of free play and connecting children with nature. The enormous nest’s spiraling branches resemble a prehistoric bird’s nest or a massive clock face to be ogled, climbed on and enjoyed. Fann is working on 12 Spirit Nests this year, with the pandemic slowing his output in 2020. An amphitheater made from salvaged forest wood will encompass the Bernheim nest, providing a place to educate and entertain visitors in the forest. A large drum made from the hollowed stump of a fallen maple tree will sit in the center of the nest. A percussionist himself, Fann’s goal is for the project to be a link to the Indigenous people and African Americans who have a history with the land at Bernheim. It is a nest for all people. “That’s what the nests are. They are storytelling spaces, to bring people together, in the spirit of community. Imagine a full moon and kids are here; maybe there is a campfire, and you’ve got people from different cultures sharing their life story, connecting and healing. That’s a space I want to hang out in,” he said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state has created a framework for self-driving delivery robots to drop off packages and navigate streets, under a bill backed by lawmakers and Gov. John Bel Edwards. The new personal delivery device law sponsored by state Sen. Rick Ward, R-Port Allen, took effect immediately after the Democratic governor signed the legislation. Grocery stores, pizza delivery restaurants and Amazon have started working on delivering items with self-driving robots. Ward told his colleagues he envisioned pharmacies, restaurants or other stores near local neighborhoods possibly using the devices to make short-distance deliveries. “Your constituents would be able to place an order for any number of things, and that personal delivery device would be able to pick that up from a store location and go throughout the neighborhood and deliver it along the way,” Ward told the House transportation committee when it debated and approved the measure. Under the new law, self-driving delivery robots must run at low speeds – up to 12 miles per hour in pedestrian areas and up to 20 mph in others. They must yield to pedestrians and can’t obstruct traffic or transport hazardous materials. Companies using the delivery vehicles must have lights on the front and rear of each device and maintain at least $100,000 of insurance on each one.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A proposed constitutional amendment to require popular elections for Maine’s attorney general, secretary of state and treasurer has fallen short in the state House. A two-thirds majority is required in both chambers to send the proposed amendment to the voters for approval. The bill won 27-7 support on Monday in the Senate, which approved an amendment to ensure the use of ranked-choice voting. But the House, which previously narrowly approved the measure, rejected the amended version by an 81-62 vote Tuesday, the Bangor Daily News reports. Maine is among a handful of states that do not hold statewide general elections for so-called constitutional officers. The positions are chosen by the Legislature and typically are filled by the party in power. Former Republican Gov. Paul LePage called for a similar change in 2015, when he was involved in a political dispute with then-Attorney General Janet Mills. But Republican support eroded with the ranked-choice voting provision. Republicans have decried the voting system since GOP U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin lost his reelection to Democrat Jared Golden despite winning the plurality of first-place votes. Golden was declared the majority winner after an additional voting round in the three-way race.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Videos showing police officers kneeing one Black teen and using a Taser on another on the beach community’s Boardwalk in separate confrontations that began over vaping are stirring criticism of the department’s use of force in such cases. On June 6, officers tried to stop a teen because he was vaping, police said in a statement. When he pulled away from an officer grabbing him in a “bear hug” and began threatening to kill them, an officer used a Taser, according to charging documents. Video of the encounter shows the teen with his hands up, but as one hand drops toward his backpack, an officer fires a Taser, and he falls to the ground. Other videos show the teen being carried away by officers with his hands and feet tied. Court documents state that the 18-year-old from Perryville teen is Black. A video of another Boardwalk confrontation Saturday shows another Black teen being held by several officers while another knees him repeatedly as a dozen officers and public safety aides hold back an angry crowd. One teen is taken into custody after lifting one of several police bicycles encircling the officers, and another is Tased as he struggles with officers. That confrontation began after officers approached a large group of people vaping to tell them it was prohibited, then returning when they saw one begin to vape again, police said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A company that authorities say failed to deliver on a contract to supply 1 million N95 face masks to the state and then made false statements in connection with its obligation to refund the state has agreed to pay nearly $3.5 million to settle the allegations, the state attorney general’s office said Wednesday. The company, Salem-based Bedrock Group LLC, signed a $3.6 million contract with the state in April 2020 in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic to supply the masks, essential for health care workers, according to a statement from authorities. The state made the purchase after it was contacted by the company’s president with an offer to supply the masks, which the president said would come from a reputable manufacturer in China. The masks were supposed to be shipped to the state in mid-April 2020, but the order was terminated in June after fewer than 100,000 of the masks were delivered. Bedrock repeatedly acknowledged its obligation to refund the state but failed to do so, according to the attorney general’s office. “This company tried to take advantage of the state by holding onto millions of taxpayer dollars it owed for masks that it never delivered,” Attorney General Maura Healey said. In addition to repaying the money, Bedrock is not allowed to seek another state contract for five years.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A school district that never returned to classrooms in the 2020-21 academic year will embrace online education again in the fall and open it to more students. Lansing said it will keep online classes as an option and invite families from other mid-Michigan districts to participate. The district also plans to open schools in a traditional way as the COVID-19 pandemic eases. “We had a number of students who were doing very well” online, said Superintendent Sam Sinicropi. “So we decided to explore what it would look like to offer a virtual option.” The district expects to enroll up to 600 students and hire 15 new teachers, who will teach solely online. Students will be allowed to participate in sports and other activities at Lansing schools. “There are some families that prefer this, and hopefully this will be the answer for them,” Sinicropi said. The capital city’s district has more than 10,000 students.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A bankruptcy trustee’s search to recover assets linked to one of the largest financial crimes in state history has netted $722 million. Doug Kelley said his work to collect assets from Tom Petters’ $1.9 billion Ponzi scheme is nearly done 13 years after the search began. A motion filed in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis last week shows the amount recovered and returned to victims and creditors, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. “We can see the light at the end of the tunnel here,” Kelley said. “It has been a long and arduous process that was at times bumpy, but I am quite pleased with the collective return of $722 million.” Petters, now 63, was indicted in 2008 on multiple counts of mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy for operating the scheme that spanned 26 countries, including the the Cayman Islands, Germany and Switzerland. A federal jury found him guilty on all counts, and he was sentenced to 50 years in prison. He is currently an inmate at the federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas. Kelley said just four or five cases remain, including one filed against the Bank of Montreal in Canada.\n\nMississippi\n\nBooneville: Friends, family and former colleagues gathered in the city Monday to remember former Mississippi House Speaker Billy McCoy and unveil a sign that names a segment of a highway in his honor. McCoy was 77 when he died in 2019. The farmer from Rienzi was a self-described Franklin D. Roosevelt New Deal Democrat who was first elected to the state House in 1979. McCoy was speaker during his final two terms, ending in 2012. McCoy – known for down-home turns of phrase and the occasional flash of temper – was instrumental in passing the 1987 Highway Program that led to construction of hundreds of miles of four-lane roads across Mississippi, including in rural areas struggling for economic development. Legislators in 2020 passed a bill naming segments of highways, including the stretch of U.S. 45 in Prentiss and Alcorn counties, in honor of McCoy. Both counties were in his House district. Democrat Steve Holland of Plantersville, who served in the House from 1984 to 2020, said McCoy would pick him up in an old blue Oldsmobile, and they’d ride the backroads of Mississippi together, stopping at country stores to see what was on people’s minds. “I don’t need a sign to remember him,” Holland said. “But, my goodness, what a wonderful way because the guy loved the roads. He loved riding them, and he loved seeing people.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Two of the area’s largest employers have announced they will require employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by fall. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports BJC HealthCare and Washington University both announced the requirements Tuesday. The decision comes at a time when demand for vaccines is waning in Missouri, a state that already lags the national average with its COVID-19 immunization rate. The St. Louis region’s three other major health systems – SSM Health, Mercy and St. Luke’s Hospital – have not issued vaccine requirements but said they were discussing the issue. Missouri Hospital Association President and CEO Herb Kuhn said hospitals across the state have “seen COVID-19’s devastation in lives and health lost,” and many are evaluating vaccine requirements. Washington University will require all faculty, staff and trainees to be vaccinated by Aug. 30. BJC will require employees to be fully vaccinated by Sept. 15.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state Department of Corrections will pay $250,000 to settle claims from a guard who claimed he was retaliated against after reporting rape allegations at Montana Women’s Prison. Daniel Root claimed he was passed over twice for a promotion after reporting in 2017 allegations of his supervisor’s sexual misconduct with inmates. The results of an investigation into the claims have not been released, but the lieutenant accused of having sex with an inmate resigned in 2019, the Montana State News Bureau reports. Root said in court filings that he was told filing lawsuits and talking to the press about issues of public concern reflected negatively on his chances for promotion. He resigned under the terms of the agreement. His attorney told the Montana State News Bureau that Root wanted to put the case behind him. Attorney Kevin Brown said he hopes the case will spur other corrections employees to step forward and report violations of rape reporting requirements. The Department of Corrections settled a separate retaliation claim from an agency employee earlier this year, also for $250,000. In that case, a former corrections employee said he faced discrimination and retaliation in 2016 for his post-traumatic stress disorder while working at the men’s state prison near Deer Lodge.\n\nNebraska\n\nSouth Sioux City: The City Council has approved a payment of $500,000 to settle its part in 16 lawsuits filed against the city and a now-defunct biogas plant by homeowners who accused the plant of sending rancid fumes through the city sewer system and ruining their homes. The settlement calls for the city, Big Ox Energy, three insurance companies and two other companies to pay a combined $1.75 million, which will be divided among the homeowners. The City Council approved South Sioux City’s portion Monday, the Sioux City Journal reports. Big Ox began operations in September 2016, separating solids from industry wastewater to create methane. The plant sold the methane and injected it into a nearby natural gas pipeline. Big Ox was subject to odor complaints soon after it began operations and was cited for numerous environmental violations until it shut down in 2019. Neither South Sioux City nor Big Ox, which have both denied the homeowners’ claims, admit liability in the settlement. After the complaints and lawsuit, Big Ox in turn sued two other companies. The first was former soybean processor CHS Inc., which it said illegally released acidic wastewater into the sewer system. The second was Olsson Inc., an engineering firm Big Ox said recommended wastewater from its plant be routed through a sewer main.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A battery recycling company founded by a former executive at Tesla Inc. broke ground on 100 acres of land at an industrial park near the city as part of its expansion plan. Redwood Materials, founded in Nevada in 2017, is expecting its operations to continue growing with a boost in used battery packs from older electric vehicles. As a result, the company plans to expand its facilities and increase its workforce from just over 100 employees to more than 600 in the next couple of years. In addition to the acquisition at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, the company is also undertaking a major project in Carson City to expand its 150,000-square-foot facility to 550,000 square feet within the next two years. “We’ve been on the quiet side because we prefer to make progress and get things done,” Redwood Materials CEO JB Straubel said. “We felt it was time to connect a bit more with the local community and help raise awareness for hiring and make sure people realize this is a worthy and unique opportunity here as well.” Straubel is known for helping launch Tesla, the electric vehicle manufacturer that has been operating out of the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center for nearly seven years. Tesla works with Panasonic to create battery packs from various components. Redwood Materials, Straubel’s new venture, does the reverse.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Budget negotiators in the state House on Tuesday went along with the Senate version of a provision that would prohibit teaching schoolchildren or public employees that one race is superior to another or that one inherently discriminates against another. The House had included language in its budget defining numerous “divisive concepts” that would be banned from being taught in schools or by public employers during diversity and inclusion training. The Senate overhauled the language in the face of opposition from Gov. Chris Sununu, framing it as an anti-discrimination measure that would not prohibit discussions about history or current events. But opponents have argued it still would limit First Amendment rights by banning discussions about important topics including racism and sexism. Rep. Lynne Ober, R-Hudson, who is leading the committee hashing out a compromise on the budget, said Tuesday that the House acceded to the Senate’s language. There was no debate. Work continued on the larger bill Wednesday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: State lawmakers are considering a bill that would fast-track offshore wind energy projects by removing the ability of local governments to control power lines and other onshore components. The bill, introduced last week and advanced Tuesday, would give wind energy projects approved by the state Board of Public Utilities authority to locate, build, use and maintain wires and associated land-based infrastructure as long as they run underground on public property including streets, though the BPU could determine that some above-ground wires are necessary. It appears to be an effort to head off any local objections to at least one wind power project envisioned to come ashore at two former power plants and run cables under two of the state’s most popular beaches. At a virtual public hearing in April on the Ocean Wind project planned by Orsted, the Danish wind energy developer, and PSEG, a New Jersey utility company, officials revealed that the project would connect to the electric grid at decommissioned power plants in Ocean and Cape May Counties. The northern connection would be at the former Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in Lacey Township; the southern connection would be at the former B.L. England plant in Upper Township.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democrat-backed efforts to expand voter access in the state are coming to fruition, with the rollout of same-day voter registration this month. The first trial run took place in a low-turnout special congressional election June 1, allowing voters to register at early voting centers in the final weeks of balloting and Election Day. In all, 2,012 residents took advantage of the opportunity to register during the final four weeks of the election, according to the New Mexico secretary of state’s office. Late-registering voters flocked primarily to the Democratic Party, accounting for about 53% of those registrations – and 50% of those on Election Day itself. About 32% of the later registrations aligned with the Republican Party. U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a Democrat, won the June 1 election with 60% of the vote to fill the 1st Congressional District seat held previously by Deb Haaland. Same-day registration is likely to be an option in future New Mexico elections, but it requires approval every two years by a panel of voting systems regulators. Approval is pending for the November local election to pick mayors in cities including Albuquerque and Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A former Shake Shack manager has filed a lawsuit against the Detectives’ Endowment Association, the Police Benevolent Association, and about 20 unnamed New York Police Department officers accusing them of false arrest and defamation. Marcus Gilliam and other employees were accused by officers of serving them poisoned milkshakes last June. In a lawsuit filed Monday, Gilliam said the subsequent interrogation caused him “emotional and psychological damages and damage to his reputation.” Three officers complained that their shakes made them sick and had a bitter and unusual taste. Two hours later, 20 officers approached the establishment and began to treat the store as a crime scene, The New York Times reports. As the investigation unfolded, police unions announced on Twitter that officers were intentionally attacked. “Tonight, three of our fellow officers were intentionally poisoned by one or more workers at the Shake Shack,” the detectives’ union tweeted. The Police Benevolent Association made a similar post later alleging that the drinks were intentionally spiked with “a toxic substance, believed to be bleach or a similar cleaning agent.” Rodney Harrison, the NYPD’s chief of detectives at the time and now chief of the department, eventually tweeted that the investigation found “no criminality” by the employees.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s ban on most abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy must remain unenforceable, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday, rejecting arguments that the law should be left intact because prosecutors aren’t going after doctors who violate it. A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, upheld a 2019 lower-court decision striking down the prohibition, which has been on the books since 1973. The Republican-dominated Legislature in 2015 narrowed the scope of medical emergencies under which a woman would be exempt from the 20-week limit. That meant more abortions involving unviable fetuses could be considered criminal, raising the fear for abortion providers that they could face prosecution. A U.S. District Court judge in 2019 agreed and blocked the law’s enforcement in situations where the fetus would be considered not viable. State government lawyers representing some district attorneys and state health officials who were sued have argued the abortion providers lack legal standing to challenge the law. Their arguments for the law’s reinstatement are based on the fact that North Carolina has not charged any abortion providers under a pair of laws being challenged and that prosecutors currently have no plans to do so.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The number of wildfires this year in the state has increased significantly, officials say, citing extremely dry conditions. Data collected by the North Dakota Forest Service and the state Department of Emergency Services shows nearly 1,400 fires have consumed about 156 square miles since the beginning of the year. Last year, about 921 fires burned approximately 18 square miles. North Dakota has experienced some of the driest winter and spring months this year. The U.S. Drought Monitor shows more than two-thirds of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought. State Forester Tom Claeys said limited moisture along with warm temperatures have increased the intensity and size of wildfires this year. “This year, it’s imperative that we all know how to mitigate against wildfires, especially as we make plans to enjoy the summer months by recreating outside with friends and family,” Claeys said. “With Independence Day right around the corner, we need to raise awareness now to reduce wildfire risk. We all can do our part to practice fire safety and protect property and lives.” Tribal, state and federal agencies responded to two large wildfires April 30 through May 2. The Roosevelt Creek Fire in the Little Missouri National Grassland and one on the Fort Berthold Reservation have each burned about 15 square miles or more.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican former Speaker Larry Householder was expelled from the state House in a vote Wednesday following his indictment in an alleged $60 million federal bribery probe – only the second time the Legislature has pushed out a member and the first time in 150 years. The Republican-led House voted 75-21 to remove Householder, of Perry County, approving a resolution that said he was not suited for office because of the indictment. The full House voted after lawmakers forced the measure to the floor instead of waiting for the expulsion resolution to work through the committee process. Reps. Brian Stewart and Mark Frazier, both Republicans representing districts that border Householder’s, encouraged their colleagues to “do the right thing” and vote to expel. “This has been a distraction. This has been a stain on the institution, and it is time for us to come together as one body,” Frazier said, adding that “this institution is greater than any one man.” Householder and four associates were arrested in July in an investigation connected to legislation containing a ratepayer-funded bailout of two Ohio nuclear power plants. The $1 billion rescue would have added a new fee to every electricity bill in the state and directed over $150 million a year through 2026 to the plants near Cleveland and Toledo.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A 24-member joint committee of state House and Senate members has been selected to consider proposals for Oklahoma’s share of funds from the latest federal coronavirus relief legislation. House Speaker Charles McCall and Senate President Pro Tem Greg Treat, both Republicans, announced the committee Wednesday. “This is an opportunity to address needs exposed by the pandemic and support economic recovery without growing state government’s financial obligations,” McCall said. Treat said the one-time funds provide “the opportunity to further strengthen Oklahoma’s position through targeted investments in projects across the state.” Gov. Kevin Stitt said the money can be used to improve the state’s infrastructure and workforce, as well as the health of residents. The state is to receive about $1.9 billion of the total $1.9 trillion in federal funds approved by Congress in March. The bill, among President Joe Biden’s top priorities in addressing the coronavirus pandemic and economic crises, was unanimously opposed by Republicans in Congress. The Oklahoma committee will be co-chaired by Sen. Roger Thompson and Rep. Kevin Wallace, both Republicans.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown has signed a bill passed by the Legislature legalizing human composting. The measure signed Tuesday will legalize what’s also known as natural organic reduction, KOIN-TV reports. It also clarifies rules surrounding alkaline hydrolysis, known as aqua cremation. The law goes into effect July 1, 2022. Rep. Pam Marsh, from in Southern Jackson County, who co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Brian Clem, said she decided to sponsor the bill because her constituents are interested in alternative after-death options. “My colleagues could see as well that in addition to providing families with a choice, it also is a business opportunity,” she said. Elizabeth Fournier, owner of Cornerstone Funeral Services in Boring, Oregon, and author of a green burial guidebook, provides “green” and eco-friendly after-death services and has given clients the option of natural organic reduction since it was legalized in Washington state in 2020. Fournier takes bodies to Herland Forest in Wahkiacus, Washington. It’s a natural burial cemetery about 100 miles east of Portland. In 2020, Fournier witnessed her first natural organic reduction and said seeing the process for herself made her more comfortable in talking to her clients about that option.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A western Pennsylvania judge will mediate a dispute over a statue of explorer Christopher Columbus in a city park. Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge John McVay declared an impasse in the dispute between the city of Pittsburgh and the Italian Sons and Daughters of America over the Columbus statue in Schenley Park, the Tribune-Review reports. McVay issued an order last week instructing the parties to identify who will participate from each side during the mediation. City crews last fall covered the 13-foot statue, which was erected in 1955, in advance of Columbus Day. The Pittsburgh Art Commission voted unanimously to remove the statue, and Mayor Bill Peduto agreed, but the Italian Sons and Daughters of America filed a lawsuit. McVay granted an injunction halting the removal but urged the parties to try to reach consensus, saying that “historical figures are people and necessarily come with heroic qualities along with character flaws” but also saying that “racism, slavery and prejudice must always be condemned and rejected by our city.” The group then asked the judge to remove himself, saying the court had adopted “its own beliefs” on settlement discussions that “are based on demonstrably false and biased recitations of history that are swiftly disproven by the primary sources of Columbus’s time.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A doctor has been cited by federal labor officials for failing to take steps to protect his medical office staff from exposure to COVID-19 even after he and other employees contracted the coronavirus. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration said Tuesday that Dr. Anthony Farina Jr. “willfully exposed” his workers to the virus when he decided to continue working. The agency said he also failed to fully implement safeguards such as cleaning and disinfecting regimens, screening all employees for symptoms, or mandating contact tracing or quarantining after exposure. Labor officials said they’d seek a $136,532 fine against Farina, who runs four medical practices: North Providence Urgent Care Inc., North Providence Primary Care Associates Inc., Center of New England Urgent Care Inc. and Center of New England Primary Care Inc. Farina’s lawyer, Michael Lepizzera, said his client will contest OSHA’s findings and proposed penalty, which he said is “legally excessive.” State officials in January suspended Farina’s license under emergency order, saying he posed a danger to the community, though they restored it the following month. Farina also faces federal allegations that he violated fair labor laws by failing to pay overtime to more than 100 employees.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: As the state nears its first execution in a decade, death penalty opponents are renewing calls for South Carolina to toss out its capital punishment statute. A group of faith leaders, academics, organizers and others delivered a letter Wednesday to Gov. Henry McMaster and the General Assembly calling for a halt to two upcoming executions and the repeal of the state’s death penalty law. Group members acknowledge it’s unlikely that the politicians who ushered in a new law aimed at restarting executions after an involuntary 10-year pause will now turn around and repeal that law. Their group, South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, was formed in light of two upcoming executions this month. “We don’t expect that we’re going to stop an execution,” said Abraham Bonowitz, director of Death Penalty Action, a national anti-death penalty group that helps local organizations oppose capital punishment. “What we do expect is that we’re going to create the organization that’s going to abolish the death penalty in this state. It might take two years, it might take 10 years, but that’s what this organization is designed to do.” State prisons officials are planning Friday to electrocute Brad Sigmon, 63, who has spent nearly two decades on death row after he was convicted in 2002 of killing his ex-girlfriend’s parents with a baseball bat.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem indicated Tuesday that she will try again to hold a fireworks display over Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day on the heels of President Joe Biden’s announcement that the White House will be hosting its own “independence from the virus” bash. The National Parks Service in March denied the state’s application to hold the pyrotechnic display, reasoning that fireworks caused safety concerns at the monument, that local Native American tribes objected to the celebration being held on land they hold as sacred and that a mass gathering could still defy coronavirus precautions. In an effort to overturn that decision, the Republican governor has written a letter to the president, bashed Biden in the media and sued the U.S. Department of the Interior. All of those efforts have failed. But after Biden announced Tuesday that he would be encouraging nationwide celebrations to mark the country’s effective return to normalcy, Noem said on Twitter that she would resubmit a request to hold fireworks at the monument on Saturday, July 3. However, even if the federal government reversed its decision, the state would struggle to pull the event together with July Fourth weekend just weeks away. Noem’s administration previously said in court that the state would have to know by June 2 to have ample planning time.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Amazon on Wednesday announced a commitment of $75million for developers to create affordable homes in the city near WeGo Public Transit high-capacity corridors. The company reported 800 homes will be built on private land, and the investment is part of Amazon’s more than $2 billion Housing Equity Fund to preserve and create over 20,000 affordable homes through below-market loans to housing partners, traditional and nontraditional public agencies, and minority-led organizations. The Music City is one of three cities hosting the company’s new headquarters, where Amazon hopes to infuse communities with cash and support over the next five years. Transportation and housing costs account for a significant portion of the average person’s expenses, said Jay Carney, Amazon’s senior vice president of Global Corporate Affairs. “We hope this will pave a path for more inclusive communities,” Carney said. WeGo, the primary regional transit agency operating bus and paratransit service across Nashville, serves close to 30,000 riders daily. Amazon will focus on affordable properties within a half-mile of transit stops and “prioritize opportunities to invest in minority-led organizations and racially and economically diverse communities,” the company reported.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The developer of a long-planned – and controversial – high-speed rail line that would get passengers from Dallas to Houston in 90 minutes announced Tuesday that it signed a $16 billion contract with an Italian company to build the project, in what could be a step toward realization. Webuild, based in Milan, will oversee heavy construction of the planned 236-mile project for developer Texas Central, the companies said in a news release. Webuild will operate through U.S. subsidiary Lane Construction Corporation, based in Cheshire, Connecticut. Nearly half the distance the bullet train will cover – at speeds up to 200 mph – will be elevated to reduce the impact on property owners, the companies said. Residents have fought the high-speed train, which has been discussed for decades and would rely on acquiring land through eminent domain to construct the rail line. Trey Duhon, who heads a group called Texans Against High-Speed Rail, criticized Tuesday’s announcement, saying it was just the developer continuing to try to drum up support for an unpopular project. “Texas Central takes every opportunity to generate what sounds like progress to keep interest and investments alive,” said Duhon, who also is the highest-ranking elected official in Waller County, outside Houston.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s ski resorts set a record for visitors this past winter despite coronavirus-related restrictions and a below-average snowfall, according to industry data released Tuesday. A news release from Ski Utah shows the 5.3 million skier days marked a major rebound from the previous winter, when the state registered 4.3 million after the season was cut short by the pandemic. The industry association said this winter’s figure also surpasses the previous record of 5.13 million skier days set during the 2018-19 ski season. Utah resorts were forced to implement COVID-19 safety protocols, including capacity limitations and mask mandates, but the industry association said those didn’t stop skiers and snowboarders from visiting. “Throughout the season it became clear that skiing provided a respite from the day to day realities of the pandemic and allowed an option for guests to safely socialize outside,” Nathan Rafferty, president of Ski Utah, said in a statement. Utah’s big year mirrors a banner season for ski resorts around the country. The National Ski Areas Association’s said the 59 million skier visits nationally are the fifth-most overall.\n\nVermont\n\nBrattleboro: A refugee resettlement nonprofit has plans to start a new program in the state to relocate refugees in smaller, more rural communities across the United States. The Ethiopian Development Community Council, a nonprofit agency that partners with the State Department to resettle refugees in the U.S., wants to launch its program in Brattleboro because of the city’s support. The first families should arrive in the city before the end of the year if the program is approved by the federal government, Vermont Public Radio reports. The nonprofit has also chosen Wausau to test out the program, pending federal approval. The nonprofit is preparing for an influx of refugees because the Biden administration has promised to increase the number of refugees allowed in the country and reopen the refugee resettlement program on which the Trump administration imposed restrictions, the radio station reports. “If we want to create integration of refugees, having them only in big cities where they would be congregating among themselves, only, is not going to help long-term integration,” said Tsehaye Tefera, founder of the Ethiopian Development Community Council. Brattleboro town manager Peter Elwell said he knows there could be opposition to the program, but the plan is in line with the town’s priority to improve equity in one of the nation’s whitest states.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Riders on the city’s transit system won’t have to dig into their pockets for another year. The board of directors of Greater Richmond Transit Company announced Tuesday that the system will remain fare-free through June 30, 2022. The system said in a news release that it has used state and federal COVID-19 relief funds since March 2020 in response to public health measures. GRTC also has sponsored the fare-free rides in the interest of economically distressed communities who rely on public transit to reach jobs, food and other resources. Free fares include rides on local buses, the Pulse, Express Bus, and CARE/Paratransit vans, the news release said. A spokesperson said workers who collected fares were offered other jobs within the company.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Scientists have found a dead Asian giant hornet in Marysville, north of Seattle – the first so-called murder hornet discovered in the country this year, federal and state investigators said Wednesday. Entomologists from the state and U.S. agriculture departments said it’s the first confirmed report from Snohomish County and appears to be unrelated to the 2019 and 2020 findings of the hornets in Canada and Whatcom County, along the Canadian border, that gained widespread attention. The 2-inch-long invasive insects, first found near the U.S.-Canada border in December 2019, are native to Asia and pose a threat to honeybees and native hornet species. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their stings are extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill. The world’s largest hornet is much more of a threat to honeybees that are relied on to pollinate crops. They attack hives, destroying them in mere hours and decapitating bees in what scientists call their “slaughter phase.” How they got here from Asia is unclear, although it is suspected they travel on cargo ships. “Hitchhikers are a side effect of all the commerce we do globally,” said Sven Spichiger, an entomologist with the state Agriculture Department who is leading the fight to eradicate the hornets.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice’s nomination of a Republican Party operative to a public broadcasting oversight board has prompted concern about the appointee’s credentials and whether the GOP governor will use his political muscle to fill multiple expired seats. Members of the state Senate Confirmations Committee received notice Friday of the pending appointment of Greg Thomas to the state Educational Broadcasting Authority, which is the governing body of West Virginia Public Broadcasting, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. Senate Minority Leader Stephen Baldwin, D-Greenbrier County, said Monday that Thomas’ background doesn’t make him a good fit for the authority. The pending appointment “stood out like a sore thumb,” Baldwin said. “You’ve got an outwardly partisan political operative being nominated to a position that doesn’t call for that at all.” Thomas has worked for several GOP politicians, including the campaign of convicted former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship’s failed U.S. Senate run in 2018. He also works for the nonprofit group West Virginia Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state is on track to scrap a requirement that has been a singular rite of passage for generations: the behind-the-wheel road test for teenagers. The Legislature’s Republican-controlled joint finance committee last week approved the state Department of Transportation’s proposal to continue its program of waiving road tests for 16- and 17-year-olds who have completed all driver’s education requirements. If approved as part of the budget by Gov. Tony Evers, the current pilot program would become a permanent part of how the Department of Motor Vehicles allocates licenses beginning July 1. DOT first began to pilot the waivers in mid-May of last year, citing its desire to reduce interactions between its employees and members of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. Department officials also said they hoped the waivers would allow DMV offices to focus on the backlog of adult driver’s tests that had accumulated amid the pandemic. Under state law, those over the age of 18 only require a passing multiple-choice knowledge test before taking the road test. The DMV has said these people cannot waive their road test because they are not required to complete a driver’s education course and behind-the-wheel training with an instructor.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Lawmakers are pursuing two possible hate crimes bills for next year’s legislative session. One bill to be drafted would require law enforcement to report hate crimes. The other would extend protections to more groups. “I want a starting point to move forward,” state Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, told other members of the Joint Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. At least 47 states have adopted hate crimes legislation since the murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in 1998, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. National groups such as the Brennan Center for Justice do not classify Wyoming as having a hate crime law, though the American Civil Liberties Union does. The statute makes it a misdemeanor to deny anyone “life, liberty, pursuit of happiness or the necessities of life” due to their “race, color, sex, creed or national origin.” The statute does not require police to report hate crimes and does not protect all vulnerable populations, according to testimony at Tuesday’s hearing. Wyoming has recorded 13 hate crimes since 2015, but the number is believed to be underreported.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/uk/uk-strikes-explainer-ambulance-nurses-railways-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Britons urged to avoid risky activity as paramedics join strikes. How ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nAnother day, another round of strikes in Britain.\n\nAs the Christmas holidays approach, railway workers have brought the transport network to a standstill. Border Force staff are preparing to walk out. Postal workers, bus drivers and civil servants are either in the middle of strike action or threatening to strike.\n\nThis week, nurses staged their biggest walkout in decades. And on Wednesday, paramedics are on strike in many parts of England, in a particularly bitter dispute that will bring further turmoil to an already ravaged public health system.\n\nThe public have been urged to only call ambulances if they absolutely need to. ‘Don’t get so drunk that you end up with an unnecessary visit to A&E,” Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, told the BBC.\n\nBut Wednesday’s strike heaps further pressure on the government, which has been accused of disregarding the calls of workers. Health Secretary Steve Barclay told the Daily Telegraph that ambulance workers have “taken a conscious choice to inflict harm on patients,” comments that drew the ire of workers and unions.\n\nA collection of individual disputes across various sectors have coalesced into a broader sense that something has gone very wrong in Britain, with workers saying that their pay, conditions and ability to provide essential services have been compromised by years of cuts and underinvestment.\n\nHow have things got to such a nadir?\n\nWho is on strike?\n\nThursday’s strike by ambulance workers, who are demanding a pay rise in line with inflation, comes after thousands of nurses walked out on 15 and 20 December.\n\nIt is not just health and emergency services that are affected; virtually all forms of travel have been affected in some ways by strike or are expected to be in coming weeks – along with education, the criminal justice system, the postal service and a host of other fields.\n\nRailway strikes have been raging for several months and frequently dominate front pages in the UK. The RMT union, which mostly represents guards, ticket examiners and maintenance staff, has called a series of walkouts, including over the Christmas period. ASLEF, which represents train drivers, has also planned action in January. Railway workers want better pay and increased job security.\n\nPostal workers with Royal Mail, which is now a private company, are taking action in the run-up to Christmas, affecting deliveries during the busy festive stretch.\n\nBorder Force workers in the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) are striking for eight days during the holiday period. The strikes will impact London Heathrow airport, as well as hubs at London Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff and Glasgow. Baggage handlers have also walked out on some dates.\n\nBus drivers in London planned a series of strikes throughout December.\n\nSeveral teachers’ unions are consulting their members about striking, after pay offers were rejected. There is already a national teachers’ strike set for Scotland next month.\n\nCriminal barristers went on strike earlier in the winter, before voting to accept a pay offer and end the action.\n\nWhy are strikes sweeping Britain?\n\nEach workforce has complaints specific to their sectors that have brought them to the picket line. But the wave of strikes must also be viewed in light of the UK’s long-running economic and societal stagnation, which has left workers desperate for a better deal.\n\nA cost of living crisis and soaring inflation have left Britons worse off this year. When adjusted for inflation, wages in the UK have fallen at one of the sharpest rates since records began in 2001, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nAnd Britain’s public sector workers in particular are bearing the brunt; average pay growth in the private sector was 6.9% in the middle of 2022, compared to 2.7% for the public sector – the ONS said this gulf is “among the largest differences between the private sector and public sector growth rates we have seen.”\n\nStill, for many striking workers, anger can be traced back further than the current economic crises.\n\nSince former Prime Minister David Cameron’s austerity program saw budgets for public services slashed, employees have complained of a decline in many of Britain’s local agencies and institutional safety nets.\n\nFunding for local councils and schools slumped over the course of the 2010s, a decade of decline that critics say has held Britain back, leaving a gaping wound in the services parents, children and citizens rely on every day.\n\nThe aftershocks of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic further tightened the purse-strings and complicated a cautious effort to emerge from the tight-fisted approach that defined the 2010s.\n\nMore recently, instability at the heart of government – Britain is on its fifth Prime Minister in six years – and a disastrous financial program unveiled by shambolic ex-PM Liz Truss have dashed many Brits’ hopes that the public sector will get a boost in the near future.\n\nBritish railways have been severely disrupted by strikes for months. CARLOS JASSO/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHow desperate is Britain’s NHS?\n\nStrikes in the National Health Service – a pillar of Britain’s national identity and one of the world’s most lauded governmental programs – are rare.\n\nUntil this month, the UK’s largest nursing union had never called a walkout in its 106-year history. Wednesday’s ambulance strike is the first such action since 1990.\n\nThere are some concerns about the level of service that will continue during the strike. Members of the armed forces are being deployed in an effort to relieve the impact, and health minister Will Quince suggested on BBC Radio that people should avoid contact sport or other “risky activity” while ambulance services are disrupted, comments that were roundly criticized as flippant.\n\nBut workers in the NHS have been pushed to the brink in recent years, with a staffing crisis, low pay and skyrocketing waiting lists leaving hospitals and wards crammed full and staff exhausted.\n\nBrits must now wait an average of one hour for an ambulance if they’ve reported a suspected heart attack, stroke or other similar issues, despite an 18-minute national target. The wait for a “Category 1” call, which relates to immediate threats to life, is up to 10 minutes, despite a seven-minute target.\n\nConditions do not always improve while a patient arrives in hospital, where waiting times are at record levels. Every day, across the country, ambulances can be seen lined up outside emergency departments, waiting to discharge their patients.\n\nIn the West Midlands area of England, one person died after an ambulance delay in the whole of 2020. In the first nine months of 2022, that figure had soared to 37, according to the BBC’s Newsnight program, which obtained the figures through a Freedom of Information request.\n\n“The reality is, every day, nurses across the UK are walking into understaffed hospitals,” Andrea Mackay, who has worked as a nurse for seven years at a hospital in southwest England, told CNN on her reasons for striking last week.\n\n“During one of my worst shifts I was the only nurse to 28 unwell children,” added Jessie Collins, a pediatric nurse. “It’s not safe and we cannot deliver the care that these children need at times.”\n\nHas this happened before?\n\nThis wave of strikes is the biggest to hit Britain in a decade, and the sheer number of services being affected has drawn comparisons to the so-called winter of discontent of 1978 to 1979.\n\nThat period followed bitter pay disputes between the government and both the public and private sector; following her 1979 election victory, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher waged a largely victorious battle with many of Britain’s unions, severely diminishing their power.\n\nIn reality, the strikes of 2022 have caused a fraction of the impact that those did.\n\nA total of 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the most recent month for which figures are available, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) – a far cry from the several million days lost at the end of the 1970s.\n\nBut October’s figure is the highest number for any month since 2011, and virtually all pay disputes seem far from resolved, stoking fears that next year will be one of mass disruption.\n\nWhat do the strikes mean for the government?\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says it cannot afford the pay demands being made by the public sector unions. In the case of railway strikes, it has said the onus is on private train companies to resolve the disputes – despite the fact that the government controls the purse-strings, having bailed out the network during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut the ongoing disruption is a major headache for Sunak, who took over from Truss with the promise of a sensible and restrained approach to Britain’s stuttering economy.\n\nOpinion polls show the government is shouldering much of the blame for the spate of labor unrest, and that the public is generally sympathetic towards striking workers.\n\nMinisters have repeatedly taken a firm line, refusing to bow to the demands of any one union – opening itself up to criticism that it is not making enough effort bring an end to the strife.\n\nRishi Sunak has resisted unions' demands, but has been accused of not doing enough to end the strikes. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nOpposition Labour leader Keir Starmer attacked Sunak on the nursing strike in Parliament last week, telling him that “the whole country would breathe a sigh of relief” if he halted the strike by striking a deal with the RCN.\n\nThe industrial action was a “a badge of shame for this government,” Starmer said.\n\nHis party, which has historical links to several unions, is walking a delicate line on the strikes; Starmer has refused to explicitly support unions’ demands, but has pointed to their walkouts as evidence that the Conservatives have stalled the economy.\n\nThose arguments will be tested even further over the Christmas period and in the New Year, and public opinion will be vital in strengthening the government’s hand or forcing them to the negotiating table.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "'Our dreams never came true.'

Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/19/clinics-kids-ban-pens-changes-benefits-news-around-states/116366192/", "title": "Clinics for kids, ban on pens: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: After COVID-19 disrupted two school years, lawmakers on Monday voted to delay an upcoming state requirement for third graders to pass a reading test before moving up to the fourth grade. The House of Representatives voted 68-27 for the bill by Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, that would delay the promotion requirement, now set to take effect next year, by two years. The bill now goes to Gov. Kay Ivey. The high-stakes promotion requirement is set to take effect at the end of the 2021-2022 school year, but supporters argued it would be unfair to force the requirement on students who were out of the traditional classroom for long stretches during the pandemic. The bill would move the implementation to the 2023-2024 school year. “These kids have had 14 months of not normal schooling. All they are asking for is a little compassion,” said Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile. “I have never ever had a bill where I’ve had so many educators call me.” The bill passed with bipartisan support. During an earlier committee meeting, members of both parties described the difficulties students and parents had in keeping up with schoolwork during the pandemic when classrooms were closed.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: Nearly half of residents 16 and older are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, while more than half have received at least one dose, state public health officials said. Data from the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services shows that 46.9% of state residents had received both doses, while 52.6% had received at least one dose, the Peninsula Clarion reports. These rates were above the national average, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These milestones were reached days after Alaska opened up vaccination appointments to children 12 and up following the CDC’s approval of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for that age group. Anchorage revoked its mask mandate on Friday ahead of its planned expiration date, the same day Juneau’s mask order was eased to allow fully vaccinated people to go in indoor public areas or at crowded outdoor events without a mask. Alaska’s average daily case counts are now trending down significantly statewide, though a few regions are still in the highest alert category based on their current per capita rate of infection, the Anchorage Daily News reports.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The coronavirus pandemic seems to be in a new phase in the state, as vaccinations have increased, and policies have relaxed. After more than a year of several surges in cases, hospitalizations and deaths, trends have been remaining steady at far lower levels than previous months. More people are getting vaccinated against COVID-19 and safely taking off their masks. “We’re at the beginning of the end,” said Dr. Joe Gerald, an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona’s Mel & Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health. Gerald said he foresees cases continuing at a moderate level through the summer before tailing off in July or August but doesn’t think there is a strong likelihood of a massive outbreak like those last summer and winter. Dr. Joshua LaBaer, executive director of the Arizona State University’s Biodesign Institute, has an optimistic view of the pandemic’s trajectory. “I actually feel like we do see the end in sight,” he said. “ It would take a lot for us to get to a point where we would see a surge like before.” That’s because vaccinations are increasing, with about 44% of all Arizonans having received at least one dose, although vaccine administration is at a pace much slower than previous months as demand wanes. Health experts have said it will take at least 70% of the state’s population to get vaccinated in order to reach what’s known as herd immunity, where enough people are immunized to prevent future outbreaks.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: City officials are looking into why sales taxes were higher than anticipated for all but the first two months of COVID-19’s onset. Sales taxes collected in May 2020 through March 2021 have consistently outpaced monthly totals for the year prior. In 2020, the revenues resulted in roughly $1.8 million more from the three city sales taxes than in 2019. The total sales taxes, which include a 1.25% county sales tax, were more than $1 million above budget, according to City Administrator Carl Geffken. “Has it become part of the underlying amount of sales tax we’re going to receive, or is there an issue, a topic, an item – something – that’s going to make all of this sales tax revenue that we’re not anticipating to come in, is it going to make it a one-off?” Geffken said. Fort Smith Finance Director Andy Richards has reached out to the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration for further details about the source of the increased sales taxes. Tax revenues were expected to fall during March and April 2020, when businesses including bars, restaurants, salons and barbershops were either shut down or greatly limited in their service to prevent the spread of COVID-19. But nonessential retail was never restricted in Arkansas as much as in states with full lockdowns.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPalm Springs: Riverside County will remain in the orange tier for another two weeks after its COVID-19 metrics ticked up slightly and remained above the threshold for lifting more business restrictions, according to data released by public health officials Tuesday. The county reported a case rate of 2.8 new daily cases per 100,000 residents, compared to last week’s 2.7. The county’s coronavirus test positivity rate is 1.6%, and its positivity among at-risk populations is 1.9%, Public Health Director Kim Saruwatari said during a Board of Supervisors meeting. Last week’s positivity rate was 1.6%, and positivity among at-risk populations was 1.8%. In order to move into the least-restrictive yellow tier, a county needs to report fewer than two daily new cases per day, a positivity rate less than 2% and less than 2.2% positivity among at-risk populations, for two consecutive weeks. The county has been in the orange tier of the state’s four-tiered, color-coded reopening framework since April 6. The state plans to eliminate the tier system and fully reopen its economy June 15 if there is enough vaccine supply for all eligible residents ages 16 and older and if hospitalizations rates remain stable and low, especially among fully vaccinated Californians, according to the state’s COVID-19 website.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis announced that some cities will begin to accept state-issued digital identification during traffic stops. A major goal of the digital ID program is to reduce how much time officers spend on the side of the road during traffic stops, the Colorado Public Radio reports, to limit the chance of being hit by passing cars. The Colorado State Patrol was an early adopter of the digital ID allowance. Stops are, on average, 10% shorter when someone uses a digital license, trooper and spokesperson Josh Lewis said. The digital ID works through a smartphone app called myColorado that people can show when they are pulled over, according to state Digital Transformation Director Russell Castagnaro. He said 150,000 people have signed up for a digital ID so far, and 78,000 have used it in the past year. Denise Maes, the public policy director for the ACLU of Colorado, voiced concern about rights to privacy and advised that people should know they do not need to give their phone to an officer. Troopers are trained not to handle people’s phones if they elect to use the digital ID, Lewis said. Rather, people should show the ID on their phone to the officer.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: As other governors have announced plans to end a $300-a-week supplemental unemployment benefit to encourage people to find work, Connecticut is offering a $1,000 signing bonus. Starting May 24, up to 10,000 people considered to have been unemployed on a “long-term” basis will be able to sign up on the state Department of Labor’s website and ultimately get paid the bonus after they’ve spent eight weeks in their new full-time job. “You see the big athletes get a signing bonus. Why don’t you get a signing bonus as well?” asked Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, who announced the new initiative Monday. He said he didn’t consider ending the federal supplement, as many states are doing. He acknowledged there are still residents afraid to work because of COVID-19 and thought it was fair to keep the $300 benefit in place. “But that said, I wanted to do everything I could to incent people to get back to work, make it easier for them to be able to get back to work. If it’s child care, if it’s transportation, if it’s clothing, maybe the $1,000 helps.” he said. “It makes it a little easier for them to get back in the game.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Health and community leaders gathered Sunday to help vaccinate newly eligible teenagers at The Warehouse teen center in an effort to combat vaccine hesitancy and close disparities in Black and brown communities. The event aimed to inoculate some of Delaware’s first eligible teens after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on May 10 authorized the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for use in people 12 to 15 years old. Teenagers and parents expressed their relief and gratitude about receiving the vaccine and encouraged others to sign up for the shots. While she was initially hesitant to get the vaccine, 17-year-old Anaya Patterson was persuaded to do so after hearing from her vaccinated friends and family who remained healthy after getting their shots. Patterson, a board chair at The Warehouse, hoped to do the same and set an example for other teens by getting vaccinated at the event. “I think that I could also be that motivating force for everyone else who is hesitant on getting it,” she said. “I just want to be healthy and leave this all behind me.” Dr. Yvette Gbemudu, chief medical officer at the Henrietta Johnson Medical Center, acknowledged the vaccine hesitancy among Black and brown communities and said she hoped the event would alleviate some of those worries.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser has loosened mask restrictions in the district Monday following last week’s change in guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, WUSA-TV reports. The new recommendation from D.C. Health and Bowser’s office says those who are fully vaccinated do not have to wear a mask indoors or outdoors, except in certain settings. D.C.’s updated mask guidance went into effect immediately. Bowser also said businesses have the right to require patrons to wear masks when they enter an establishment. She said district officials will still require masks in Metrorail and MetroBus areas, schools and child care centers, homeless shelters, schools, health care settings and correctional facilities. Bowser said COVID-19-related mandates for summer camps and recreation centers have also been updated.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: City commissioners are likely to devote the bulk of millions of dollars in federal funding to replenishing public-sector revenue losses accrued during the height of the pandemic last year. They also hope the funding can chip away at homelessness and augment affordable housing and human services. Commissioners will get their midyear budget update Wednesday when city staff present an itemized preliminary budget and preplanning efforts to spend the $46.2 million coming as part of this year’s congressional pandemic relief package. Funds cannot be dispersed until the city’s application to the U.S. Treasury is approved. It will be released in two chunks over the next year, 50% in the next month or so and the rest no more than one year after the first allocation. Budget staff have identified how it could best be spent in the community while also replenishing city coffers after a tough budgetary year. Last year, staff predicted $23.4 million in lost revenue linked to the coronavirus’ impact, mostly due to drops in sales and gas tax, utility collection, recreation and other service, public transit and flights. Staff is recommending $28.2 million in relief money go toward addressing those losses in the general fund and covering losses in capital funding, taxes and other fees.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: People held in a metro-area jail are being denied access to pens, effectively eliminating their ability to communicate with their lawyers by mail, according to a filing in federal court. Civil rights groups sued Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill and several of his high-ranking subordinates in July, alleging that overcrowding, a lack of personal protective equipment and limited access to cleaning and sanitation supplies were putting people in the county jail at risk of exposure to the coronavirus. A judge in December approved class-action status for the lawsuit, meaning it would include all current and future detainees. After lawyers began communicating by mail with a large number of detainees, jail officials abruptly changed policy to declare pens contraband, confiscated all detainees’ pens and stopped selling them through the commissary, according to a filing Thursday in federal court. The “unprecedented policy” has no legitimate purpose, keeps people held in the jail from being able to communicate confidentially with their lawyers by mail and makes it difficult for the lawyers to gather necessary information from their clients, the filing says. It also violates the constitutional rights of the lawyers and their clients and “supports an inference of unlawful retaliation for protected speech,” the filing says.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The University of Hawaii will soon require students to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend in-person classes or be on campus. The rule will take effect when at least one of the three COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for emergency use receives full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. That could happen this summer. “It is clear that a vaccinated campus is a safer campus for everyone, and a fully vaccinated student community enables the best opportunity for a healthy return to high-quality face-to-face teaching, learning and research,” University of Hawaii President David Lassner said in a statement. The University of Hawaii System’s enrollment is about 49,600 across 10 campuses. Students can request exemptions from the requirement for medical or religious reasons. Those who are not vaccinated will be able to enroll in online courses. Other schools in Hawaii have not made the vaccine a requirement yet. “We evaluate potential policy on our own schedule and will be in communication with our students, faculty and staff as we move into summer,” Hawaii Pacific University spokesman Stephen Ward said. Gov. David Ige said the state is not yet considering requiring vaccines for younger students.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: The Idaho State Board of Education approved the budgets for the state’s four-year higher education institutions Monday, keeping tuitions mostly flat and including few significant increases in fees or other costs. It’s the second year the board has opted not to raise tuition at the University of Idaho, Idaho State University or Boise State University for Idaho students seeking a bachelor’s degree, the Moscow-Pullman Daily News reports. That move has drawn broad support from university leaders. Brian Foisy, the vice president for finance and administration at the University of Idaho, said his school is also keeping tuition flat for out-of-state undergraduates and for graduate students. “The only increases are a 3.9% professional fee increase for the College of Law and a relatively minor increase in our overall student activity fee,” Foisy said. “These are actually not proposals that come forward from the administration of the university but actually proposals that come from the students themselves.” Tuition and fees for undergraduates seeking bachelor’s degrees at the University of Idaho total $8,340 for in-state students and $27,576 for out-of-state students. Foisy said that’s significantly lower than average student-borne costs at similar schools.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state is now officially allowing vaccinated people to go without masks in both indoor and outdoor settings, aligning with new federal recommendations issued last week. People who have received a full COVID-19 vaccine series can resume daily activities without wearing a mask, including many indoor activities considered high risk, such as dining, seeing a movie or attending a crowded worship service at a local church, the Illinois Department of Public Health determined Monday. Masks are still recommended in medical settings and on public transportation. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the new guidelines were a step in the right direction toward normalcy for the state but also supported those who are still cautious about taking off their masks before the pandemic is fully in the rear view. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, IDPH’s director, reminded people that the pandemic still isn’t quite over and implored them to get vaccinated and join others in taking off their masks. “While more than 64% of adults in Illinois have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, we need to increase that number,” Ezike said. “To slow down disease spread and the development of even more deadly variants, we need as many people as possible to be vaccinated.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Lawyers for Gov. Eric Holcomb are deriding the state attorney general’s arguments that he can block the governor from asking the courts to stop a new law giving legislators more authority to intervene during public emergencies. Holcomb’s lawyers maintain in a new court filing that Attorney General Todd Rokita is making “absurd” arguments that he alone has the legal authority to represent the state in court and can decide whether the new law is constitutional. The legal dispute between the two Republicans stems from Holcomb’s lawsuit arguing that the law passed this spring by the GOP-dominated Legislature is unconstitutional because it gives lawmakers a new power to call themselves into a special legislative session during emergencies declared by the governor. Holcomb’s lawyers said in Monday’s Marion County court filing that the governor’s office was created by the state constitution to head the executive branch, while the attorney general was created by state law and can’t supersede the authority of the governor or the courts. Rokita’s office didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: For its annual Day of the Dead holiday program, the Des Moines Art Center this year will be remembering the names, faces and stories of Iowans who lost their lives to COVID-19. The center is seeking submissions for its “Día de los Muertos: Recuerdo” (“Day of the Dead: I Remember”) program, which will span six weeks beginning in mid-September. “The COVID-19 pandemic has left many communities all over the world grieving,” Museum Educator Mia Buch said in a news release. “We intend to honor the lives of those lost in Iowa by making their stories a part of our yearly Day of the Dead celebration, where the traditions of the Latinx community provide ways to come together and bring us closer to our loved ones who have passed.” The 21st annual celebration will be mainly virtual but will include traditional dance, food, music and art. There also will be a memorial slideshow of honoree submissions, and the art center will select four for feature videos to be posted on its website and social media channels. Honorees will be considered regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation, the art center said in its release. The honoree submission form, available online, is due by Aug. 1. Submissions for the feature honoree videos are due by May 31.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Schools are stepping up efforts to administer COVID-19 vaccines to newly eligible 12- to 15-year-olds as more districts relax mask rules or face pressure to do so. Hundreds of students from public and private schools gathered Monday to get immunized at Topeka High School. “We were surprised that so many people were here,” said Richard Bolejack, as he took his daughter, a freshman at nearby Shawnee Heights High School, to the vaccine clinic. “We were like, ‘Wow,’ because we didn’t think that would be the case.” The students were joined by Gov. Laura Kelly, who touted the effort as the state aims to increase its vaccination rate. School districts from Manhattan to Olathe are conducting similar clinics, and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and the Kansas National Guard are chipping in support as needed. But the governor pointed to a statewide drop in demand, stressing that the next frontier would be making COVID-19 shots available at doctor’s offices throughout the state. “We thought it very important to take the vaccines to the people, rather than expecting them to come to something like this,” Kelly said. “They made it very clear that wasn’t going to happen anymore.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Cutting off the extra federal payments going to unemployed Kentuckians would hurt the state’s economy as it recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. The Democratic governor said he’s willing to consider ending the weekly $300 federal unemployment payment eventually but quickly added: “That doesn’t mean we will.” The extra money is set to expire in September. The Bluegrass State’s most powerful Republican, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, criticized the extra federal benefits Monday. He said governors are “having to clean up this mess” as many businesses struggle to find workers. Meanwhile, two GOP state lawmakers urged Beshear to terminate the supplemental payments, saying the benefit is contributing to a labor shortage. Beshear said he’s trying to “thread the needle” of maintaining the extra federal payments that pump tens of millions of dollars into the state’s economy each week while encouraging people to go back to work as the economy fully reopens. Much of the extra money is spent at grocery stores and other retail businesses, the governor said. “An immediate termination of those extra benefits would hurt our economy and hurt a lot of groups – restaurants and others – that have suffered during this pandemic,” Beshear said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A federal appeals court on Monday declined to review last year’s decision by a federal judge that expanded early voting and mail balloting in Louisiana during last fall’s presidential election. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said the case is now moot, rejecting arguments from two key state Republican officials that the ruling by U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick in Baton Rouge was wrong and could set the stage for more such orders. The ruling from a panel of three judges said in part that “even assuming that issues similar to those that arose in this case as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may come up again in future cases, there is no indication that the parties in those cases will be unable to use the tools available to obtain meaningful review.” State officials agreed to expand voting opportunities during summer elections to prevent the spread of the coronavirus but were unable to reach accord on the fall elections. Dick ordered similar expansions for November and December balloting. Her Sept. 16 order was the result of a lawsuit filed by voting rights advocates, including the Louisiana State Conference of the NAACP and the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state might extend the ability of its residents to use telehealth services beyond the coronavirus pandemic. Many people have transitioned to telehealth during the pandemic, in part to avoid crowded doctor’s offices. Democratic Sen. Heather Sanborn of Portland has proposed a bill to guarantee Maine health care providers have a right to provide telehealth services in the future. Sanborn’s proposal would also allow health care licensing boards to create rules and practices for health care workers. She said it’s time for the state to “make it clear that telehealth is a proper form of health care delivery and ensure that people across our state can continue accessing these critical services no matter where they live or what the circumstances are.” The proposal would add language to health care licensing board statutes to guarantee providers have a right to provide it, Sanborn said. The measure is expected to be considered in committee.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Outdoor stages, family entertainment, local art, diverse food and beverages will return to downtown this year for the National Folk Festival. The Sept. 10-12 event will mark the 80th National Folk Festival and the third time the event takes place in Salisbury. Organizers hope the in-person celebration taking over downtown will also be a strong sign of the city’s continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which previously delayed the anniversary festival in 2020. Festival organizers announced the event’s first six performers this week: Balla Kouyate & Famoro Dioubate, the Del McCoury Band, Grupo Rebolu, the Savoy Family Cajun Band, Shemekia Copeland and the Sri Lankan Dance Academy of NY. “These artists hint at the extraordinary diversity of cultural traditions that will be featured at this year’s National Folk Festival – the event’s 80th anniversary – and each represents the highest level of achievement and excellence,” said Lora Bottinelli, National Council for the Traditional Arts executive director. “There are no repeats from 2018 or 2019, and it’s all free!”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state’s three casinos continued their pandemic recovery in April. The nearly $85 million in gross gambling revenue at the casinos was up slightly from the $84 million in revenue in March, according to data released Monday by the state gambling commission. Massachusetts collected more than $24 million in taxes from gambling in April – the most since before the start of the pandemic. Revenue was up at both Encore Boston Harbor and the Plainridge Park slots parlor in Plainville but declined slightly at MGM Springfield month over month. The state’s casinos are still operating under capacity limits meant to control the spread of the coronavirus. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission plans to meet before the end of this month to discuss loosening occupancy and mask-wearing rules. Massachusetts casinos were closed in March 2020 because of the pandemic but were allowed to reopen last July under strict capacity limits.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state will reinstate a requirement that people receiving unemployment benefits show they are actively searching for work, effective May 30, but has no plan to end a $300 weekly federal supplement going to 816,000 jobless residents. All seven of the state’s Republican U.S. House members wrote a letter to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday urging a halt to the extra payment, which is on top of maximum state benefits of $362 per week. “We call on you to end participation in this program to get our state’s economy back on track and ensure our employers have access to the talent they need to return to normal,” they wrote, echoing a call that at least one small-business group made last week. But Lynda Robinson, spokeswoman for the state Unemployment Insurance Agency, said it does not plan to end any federal unemployment programs, including for self-employed or gig workers who began qualifying at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The work-search requirement, which was waived starting in March 2020, will be restored. Claimants will have to conduct at least one work-search activity for each week they certify for benefits.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: With masks off for many and summer on the horizon, a return to travel is expected to help fuel the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. America’s $1.1 trillion travel industry was among the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, suffering a never-before-seen 42% decline in revenues in 2020. In Minnesota, the $16.6 billion leisure and hospitality industry took a $7.1 billion hit in 2020, with the largest decline in lodging, where revenues fell 37%. On the upside, an Explore Minnesota Tourism survey found that 6 in 10 Minnesota tourism and hospitality businesses surveyed had already returned to pre-pandemic business levels or expect to get there by the end of the year. The overall forecast is that 2021 will see an 80% increase in revenues from 2020. That means travelers who are aching to get out of town but not yet ready to get on an airplane are in a prime position to feed the state’s economic recovery.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: If COVID-19 were a fire, it’s not down to the embers yet. “There’s still some flame,” Mark Horne, Mississippi State Medical Association president, said during a livestreamed discussion Friday. Daily COVID-19 cases reach have average roughly 200 to 230 cases, State Epidemiologist Paul Byers estimated. While that’s much lower than the numbers when the coronavirus surged in winter, thanks to vaccines, coronavirus variants still pose a problem, among other issues. State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs predicted the state would likely soon see a bump in cases, but not to the extent of the winter months. “In a way, we’re halfway through the pandemic; it’s just gonna go slowly,” Dobbs said. “I really do believe you’re likely to get COVID or the vaccine.” Getting vaccinated, all three officials agreed, is the key to keeping healthy and returning to the state closer to normal. The Mississippi State Department of Health reported 608 newly confirmed virus cases Tuesday, including more than 400 identified over the past several months and added to the overall tally. The health department also reported 11 coronavirus-related deaths Tuesday. Since the virus hit the state in March 2020, a total of 315,634 cases and 7,268 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The city is ditching its indoor mask rule – but not until summer break begins for the area’s public school students. The City Council voted Monday to drop the requirement after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance last week that Americans who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 need no longer wear face masks. Springfield-Greene County Acting Health Director Katie Towns said waiting until 11:59 p.m. May 27 for the change to take effect “will allow children not yet eligible for a vaccine to continue to be protected with masks.” She said that “we need to spend these next two weeks working hard to improve our vaccination rates while we wrap up school.” Towns told the council that Greene County’s rolling seven-day coronavirus infection rate has declined 93% since its wintertime peak. “These lower numbers give us confidence in our ability to continue to respond to COVID-19,” she said, citing health department efforts such as contact tracing investigations to slow the spread of the disease. Missouri’s major cities and many nearby counties, including Kansas City, St. Louis and St. Louis County, all ended mask mandates Friday.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state posted 148 new COVID-19 cases Tuesday, bringing Montana’s total active confirmed reports to 974. Cascade County reported 27 new cases Tuesday. The county continues to lead the state in active reports, now with 225 active cases. The county has recorded 8,780 recoveries and 169 deaths. The state has 108,285 recoveries, 1,602 total deaths and 5,175 active hospitalizations from the coronavirus, according to the state website covid19.mt.gov. The state has administered 1,345,671 tests for the coronavirus, which is 1,671 more than Monday. The first case of COVID-19 in Montana was reported March 11, 2020. To date, there have been a total 774,587 total doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in the state and 370,768 residents fully immunized against COVID-19. Yellowstone County added the most new cases in the state with 36 new reports, bringing its total to 151 active cases. Gallatin County added 23 new cases for a total of 75 active cases in the county. Missoula County now has 46 active cases of the virus after adding 14 new cases Tuesday.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Lawmakers rejected state-mandated coronavirus protections for meatpacking workers Tuesday, with opponents arguing that slaughterhouses have already taken precautions and that the pandemic is nearly over. Lawmakers voted, 25-18, to sideline the measure for the rest of the year, even though supporters said it was necessary to ensure that all plants are keeping their employees safe. “It’s not whether or not a plant cares about their employees,” said Sen. Tony Vargas, of Omaha, who sponsored the bill. “There is a need for consistency.” The bill faced an uphill battle because of opposition from Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts, who said Monday that it wasn’t needed. Lawmakers narrowly advanced the measure through an initial vote earlier this month, but supporters at the time fell three votes short of the 30 they would have needed to override a veto. Nebraska’s meatpacking companies complained that the bill imposes unrealistic mandates on the industry, including a requirement to maintain a 6-foot distance between employees in break and locker rooms. “It’s just not workable,” said Sen. Julie Slama, of Peru. But Sen. Ray Aguilar, of Grand Island, said he’s spoken with workers who are still fearful about working in plants and want protections in place for one more year, as the bill would have mandated.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state jobless office said Monday that it has signed on with an identity verification system that requires an additional step to let new regular unemployment insurance applicants securely provide personal information online. The Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation said the system, called ID.me, is meant to ensure security and streamline claims. Beginning Tuesday, applicants for regular claims will be required to use the new system if told to do so by the unemployment office, according to the department. Department employment security chief Lynda Parven said the system has been used for Nevada’s Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program and now for regular applications. It is required under the federal Continued Assistance for Unemployed Workers Act of 2020. She called providing benefits to legitimate claimants the top priority. Parven said the credential service provider is federally certified and already being used by more than 25 states, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security Administration, Department of the Treasury, and retail and service organizations.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is getting nearly $10.7 million in federal grants through the federal pandemic relief package signed into law this March to support efforts to combat substance use disorder and increase access to mental health services, New Hampshire’s congressional delegation said Tuesday. The funding comes in addition to $16.3 million provided in the emergency COVID-19 relief package that was signed into law in December for substance use disorder treatment and mental health care. The funds are coming from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “The pandemic has placed an enormous strain on Granite Staters and underscored the urgent need to provide support for those grappling with mental health challenges and substance use disorders,” U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan said in a statement.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy remained firm Monday that face coverings would still be required indoors at public places for the foreseeable future even after New York officials said they will lift the state’s mask mandate this week. At a briefing just an hour after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo made his announcement, Murphy said lifting the requirement for vaccinated residents would be impossible to police and could lead to a new wave of COVID-19 cases, since the majority of New Jerseyans are still not fully inoculated. “We need to know unequivocally that doing so will not lead to a backslide in our progress,” he said. It leaves New Jersey among a shrinking pool of states that still require virtually all residents to wear masks inside restaurants, stores and other businesses. Murphy said several times Monday that he will lift the mandate “in the not-so-distant future” but did not offer a timeline or what benchmarks need to be met. “This is not always-and-forever, folks,” he said. “We just need a little more time on the clock.” Republicans were quick to blast the Democratic governor. “Instead of following the science here in New Jersey, we have a governor who continues to restrict personal freedoms to cater to the irrational fears of a timid liberal constituency,” said state Sen. Michael Testa, R-Cape May.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: All new Dona Ana County employees will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition of employment. The policy was announced Saturday in a return-to-work memorandum from county manager Fernando Macias, a copy of which was obtained by the Las Cruces Sun-News and verified as authentic by county attorney Nelson Goodin. The memo says county employees will resume working on site effective June 1, with all locations adhering to the New Mexico Department of Health’s public orders pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes to the state’s mask mandate Friday that drop mandatory face coverings for fully vaccinated individuals in most situations. Because the county’s mask mandate was enacted in an ordinance, Goodin said the Board of County Commissioners would consider the first reading of a new ordinance mirroring the new mask mandate for publication at their open meeting next week. With 90% of the county’s employees now vaccinated against the disease caused by the coronavirus, Macias wrote to the rest of the workforce: “I strongly encourage you to do so as soon as possible.” The memo doesn’t say whether new employees may request accommodations for the vaccine requirement under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Andrew Giuliani, the son of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, announced Tuesday that he is seeking the Republican nomination for governor, potentially setting up a battle with third-term incumbent Democrat Andrew Cuomo. “Giuliani vs. Cuomo. Holy smokes. It’s Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier,” the 35-year-old said in an interview with the New York Post. He also posted a video on Twitter that assailed Cuomo for, among other things, barring gatherings and closing businesses and schools as the coronavirus began killing thousands of New Yorkers last March. “At the first sign of a problem, they chose to shut us down. They take away our freedoms. They quarantine healthy people,” he said. The younger Giuliani served as a White House aide under former President Donald Trump and has more recently been a commentator for the conservative network Newsmax. He has never run for public office. Andrew Giuliani first came to public attention at his father’s 1994 mayoral inauguration when, at age 7, he mimicked his father’s gestures at the podium and repeated some of his words. The spotlight-stealing antics were lampooned by Chris Farley on “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Young drivers whose attempts to get their provisional license were stymied by COVID-19 pandemic delays in the past year would get a timing break under legislation headed to Gov. Roy Cooper’s desk. The Senate agreed unanimously Monday evening to House changes to a bill that would cut the amount of time drivers must hold a learner’s permit before seeking a license that lets them drive unsupervised. The time would be reduced from 12 months to six, but the shorter window would only last for those applying for the “Level 2” license through the end of the year. Bill supporters are seeking Cooper’s signature to make it become law. Original bill sponsor Sen. Vickie Sawyer of Iredell County said the measure still assists those teenagers who couldn’t advance because driver’s education classes were postponed as school activities were shuttered. The young motorists who benefit from the proposed change would still have to log 60 hours behind the wheel with a supervising parent, be at least 16 years old and pass a road test to qualify for the provisional license. Earlier versions of the bill would have reduced permanently the wait time to either six or nine months.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s top oil regulator says crude production grew in March and should keep rising throughout the summer, following a lackluster start to the year. The state’s daily oil output increased 2% to 1.108 million barrels per day in March, according to figures released Friday. State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms attributed the uptick to oil companies bringing more wells online that had already been drilled but not yet fracked, a necessary step before a well starts producing oil. Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting water, sand and chemicals down a well at a high pressure to form cracks in rock to release oil. At the height of the oil industry’s woes earlier in the coronavirus pandemic, just one crew was working in the state to bring newly drilled wells online. Now there are nine, The Bismarck Tribune reports. Eighteen rigs were drilling for oil in North Dakota on Friday, up from the single digits last summer. Helms described the turnaround as “a nice, gentle recovery.” Oil production in March was nearly 25,000 barrels per day more than in February. Natural gas production grew by 6% in March to 2.879 billion cubic feet per day. The industry captured 94% of the gas it produced and is meeting the 91% target set by state regulators to help alleviate the wasteful flaring of excess gas.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The state no longer requires fully vaccinated people to wear masks indoors in most situations, under a revised health order released late Monday afternoon. The revised order sets separate face covering and social distancing rules for people based on their vaccination status. The order will expire June , along with all other remaining health orders except those for nursing homes, assisted living facilities and data collection. The order, retroactive to 4 p.m. Friday, aligns Ohio with new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said last week that vaccinated people can return to many of their pre-pandemic activities. People who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 – defined as two weeks past the first dose of a single-dose shot or the second dose of a two-dose regimen – are still required to wear facial coverings and keep social distancing indoors; outdoors when unable to consistently maintain a distance of 6 feet from others outside their family or household; and on public transportation or in taxis or ride-sharing vehicles. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, is still required to wear a mask on planes, trains, buses and other public transportation under the order. Businesses can set their own policies. The K-12 school mask mandate remains in place.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state will end a $300-a-week supplemental unemployment benefit next month, Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Monday. To incentivize unemployed people to return to work, Stitt said the state will offer a $1,200 stipend for the first 20,000 workers who get off unemployment and work at least 32 hours per week at a qualifying job. Claimants can begin applying June 28. “As Ronald Reagan once said, the best social program is a job,” Stitt said at a trucking company in Oklahoma City, flanked by several employers who said they are having a hard time finding workers to fill jobs. “These Oklahoma companies are open for business and ready to grow.” The additional $300-a-week federal supplement, along with pandemic unemployment assistance for gig workers and contractors, will end June 26, Stitt said. About 90,000 Oklahomans currently receive the additional benefit, according to the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. Chad Warmington, the head of The State Chamber, an association of businesses and industries in Oklahoma, said many of his members complain that some unemployed residents are making more in jobless benefits than they would at a job.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A bill that would reinstate Oregon’s moratorium on foreclosures for those experiencing financial hardship during the coronavirus pandemic passed the state Senate on Monday. The bill, which would allow homeowners to put their mortgage in forbearance at least through June 30, passed on a 19-9 vote and now moves to the House. The previous state moratorium expired at the end of 2020, but many homeowners continued to struggle to catch up on mortgage payments. The bill could be extended until the end of the year if Gov. Kate Brown lengthens the statewide emergency period. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the state’s existing housing crisis has only been exacerbated. In late April, more than 30,000 Oregon homeowners said they were not caught up on their mortgage payments, based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent Household Pulse Survey. Lawmakers have pushed the housing crisis to the forefront during this year’s legislative session. Last week, they passed a bill that extends the time renters have the time to pay back rent, from July until the end of February 2022. That legislation is now on the governor’s desk.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The president of the state’s largest teachers union expressed support Monday for in-person instruction in the fall, calling it a “top priority” now that many teachers have been vaccinated and older children have become eligible for COVID-19 shots. “As more students are vaccinated over the summer, we believe that in-person instruction is achievable in a way that keeps everyone safe,” said Rich Askey, president of the Pennsylvania State Education Association, which represents 178,000 active and retired educators, health care workers and others. “Educators and support professionals look forward to working with school district leaders, parents and community members to get students on a pathway to achievement as we emerge from this pandemic.” Askey’s statement came days after the leaders of the nation’s two major teachers unions, including PSEA’s parent union, the National Education Association, called for a full return to in-person learning. Most Pennsylvania schools have already resumed at least some in-person instruction, though some are sticking with virtual learning at least through the end of the current academic year. In March, the state prioritized teachers for the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a bid to help schools reopen.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s economy is growing as it emerges from the coronavirus pandemic, but it still trails the region and nation, according to a new report. Rhode Island’s gross domestic product is projected to have grown by 3.5% in the first quarter, but that lags New England, with projected growth of 5.2%, and the nation, at 6.4%, according to a report published Tuesday by the Center for Global and Regional Economic Studies at Bryant University and the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. Rhode Island’s “growth gap” existed before the pandemic but only widened over the past year, the report said. The state regained some jobs but has not made up for losses suffered at the start of the pandemic, according to the report. “We’ve come a long way from our economic freefall last spring,” RIPEC President and CEO Michael DiBiase said in a release, “but the briefing reveals stubborn structural weaknesses that are slowing our recovery and make the Ocean State more vulnerable in the future.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster has signed into law a bill that forces death row inmates for now to choose between the electric chair or a newly formed firing squad in hopes the state can restart executions after an involuntary 10-year pause. Two inmates who have exhausted their appeals immediately sued, saying they can’t be electrocuted or shot because they were sentenced under a prior law that made lethal injection the default execution method. South Carolina had been one of the most prolific states of its size in putting inmates to death. But a lack of lethal injection drugs brought executions to a halt. McMaster signed the bill Friday with no ceremony or fanfare, according to the Legislature’s website. It’s the first bill the governor decided to deal with after nearly 50 hit his desk Thursday. “The families and loved ones of victims are owed closure and justice by law. Now, we can provide it,” McMaster said on Twitter on Monday. Last week state lawmakers gave their final sign-offs to the bill, which retains lethal injection as the primary method of execution if the state has the drugs but requires prison officials to use the electric chair or firing squad if it doesn’t.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The number of state residents receiving an initial dose of a COVID-19 vaccine has slowed dramatically in recent weeks, prompting medical experts and community leaders to turn to personal conversations to battle misinformation around getting a shot. Just over 4,000 people across South Dakota received their first shot last week, according to the Department of Health – a big drop-off from 26,000 in a week at the end of March. At that point, the state seemed to defy a trend of skepticism in states dominated by Republican politics. South Dakota had boasted one of the nation’s highest vaccination percentage rates; just weeks later, its ranking has tumbled to 24th. “Demand just plummeted,” said Julia Yoder, a spokeswoman for the Brookings Health system who has also been overseeing mass vaccination sites for Brookings County. “Before you couldn’t keep enough in stock, and then it went to crickets. We couldn’t convince people to sign up.” South Dakota appears to have run into what Alan Morgan, the head of the National Rural Health Association, called a “rural wall” of vaccine hesitancy. He said much of the messaging has not been “relevant” to rural communities, adding that “politicians, government officials and movie stars” are not the best messengers to reach rural communities.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Federal support will leave the COVID-19 vaccination site at the Pipkin Building on Wednesday. In six weeks of a federal partnership, the site never lived up to its capacity to administer 3,000 shots a day, or 21,000 each week. Weekly vaccine allocations locally are also set to decline from 60,000, officials said Tuesday, a response to decreased demand. “At any time, if we get a tremendous increase in uptake of vaccinations, we have the ability to flip the switch and to build that capacity back up,” said Gina Sweat, director of fire services at Memphis Fire Department, adding the caveat that a return of federal resources would be unlikely. Help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency arrived April 7. Within the first two weeks of operation, the site nixed appointments in favor of walk-ins but never doled out 3,000 shots a day. In the final four weeks, most days the site never broke 1,000 shots. “I think the closest we came to that was about 2,500 a couple of days,” Sweat said. On Monday, one of FEMA’s last days at the site, 791 doses were administered, city data shows. The Pipkin site will still remain open for vaccinations. Beginning Thursday, the Pipkin site will be open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday. Appointments are not required.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state on Monday joined the growing number of its counterparts that will stop paying the federally funded $300 in extra pandemic-related weekly unemployment aid, as businesses that scaled back or shuttered during the pandemic are reopening. The extra benefits in Texas will end June 26, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said in a letter to the Biden administration. He joins at least a dozen other governors, all Republicans, who are opting out of the additional federal unemployment benefits this summer. The money is part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief measure approved in March and is set to expire in September. But business groups urged Abbott to opt out early, arguing it was hampering the Texas economy’s rebound. Other expanded unemployment benefits in Texas, including one making gig workers and the self-employed eligible for assistance for the first time, will also end in June. Factors besides the extra money help explain why people who are out of work might be reluctant to take jobs. Government surveys show that some still fear exposure to the coronavirus. Many women, especially working mothers, also left the workforce to care for children still in online school for at least part of the week.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Zion National Park has increased the ticket price for a ride on one of its highly popular shuttles from $1 to $2 per person, per day, in a pandemic-related move. After receiving public comment, the park went ahead with the increase to help cover staffing and operational costs associated with the ticket system. With the pandemic raging last summer, the national park used a ticketing system through Recreation.gov to control crowds and maintain social distancing. The ticket system provides predictable access to the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive, which covers the park’s main canyon and handles the vast majority of the 4 million-plus visitors who come to the park each year. Officials say they expect the ticket system to remain in place through the summer and potentially into the fall, and staff is needed in multiple locations to take tickets, answer questions, keep lines short and maintain social distancing and other pandemic guidelines, according to an April press release from the NPS. “Visitation has increased dramatically from early pandemic levels, necessitating reestablishment of visitor services and work can no longer be delayed on critical park projects, and it is therefore no longer financially feasible to absorb operational costs associated with the ticketing system,” according to the release.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott is asking all Vermonters to show their appreciation for emergency medical service workers by getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Scott has declared this week as EMS week. More than 100,000 requests for EMS response are answered yearly across the state, the Republican governor said Monday. “Add to that the unprecedented challenges required of the state’s individual emergency responders and 168 licensed ambulance and first responder services during the pandemic, and you come up with 2,800 of our fellow Vermonters who deserve every moment of the EMS Week recognition that started on Sunday,” he said in a statement. More than 30 EMS-led vaccination clinics are planned around Vermont this coming weekend, providing the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to anyone at least 18 years old, according to the Health Department. A list of walk-in clinics is available on the Health Department’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state is expecting a half-billion-dollar budget surplus by the end of June, blunting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, and officials are awaiting a $4.3 billion federal deposit in the state’s coffers any day. Secretary of Finance Aubrey Layne told legislators Monday that he expects state revenues to exceed expenses by more than $500 million in the fiscal year that ends June 30, the Richmond Times Dispatch reports. Layne also expects Virginia to receive its share of federal aid from the latest congressional relief package in one lump sum soon, leading to a special legislative session to determine how to spend it. That federal money doesn’t include $6.6 billion that the federal government is sending to the state for specific categories of programs, such as support for education, child care, transportation and public health. “I don’t think anyone 14 months ago would have thought we’d be in as good a position as we are,” Layne told the House Appropriations Committee. A year ago, state revenues plunged by $700 million in April, compared with the same month in 2019, as Northam and the Assembly froze more than $2 billion in new spending in the budget they’d adopted March 12, 2020, the same day the governor declared a public health emergency.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: Kitsap County health officials are teaming up with businesses, community organizations and just about anyone who’s up for hosting a COVID-19 vaccination clinic to immunize a broader swath of the population. “We’re going to take the vaccines to people where they are,” said Dr. Gig Morrow, Kitsap Public Health District health officer. Already gone are the days when a limited supply of COVID-19 immunizations included long lines at mass vaccination clinics around Kitsap. Roughly half the county’s population 16 and older is now fully vaccinated. But health officials know there are others willing to get vaccinated if it were convenient. Morrow said the health district is working with a local auto dealership to offer COVID-19 shots, and Peninsula Community Health Services will soon offer them aboard Washington State Ferries’ Bremerton run. No appointment is necessary, and the shots are free. To top it off, the health district has partnered with Crane’s Castle Brewery in East Bremerton to offer shots to those having a pint of beer from 4 to 8 p.m. Thursday. The Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board has temporarily suspended a ban on free alcohol to allow establishments to give away a drink for those who get a poke in the arm.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said Monday that he plans to reach out to leaders in the Legislature to decide how to allocate the latest in federal pandemic relief funding. Justice said his staff is working on a spending plan for $678 million from the package signed into law by President Joe Biden. He said House and Senate input will be sought next week. The funding represents half of what the state will receive to offset economic setbacks from the coronavirus pandemic. Because West Virginia’s current unemployment rate is not significantly higher than its pre-pandemic level, the state will receive the rest of its nearly $1.4 billion allotment next year. An additional $516 million is going to every county and some larger cities. The money can be used by state and local governments for relief from the public health crisis. Under guidance the Treasury Department released along with the numbers, it also can be used to offset harm to workers, small businesses and affected industries; to invest in water, sewer and broadband systems; and to replace lost public-sector revenue. Essential workers also can qualify for premium pay under the program. Officials cannot cut taxes, pay down debt or bolster the state’s rainy day fund with the relief package.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican legislators want to end the $300-per-week federal unemployment supplement, which they said Tuesday hurts businesses that are struggling to fill vacancies as customers return amid a loosening of coronavirus restrictions. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Sen. Howard Marklein, chairman of the Legislature’s budget committee, called on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to support the bill they unveiled with the support of a couple of Wisconsin business owners. Evers, who could veto the bill, signaled his opposition. His spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said that “if Republicans are interested in putting this pandemic behind us, they’ll stop playing politics with our economic recovery” and approve Evers’ state budget proposal. Democrats have generally been supportive of the additional unemployment payment, saying other barriers to work are fueling the worker shortage, not the $300. They also point out that Wisconsin’s unemployment rate of 3.8% is below the national average of 6% and near what it was before the pandemic hit. The bill comes after the state chamber of commerce, more than a dozen trade groups, more than 50 local chambers of commerce and others called on Evers to return the state’s unemployment payments to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Tickets to the College National Finals Rodeo are on the table as an incentive for COVID-19 vaccine recipients, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Casper-Natrona County Health Department is holding a “COVID Block Party” on Friday outside Eastridge Mall, giving the rodeo tickets to those who get their shots at the event. A raffle will also offer chances at tickets to performances by ZZ Top and Foreigner, as well as to Casper Comic Con, the newspaper reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/19"}]}

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}]}

And those levels, as well as the risk to residential and commercial properties, are increasing, the report says.\n\n\"Anytime you're dealing with an urban area with lots of asphalt, just lots of blacktop in general, the rain runs off really quickly rather than getting absorbed by green grass and things like that,\" Schoettmer said. \"So urban areas tend to flood a lot quicker.\"\n\nThe city is also getting, on average, more precipitation, he added. The National Weather Service this year updated its \"climate normals,\" and Louisville's estimated yearly rainfall jumped 7%, to 48.34 inches annually from 44.91 inches.\n\nAcross the river, the report estimates that about 312,150 Indiana properties \"have greater than a 26% chance of being severely affected by flooding over the next 30 years.\" That's about 9% of all properties in the Hoosier State.\n\nMeanwhile, one-fourth of the United States' \"critical\" infrastructure is at risk of flooding, according to the report. Louisiana, Florida and West Virginia join Kentucky in having the most \"community flood risk.\"\n\nGot snow?:Here's what the Old Farmer's Almanac predicts for winter 2021-22 in Kentucky\n\nThe report also found the risk to properties across the U.S. is expected to increase by 10% over the next 30 years, in part due to the effects of climate change.\n\nThere are things communities can do to mitigate their risk and better weather flooding, the report says.\n\nActions that can help include maintaining stormwater systems, roads and dams. Communities also should have response plans and update them regularly, the report says, and improve \"green infrastructure,\" such as open spaces and rain gardens.\n\nFirst Street also recommends homeowners read up on their individual properties' flood risk and learn about flood insurance.\n\nUSA Today contributed to this report.\n\nMary Ramsey is a breaking news reporter for The Courier Journal.

Hess and Thomas C. Frohlich\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nThe global population is aging rapidly. Today, there are roughly 868 million people who are at least 60 years old globally, or about 12% of the world's population. By 2050, more than 2 billion people will be 60 or older, or 21% of the projected global population. In the United States, 27% of all Americans will be at least 60 years old.\n\nHelpAge International's \"Global AgeWatch 2014 Index\" ranked the social and economic well-being of older residents in 96 countries. The report rated each country on four broad factors important to an aging population: supporting income security, fostering good health, employment and education, and the overall environment for older residents.. Norway was rated as the best country for older people to live in, bypassing Sweden, last year's top-rated country. Meanwhile, Afghanistan was rated the worst country for older people for the second consecutive year.\n\nGenerally, wealthy countries are better able to provide for their residents than poor countries. All but one of the top 10 countries had a GDP per capita of at least $30,000. At the other end of the spectrum, just one of the 10 worst-rated countries had a per capita GDP of more than $5,000.\n\nHowever, Kate Bunting, CEO of HelpAge USA, told 24/7 Wall St. that being a wealthy nation alone is not enough for a country to rate well. \"We focus on a multidimensional look at being older,\" Bunting said. The ability of older people to continue working and ensuring that they do not feel socially isolated are examples of important factors not necessarily captured by GDP, Bunting added. Despite the challenges of crafting policies to help an older population, \"We feel that global aging is really a triumph of development.\"\n\nWide-ranging pension coverage is one factor that can help the elderly population of a country. In many of the 10 highest-rated countries, 100% of the population 65 and over receives a pension. According to HelpAge International, only half of the global population can expect to receive a pension of any kind in old age.\n\nProviding for older residents' long-term health is also a critical factor in a country's ranking. In each of the top 10 countries to grow old in, a resident who is 60 years old can expect to live at least another 23 years, on average. However, in all of the worst countries to grow old in, the average life expectancy for a 60 year old resident is less than 20 years, with four of these nations reporting average life expectancies at 60 of just 16 years.\n\nAn aging global population creates new challenges — and opportunities — for policy makers. According to Bunting, \"We can start thinking about this as an opportunity for us to think globally about the kinds of policies we need in place in order for people … to age comfortably.\"\n\nWithin the specific context of the United States, which ranked as the eighth best country to grow old in, improving access to health care is an important challenge. Additionally, while the U.S. has a strong social protection system, in the form of Social Security, \"there are still challenges with that system,\" Bunting said. The poverty rate among the American elderly is also an issue of concern.\n\nTo identify the best and worst countries to grow old in, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed HelpAge International's 2014 Global AgeWatch Index of 96 countries. Each country was graded based on four measures: income security, health status, employment and education, and the overall environment for older residents. All data are for the most recent available period at the time the report was put together. We also reviewed figures from the IMF for population, inflation, debt, and other economic variables.\n\nThese are the worst countries to grow old in:\n\n10. Iraq\n\n> Total population: 35.9 million\n\n> Pct. population aged 60+: 5.1% (43rd lowest)\n\n> GDP per capita: $3,462 (57th lowest)\n\n> Life expectancy at 60: 18 (tied-63rd lowest)\n\nThis year, Iraq is the 10th worst country to grow old. Only a few countries were worse at enabling older Iraqis to live free, safe, and satisfying lives. For example, less than a third of country residents over 50 were satisfied with the freedom of choice in their lives, the worst rate among countries reviewed. And just half felt safe walking alone at night. Like many countries where growing old is relatively difficult, Iraq provides no social pension. In addition to relatively low life expectancies for older residents, decades of war have likely hindered both the government and communities from supporting older Iraqis. Between Iraq's war with Iran in the 1980s, two military campaigns conducted by the United States, and the recent rise of extremist groups, the nation's economy and infrastructure have struggled to stabilize.\n\n9. Zambia\n\n> Total population: 15.0 million\n\n> Pct. population aged 60+: 3.8% (9th lowest)\n\n> GDP per capita: $1,419 (25th lowest)\n\n> Life expectancy at 60: 17 (tied-36th lowest)\n\nAs might be expected in the worst countries to grow old, there are relatively few elderly residents in Zambia. Less than 4% of the country's population was over 60 years old as of 2014, among the lowest shares. Elderly Zambians struggled with high poverty rates, poor health, and lack of personal security. Nearly 23% of residents over 60 lived in poverty, one of the worst rates. Residents over 60 years old could expect only 12.2 years of relatively good health, among the lower healthy life expectancies worldwide. Just over a third of Zambian residents over 50 felt safe walking home at night, also among the lowest proportions.\n\n8. Uganda\n\n> Total population: 38.0 million\n\n> Pct. population aged 60+: 3.7% (4th lowest)\n\n> GDP per capita: $1,165 (19th lowest)\n\n> Life expectancy at 60: 16 (tied-11th lowest)\n\nLike several of the worst countries to grow old, Uganda had an exceptionally high employment rate among older Ugandans. Nearly 89% of Ugandans between 55 and 64 were employed, more than in all but a handful of other countries. While jobs seem to be readily available, many elderly Uganda residents were poorly educated and under considerable financial strain. Less than 7% of people over 60 had at least a secondary education, one of the lower rates. And nearly 21% of residents at least 60 years old lived in poverty, among the world's higher rates. Uganda's GDP per capita of less than $1,200 was one of the lowest among all countries reviewed.\n\n7. Jordan\n\n> Total population: 6.7 million\n\n> Pct. population aged 60+: 5.4% (51st lowest)\n\n> GDP per capita: $5,267 (75th lowest)\n\n> Life expectancy at 60: 19 (tied-82nd lowest)\n\nMost older Jordanians either have strong family ties or find financial help from the government. Seventy-two percent of people over 50 said they could rely on at least one person if they were in trouble. And more than 42% of 65 and older residents received a pension, one of the better rates compared to other countries on this list. Despite these strengths, the vast majority of Jordan's older population was financially dependent on others. Just 22.1% of 55-64 year-olds were employed, lower than in most countries. Also, just 21% of the population over 60 had at least a secondary education, far worse than in many nations. Overall, Jordan received one of the worst scores for enabling residents to live capably on their own.\n\n6. Pakistan\n\n> Total population: 186.3 million\n\n> Pct. population aged 60+: 6.5% (66th lowest)\n\n> GDP per capita: $2,348 (45th lowest)\n\n> Life expectancy at 60: 17 (tied-36th lowest)\n\nLike several of the worst countries to grow old, Pakistan is part of a politically unstable region. In addition, the capital has been the site of ongoing protests in recent years, and the country struggles to control regular flooding disasters. Despite the turmoil, older Pakistanis enjoy one of the lowest poverty rates in the world, with just 1.8% of residents over 60 living in poverty. Many older Pakistani residents do not feel socially connected, however, as just 60% of people over 50 said they someone they could count on when in trouble. And a minority of majority of older residents did not feel independent or satisfied with their freedom of choice.\n\n5. The United Republic of Tanzania\n\n> Total population: 47.7 million\n\n> Pct. population aged 60+: 4.9% (36th lowest)\n\n> GDP per capita: $1,331 (24th lowest)\n\n> Life expectancy at 60: 18 (tied-63th lowest)\n\nWhile nearly 93% of 55-64 year old Tanzanian residents were employed — the second highest rate worldwide– many of these jobs were likely low-skilled. Just 3.1% of country residents over 60 had completed at least a secondary education, one of the lowest attainment rates in the world. Further, less than 40% of residents over 50 were satisfied with the country's public transportation options, worse than in the vast majority of nations worldwides. Like many countries in the region, Tanzania is quite poor, with a GDP per capita of just $1,331, one of the lowest in the world. Despite poor economic output, Tanzania has managed to avoid violent internal turmoil that is often common in African and Middle-Eastern nations.\n\n4. Malawi\n\n> Total population: 17.6 million\n\n> Pct. population aged 60+: 4.9% (35th lowest)\n\n> GDP per capita: $667 (6th lowest)\n\n> Life expectancy at 60: 16 (tied-11th lowest)\n\nMalawi is exceptionally poor, with an economic output of just $667 per capita. The U.S., by contrast had a GDP of nearly $45,000 per capita. Nearly all of Malawi's 55-64 year old population worked, with an employment rate of 96.6%, by far the highest among countries reviewed. Yet, like in several other nations in the region, elderly residents are poorly educated. Just 4.5% of people over 60 had completed at least a secondary education, much less than in most countries. While the high employment rate may help some older residents feel independent, less than half of people over 50 said they had someone they could count on when in trouble, one of the worst measures of social connectivity. Nearly 18% of Malawi residents over 60 also lived in poverty, one of the higher rates worldwide.\n\n3. West Bank and Gaza\n\n> Total population: N/A\n\n> Pct. population aged 60+: 4.6% (28th lowest)\n\n> GDP per capita: $2,465 (48th lowest)\n\n> Life expectancy at 60: 18 (tied-63rd lowest)\n\nThe West Bank and Gaza, separated by miles of Israeli territory, are nearly the worst regions in which to grow old. Palestinians and Israelis have been in a nearly continuous conflict, and tensions may worsen as Hamas recently renewed its political presence in the West Bank. While nearly three-quarters of people over 50 felt safe walking home and approved of the public transport system — both among the higher rates reviewed — just 30% of residents aged 55 to 64 had a job, nearly the lowest rate. Poor employment and political turmoil may have also contributed to only 41% of Palestinians over 50 feeling freedom in their lives, one of the lower rates among countries reviewed.\n\n2. Mozambique\n\n> Total population: 26.5 million\n\n> Pct. population aged 60+: 5.1% (40th lowest)\n\n> GDP per capita: $842 (8th lowest)\n\n> Life expectancy at 60: 16 (tied-11th lowest)\n\nLocated on the Indian Ocean in southeastern Africa, Mozambique has struggled with a long history of colonialism and civil war. While the country has stabilized considerably since its independence in 1992, Mozambique is still quite poor. The nation's GDP per capita was just $842 last year, among the lowest economic outputs worldwide. The country's weak economy is likely having some effect on the well-being of elderly residents, as nearly 20% of people over 60 lived in poverty, considerably higher than in most other countries. Less than a third of Mozambique residents over 50-years old felt safe walking home at night, nearly the worst rate.\n\n1. Afghanistan\n\n> Total population: 31.3 million\n\n> Pct. population aged 60+: 3.9% (11th lowest)\n\n> GDP per capita: $1,225 (8th lowest)\n\n> Life expectancy at 60: 16 (tied-11th lowest)\n\nAfghanistan is the worst country for the elderly. At 60 years old, Afghan residents could expect only 9.2 years of good health — one of the only nations in the world where healthy life expectancy at 60 was less than a decade. While older Afghans were more likely to work than older residents in other countries, people over 60 were very poorly educated. Just 5.2% had completed at least a secondary education, among the lowest rates worldwide. While the U.S. and its allies have considerably reduced its military presence in the country, Afghanistan has been the site of conflict for decades. The withdrawal of the U.S. from the country could also further imperil the nation's political and economic stability.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Lieb\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nMOSBY, Mo. – The residents of this small riverside town have become accustomed to watching floods swamp their streets, transform their homes into islands and ruin their floors and furniture.\n\nElmer Sullivan has replaced his couch, bed and television. He’s torn up water-buckled floorboards.\n\n“I just don’t want to mess with it anymore. I’m 83 years old and I’m tired of it, and I just want to get out of it,” Sullivan said.\n\nIt’s a similiar story in Hamburg, Iowa, which was inundated in March by a breach of a Missouri River levee. Looking for a solution, many communities are turning to federally funded buyouts of properties vulnerable to floods.\n\nMore:Bipartisan disaster relief package held up by lone GOP House member over border security\n\nFormal discussions are likely a long way off for Hamburg, but local officials aren’t waiting around. Mayor Cathy Crain said they are looking into the potential for a private developer to relocate some houses and to acquire higher land where new homes and businesses could be built.\n\nRelocating to higher ground isn’t likely in Mosby, unless residents are willing to go elsewhere. The entire core of the town is in a floodway, which means that new development is limited.\n\nFinally fed up, Sullivan and nearly half of the homeowners in Mosby signed up in 2016 for a program in which the government would buy and then demolish their properties rather than paying to rebuild them over and over. They’re still waiting for offers, joining thousands of others across the country in a slow-moving line to escape from flood-prone homes.\n\nPatience is wearing thin, though. Mosby, a town of fewer than 200 people, has a core of lifelong residents and some younger newcomers drawn by the cheap prices of its modest wood-frame homes. Residents watched nervously this past week as high waters again threatened the town.\n\n“It really is frustrating, because here we are, we’re coming through a wet season. There’s a chance that we could possibly flood, and we’re still waiting,” said Jason Stooksbury, an alderman who oversees the town’s efforts to curb flooding. “It’s not a good situation, but what are you going to do — it’s the government process.”\n\nOver the past three decades, federal and local governments have poured more than $5 billion into buying tens of thousands of vulnerable properties across the country, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nThe AP analysis shows those buyouts have been getting more expensive, with many of the costliest coming in the last decade after strong storms pounded heavily populated coastal states such as Texas, New York and New Jersey. This year’s record flooding in the Midwest could add even more buyouts to the queue.\n\nThe purchases are happening as the climate changes. Along rivers and sea coasts, some homes that were once considered at little risk are now endangered due to water that is climbing higher and surging farther inland than historic patterns predicted.\n\nRegardless of the risks, the buyouts are voluntary. Homeowners can renew taxpayer-subsidized flood insurance policies indefinitely.\n\nWith more extreme weather events, flooding “is going to become more and more of an issue, and there will be more and more properties that are at risk of total loss or near total loss,” said Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has jurisdiction over FEMA. “Then the question is: Are we just going to keep selling them insurance and building in the same place?”\n\nDeFazio wants to expand and revamp a buyout process that he describes as inefficient and irrational. He’s backing a proposed pilot project that would give homeowners a break on their flood insurance premiums, as long as they agree in advance to a buyout that would turn their property into green space if their homes are substantially damaged by a flood.\n\nBuyout programs rely on federal money distributed through the states, but they generally are carried out by cities and counties that end up owning the properties.\n\nMost buyouts are initiated after disasters, but Congress has become more proactive. Appropriations for FEMA’s Pre-Disaster Mitigation Grant Program — which funds buyouts and other precautions, such as elevating homes before disasters strike — have risen from $25 million in 2015 to $250 million this year.\n\nA recent study for the National Institute of Building Sciences found that society as a whole saves $7 in avoided costs for every $1 spent through federally funded grants to acquire or demolish flood-prone buildings. Yet it’s harder to gauge the benefits for the individuals who move.\n\nAfter Superstorm Sandy pummeled New Jersey and New York in 2012, Duke University graduate school student Devon McGhee researched what happened to hundreds of Staten Island homeowners who took buyouts. She found that all but two of the 323 homeowners she tracked relocated to areas with higher poverty levels. Three-quarters remained on Staten Island, and about one-fifth moved to homes that still were exposed to coastal flooding hazards.\n\n“When people take the buyouts, sometimes the money they are given on their home is not enough to buy a comparable home in a lower-risk area,” said McGhee, who now works as a coastal management specialist for an engineering and consulting firm.\n\nThe prolonged buyout process also can take an emotional toll on people who are uprooted.\n\n“Maybe they find a home, and it’s a good home, but it’s not their home where their kids grew up and had birthday parties and that sort of thing. There are these losses that occur in that transition process that can have implications for years,” said Sherri Brokopp Binder, an Allentown, Pennsylvania-based consultant who researches disaster buyouts.\n\nMultiple layers of government bureaucracy can slow the buyout process. So can the typical hiccups that come with property sales.\n\nIn Kingfisher, Oklahoma, officials are still working to complete a buyout prompted by Tropical Storm Erin in 2007. The city initiated a buyout in 2010, then received additional money to buy more homes about five years later. It’s purchased more than 80 so far, with about 10 more to go, said Annie Vest, a former Oklahoma state hazard mitigation officer who now works for an engineering firm administering Kingfisher’s grant.\n\nThe process is just getting started in some Texas communities swamped by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Officials in Liberty County, northeast of Houston, held a meeting with residents last month to discuss a $6.7 million HUD grant to buy out homes near the Trinity River.\n\nThe county still must get appraisals of the homes, conduct asbestos inspections and take bids for a demolition contractor.\n\nLocal officials hope to start taking buyout applications by the end of the year, said David Douglas, the Liberty County engineering administrator and flood plain manager.\n\nLocated just northeast of Kansas City, Mosby began as a railroad town in 1887 and expanded with coal mines in the early 20th century.\n\nAt one time, it had a school, bank, grocery store and lumber yard.\n\nThose are gone now, and the trains merely pass by. In 2015, financial strains led the town to eliminate its small police force.\n\nMosby experienced some of its worst flooding that same year, with three floods in less than six weeks. The next year, city officials began pursuing the buyouts, and more than 40 homeowners signed up. They’ve been in limbo ever since. Local officials sought nearly $3 million in funding, submitted a revised application, obtained property appraisals and conducted environmental reviews.\n\nSome residents have been scouting for new housing. Others are waiting to see the bids, which are expected this summer.\n\nSullivan hopes to get $28,000 for his home. He would move near his sister in southeastern Missouri, but he’s getting impatient.\n\n“I’m just about ready to tell them, ‘Take it and shove it,’” he said.\n\nSitting on the concrete porch of the white wooden house where she’s lived for the past 36 years, Tammy Kilgore explains that “everybody’s just really on edge and ready to leave.”\n\n“The floods, I’m tired of dealing with them, I really am,” she said. “I think they should have bought out this town a long time ago.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/20/us-heat-wave-live-updates-temperature-forecast/74154164007/", "title": "Heat wave live updates: More than 100 million are sweltering", "text": "ARLINGTON, Va. − Excessive heat advisories, watches, and warnings blanketed the first day of summer Thursday for more than 100 million Americans from Chicago to Caribou, Maine, — with more blistering heat on the way.\n\nMeteorologists blame a heat dome, a powerful high-pressure system that traps hot air over a region and prevents cool air from getting in, causing ground temperatures to remain high.\n\nThe searing heat rolling across the northeastern tier will make its way to the mid-Atlantic in the coming days.

Monday's high set a record for the date, while Tuesday's and Wednesday's highs each fell one degree short of the record.\n\n\"People's bodies are just not prepared to deal with this kind of heat this early in the year,\" said Dr. Chris Cammarata, Hamot's director of emergency medicine. \"I worry about those who have to work outside for days in a row when the temperatures are this high.\"\n\nThomas Sherry, 64, was sweating profusely Thursday morning after he walked along Peach Street in Erie for nearly 20 blocks.\n\nSherry, who had spent the previous days of the heat wave cooling off at the Mental Health Association of Northwestern Pennsylvania, said he was not allowed to go inside Thursday due to a disagreement.\n\nDespite the hot weather, Sherry said things could be worse.\n\n\"It's much better than winter,\" Sherry said as he held a quart-size bottle of water.\n\n-David Bruce, the Erie Times-News; Samantha Hendrickson and Bailey Gallion, the Columbus Dispatch\n\n'Nothing that we can't handle': Hard-hit Maine residents enduring\n\nRebecca Matley has noticed difficulty breathing this week.\n\nThe worst she felt was on Wednesday, when the northern Maine city she lives in, Caribou, hit a record-breaking heat index of 103 degrees, making it hotter than Miami.\n\n“Just going from the car to the door you can feel it,” she said.\n\nThe 22-year-old works as a barista at The Maine Bean & Tea, where the heat has caused a surge in sales of the shop’s blue raspberry slushie.\n\n“We’re lucky we had a lot of it in stock before Wednesday,” she said.\n\nShelly Gagnon and her family sought relief at Cross Lake, where they spent their Wednesday evening in the cool water. The 46-year-old said the only routine the heat has interrupted is her morning and nightly walks with her two golden retrievers, Harper and Lucy.\n\nOther local waterways and public pools have been inundated with residents seeking a respite from the oppressive heat.\n\nFor the last two days, the splash pad at the Caribou recreation center has been “absolutely packed full,” said Gary Marquis, the superintendent of parks and recreation for the city.\n\nOn Thursday night, about 2,000 people will attend Caribou’s biweekly street fair, he said. Local government agencies will be providing water and firefighters in a ladder truck will be “spraying off the kids.”\n\n“It's amazing how people will still come out when it's this hot and enjoy good music and enjoy all the vendors,” he said. “This heat is an inconvenience for a couple days, but it's nothing that we can't handle.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nHere's where heat records were broken\n\nTemperatures broke records all across the region impacted by the heat wave, forecasters said. On Thursday, the National Weather Service office in Pittsburgh said several record daily lows were set across Pennsylvania.\n\nPhiladelphia reached a record warm low of 71 degrees while Wheeling's low was 73 degrees, according to the weather service. Meanwhile, Dubois hit both a record high at 89 degrees and a low of 71 degrees.\n\nHere were some records met or broken on Wednesday:\n\nClimate change linked to lengthy heat wave\n\nThe deadly heat wave that scorched much of North America in early May and early June – and is still baking the central and eastern U.S. – was made 35 times more likely because of human-caused climate change, a scientific study released Thursday says.\n\nThe heat wave has killed at least 125 people and led to thousands of heat stroke cases in Mexico, where the heat was particularly intense. Scientists say heat waves will continue to intensify if the world continues to unleash climate-warming emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\n“The results of our study should be taken as another warning that our climate is heating to dangerous levels,\" said study co-author Izidine Pinto, a researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.

But he said he expects no widespread problems.\n\n\"We ask people to generally be smart about their energy usage through a high-load period like this,\" he said. \"Defer energy intensive things like running the dishwasher or laundry until later in the evening when demand goes down. Otherwise the grid is pretty much ready.\"\n\nAcross New England, a region-wide abnormal conditions power alert was in effect. ISO New England, a non-profit regional power transmission agency, projects demand to peak Thursday evening at the highest level of the season so far. But the agency anticipates having the \"necessary resources\" to meet demand.\n\n\"System operators have tools at their disposal if unexpected conditions materialize,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nIn Virginia, Dominion Energy spokesperson Aaron Ruby said the power system is \"fully prepared\" for the heat and thus far is performing well.\n\n\"We’re coordinating closely ... to ensure the reliability of the grid throughout the heat wave, not only in Virginia but across the entire 13-state regional grid,\" Ruby said in a email to USA TODAY.\n\nWorld could again break record for heat this summer\n\nThe dangerous heat is not limited to the United States. Cities on four continents are scorching, an early sign that a season of record-breaking heat could surpass last summer as the warmest in 2,000 years. The World Meteorological Organization says there is an 86% chance that one of the next five years will eclipse 2023 to become the warmest on record.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, where nearly 2 million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the haj in Mecca this week, hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures 120 degrees. Egyptian medical and security sources said Thursday that at least 530 Egyptians alone had died.\n\nIn India, New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 95.4 degrees at 1 a.m.\n\nAlberto makes landfall in Mexico\n\nTropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of 2024, made landfall in Mexico and was downgraded to a tropical depression, moving to the west at 18 mph with sustained winds of 35 mph.\n\nThree deaths in Mexico were blamed on the storm. But officials there were also crediting Alberto which delivering much-needed rains to the drought strickent region.\n\nThe storm is forecast to dump up to 20 inches of rain across parts of northeast Mexico with nearly a foot of rain expected throughout southern Texas. Such high rainfall totals will likely produce \"considerable flash flooding and urban flooding\" as well as possible mudslides across northern Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAlberto makes landfall:Danger looms for Texas\n\nHow do you stay safe in the heat?\n\nThe weather service is urging people to avoid the outdoors in the heat of the day.

Read the first here.\n\nHAYNEVILLE — There are times where you walk outside Hayneville’s Family Dollar and smell it, the stench hanging thick in the Black Belt air.\n\nMary McDonald has seen schoolchildren steer their bikes through it, dark streams spider-webbing the cracked asphalt as rubber wheels splash through.\n\nCharlie Mae Holcombe has heard it, an ominous gurgle from her toilets and sinks after heavy spring rains.\n\n“It’s been so bad, it’s come up through my bathtub,” Holcombe said. “When it really storms, my yard is like a river. It’s terrible. You can smell it through the walls. It purely stinks.\"\n\nIn the best-case scenarios, Holcombe’s grandchildren play inside for a spell, avoiding a front lawn-turned-swamp pooling with sewage from a clogged septic system. In the worst case, the raw waste creeps through pipes inside the Holcombe home, ruining yet another carpet and forcing the family to stay in Montgomery while everything dries out.\n\nHolcombe and McDonald are just two of thousands of Alabamians living with inefficient or failing wastewater treatment systems — a problem that has persisted for decades in both rural and urban areas. Holcombe has been dealing with waste flooding her front yard since the late 1980s when it was built.\n\nFor a time, Catherine Flowers, a Lowndes County native and rural development manager for the Equal Justice Initiative, said she felt as if she and a handful of other activists were shouldering this heavy burden alone. But their steady and consistent work in recent years has pushed Alabama to the forefront of American poverty and wastewater infrastructure discussions, marking Lowndes County as a canary in the coal mine for a public health crisis. Their work to shed light on the issue has pushed public officials to lobby for increased infrastructure funding and incentivized academic experts to rethink conventional engineering methods.\n\n“I think we’re going in the right direction,” Flowers said. “This isn’t a partisan problem. The land is bipartisan.”\n\nThe swath of Alabama counties that make up the Black Belt are largely rural. Their wastewater infrastructure is cobbled together or nonexistent, with some small community municipal systems, many households relying individual septic tanks, and mobile homes straight-piping sewage into yards.\n\nThe rich topsoil that gave the area its name and led to the forced slavery for the cotton economy in the 19th century is made of layers of clay and chalk — productive for crops and bad for water absorption because of its poor percolation, making mainstream septic systems inefficient at best.\n\nBut special septic systems for this soil are out of the question for the poorest communities in the state; the median household income falls under $28,000 in Lowndes County, according to 2016 U.S. Census Data.\n\n“Normally, it might cost $2,000 to put in a septic tank and a drain field in Mobile or Tuscaloosa,” said civil engineer Kevin White. “But in the Black Belt, with the poor soils, the system has to be so large or so complicated that we’re talking $8,000 to $10,000 or even more.”\n\nFor decades, White has been working toward more innovative and affordable Black Belt wastewater solutions. He led a study for the University of South Alabama more than 10 years ago in Bibb County, which found that half of rural households had raw sewage pooling on the ground. He and other researchers are now studying Wilcox and Hale counties, where similar onsite wastewater systems fail at a rate of roughly 50 percent.\n\n“We have decided, as a society and an engineering profession, that the best way to transport human waste is via water,” White said. “We build toilets that flush using water. But when we’re in a situation like the Black Belt, where we have to soak water into soil that won’t percolate — maybe this is the wrong way of doing things.”\n\nWhite said that fundamentally changing how we think of wastewater — any used water in a home — could be part of the solution to this crisis. Waste from toilets, or black water, is the most likely to cause environmental and health issues. Gray water, or waste from kitchen sinks and showers, isn’t clean but also doesn’t pose the same dangers. Treating gray and black water differently could significantly reduce the sizes of septic disposal systems, he said.\n\nOther options are outhouses — an ideal engineering solution, but not as socially acceptable in modern-day America — compost toilets, and more expensive and efficient toilet systems that use air and small amounts of liquid to flush. Plumbing manufacturer American Standard sent a team of engineers to Lowndes County last year and is in the initial stages of developing potential product solutions for rural septic issues.\n\nAt Duke University, Flowers has established a collaborative research partnership with environmental policy and management professors and students. The team is looking at policy challenges, funding mechanisms and septic system engineering design from a multidisciplinary approach, looping in humanities-based academics and on-the-ground activists to ensure Lowndes County residents have a voice in possible solutions.\n\nFlowers said she hopes to put faces to the problem by convening academics and policymakers on Lowndes County front porches.\n\n“A lot of people think that solutions made to fit urban areas should fit rural communities,” Flowers said. “That’s not the case. Rural communities should be recognized and acknowledged.”\n\nLowndes County is not the only rural place in the U.S. dealing with these problems — Flowers said she’s spoken with communities from Alaska to New Jersey grappling with similar issues — but it’s serving as an example for other communities.\n\n“The civil rights marchers from Selma to Montgomery slept on the property of some of the families we visited (in Lowndes),” said Ryan Juskus, a doctoral candidate at Duke University who is working with Flowers on the partnership. “This land isn’t just any old piece of land with a wastewater issue. There’s something particular about this place that’s important for us to tend to. And we hope talking about our solutions in a larger frame can ultimately have a greater impact and a wider resonance with other places across the country that struggle with wastewater issues.”\n\nBecause of its violent racial history from slavery to the Civil Rights era and years of exploitation and pollution from industry, Black Belt residents are often mistrustful of government intervention and fearful of rumored consequences, like being arrested if they come forward with mismanaged home waste systems.\n\nMore:An era of terror: Montgomery family remembers father's lynching, legacy\n\nBut improving conditions will require collaboration with local health departments and municipalities. State officials say funds have been appropriated to small towns in the past, but White said part-time city government leaders have lacked the know-how of creating comprehensive action plans.\n\n“There could be some decentralized type sewer and treatment systems that could be implemented,” White said. “Somebody would have to manage and operate those systems. That’s one reason we’re trying to ... put together some steps to help counties establish a utility.”\n\nHe added that the county governments should initiate some of these efforts to provide managed sewers through grant funding.\n\nLocal health departments are shifting their focus to these types of initiatives, starting with building new relationships in the region.\n\n“We’re involved because it’s important to us that people have adequate sewage,” said Dr. Scott Harris, the Alabama Department of Public Health’s state health officer. “At the same time, we’re not the Alabama agency that builds sewer systems. We’re not funded for that. But we’re invested in seeing that happen for people, and we’re trying to facilitate it the best we can.”\n\nEarlier this year, ADPH, with the help of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, surveyed 192 households. They found a majority of households indicated sewage and sanitation were problems in Lowndes County, with 31 percent reporting “sewage backing up into the home, off-color or foul-smelling water from faucet, and standing sewage or run-off near the home” occurring in the past year.\n\nSherry Bradley, a longtime ADPH employee and Black Belt native, is developing public information campaigns to educate residents on proper septic maintenance as well as encourage individual reporting of onsite sewage failure. Tasked with regulating everything from restaurants to tattoo parlors to septic tanks, the department says its budget limits how proactive it can be without citizens alerting them to ongoing problems.\n\nThe agency is buying billboard space, attending church functions, and organizing town halls like one held in late May with U.S. Rep. Terri A. Sewell (D-Selma) and U.S. Sen. Doug Jones (D-Birmingham), where Jones apologized for the neglect Lowndes County has experienced.\n\nHealth officials are also working to counteract rampant rumors that the department locks up residents who resort to straight piping. Though residents can be cited and fined, Harris said it’s a last resort that usually happens a year or more after ADPH tries to work with the resident. According to Lowndes County Circuit Clerk records, seven people have pleaded guilty to similar citations since 1996.\n\n“There’s a narrative that we’re looking to lock people up. We’re not. We don’t want to do that. We just want to protect public health with adequate sewage,” Harris said. “You have to get people to trust you, and that doesn’t happen if they don’t know you. We’re trying to have a presence.”\n\nState lawmakers have vowed to address the issue. Jones cosponsored legislation in the Farm Bill that would expand a U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program for rural households installing or maintaining decentralized wastewater systems.\n\nThis kind of partnership is key, said White. The engineering solutions his team is working on at South Alabama — low water waste transfer, different treatment of shower versus toilet waste — are promising, but they’re also outside the bounds of current standards in the U.S. He is working with ADPH on regulatory flexibility options, like relaxing certain septic system standards to test these options.\n\n“We’re going to work closely with the health department so they know what we’re doing and how effective it is,” White said\n\nAfter a lifetime in rural communities where they have witnessed poor sanitation and other impoverished conditions, Flowers and McDonald say they understand Alabamians who feel ashamed to call attention to the problem. But they’re not afraid to speak out to help those living in their home soils and beyond.\n\n“I just thought it was something we did wrong. But it’s not just a Black Belt problem. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution to this,” Flowers said. “I think what we’re putting together is a template for how these different entities can and should work together to find solutions. We’re working on a life-giving and life-sustaining solution.”\n\nThis series is supported by the Solutions Journalism Network, a nonprofit focused on reporting about responses to social problems.\n\nPart One:\n\nThe rural South’s invisible public health crisis", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/06/farmers-struggle-trade-wars-floods-and-low-prices/1346442001/", "title": "Farmers struggle with trade wars, floods and low prices", "text": "And then came the rain.\n\nAmerican farmers already plagued by a near biblical parade of misfortune that includes years of low prices and a trade war with China are now grappling with record Midwest rain that will likely prevent a large portion of this year’s crop from even getting planted.\n\nThe troubles have created the worst farm crisis since the 1980s, when oversupplies and a U.S. grain embargo against the Soviet Union forced thousands of farmers into bankruptcy, experts say.\n\n“It’s not the 1980s, but it’s as close as we’ve been,” says John Newton, chief economist of the American Farm Bureau.\n\nWhile some farmers have been shutting down or selling to larger competitors for years amid thinner profits, analysts say 2019 will bring a more dramatic shakeout.\n\nMaximize your savings: Best high-yield savings accounts\n\n“This is more than a cyclical thing,” says Gary Schnitkey, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois. “It’s a series of events that we’ve never seen come together. … It’s going to be a blow to everyone’s financial position.”\n\nMoving up?How to take the stress out of selling your house and buying another home\n\nTips to dodge robocallers:How do they have my number? 5 ways to avoid being put on robocall lists\n\nAgriculture makes up less than 1% of U.S. gross domestic product, down from about 8% in the late 1940s, according to JPMorgan Chase. Still, a downturn in the sector could trim economic growth – projected at about 2.2% this year – by up to two-tenths of a percentage point, says Nathan Kauffman, lead economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.\n\nPlanting delays\n\nRain and flooding that began in March have kept farmers from planting a major portion of their crops during the normal mid-April to mid-May season in states like Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and Michigan. As of Sunday, 39% of soybean acres have been planted in the 18 largest producing states, compared with an average 79% over the past five years, Agriculture Department figures show. Sixty-seven percent of corn acres are in the ground, vs. an average 96%. Such delays are unprecedented, Newton says.\n\nProjected yield shortages have provided at least some boost to long-depressed prices. Contract corn prices for July delivery have risen from $3.57 a bushel in late April to about $4.15. Soybean futures have edged up from $8.41 to about $8.70. Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department has announced it will provide $16 billion in aid to farmers this year to partly offset the price shortfall resulting from the China trade fight.\n\nThe developments have presented farmers with wrenching dilemmas that are coming to a head this week, the last viable period to plant corn: Forgo planting on certain fields and file an insurance claim for “prevented planting” that would net slightly less than half their normal proceeds. Or go ahead and plant as much as possible, relying on the government payouts and perhaps some crop insurance to cushion the blow. But the late plantings could spell poor yields that curtail revenue and limit future insurance payments.\n\nMegan Dwyer, 30, who co-owns a 700-acre farm with her father in Coal Valley, Illinois, got a few days of dry weather this week and decided to roll the dice and scramble to plant most of her corn in just a few days.\n\n“You always want to produce,” says Dwyer, a fourth-generation farmer. “If you produce less, then you’re failing. … It’s hard to change that mindset.”\n\nShe says she may still file some prevented planting claims, depending on the weather in coming days and weeks.\n\nOne of Dwyer’s fields near a river is still under water. Other parcels couldn’t be tilled for weeks because tractors couldn’t grind through the mud.\n\nA litany of troubles\n\nThe wet weather is just the latest calamity to buffet America’s farmers.\n\nMayo curse:Holy mayo! Heinz's new condiment Mayochup includes a bad word\n\nThe industry reaped healthy profits after renewable fuel standards in the mid-2000s opened vast markets for corn, which is used to produce ethanol. A 2012 drought hammered output, driving up grain prices even while insurance covered lost output. Higher prices for corn and wheat – feedstock for cattle, hogs and chickens – forced farmers to thin their herds, driving meat prices up as well. The higher crop and livestock prices meant even fatter profits.\n\nBut they spurred record production in the U.S. and globally, halving commodity prices. Prices have remained low the past five years as net farm income fell from $123.8 billion in 2013 to $69 billion last year, according to the Farm Bureau. Meanwhile, costs for fertilizer, seeds and other materials have risen.\n\nMore:It's great that you got a raise, but it just might hurt the stock market and the economy\n\nThen, last summer, China, which buys nearly a third of U.S. soybeans, slapped a 25% tariff on the crop in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. That dampened demand and pushed prices below the break-even level of just under $10 a bushel. Some soybean farmers went bankrupt.\n\nChapter 12 farm bankruptcies have increased from 360 in 2014 to 498 last year, according to the Kansas City Fed. Although they’re still well below record levels, the filings totaled 130 the first three months of 2019, the highest first-quarter total in nearly seven years. Farms on average have been marginally profitable the past few years, but they’ll likely be in the red in 2019, Schnitkey says.\n\nChina began buying some American soybeans again early this year as talks between the two countries resumed. But Chinese officials recently announced they would halt all purchases after President Donald Trump stepped up tariffs against the country last month.\n\nThere's more. An African swine fever virus could suppress the production of Chinese pigs – which feed on soybeans – for years. And Trump last week threatened tariffs on all Mexican imports to prod the country into curtailing illegal immigration from Central America. Mexico vowed retaliation that could mean duties on U.S. exports such as corn, dairy and beef.\n\nThat would further batter the profits of Dwyer and her husband, Todd, who also have a herd of 60 cows.\n\n“It’s constantly one thing after another,” she says. “We can’t seem to catch a break.”\n\nWhile most economists believe the United States and China will likely resolve their dispute later this year, Dwyer worries the standoff will prompt Chinese customers to permanently switch to other soybean-producing countries.\n\nThat’s what happened in the early 1970s when President Richard Nixon ceased soybean exports to Japan to temper inflation, leading Japan to invest heavily in soybean production in Brazil and reduce U.S. imports, says Jonathan Coppess, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois. Brazil now rivals the U.S. as a soybean producer.\n\n“We have no idea how these decisions will impact China long-term,” Coppess says.\n\nFarm income, meanwhile, is expected to remain pressured by low prices the next few years amid abundant supplies and slowing global demand, says Kauffman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.\n\nThe Dwyers have scuttled plans to buy ­­a $20,000 trailer to transport goods. They’re pinching pennies at the grocery store and thinking of forgoing swimming lessons for their three kids this summer.\n\nLike many millennial farmers, Dwyer holds several part-time jobs to supplement her income – selling seed, advising farmers and technical writing. Her husband, Todd, works in product development for farm equipment maker John Deere.\n\nNow, Dwyer is considering getting a full-time job. But she can't imagine giving up farming.\n\n\"It's never the same every day,\" she says. \"Planting a seed and waiting for it to grow, seeing a newborn calf. That's something you're never going to see sitting in a cubicle.\"\n\nWisconsin farmers hit especially hard\n\nIn Wisconsin, the planting delays are compounding a dairy crisis fueled by global overproduction of milk and prices that have dropped 40% since late 2014. Wisconsin lost almost 700 dairy farms in 2018.\n\nAs of Feb. 1, Wisconsin had 8,046 dairy herds, down 40% from 10 years earlier, according to state data.\n\nAt the same time, foreign markets for American dairy products have dwindled in response to tariffs that Trump slapped on foreign steel and aluminum. Cheese shipments to China have fallen almost 65%, and exports to Mexico are down more than 10%.\n\nMexico and Canada have targeted rural America as a way to punish Trump, and the economic harm could be felt for years, said Laurie Fischer, CEO of the American Dairy Coalition.\n\nThis spring, farmers face crucial decisions. Some are running out of feed for their cattle. Do they seek operating loans to plant crops for livestock rations? Or do they quit and cut their losses that can add up to thousands of dollars a month?\n\nWalmart and college:Walmart's expanding the chance to go to college for a dollar a day to more of its workers\n\nIn Shell Lake, dairy farmers Sue and Chuck Spaulding are hanging on, milking about 60 cows on their 300-acre farm that Chuck bought when he was only 17.\n\nSeven years ago, they borrowed heavily to modernize it. Nearly every dollar the Spauldings have earned from their milk the last few years has gone toward their debts and farm insurance, leaving them with little income except for Chuck's Social Security check and selling some livestock and hay.\n\nThe Spauldings' youngest daughter and son-in-law, Christy and Jeremy Spexet, also rely on the farm for their livelihood. They live in a mobile home nearby and put in long hours to keep the milking operation going.\n\nBut Chuck and Sue can't afford to pay them much. Like other farmers, Sue has started a GoFundMe campaign to get some help from the public.\n\n\"We set a $30,000 goal for our campaign because we didn't want to scare people away,” Sue said. “But we probably owe about a quarter of a million dollars.\"\n\nContributing: Rick Barrett, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2023/01/30/michigan-weather-climate-worst-disasters/69848998007/", "title": "Michigan's worst weather, climate disasters since 1980", "text": "As human fossil-fuel burning warms the global climate, severe storms have increased in frequency and intensity.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn a world that at times seems obsessed with the Windsor dynasty that occupies the British throne, a political dynasty with a history deeply entwined with one of the world’s most politically sensitive countries gets far less attention.\n\nPeter Bergen CNN\n\nPakistan, a country with nuclear weapons that neighbors Afghanistan, China, Iran and India, has been long dominated by its powerful military, which in recent years has put increasing pressure on independent media and dissenting voices.\n\nPakistan’s Bhutto family dynasty, in recent decades, championed a more liberal democratic approach to politics and has provided two of the country’s most important leaders – and today, its youngest foreign minister ever.\n\nI met last week with Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who was visiting Washington. He told me that the assassination of his mother, two-time Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was a turning point for him at 19 that pushed him into public service: “I didn’t choose this life. It chose me. The circumstances of her assassination and the events that followed led me down this path where I am today.”\n\nBhutto Zardari is also the chairman of the left-of-center Pakistan People’s Party, which was founded by his grandfather and is one of the largest political parties in the country.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Pakistan became a key American ally after the Soviet Union invaded Pakistan’s neighbor Afghanistan in 1979. That invasion precipitated a tight alliance between the United States and the military regime of Pakistan’s President, Gen. Zia-ul-Haq. The CIA acted as the quartermaster to the Afghan rebels, funneling billions of dollars of weapons to the Pakistani military intelligence service, which in turn supported several of the Afghan groups fighting the Soviets.\n\nIn 1989, after being defeated in Afghanistan, the Soviets pulled out – a move that hastened the collapse of the Soviet regime. When the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan, the United States closed its embassy in Kabul and washed its hands of the country.\n\nThat move would turn out to be a large blunder because Afghanistan then descended into a civil war, out of which emerged a shadowy group, the Taliban, which by 1996 had taken over almost the entire country. The Taliban also gave refuge to Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda group, which planned the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn the years before 9/11, Pakistan was one of only three countries that recognized the Taliban government in Afghanistan, seeing in them a force on its western border that would not ally with its main enemy, India.\n\nAfter September 11, under intense US pressure, the Pakistanis switched allegiance and, at least initially, supported the US-led war against the Taliban and al Qaeda.\n\nDeeply enmeshed in all this complex history is the Bhutto family, which, even more than the Kennedys in the United States, is a political dynasty that has shaped the history of their country while also enduring considerable personal tragedy.\n\nZulfikar Ali Bhutto, Bhutto Zardari’s grandfather, was the first democratically elected Prime Minister in Pakistan, but he was later deposed and then hanged by the regime of the Pakistani military dictator Zia in 1979.\n\nA little under a decade later, Bhutto’s daughter Benazir Bhutto, then only 35, became the first female Prime Minister in Pakistan’s history and, indeed, the first female Prime Minister of any Muslim-majority country.\n\nShe was a graduate of Harvard and Oxford and orientated to the West, but nonetheless, during her prime ministership, Pakistan’s powerful military began supporting the Taliban as they rose to power in Afghanistan.\n\nIn February 1993, a militant from Pakistan, Ramzi Yousef, masterminded the bombing of the World Trade Center, killing six people. Yousef then went back to Pakistan and began plotting to kill Benazir Bhutto, who was then serving as Prime Minister for the second time. The plan failed when the bomb Yousef was building malfunctioned.\n\nIn 2000, I met with Benazir Bhutto, who explained to me that “the international Islamist movement saw Pakistan as its base. They saw my party as a liberal threat.” She became a fervent public critic of the Taliban and al Qaeda, and the fact that she was the first woman to lead Pakistan made her an even bigger target for Islamist militants.\n\nBenazir Bhutto was assassinated in Pakistan in 2007 when she was campaigning to become Prime Minister for the third time. The Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for her murder.\n\nAll this tangled history was going through my mind when I met with her son at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington. Bhutto Zardari was visiting the US capital as his country faces what is arguably the worst crisis since its founding in 1947; by late August, floods of biblical proportions had submerged a third of the country.\n\nBhutto Zardari told me, “One in seven people, 33 million, are affected. The World Health Organization has warned of a second catastrophe in the form of a health crisis with waterborne diseases. There will also be food insecurity because of the millions of acres of crops destroyed.”\n\nThe flooding over the summer has caused an estimated $30 billion in damage.\n\nIn addition to the immediate crisis, Bhutto Zardari said now was the time to implement a longer-term solution – “a Green Marshall Plan” for climate-stressed developing countries such as Pakistan that have only a small impact on global warming but are disproportionately suffering its costs.\n\nBhutto Zardari pointed out that while Pakistan contributes less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming gases, it is one of the countries most affected by climate change. A “Green Marshall Plan” would allow countries such as Pakistan to build infrastructure more resilient to its effects.\n\nAsked about the Taliban, which now control Afghanistan, Bhutto Zardari surprised me when he advocated for greater engagement with them, even though the Afghan Taliban shelters elements of the Pakistani Taliban, the terrorist group that claimed responsibility for his mother’s murder. “They are our neighbors,” he said. “Our neighbors aren’t going away, and we need a peaceful, stable Afghanistan, so we don’t see an exodus of Afghan refugees into Pakistan, and we don’t see an exponential increase in terrorism.”\n\nBhutto Zardari explained that the dire economic situation in Afghanistan made dealing with the Taliban more important since predictions indicate that more than 90% of the Afghan population may soon fall below the poverty line. “History has shown us that theocratic, autocratic regimes, when faced with tough economic times, tend to contract rights rather than expand rights,” said Bhutto Zardari, who studied history at Oxford.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAt the end of our interview, we returned to the subject of his mother, Benazir, whom I had met many times over the years, including the first time that she was Prime Minister during the late 1980s and had only recently given birth to him.\n\nBenazir Bhutto was assassinated almost two decades later at age 54 when she was a politician at the height of her powers. She was very much an ally of the United States, an enemy of Islamist terrorists such as al Qaeda and the Taliban, and also an advocate for liberal democracy in Pakistan.\n\nI asked her son, “Would Pakistan have had a very different trajectory if she had become Prime Minister for the third time”? The foreign minister replied, “Yes. I think that’s pretty safe to say.”", "authors": ["Peter Bergen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/02"}]}

He said the store's loyal following included customers from upstate, who regularly asked when Hobby Lobby would be expanding.\n\n\"It's really about serving the community,\" Trotta said.\n\nHobby Lobby ended up taking a portion of the former Burlington store in University Plaza, which is also home to an Acme and Harbor Freight Tools. Burlington moved down a spot last year, taking about half its former space and clearing room for Hobby Lobby.\n\nThe Hobby Lobby layout\n\nTo the right of the entrance is the store's seasonal section, which featured Easter decorations and spring toys Friday. Further right along the side wall were housewares, outdoor gear and furniture and baskets and pillows.\n\nCraft supplies make up the bulk of the back wall starting from the back right corner and terminating at a custom framing station in the back left corner (when considered from the entrance). The section had a deep well of items to decorate (wood shapes, tree houses, T-shirts and glass jars to name a few) and things to decorate with (stickers, stamps and paints).\n\nFrom the framing station in the back left corner working back toward the entrance along the side wall are collections of rugs and door mats and yarn, fabrics and prints. Flowers, garland and wreaths fill the front left area of the store near the checkout lines.\n\nThe middle of the store is a maze of wall decor.

Ralph Woodrow, who was at Summit North Marina on Friday morning in hopes of catching a glimpse of the Florida manatee. \"Have you seen one? Do you know anything about them?\n\n\"They're like the size of a hippopotamus.\"\n\nOn Thursday, a woman contacted Division of Fish & Wildlife Enforcement Natural Resources police after spotting the manatee in the marina, Cpl. John McDerby said. An officer responded and found the 7-foot-long manatee swimming around the marina.\n\nThough McDerby said there have been manatee spottings in Indian River Inlet between Dewey and Bethany beaches as recently as last year, he could not remember a time where a manatee made it this far back in the canal.\n\nMcDerby said the interest in the manatee is widespread.\n\n\"It is definitely not just media interest,\" he said. \"Our Facebook pages are still getting comments, likes, shares, etc.\n\n\"Even now as I type, my phone has been giving me notification alerts since yesterday afternoon.\"\n\nMarina workers said people have been calling to see if the creature was still there so they could come down and see it.\n\n\"The phone has been ringing off the hook,\" said Tim Deane, a marina worker, who watched the manatee swim near the docks for about an hour Thursday.\n\n\"It was pretty cool just seeing him cruising along and hang out,\" Deane said. \"Nobody was messing with him. He was just doing what he does: eating and swim.\"\n\nDeane was interviewed Friday by Judy Dierkes, a member of Lewes-based Marine Education Research & Rehabilitation Institute who is trying to track the animal.\n\n\"If you see it, there's a hotline (302) 228-5029. Contact them, and we will collect the data,\" Dierkes said. \"We'll try to make sure that we have somebody that gets to the scene just to make sure that it's taken care of.\"\n\nManatees are large herbivorous marine mammals, sometimes known as sea cows. Florida manatees, best known for their homes in warm southern waters and gentle nature, have been known to swim as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts, but typically don't go much farther north than the Carolinas.\n\nIf a manatee is up north and the water temperature drops below 65 degrees, it would be dangerous to the animal's tissue causing something similar to frostbite to occur.\n\n\"Water temperature is very critical to their well-being,\" said Suzanne Thurman, MERR's executive director.\n\nIdeally the manatees should be well on their way back home to Florida by September, Thurman said.\n\n\"They still have time for their summer vacation up here in the north,\" she added.\n\nWhile there may seem to be more manatee sightings recently, it might not be a pattern, Thurman said, simply a matter of how often they were reported before. Things such as social media are a factor in sharing the news about a sighting.\n\nThere have been other manatee visits to the Delmarva Peninsula area.\n\nIn 1994, a male manatee was sighted in the northern Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. That male manatee, nicknamed \"Chessie,\" had to be rescued in October of that year as temperatures dropped to unsafe levels. Chessie was sighted again in the Chesapeake Bay in July 2011, leading it to also being known as \"the traveling manatee,\" according to Save the Manatee Club based in Maitland, Florida.\n\nAnother manatee made famous for his rescue from cold New Jersey waters in 2009 is Ilya the wayward manatee, said Janice Nearing, a spokeswoman for Save the Manatee Club, which was founded by musician Jimmy Buffett to protect endangered manatees and their aquatic habitat.\n\nIt was not known Friday afternoon if the manatee spotted in Summit North Marina was Chessie or Ilya.\n\n\"We do not know the identity of that manatee at the moment,\" Nearing said.

No one returned to retrieve it, he said.\n\nIn the subsequent year and a half, Mac Isaac said, a “whole lot of” players were involved in the story that ended with President Donald Trump circle’s taking possession of a copy of the laptop hard drive, less than two months before the presidential election.\n\nMac Isaac declined to name most of them.\n\nThe hard drive reportedly contained emails from 2015 that were the basis for a New York Post story published Wednesday morning claiming then-Vice President Joe Biden held a meeting with a high-ranking official at Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company that had employed his son Hunter Biden.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the veracity of the claim was being challenged by Biden’s campaign, which said in a statement that no such meeting existed in the then-vice president’s official calendar.\n\n“No meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place,” the campaign said.\n\nLater in the day, Facebook and Twitter, in an unprecedented decision, both implemented policies limiting the sharing of the story.\n\nFacebook spokesman Andy Stone described the move as “part of our standard process to reduce the spread of misinformation,” pending a “fact-checker review.”\n\nMac Isaac repeatedly claimed he had shared the device with Costello because he was fearful for his safety. He did not explain how a move that would result in publicity would improve his security.\n\nMac Isaac also declined to state whether he approached Costello first with the hard drive or whether Giuliani’s team came to him.\n\nWhen pressed on the question, he answered in vague near-soliloquy, stating, “When you’re afraid that you don’t know anything about the depth of the waters that you’re in, you kind of, you want to find a lifeguard.”\n\nHISTORY:As Biden-Trump, Ukraine debate rages, related court cases land in Delaware\n\nLast Sunday, Giuliani gave the New York Post reporters a copy of the hard drive that had been provided by Mac Isaac, the publication said.\n\nFor nearly two years, Giuliani had been working on behalf of Trump to dig up information that could be damaging to Biden’s presidential campaign. Much of the effort has focused on finding a link between the former vice president's work in Ukraine and Hunter Biden's dealings with Burisma.\n\nGiuliani has asserted repeatedly without evidence that Joe Biden had sought to protect Burisma when he pressured the Ukrainian president in 2015 into firing the country's prosecutor general.\n\nLast year, Trump himself sought out such information from Ukraine’s new president – an act that led to his impeachment.\n\nU.S. Senate Republicans last month published a report based on an investigation that looked into the claims. While they found Hunter Biden's business made State Department official's work awkward, they found no evidence that Joe Biden acted inappropriately.\n\nIn his comments Wednesday, Mac Isaac called the impeachment a sham.\n\nHe said he began hearing about Burisma and Ukraine shortly after Hunter Biden had left his laptop at the Trolley Square repair shop. When a customer doesn't return after 90 days, Mac Isaac says he typically will reach out to them by phone.\n\nAsked if he called Hunter Biden, Mac Isaac said, \"No comment.\"\n\n“We have customers who abandon products all of the time,\" he said.\n\nDuring the subsequent summer and fall, Mac Isaac said he became alarmed after browsing through the computer's files. He claims he then spoke with an associate more versed than him in the law and in current events.\n\nThat unnamed person then contacted the FBI, Mac Isaac said.\n\nFederal investigators from Wilmington and Baltimore then subpoenaed the laptop in December, Mac Isaac said.\n\nShortly after, they called Mac Isaac asking him to assist them, technically, in viewing the files on the damaged hard drive, he said.\n\nMac Isaac admitted that the request raised his own suspicion, given that the FBI has its own technical staff.\n\nMore:A look at Joe Biden's family tree\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Delaware’s federal prosecutors declined to confirm or deny the existence of any investigation into Hunter Biden's laptop.\n\nIn the months after the alleged December subpoena, the FBI made no public statements about the contents of the hard drive. That discouraged Mac Isaac, who had hoped such information could vindicate Trump and prevent his impeachment.\n\nAt various points in his interview Wednesday, Mac Isaac insinuated the FBI had covered up the information, though he provided no evidence to verify such a suspicion.\n\nHe also stated repeatedly that he had believed that giving investigators the hard drive would amount to “following the chain of command,\" an idea that he failed to describe beyond the vague pronouncement.\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

Board", "text": "Most people understand the Brown v. Board of Education decision as one of the most definitive cases in education and American history. On Tuesday, though, a special panel looked to remind listeners of not only how closely Delaware is tied to that story — but how that relevance still echoes.\n\nThe decision, eventually stripping the country of its \"separate but equal\" doctrine across schools, just marked a 70th anniversary this month. Two cases from Delaware joined that landmark case at the Supreme Court, Bulah v. Gebhart and Gebhart v. Belton, led by Wilmington powerhouse attorney and civil rights advocate Louis L. Redding.\n\nDelaware Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion invited several speakers to dive into this intersection. State officials were joined by the Rev. JB Redding, daughter of Louis L. Redding; René Ricks-Stamps, daughter of plaintiff Shirley Bulah; Justice C.J. Seitz Jr., of the Delaware Supreme Court and son of late judge Collins J. Seitz; and James “Sonny” Knott, a 94-year-old former student of the very school they sat in. More names lined the list.\n\nSpeakers and a small audience packed Hockessin Colored School #107C for two hours of discussion, and the public livestream can still be watched. Here are just some key takeaways.\n\n\"We're standing on hallowed ground today,\" said Ricard Potter Jr., chief diversity officer within Delaware's Department of Human Resources. \"And hopefully this conversation will be one that enriches individuals who are in attendance, as well as an opportunity for us to have a call for action.\"\n\n'Trail to Desegregation':How one Wilmington bus tour honors 70th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education\n\nThe work is not over\n\nThis was never an instant solution.\n\nThough the 1954 decision called for an \"immediate\" stop to segregated schools, the reality would play out much more slowly. And in the very state with two cases fueling arguments, school segregation persisted in some areas until the late '60s. Impact was clear, but progress painfully lagged for many.\n\nAnd, Tuesday's speakers would argue, it has yet to be entirely achieved.\n\n\"Even today, Black students in our state and across the nation continue to face challenges that impact their academic success,\" said guest Rep. Kendra Johnson, speaking in opening comments. \"Issues such as unequal funding, resource gaps and racial discrimination are reminders that the promise of Brown v. Board of Education is yet to be fully realized.\"\n\nRedding echoed her thoughts as the panel heated up.\n\n\"I think the first thing to say is where we are not,\" said the daughter of Delaware's first Black attorney. \"That whatever brown the board did, it did not desegregate America. That right now, straight across the nation, north and south, any of our big cities but also rural areas, are as segregated as they were at the time required.\"\n\nThe state's own Redding Consortium has rooted its recent work in this reality, having been created in 2019 to recommend policies aimed at educational equity in Wilmington and the northern county. Legal and political decisions over decades, members write, have left the city with several racially identifiable, high-poverty schools — plagued with higher rates of crime, housing instability and poverty, alongside educator turnover and persistent underachievement.\n\nAnother familiar face on the panel came in Mark Holodick, secretary of the Delaware Department of Education.\n\n\"Equality and fairness have changed, and I would say improved, since the Brown decision,\" Holodick said. \"However, opportunities and outcomes for students of color — not so much.\"\n\nHe nodded to this consortium work, exploring how redistricting could be a first step in more systemic reform for Wilmington schools, which he senses an appetite for from the state board. He also called on necessary impact from a very similar body, charged with improving city schools: the Wilmington Learning Collaborative.\n\nBut statewide, Delaware is battling low proficiency among students of color, not leading such students to high levels of success in math and reading in particular. His department, Holodick told the panel, is particularly focused on trying to bolster elementary reading levels.\n\n\"We need to do something about our literacy rates in Delaware, particularly among students of color,\" he said, also quoting some counsel from activist Bebe Coker. \"Because we all know reading opens the door for everything else.\"\n\nJustice Seitz, of the Delaware Supreme Court, also noted the ongoing need for diversity in the law — having formed the Delaware Bench and Bar Diversity Project, back on the 67th anniversary of Brown. There's hope changemakers like his father won't be far and in between again.\n\n\"We have a huge amount of work and resources going in to education because that is, as we said today, that is the key to a long-term solution to getting greater diversity in the Delaware bar,\" the justice said.\n\nWilmington with two school districts?Delaware’s latest redistricting vision to take shape\n\nRemember Delaware's history\n\nWhen asked if segregation made him angry as a child, Louis L. Redding said no.\n\n\"It was not anger he felt,\" said Claire DeMatteis, Delaware's secretary of human resources, moderating the panel, \"but instead: 'Curiosity.'\"\n\nDuring the more than 50 years that he practiced law in Delaware, Redding handled cases that challenged discrimination in housing, public accommodations, employment and criminal justice. His two Delaware cases that consolidated under Brown v. Board of Education played out on New Castle County soil.\n\nIn 1951, the families of Ethel Louise Belton and Shirley Barbara Bulah hired Redding in separate cases, suing the state for refusing to provide transportation to attend the schools closest to their homes. Belton was required to attend Howard High School, a forced 20-mile round trip on public transportation, while living just blocks from all-white Claymont High. Bulah attended Hockessin Colored School #107-C, even though a white school would have been much closer for the 7-year-old.\n\n\"The quest to satisfy this curiosity changed the face of Delaware and shaped laws within our nation,\" DeMatteis said, noting the very decision joining this panel.\n\nSonny Knott, alongside nearly every speaker, stressed Delaware cannot forget this history. That is, both what these parents went through for their children's education, as well as the stories within the state's Black schools.\n\nHe remembers a vibrant community, in a close-knit one-room school with six grades and one teacher. But he also remembers missing pages in school books, given as hand-me-downs if the white schools upgraded.\n\n\"I love the opportunity to talk about the 107, and I encourage each and every one of you: Forget about today,\" the former student said to the crowd. \"Think about tomorrow and the next day in our future. Bring your kids here. There's a lot of history here. There's only about five of us left that spent their entire career at the 107.\"\n\nKnott's stories and many more fill the pages of another panelist's book.

The number of flu-related hospitalizations in Delaware has also doubled, going from 158 this time last year to 398 so far this season.\n\nHospitals have felt strained by this year's flu season due to the number of Delawareans experiencing flu-like symptoms, officials said.\n\nAt St. Francis, only patients with influenza are being asked to limit visitors, said Dr. Sandra Gibney, an emergency room physician. The few who are given permission to visit must wear a full isolation gown, mask and gloves, she said.\n\nAt Bayhealth, patients are being asked to refrain from bringing children 16 or younger to visit as an extra level of precaution for both patients and visitors, spokeswoman Danielle Pro-Hudson said.\n\nWhile the flu season tends to hit senior citizens the hardest, Delaware infants and children have been the most affected by the flu, making up 25 percent of the season's cases. Fifty-three children have died from the flu throughout the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but none so far in Delaware.\n\nIn Delaware, newborns to children 4 years old account for 277 of the cases, while children ages 5 to 9 years old make up 221 cases.

Another portal is slated to launch in Piaui, Brazil, according to the organization behind the installations, Portals.org.\n\nThe portal will stay at the Love Park up until Nov. 7 before it's moved to a different location in the city, according to local station WCAU-TV.\n\nArtwork:Sotheby's to hold its first auction for artwork made by a robot; bids could reach $180,000\n\nCrack on screen to be fixed soon\n\nThe portal's screen debuted to Philadelphians with a slight crack that either happened upon arrival or ahead of installation, WCAU-TV reported.

On a recent Monday, the lunchtime crowd in LOVE Park was all about, well, love. Philadelphians waved to those on the other end of The Portal, where it was nighttime in Poland and Lithuania but still daytime at a busy Dublin intersection where its counterpart was.\n\nWhat is it?Portal installation relocates from New York to Philadelphia, livestreaming to the world\n\nBringing a 'good energy' to Philly\n\n\"It's bringing everybody together,\" said Jontae Miles, a ranger with the Philadelphia Department of Parks and Recreation. He and other rangers, as well as a few scattered Philadelphia Police officers, kept an eye on people in the park, \"to make sure everyone's being safe and kind.\"\n\nEveryone, it seemed, was doing just that.\n\n\"It brings a good energy to the park and the city,\" Miles said.\n\nCrystal Finley brought Selma Cohen, who was in a wheelchair, to see The Portal and wave to the other side of the world.\n\n\"I read the paper to her every morning,\" said Finley, who is Cohen's caretaker. \"She enjoys getting outside. Even if people get a bit mischievous, this is still a nice expression of love.\"\n\nDublin seemed to be the liveliest location, and as Caesar Thorne, a rapper who goes by Lambo, held a sign that read \"Where are you?\" on one side and \"Hello from Philly!\" on the other, one of the Dubliners opened her winter coat to reveal a Philadelphia Eagles shirt.\n\nA cheer went up from the Philly side.\n\n\"I paid some little kids $3 each to find a Sharpie so we could make this sign,\" said Thorne, who described himself as \"genius-borderline-crazy\" and said he'd been out there since 6 a.m. looking at − and being looked at through − The Portal.\n\n'We're the city people love to hate!'\n\n\"We're the city people love to hate!\" Thorne added in what he called his \"spectacular vernacular.\" Asked why, the lifelong city resident said it was a case of envy for Philadelphia's greatness: \"They hate us 'cause they ain't us.\"\n\nThorne would periodically put the sign down long enough to engage, to varying degrees of success, in a cross-continental game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. When a preteen boy in one city (we won't say which to protect the kid) flipped the middle finger at Philadelphians, a ranger shook his head disapprovingly and said to the crowd, \"We'll be better than that.\"\n\nKate McCabe danced, trying without any luck to get someone on the other side of The Portal to join her. Thorne obliged, though, and the pair grooved together to the sounds of a TikTok soundtrack.\n\n\"I think it's remarkable that we can wave and be friendly,\" she said. \"It's an occasion to dance.\"\n\nAs for the city's reputation for toughness, she waved that away. \"I've heard it all, the snowballs at Santa and all that.

Later he moved to California to join the burgeoning electronic and video games industry, bringing his love of the whimsical to the online world.\n\nSo it surprised no one that as De Koven faced his own mortality there was only one legacy he wanted to leave: A way for people to play with each other.\n\nLate last month that vision became reality as the Indy Parks Foundation held a ribbon cutting for two new parent-child Expression swings in Ellenberger Park just a few blocks from the Irvington house where De Koven, 75, has lived for almost a decade.\n\nIn typical fashion, De Koven — known widely as \"Blue\" for an amalgam of his first and middle names Bernard Louis — elicited laughs from the crowd of about 30 as he started to speak into the muffled mike. \"Technical help,\" he called in a deliberately accentuated whine.\n\nThen, he turned serious, noting that the swings stood for what he's been teaching all his life, the importance of play.\n\nMore:After almost taking his own life, Riley doctor focuses on saving other physicians\n\nMore:'1 in a million, 1 in a billion': Indiana toddler who was born with metastatic melanoma\n\nAfter being diagnosed with advanced lung cancer this spring, De Koven decided he wanted to raise the $10,000 to $15,000 needed to install the swings in the park. He reached out to GameTime, the company that makes the equipment, through its local distributor Sinclair Recreation and explained his plan.\n\nAlthough vice president Rich Sinclair had never met De Koven, he felt an immediate connection to him. He contacted GameTime, told a company executive the story and asked whether they could look into a discount to help make this happen.\n\n\"I know this guy,\" said Tom Norquist, the company's senior vice president of marketing, design, and product development. \"I’ll donate the swings.\" Years ago, De Koven had written an article about the swings that allow parent and child to swing while looking at one another, saying they epitomized the joy of play.\n\n“People are always looking for a donation and Bernie wasn’t looking for that. We were just really struck by his sincerity and his genuine desire to do something lasting for those who were going to survive him,” Sinclair said. “His story struck a chord in my heart and we wanted to try to go above and beyond to help him bring this idea and go and to do it quickly as his time is running short.”\n\nThe donation helped expedite De Koven’s campaign. Through the Indy Parks Foundation, De Koven’s family and friends raised about $6,000, but only about $4,000 was needed to pay for preparing the site for the swings. The Parks Foundation has about $2,000 remaining and people can still donate towards the De Koven fund for additional uses to be determined by De Koven and his family, said Jenny Burrough, Indy Parks Foundation vice president.\n\nDe Koven’s legacy gift is the first of its sort for the foundation, Burrough said.\n\nBut De Koven considers his true gift to be the timing of his cancer diagnosis.\n\n“So it’s the end of my life, but that’s fine. I’ve had such a beautiful life,” he said. “All I want is to be able to, as long as I’m alive, to carry the spirit of playfulness to people who are ready for it.”\n\nIn a deep, emotive voice that betrays his roots in theater, De Koven shared the “long but lovely” story of his life.\n\nDe Koven met his wife Rocky more than five decades ago, while both were studying in Israel. The two moved to the Philadelphia area, where De Koven, who has a master’s degree in theater, taught at a Philadelphia school. One day, De Koven let the class play “Duck Duck Goose.”\n\nHis “big A-ha moment” came when a child invited him to join the circle. He tried to make himself invisible. But of course, he was next chosen.\n\n“That's when I realized, this is real genuine drama and theater,” he said. “I began to really recognize that in children’s games are profound truths.”\n\nA few years later, De Koven switched his focus to adults after realizing that kids already know how to play. Adults on the other hand have few opportunities to do so.\n\nThe De Kovens bought a 25-acre farm in Eastern Pennsylvania and created the Games Preserve, where they hosted retreats for people. The place had one bathroom. Guests slept in the barn. Visitors tended to be too busy playing ping-pong or air hockey, twisting on the flying rings, or trying any of the more than 1,000 board games to complain. Philadelphia businesses sent their employees; Graterford Prison hosted a retreat for guards.\n\nMeanwhile, De Koven helped start a group, the New Games Foundation. Imbued with a distinct anti-war flair, the organization emphasized large-scale adult play. The idea was to celebrate play without scores, awards, or determining who was the best.\n\n“In a way it was a real demonstration of peace,” said De Koven, who in 1978 shared his philosophy in a book called 'The Well-Played Game.’“This is what we do when we stop being afraid of each other. This is our natural state to play together like that.”\n\nThe life was a joyful but far from lucrative one. In 1981, the De Kovens ran out of money. Meanwhile, De Koven had learned of a new twist in the games world: Video.\n\nHe scraped together enough for a one-way ticket to California, where he helped develop games like Ricochet and Alien Garden, an art game in which the player is a bee nurturing a garden. His partner? A programmer named Jaron Lanier, who would later be known as the father of virtual reality.\n\nAll of a sudden what had been a hobby for many became an industry.\n\nFor De Koven, games had long been a spiritual undertaking. Now, there was a cadre of like-minded people to learn from his insights. He found audiences all over the world.\n\nPlay remains the focus of De Koven’s life. He describes his favorite games as “panty-wetting” in which the players laugh so hard they lose bladder control. The fewer the rules of the game the better. Less rules allow players to evolve the game together.\n\n“Play is a spiritual experience. When you get to that point, you free each other. I have a term for it, co-liberation, because your laughter makes me feel more free to laugh with you,” De Koven said. “We free each other.”\n\nEight years ago, De Koven and his wife Rocky moved from Redondo Beach, Calif., to live near their daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren in Indiana. They also have a son, daughter-in-law, and four grandchildren in Israel. The De Kovens embraced life in Indiana, hosting neighborhood get-togethers to test games. De Koven continues to be a major voice in the world of play with his website, Deep Fun.\n\nEarlier this spring, De Koven learned he had metastatic lung cancer. Back pain had plagued him for a few years and his doctor diagnosed spinal stenosis. When it became more difficult for De Koven to walk, his doctor recommended another scan. Doctors saw the cancer that had spread.\n\nThese days, De Koven allows, he cries often. Colleagues in the world of play have been coming to visit from around the world, crowding his living room that lacks a couch but features a ping-pong table to say what could be their final goodbyes.\n\nDespite the tears, De Koven maintains a sense of playfulness, even joking about dying, says his daughter Shael Weidenbach.\n\nThe idea for the swings originated with a perennial joke her father would make about death, Weidenbach said. Instead of a headstone, he’d say, I want a tetherball.\n\nShortly after his diagnosis, as father and daughter sat in the hospital, she asked, \"Do you still want a tetherball?\"\n\nWithin a few days, De Koven had reached out to the park department about the swings. Thursday he smiled with approval as kids and then their parents climbed on the two swings within seconds of the formal ribbon cutting. The two Expression swings are situated so that the two parents swinging and their two children make eye contact with one another as they sway, the first swings installed in this fashion.\n\nAs he nears the end of his life, De Koven said, he encourages people to incorporate play into every aspect of their lives – to cook playfully, teach playfully, say hello to strangers playfully. Games serve to help nurture playfulness.\n\nIn advance of a recent appearance, De Koven put together a Power Point presentation he titled “My Life in Play.” Of course the irony was not lost on him, but he takes solace in the fact that he feels he has accomplished what he wanted in life.\n\nIn many ways, the life he has lived has been, indeed, a well-played game.\n\n“It’s not a question of who wins or loses the game, it’s really a question of how well the game is played,” he said. “It’s my only reason for going on.

The toxic stew seeped down into the soil and migrated with the groundwater off the company's site, eventually vaporizing up through the soil into the basements of nearby homes, posing a health risk to residents.\n\nThe solvents remain today — more than 30 years after they were discovered, and after countless public meetings, debate and study — beneath homes and backyards where DuPont workers and other residents raised families, played with children and planted vegetable gardens.\n\nBut now, a trove of government documents and emails obtained by The Record and NorthJersey.com reveal for the first time how extensively DuPont — the chemical giant that gave the world non-stick pans, stain-resistant carpets, nylon and other ubiquitous products — worked behind the scenes for more than three decades to keep secret and then downplay the extent of overall contamination from the site and the potential health risks they posed.\n\nThe company pushed back against regulators and chose not to tell residents that the cancer-causing chemicals could be vaporizing up from the groundwater into their homes, those documents reveal.\n\nThe plume of chemicals remains largely unaddressed, even as many residents blame DuPont for elevated levels of cancer and for other illnesses in their neighborhood.\n\n\"This was our home, and they did this, and we were lied to — lied to,\" said Helen Martens, who moved to the Pompton Lakes neighborhood in 1977. \"I lost all faith in the law, and in our town elected officials, and DuPont. I couldn't believe they had done this to people.\n\n\"I love my home,\" the 72-year-old said. \"I just fear it.\"\n\nThe Record reviewed hundreds of state and federal government emails and 100 boxes filled with government documents, obtained through open records requests, and conducted more than 70 interviews with residents, regulators, lawyers and environmental experts.\n\nThe investigation reveals that:\n\nDuPont told residents in 1997 that vapors from cancer-causing solvents weren't entering homes – even though the company was aware of the potential for the solvents to vaporize and had not conducted tests beneath or inside any houses.\n\nthat vapors from cancer-causing solvents weren't entering homes – even though the company was aware of the potential for the solvents to vaporize and had not conducted tests beneath or inside any houses. DuPont and regulators discussed the threat of vapor intrusion for seven years – from 2001 to 2008 – without informing the public, documents show. That prevented unsuspecting residents from acting on their own to protect themselves, while potentially breathing cancer-causing vapors in their homes.\n\nof vapor intrusion for seven years – from 2001 to 2008 – without informing the public, documents show. That prevented unsuspecting residents from acting on their own to protect themselves, while potentially breathing cancer-causing vapors in their homes. Even as residents were kept in the dark, regulators pushed DuPont to test for vapors. The company was \"adamantly opposed.\" Internal government documents show why: DuPont didn't want test results that could be used against the company by residents in an ongoing suit about other pollution from its Pompton Lakes facility.\n\nThen, as part of the settlement of that suit, DuPont required residents to sign a release that kept them from suing DuPont if additional pollution was discovered.\n\nOnly after those releases were signed did DuPont test for vapors. But when residents were finally told about the danger in their homes and tried to sue, a judge said those who signed the releases were out of luck.\n\nThe Record and NorthJersey.com's investigation also found:\n\nDocuments dating to 1979 show the company's behavior on the vapor intrusion issue was part of a larger, decades-long pattern in which DuPont obscured and then downplayed the extent of various toxic pollutants migrating off its property.\n\non the vapor intrusion issue was part of a larger, decades-long pattern in which DuPont obscured and then downplayed the extent of various toxic pollutants migrating off its property. Experts say it is hard to definitively link a particular polluted site to specific cases of cancer or other illness. Still, a door-to-door canvass by The Record of more than 50 households in the plume neighborhood identified many cases of various cancers that have been linked in studies to solvents that have been found in the plume, as well as other diseases, across multiple generations.\n\na particular polluted site to specific cases of cancer or other illness. Still, a door-to-door canvass by The Record of more than 50 households in the plume neighborhood identified many cases of various cancers that have been linked in studies to solvents that have been found in the plume, as well as other diseases, across multiple generations. A federal regulator told The Record she pushed to have the DuPont site added to the Superfund list so it could receive more federal money and contractor support, enjoy potentially quicker approvals for cleanup measures, and take into account public input. But state and local political leaders, including Bob Martin, the state's top environmental official under then-Gov. Chris Christie, blocked those efforts.\n\n\"It always seemed to me that the company was trying to slow-walk the problem,\" Judith Enck, former regional administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency during the Obama administration, said in a recent interview. \"They worked hard to pay as little money as possible and stretch it out over a long period of time, and sadly I think they are succeeding at that.\"\n\nThe delays at times generated expressions of frustration. At one point in 2007, for instance, Frank Faranca, a state regulator, emailed DuPont about vapor testing beneath homes: \"I find it increasingly hard to believe that it has taken this long to do the work. If you are truly trying to protect human health, it should not have taken this long.\"\n\nThe Pompton Lakes residents affected by the plume of vaporizing solvents are not alone.\n\nIn New Jersey and across the nation, vapor intrusion is a growing concern, and not only for newer contaminated sites that are just starting to be cleaned. Over the past decade, for instance, New York's environmental agency has revisited 147 legacy sites that had already been considered cleaned up to check for vapor intrusion.\n\nDuPont — which had a gross profit in 2016 of more than $10 billion — has spent money in Pompton Lakes over several decades to address some aspects of its legacy of pollution.\n\nA $50 million cleanup of Pompton Lake is underway to remove lead and mercury that washed into the lake sediment. DuPont also spent $70 million in the early 1990s to remove and replace soil tainted with lead and mercury from the backyards of homes that lined Acid Brook, a stream that runs through the DuPont property and through the adjacent neighborhood before it empties into Pompton Lake.\n\nDuPont spent nearly $40 million to settle lawsuits in connection with the mercury and lead contamination over the years, and offered a \"groundwater benefits program\" — payouts of $5,000 each to residents who promised not to sue the company.\n\nBut far less has been done to address the source of the vapor intrusion, which affects a much greater area.\n\nThe company built a $1.2 million pump-and-treat system to prevent more chemicals from leaving its property. And since 2008, DuPont has paid to install and cover the operating costs of venting systems intended to remove the harmful vapors from homes.\n\nStill, the underground plume of chemicals remains beneath 400 homes. One pilot study to test a method to treat the chemicals failed. A second controversial pilot study awaits state approval. There is no plan to buy out residents who have seen their property values plummet.\n\nDuPont declined to discuss its former operations in Pompton Lakes, referring all questions to Chemours, a spinoff it created in 2015. Chemours inherited about 170 contaminated DuPont sites nationwide, including the 600-acre Pompton Lakes site in Passaic County.\n\nChemours calls the Pompton Lakes cleanup challenging and said its goals ultimately mesh with those of residents.\n\n\"The remediation of a complex site like Pompton Lakes is a lengthy and complicated process,\" Chemours spokeswoman Robin Ollis Stemple said by email.\n\n\"While we all wish that this could be done more quickly, Chemours is committed to doing the work in a way that is thorough, science-based, protective of people and the environment and in accordance with all guidance\" provided by regulators.\n\n\"While this takes time, we believe this is the right approach for the Pompton Lakes community,\" she added. \"Ultimately, Chemours and the community have the same goal: to complete protective remediation and return the site to productive use.\"\n\nBut many wary residents — some of whom suffer from an array of illnesses — say they have been betrayed for decades by DuPont and let down by regulators and elected officials. They say they have no confidence the plume will be addressed. Some said they feel trapped, and want nothing more than to escape the neighborhood they once loved.\n\n\"I wind up with Stage 4 kidney failure,\" said longtime resident Ron Merlino. \"Guess what,\" he said. \"Buy our homes. Get us out of here. They should have got us out of here as soon as they knew we were getting poisoned in our own homes.\n\n\"It's time to go,\" Merlino added. \"I can't wait to get out.\"\n\nToday, more than three decades after regulators became aware toxic chemicals were migrating off the DuPont site, the plume of contamination remains unaddressed beneath more than 400 homes, making it one of the country's larger vapor intrusion sites.\n\nHere's how that happened.\n\nBecause it plays such an ominous role in their lives, some Pompton Lakes residents refer to the contaminated groundwater beneath their homes simply as \"The Plume.\"\n\nMany residents insist the plume of solvents has caused dozens of cases of brain, cervical, kidney and other cancers, as well as other illnesses.\n\nTheir argument was bolstered by a 2009 state health study that showed kidney cancer rates among women in the neighborhood were elevated and that non-Hodgkin lymphoma among men was elevated compared with the state average. New Jersey's rate of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in men is among the highest in the country.\n\nThe Health Department said in its 2009 study that while it could not definitively link the elevated cancer rates to solvents in the plume, \"the contaminants cannot be ruled out as a potential cause.\"\n\nWhen asked to comment on the array of illnesses among residents living above the plume, Chemours said in an email, \"It is an unfortunate fact that illnesses, including cancer, occur in all communities and neighborhoods in the state and the country.\"\n\nResidents say the plume has pushed down property values and prevented people from cashing in on life savings tied up in their homes.\n\nThe state first concluded solvents were migrating off the DuPont site and under homes as early as 1984, documents show. In 1988 the state and DuPont signed an agreement that required DuPont to drill monitoring wells to determine the extent of the plume — and to clean the contaminated groundwater.\n\nThe state Department of Environmental Protection called cleaning the plume a priority. Private wells in the neighborhood were the initial concern. Most were used to water lawns and fill swimming pools. But a few provided drinking water.\n\nRichard Marsh, a former DuPont employee and longtime resident, recalled a neighbor who had multiple dogs die from tumors.\n\n\"He fed them well water,\" Marsh said. \"My dogs never died of tumors. We used municipal water.\"\n\nThe solvents in the plume — TCE and PCE — belong to a group of chemicals called volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, which easily evaporate in the air. Private wells in the neighborhood, tested in 1985 and 1986, had volatile organic compounds as high as 5,592 parts per billion. One well had 408 parts per billion of PCE and 167 parts per billion of TCE.\n\nThe state drinking water limit for either of those solvents is 1 part per billion — the equivalent of one drop of solvent in an Olympic-size swimming pool — illustrating their potency.\n\nGiven the health concern, DuPont had the wells disconnected and the homes hooked up to municipal water.\n\nNot until 2001 — 17 years after the plume was identified — did regulators first mention in private exchanges with DuPont about the potential for the plume to be a health threat to residents through toxic vapors seeping into homes.\n\nVapor intrusion occurs when contaminants in the groundwater turn to vapor, move up through tiny spaces in the soil and enter basements through cracks in foundations or openings for utility lines.\n\nScientists have known about the threat for decades.\n\nTests for toxic vapors were conducted at the infamous Love Canal in upstate New York in the mid-1980s, and a few years later, vapor intrusion tests were conducted in residential areas of Rochester, New York, near a contaminated Kodak facility.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the federal Environmental Protection Agency issued some guidance on dealing with vapor intrusion at Superfund sites.\n\nNew Jersey was among the first states to focus on it. The state issued guidance in 1999 to test indoor air. The science was evolving rapidly, said John Boyer, a vapor intrusion expert with the state. Over the next few years the EPA and state Department of Environmental Protection put out new guidance on how to handle vapor intrusion, reflecting the evolving science.\n\nDuPont was aware of the potential for the solvents in the Pompton Lakes plume to vaporize into homes as early as 1997, documents show. But they told residents it wasn't happening, even though they had not tested the air in homes, or the soil underneath.\n\nHere is an excerpt from a letter DuPont sent residents in September 1997:\n\n\"… in addition to monitoring the groundwater plume, DuPont has also investigated the potential for vapor emissions to occur from the plume. (M)easurements … provide no indication of vapor migration.\"\n\nBut the measurements weren't taken under or inside people's homes. They were conducted in an old dry well on DuPont's former property.\n\n\"As far as the assumptions they were making, the science really wasn't there,\" said Boyer, the state vapor intrusion expert. \"There was no basis for us to disagree, I guess, at that point. But as time went on, the science got better, and as we moved forward we started recognizing this was more of a problem than we may have anticipated.\"\n\nChemours, in an email to The Record, said the best environmental investigation practice requires sampling \"where concentrations are likely to be highest,\" and the old well site was in the direct path of the groundwater flowing from the DuPont site \"where contamination would be expected to be highest.\"\n\nChemours also said \"the science of understanding vapor intrusion continued to evolve after 1997.\" It noted that DuPont conducted tests in the plume neighborhood from 2003 to 2005, though not under or inside homes.\n\n\"The data collected up to that point indicated that there was no vapor intrusion pathway,\" Chemours said.\n\nThough residents would be told nothing about vapor intrusion until 2008 — more than a decade after DuPont's 1997 letter — internal DEP and EPA emails and documents show that as early as March 2001 the regulators worried that vapors could be a health risk.\n\nIt took seven years for residents to be alerted.\n\nBecause the state at the time had little regulatory power on vapor intrusion, they relied on the federal EPA's push.\n\n\"We did not have the regulatory gun in a holster,\" said DEP spokesman Larry Hajna.\n\nAt a meeting in March 2001, regulators told DuPont that vapor intrusion \"must be addressed.\"\n\nAnd an EPA document a few months later noted that because the solvents were detected in elevated levels in monitoring wells in the neighborhood, \"indoor air may be of concern at off-site locations in the residential community.\"\n\nThe issue should be investigated, the report said.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nMore than a year later, in March 2003, DuPont and the regulators held a private meeting, documents show. The regulators underscored that \"there are potential impacts of the plume on people in the residential houses … through indoor air.\"\n\nBut that message was not conveyed to the residents.\n\n\"The public has a right to know about a problem,\" Enck, the former EPA regional administrator, said in a recent interview.\n\n\"I think it's crucial for government regulatory agencies but also for big companies to share information early,\" said Enck, who left the EPA in January 2017 after seven years. \"Unfortunately that didn't happen here.\"\n\nInstead, DuPont made it clear to the agencies that the company opposed sampling homes in the plume. In April 2003, an EPA official noted in an internal email: \"DuPont to fight if indoor air sampling required.\"\n\nDuPont sent a report a few months later saying there was no vapor intrusion — a report that relied on the same 1996 test of the dry well on DuPont's former property.\n\nThe state disagreed.\n\nAn agency memo noted that samples from monitoring wells in the plume neighborhood found elevated levels of PCE and TCE, which indicated the need to test for vapor intrusion. The 2003 memo also questioned DuPont's assumptions.\n\nIt noted that other wells had not been tested since 1995, so \"it is questionable whether one can conclude … that the concentration levels in the off-site plume are decreasing.\"\n\n\"If you know there's contamination and it's inexpensive and easy to mitigate, then do it,\" said Lenny Siegel, executive director of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight, which advocates for victims of environmental pollution.\n\n\"If you can install mitigation systems, just do it,\" he said. \"If installed properly they are effective.\"\n\nChemours defended DuPont's decision not to alert residents about the potential for vapor intrusion until 2008.\n\n\"In 1997, the science of vapor transport from groundwater … (was) still developing,\" Chemours wrote. \"We understand that DuPont followed relevant, applicable guidance as it was developed by regulatory agencies over time, and that DuPont communicated with residents appropriately.\"\n\nThat explanation does not sit well with some plume residents.\n\n\"The safest thing obviously is to move the people out,\" said longtime resident Cheryl Rubino. \"They should not be exposed to the contamination. But for those who don't want to go — make them whole. It's not fair what's happened to these people. Their homes, their investments, their life savings are in their house. They will always need to disclose the contamination.\n\n\"Personally, I don't feel it's going to get cleaned up,\" Rubino said. \"I really don't. It's too difficult and too expensive. And there's going to be a very difficult and long haul, and it will not happen before my mother dies, and it will not happen before I die.\"\n\nDuPont adamantly opposed testing for cancer-causing vapors beneath the Pompton Lakes neighborhood because it didn't want the test results to become a cudgel the public could use against the chemical giant in court, documents and emails reviewed by The Record and NorthJersey.com show.\n\nAnd as DuPont pushed back against regulators, Pompton Lakes residents, unaware of the vapors potentially seeping into their homes, continued to use their basements to do laundry, check their computer email, play video games — all while potentially breathing in the dangerous vapors.\n\nDuring that seven-year period when the public was kept in the dark about the potential danger lurking beneath their homes, not only did DuPont resist regulators who had pressed for vapor tests — at times the regulators' own bungling exacerbated the delays, according to dozens of internal emails and government documents obtained by The Record and NorthJersey.com.\n\nDocuments show that DuPont was unhappy with the regulators from the state and the federal EPA for pushing to have vapor tests conducted.\n\nIn an August 2003 email to officials at the EPA's Region 2, which covers New Jersey, DuPont complained that \"generally we feel that Region II wants more documentation and investigations tha(n) we have experienced with other Regions.\"\n\nA month later, DuPont and the regulators met to discuss ways to test for vapor intrusion in the plume. An internal EPA memo, uncovered by The Record and NorthJersey.com through a public records request, summarized the meeting.\n\nIt noted that if the geology of the site made it impossible to use generic testing methods, DuPont would need to conduct air sampling beneath and inside plume homes, \"which DuPont has adamantly opposed. They are involved in several citizen suits and they are concerned that such an assessment could be detrimental to the cases.\"\n\nIn other words, DuPont told environmental officials that if the tests showed elevated levels of solvent vapors, that could be used against them in ongoing lawsuits related to other contaminants that had left DuPont's property.\n\nOne of those suits had been filed on behalf of Pompton Lakes residents in 1998.\n\nThe case, Agnes v. DuPont, focused on health impacts and falling home values allegedly caused by mercury and lead that had washed off the DuPont site and into backyards, brought there by Acid Brook. The case also looked at solvents that contaminated private wells.\n\nBut it didn't focus on vapor intrusion, since the public had not yet been told it was a concern.\n\nWhen DuPont settled the Agnes case, the public remained uninformed about the danger of vapor intrusion.\n\nThe settlement provided most residents $950, a third of which went to their lawyers. In exchange, DuPont required residents to sign a release in which they relinquished their right to sue DuPont in the future over any illness other than cancer related to contamination from DuPont's Pompton Lakes site.\n\nWhen they signed those releases, residents were still in the dark about the ongoing talks between regulators and DuPont about vapor intrusion.\n\nAfter DuPont told the public in 2008 that tests indicated vapor intrusion was occurring, residents filed another suit, this time focused on vapor intrusion.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh ruled that 113 of the residents had no standing to sue DuPont because they had signed the 2004 releases — even though they knew nothing about vapor intrusion at the time.\n\n\"We were basically told after the fact — after giving them amnesty, if you will, that, oh, by the way — there is contaminated groundwater under your home, there are gases that are potentially seeping through the cracks in your basement, and they are carcinogenic,\" recalled longtime resident Jefferson LaSala.\n\nDuPont declined to comment on any aspects of its Pompton Lakes operations for this series. Chemours, a spinoff company that inherited responsibility for 170 of DuPont's contaminated sites across the country, including Pompton Lakes, told The Record in an email that \"there was no effort\" by DuPont \"to delay testing\" in the plume because of the lawsuits.\n\nDelays abounded, however, lasting years. Emails show that some delays were caused by DuPont, and some by regulators.\n\nMeanwhile, residents continued to use their basements, unaware they could be breathing cancer-causing vapors.\n\n\"I worked on vapor intrusion in upstate New York 20 years ago — it's not brand new,\" Enck, the former EPA regional administrator overseeing New Jersey during the Obama administration, told The Record. \"One of the most basic things is you do indoor air samples to decide if there is a problem and need a widespread solution.\"\n\nAt the same time, the state DEP had only a handful of vapor intrusion cases by 2005. \"So there was no precedent, no standard approach,\" recalled John Boyer, the DEP's vapor intrusion expert. \"We sort of broke ground when it came to the DuPont case in how to go about doing things.\n\n\"We were sort of feeling our way through this process,\" Boyer said.\n\nAnd DuPont didn't help.\n\nThe company submitted multiple reports over several years using screening levels and other factors the regulators had already rejected as lax or inappropriate, stalling the agencies in the process.\n\n\"History shows that in the absence of an active community and regulators, most polluters will drag their feet,\" said Lenny Siegel, executive director of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight, which advocates for victims of environmental pollution. \"They will try to do study after study showing the contamination isn't as bad as everyone thought. They are responsible to their shareholders.\"\n\nIn their 2010 book \"The Polluters,\" authors Benjamin Ross and Steven Amter, scientists who ran an environmental consulting firm, wrote that \"one of the industry's common tactics can be summed up as ‘spill, study, and stall.' When outside pressure to do something about pollution became strong, a study of the problem would be launched as an alternative to expensive action.\"\n\nEnck agreed.\n\nCompanies such as DuPont \"know how to tie regulatory agencies in knots,\" she said. \"They spend money on scientists who just question everything an agency wants to do.\"\n\nWhile the DEP and EPA kept prodding DuPont to test for vapor intrusion in Pompton Lakes, at times the regulators themselves dropped the ball, inadvertently exacerbating DuPont's delay, and causing residents to be victims of bureaucratic bungling.\n\nFor instance, early in 2004 DuPont sent an email to the DEP asking it to approve some sampling procedures. When the EPA asked three months later for the test samples, DuPont said it hadn't conducted the tests because it never heard back from the state.\n\n\"We prefer feedback before we proceed,\" DuPont wrote.\n\nA DEP official countered that he never received DuPont's correspondence, and besides, he was overwhelmed with work. \"I have to keep switching between my other 17 hazardous waste sites, which leaves me little time to devote to any specific project,\" he wrote. \"If any one project becomes a high priority, that gets 100% of my attention, and everything else gets dropped.\"\n\nLater that day, he acknowledged that he found DuPont's earlier email.\n\n\"Since my desk is buried beneath a Solid Waste landfill, I could not determine if I got the document,\" he wrote, somewhat sarcastically.\n\nThe new sampling was scheduled for Aug. 9.\n\nOn Sept. 14, the EPA followed up, asking for results.\n\nOn Dec. 22, the EPA asked again for the results.\n\nMore than a week later, DuPont replied: \"We had some problems with the last set of samples.\"\n\nWhen samples were taken at seven homes in early 2008, results showed elevated levels of PCE in all seven, and elevated TCE in six.\n\nA hydrogeologist hired as an expert for resident plaintiffs in a 2010 court case said that, since the solvents had likely been in the groundwater since the 1940s, \"vapor intrusion must have also occurred in the neighborhood for decades.\"\n\nAfter the 2008 test results, DuPont installed vapor intrusion systems on more than 330 homes to suck the vapors out from beneath the foundations and release them into the outside air to dissipate. In 2014, tests at Lakeside Middle School, adjacent to the plume, did not detect toxic vapors above state safety standards.\n\nHowever, the source of those vapors — the plume of contamination in the soil — is still there, unaddressed. Chemours has proposed a new pilot study to flush water into the ground to create a barrier between the vapors and the homes, but residents worry it will raise the water table and flood their basements with contamination.\n\n\"We're dealing with a very affluent company that knows science,\" said Enck, the former EPA regional administrator. \"They make billions of dollars every year, and someone inside the company has to take a very close look at the toxic legacy here and decide to do something differently.\n\n\"I think we need a new set of experts inside the company addressing this, because the old way is not working,\" Enck said.\n\nShe urged New Jersey's new governor, Phil Murphy, to make the site a priority. \"I think the community members are raising very legitimate concerns,\" Enck said.\n\nThe test results showing vapor intrusion in Pompton Lakes came nearly eight years after regulators first started raising concerns to DuPont about the potential for vapor intrusion in the neighborhood.\n\nThey arrived 11 years after DuPont told residents vapor intrusion was not occurring in the plume.\n\nAnd it was nearly 25 years after state environmental officials first suspected solvents were migrating off the DuPont site and under adjacent homes.\n\nWhen DuPont told Pompton Lakes residents in June 2008 that vapor intrusion could be occurring in their homes, the company said it would pay to install vapor mitigation units on each home in the plume.\n\nThe systems work by sucking the toxic vapors out from under a home and sending them up through a pipe, which releases them to the outside air, allowing them to dissipate.\n\nThe vapors came from the cancer-causing solvents PCE and TCE, which had contaminated a plume of groundwater beneath about 400 homes. The solvents had migrated off DuPont's former munitions facility nearby, and had moved their way up through the soil and into some basements.\n\nDuring tests to determine the extent of vapor intrusion in the neighborhood, two-thirds of samples taken beneath homes showed that PCE levels exceeded the state standard of 16 parts per billion. Levels were as high as 6,800.\n\nSimilarly, a third of samples tested high for TCE. The state standard was 11 parts per billion. Readings were as high as 1,200.\n\nAs for indoor air results, elevated levels of PCE were in 29 percent of the samples. The state standard was 1 part per billion, and readings were as high as 68.\n\nIn its 2010 report on the test results, DuPont said this about providing the vapor mitigation systems: \"DuPont believes that proactively offering systems to those residents located above the groundwater plume is an appropriate measure while efforts continue to assess potential remedial technologies for implementation in the offsite groundwater plume.\"\n\nThe company could have \"proactively\" provided those systems eight years earlier, when regulators first raised concerns about the potential for vapor intrusion.\n\n\"Companies are always free to proactively take steps to protect public health when they have contaminated communities,\" former EPA regional administrator Judith Enck said in a recent interview.\n\nIn December 2009, a state Health Department study found that women living in the plume had elevated rates of kidney cancer and men had elevated rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The Health Department said it could not definitively link the elevated cancer rates to the solvents in the plume — but \"the contaminants cannot be ruled out as a potential cause.\"\n\nBy that time, homeowners had grown so distrustful of DuPont that many refused to let the company's contractor into their homes to install the vapor mitigation systems. In some cases, their lack of faith was warranted.\n\nEarly in 2009, the Pompton Lakes building inspector failed 22 of the venting systems because the top of the outdoor pipe was installed too close to a window or chimney. Eventually, regulators allowed homeowners to choose their own state-approved contractors to install the systems. More than 330 homes in the plume neighborhood now have vapor mitigation systems.\n\nBut today, nearly 30 years after DuPont signed an agreement with New Jersey to clean up the groundwater plume — which is the source of those cancer-causing vapors — the land beneath the homes remains contaminated.\n\nBlasting caps and explosive powder have played a major role in the history of Pompton Lakes and neighboring Wanaque for more than a century.\n\nEven before DuPont arrived on the scene, several smaller companies made explosive powder in those towns as far back as the 1880s.\n\nThe first plant on the Wanaque portion of the future DuPont site was built in 1886 by H. Julius Smith, who had patented a spark-fired blasting cap filled with mercury fulminate.\n\nIn 1894, the American Smokeless Powder Co. took over production on the property. Its smokeless powder was a vast strategic improvement for soldiers over black powder, which had produced smoke that obscured enemy targets during battle and also gave away the location of the soldiers doing the shooting.\n\nThe Haskell Plant, as it was known, was purchased in 1898 by Laflin & Rand, which expanded the site. The factory was so important that American troops were stationed to guard it during the Spanish-American War.\n\nDuPont acquired control of Laflin & Rand in 1902, and set up its DuPont Electric Exploder Company, which included blasting cap and powder production facilities on the west side of Lake Inez along the Wanaque River. The facility would play a key production role in World War I.\n\nIn 1908, DuPont opened the DuPont Cap Works in the Acid Brook Valley.\n\nInitially the company made mercury fulminate as a powder to use in its blasting caps, then later switched to lead azide.\n\nTroops were stationed around the facility during World War I to guard against any potential sabotage by foreign agents.\n\nWith good reason.\n\nAn incident in January 1917 provided a stark reminder of the danger posed by the materials on the site. Some 400,000 pounds of smokeless powder ignited, causing explosions that could be felt as far away as Massachusetts. Houses shook in Brooklyn, windows shattered in Westchester County, and telephone and telegraph service throughout North Jersey was disrupted, according to a New York Times story at the time of the disaster: \"At the Pompton Lakes Hotel the floors were forced up and the guests ran to the street in terror, many not fully dressed.\"\n\nDuPont built a series of homes just south of its plant around World War I to house employees. The neighborhood became known as DuPont Village.\n\nIn 1926, DuPont shuttered its Wanaque facility and consolidated operations to the southeast, in Pompton Lakes.\n\nAs the nation ramped up for World War II, so did DuPont's hiring at its Pompton Lakes site. Employment peaked during the war at about 7,500, providing steady, well-paying jobs for many in the area.\n\nIn fact, DuPont provided more than jobs — it provided a way of life, a sense of community, even recreational opportunities such as athletic teams.\n\nIn 1943, amid World War II, operations and staff at the Pompton Lakes site had grown so large that DuPont introduced a monthly newsletter, aptly named \"The Exploder.\"\n\nThe first issue noted that it was created \"to unite the thousands of workers at the plant in a spirit of harmony, friendliness and above all, grim determination to keep at its peak the production for which we have taken solemn obligation.\"\n\nThe newsletter provided personal updates on workers in various parts of the sprawling facility, including the \"Twisting Line,\" \"Inspecting Line\" and \"Coiling Line.\"\n\nThat first issue also warned against absenteeism.\n\n\"They're beginning to use some pretty sharp words, including ‘deserter' for those who are absent without excuse from war plants,\" it read. \"The way to get to work every day is to bear constantly in mind that somewhere out in the Pacific or in Africa, some teenage son or somebody's husband may reach out desperately for ammunition to protect himself against the fiendish enemy and find that there isn't any…production was short that day you stayed out to get your hair set.\"\n\n\"The Exploder\" even had New Yorker-style cartoons, including one in which a female employee holds out a cup to a woman on another assembly line and says, \"Can you lend me a cup of Thermite — I just need a little to finish up a batch of incendiaries!\"\n\nAfter World War II, DuPont operations in Pompton Lakes slowly declined, until the plant closed in 1994.\n\nRemnants of structures — primarily concrete footings, stone and concrete foundations and masonry walls — remain on the 600-acre property, along with Cannonball Road, which had served as the facility's spine.\n\nFounded in 1802 as a gunpowder mill on the Brandywine River in Delaware by chemist and industrialist E. I. du Pont, who had fled the violence of the French Revolution with his family in 1799.\n\nHeadquartered in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nPlayed key role in making blasting caps and other ammunition at its Pompton Lakes facility for the U.S. military during both world wars.\n\nPlayed a major role in the Manhattan Project, which ultimately developed nuclear weapons for the United States during World War II.\n\nInvented Nylon, Lucite, Dacron, Mylar, Kevlar, Tyvek, Lycra, Teflon, Corian, Stainmaster carpets, and other now-ubiquitous products.\n\nIn 2015 spun off a separate company, Chemours, which inherited responsibility for cleanup of more than 170 of DuPont's contaminated sites, including Pompton Lakes.\n\nHad $10 billion in net profit in 2016.\n\nIn September 2017 completed a $130 billion merger with Dow, another chemical industry giant, to become DowDuPont. DowDuPont is expected to break into three independent, publicly traded companies focused on agriculture, materials science and specialty products.\n\nAbout the Project\n\nJames M.

Consider 2021 the year its biggest entities face the logistics of that head on.\n\nMajor League Baseball’s decision to yank the July 13 All-Star Game from Atlanta was undeniably political, coming as it did in the wake of Georgia’s adoption of a restrictive and racially unjust voting law.\n\nAnd the decision on where the game goes now will be all the more politically loaded – though that doesn’t mean it is without opportunity.\n\nJust as the decision to move the game was done, as commissioner Rob Manfred noted, after conversations with current and former players, franchises and the burgeoning Players’ Alliance, so, too, should a decision on the new site.\n\nMLB 2021:Champion Dodgers have MLB's highest payroll\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\nLINDOR:Mets' new superstar embraces the spotlight\n\nMLB’s partnership with the Players’ Alliance was perhaps its most notable action during a year the league was initially caught flat-footed by nationwide protests over the police killing of George Floyd. While still not the “social institution” former commissioner Bud Selig hoped to be, the league was supportive in efforts by Black players to sit out a game after the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\nThe emergence of the Players’ Alliance kept Black voices in the game even if they’re no longer on the field, a crucial coalition at a time African-American players comprise just 8% of active players. In September, MLB and the MLB Players’ Association donated $10 million to the Players’ Alliance to further Black representation in baseball; MLB added another $1 million donation of equipment and supplies to help fuel the Alliance’s winter tour of disadvantaged neighborhoods as the COVID-19 pandemic surged.\n\nThat spirit of collaboration will hopefully prevail in making a thoughtful decision for All-Star Game 2021, Take II. A few suggestions:\n\nMilwaukee\n\nIn a year meant to honor Hank Aaron, who passed away in January, the only place potentially on par with Atlanta is Aaron’s first and last baseball home, where he played 12 seasons before the Braves departed for Atlanta, and two final seasons with Selig’s Brewers.\n\nAnd Wisconsin will for the foreseeable future be a crucial state politically, where bad-faith political actors may always seek to curb voting rights and poll access.\n\nIt may seem folly to move a jewel event due to voter suppression and place it in a state where a handful of state lawmakers have circulated at least 10 bills that aim to make voting more difficult. At the same time, placing the game there now could appropriately amplify these issues, particularly if players are given a platform to discuss them.\n\nMinneapolis\n\nThere are no bonus points for being the first entity to release a heavily-workshopped statement on a sensitive topic. Yet for what it’s worth, in the grim hours and days after Floyd’s death, it was the Twins who weighed in first on the killing, two days before any other club and six days before the league itself did the same. They were also one of just 12 teams who dared mention Floyd by name, the other 18 dancing away from the subject to bathe in the vinaigrette of a word salad.\n\nTwins manager Rocco Baldelli beat his own team to the punch by a day, tweeting that Floyd “should be breathing right now. We have a lot of progress to make. A lot. Remember his name. Remember what happened.”\n\nThose words resonate even more now; nearly a year removed, it’s easy to forget the killing of Floyd in broad daylight was the impetus for so much that changed in the months since.\n\nThe trial of Derek Chauvin has shown how traumatic the killing was for Blacks in the Twin Cities. His conviction won’t ease that trauma, and his acquittal would only open the wounds further. An exhibition baseball game won’t salve those wounds, but it would serve as a reminder to the sport why all those “difficult conversations” have been happening.\n\nChicago\n\nAnd no, we’re not talking about Wrigley Field.\n\nInstead, MLB could look to the South Side, where Guaranteed Rate Field looks a little shinier after renovations and features perhaps the best food selection of any park.\n\nMore significantly, there may not be a better place to focus on MLB’s hopes of growing and diversifying the game.\n\nWith community works a significant part of any All-Star Game, MLB couldn’t do much better than partnering with the Lost Boyz, a group committed to “provide sports-based youth development to help boys and girls in Chicago’s under-resourced neighborhoods develop confidence, resilience, and life skills.”\n\nThose aforementioned bad actors often ask, “What about Chicago?” when gun violence or police brutality are mentioned. It is a disingenuous concern regarding a complex, multi-layered situation. It would be a helpful and powerful gesture for the league and its players to amplify those doing the work on the ground.\n\nAlso, Tim Anderson would make for an excellent game ambassador.\n\nTampa Bay\n\nOK, there’s probably no way this would fly.\n\nYet St. Petersburg’s much-maligned Tropicana Field has never hosted an All-Star Game, and it may never: Efforts by the Rays and political officials on both sides of the bay to produce a new stadium have never gained traction, and the club may be ticketed for relocation by 2027.\n\nIt would be a diss to the area’s rich baseball culture and Rays fans to leave town without the game’s jewel event visiting. Hey, it’s not their fault Tropicana Field is a pain to access and that the region was given a franchise without a longer-term stadium solution in place.\n\nAnd there would be no greater area to highlight the gains baseball must make than St. Pete and nearby Hillsborough County, which produced countless Black stars, Dwight Gooden, Gary Sheffield and Fred McGriff among them. Since, the game at large has seen a huge drop in Black participation. Including past and present area stars, such as the aforementioned trio and New York Mets slugger Pete Alonso, would highlight the ar of Tampa baseball while keeping an eye on the future.\n\nThe game could also provide a platform for veteran Ian Desmond, who has opted out of each of the past two seasons to support youth baseball in nearby Sarasota and better contextualize the events of the past year for himself and his children.\n\nBaltimore\n\nSeems like yesterday the crowd at brand new Camden Yards was shouting down Cito Gaston for failing to bring Mike Mussina into the 1993 Midsummer Classic. Well, the game hasn’t been back to Charm City since, even as four other cities – Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Philadelphia and Cleveland – have received multiple All-Star Games.\n\nMeanwhile, Camden Yards has aged beautifully, but it and Baltimore could use some love. Attendance fell drastically at Oriole Park – from 2.4 million in 2014 to 1.3 million in 2019 – for a variety of factors, from franchise obsolescence to area economic factors, diminishing population and perceptions of security issues after protests in the wake of Freddie Gray’s death in police custody in 2015.\n\nNow, the Orioles are batting away queries that they may move, which team ownership insists won’t happen.\n\nThe Orioles have chosen their current path of Lose A Lot before hopefully Winning Big, but that’s not the only reason attendance has ebbed. An All-Star Game can provide a jolt of interest the local team cannot, while also sprinkling the additional benefits of the game into a community disproportionately impacted by any calamitous event – be it COVID-19, economic woes or injustices of the sort the league has hoped to fight in the past year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/2023/02/06/super-bowl-2023-events-entertainment-live-coverage-arizona/69870303007/", "title": "Super Bowl 2023 comes to dramatic end after Rihanna, celeb ...", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nArizona felt a little like the center of the universe as professional athletes, celebrities and football fans converged on metro Phoenix for the 2023 Super Bowl at State Farm Stadium.\n\nAn array of star-studded Super Bowl-themed events took place in the lead-up to the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs' showdown in Glendale. That's not to mention Rihanna's halftime show or the pregame performances from Chris Stapleton, Babyface and Sheryl Lee Ralph.\n\nHere's a recap of celebrity sightings, fan events, autograph signings, concerts, parties — all the biggest moments before, and during, the big game.\n\nSuper Bowl in Arizona 2023: Updates on traffic, weather, restrictions\n\nTravis Kelce is ready to party after the trophy ceremony\n\nWell done, whoever plays music over the public-address system at State Farm Stadium.\n\nLiterally.\n\nDuring the trophy ceremony immediately following the thrilling game, in which the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35 with a field goal in the final seconds, Travis Kelce did what he does from the on-field stage: Screamed, \"You gotta fight! For your right!\"\n\nAnd then he let the Chiefs fans finish, \"TO PARRRRRRTTTTY!\"\n\nWhich they did, screaming with delight. And immediately the stadium speakers blasted \"Fight for Your Right\" by the Beastie Boys.\n\nRock on.\n\nSuper Bowl 57 comes to a dramatic end\n\nThe tension inside State Farm Stadium was incredible — as was the noise.\n\nNo surprise, since these are two of the loudest fan bases in the NFL.

Some posts were more tactful than others.\n\nThe NFL shared footage of A$AP Rocky enjoying Rihanna’s performance and some millennials drew parallels between Rihanna’s backup dancers’ outfits and the 2008 Disney film ‘Minutemen.’\n\nA representative for Rihanna confirmed that she is indeed expecting her next child, making her Super Bowl performance possibly the biggest pregnancy reveal ever.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nRihanna reasserts her pop music dominance at her halftime show\n\nWe’ve all been wondering who Rihanna might bring out to join her in the spotlight when she took the world’s biggest stage at State Farm Stadium for the Super Bowl 2023 halftime show and … surprise.\n\nShe got along just fine without a single cameo.\n\nRihanna made her entrance on a floating platform high above the field, rocking a stylish red jumpsuit and matching latex bustier singing “Bitch Better Have My Money,” seamlessly working her way through a dizzying celebration of her catalog that put the focus squarely on her most iconic hits, from “Umbrella” to “Work.”\n\nShe hasn’t toured since late 2016 and this halftime show more than lived up to the promise of a world-class performer reasserting her place in the pop music stratosphere.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nRihanna's Super Bowl 2023 playlist: Here's every song from her halftime show performance\n\nOne fan paid over $30K for her seat.

She and her husband Bill bought the tickets before the AFC Championship, in which the Chiefs beat Cincinnati.\n\n“We were just hoping the Bengals would be here so we planned ahead,” Foster said. “We were putting out good vibes.”\n\nThey were also putting out good money — Foster wouldn’t come clean on exactly how much they spent, but she hinted at it — “30-ish,” she said.\n\nAs in $30,000?\n\n“Plus some.”\n\nPlus how much? Foster wasn’t saying.

Hance Park, where the official NFL watch party is underway at the Super Bowl Experience. According to the National Weather Service, the wind is blowing west at more than 20 mph, kicking up dead grass and the few leaves left on the trees.\n\nThat hasn't tamped down the excitement at the park, where it's been difficult — if at all possible — to navigate from one side to the other because the crowd in front of the stage is just that dense.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nAre you ready for Rihanna?\n\nThe Super Bowl has rarely had a more anticipated halftime show.\n\nRihanna, one of the most successful pop sensations of the century, is making her return to live performance for the first time since 2018, when she did the Grammys. It's been even longer since she’s toured.\n\nWe spoke to several members of the team that helped her put this show together and they promised us \"It's nothing like you've ever seen before.” Her music director added, “Trust me, this is my fourth Super Bowl halftime.

Just over a week earlier, she told the crowd at one of her Las Vegas residency shows that she's \"going just for Rihanna.\"\n\nHopefully there will be some cameras pointed her way during the halftime show performance.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nChris Stapleton spared us the all-too-common national anthem showboating\n\nIs Chris Stapleton “only the best voice in the world,” as Babyface suggested at a press conference in downtown Phoenix Thursday morning?\n\nTo be fair, few singers could hope to live up to that level of hype. But Stapleton does have a wonderful voice, as anyone at all familiar with the Grammy-winning country singer’s catalog would surely testify.\n\nAnd he used it to brilliant effect at State Farm Stadium without making it feel like he was out there to impress us with a show of vocal pyrotechnics.\n\nIt was more about the song itself, which as Stapleton said, can go horribly wrong. But this one didn’t.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nReview:Chris Stapleton's deeply soulful Super Bowl national anthem, plus Sheryl Lee Ralph, Babyface\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph delivers a monumental ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph, the Emmy-winning star of “Abbott Elementary,” got the pregame entertainment off to a breathtaking start with her version of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Black national anthem, looking powerful in a flowing, off-the-shoulder red gown and matching gloves.\n\nAt Thursday’s pregame press conference in Phoenix, Ralph said her goal was “to make sure we could have a version for people to understand the great lyrics of this song and what it means.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly how it went, a life-affirming testament to the deep meaning of the lyrics, well served by Ralph’s Broadway experience. If you didn’t understand those lyrics, you weren’t listening. — Ed Masley\n\nHere's what to expect in 2023:How long does the Super Bowl national anthem take?\n\nHow to watch Chris Stapleton sing the national anthem at Super Bowl 2023\n\nCountry superstar Chris Stapleton will sing the national anthem just before Super Bowl 2023 kicks off at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at State Farm Stadium.\n\nHe’ll be joined in the pregame ceremonies by Babyface, who will sing “America the Beautiful,” and Sheryl Lee Ralph, of “Abbot Elementary,” who will sing “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”\n\nEach song will be performed in American Sign Language as well, by Arizona native Troy Kotsur, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for “Coda”; Colin Denny, a member of the Navajo Nation in Arizona; and Justina Miles.\n\nHere’s everything to know about today’s national anthem, including how long it might last.\n\n— Jill Cassidy\n\nSuper Bowl pregame: Sheryl Crow soaks up the sun, suggests new footwear for Patrick Mahomes\n\nSheryl Crow was midway through a hit-filled concert at the On Location tailgate party outside State Farm Stadium when she took a moment to reflect on her footwear — spectacular studded black open-toed clogs with heels that had to be at least 4 inches high.\n\n“All I’m saying,” she said, “is I think Patrick Mahomes should have to run in these shoes.”\n\nThat would definitely be a game changer.\n\nCrow and her band took the stage to a raucous recording of the Rolling Stones’ “Start Me Up” — a bold move, to be sure, and a handy frame of reference for the brand of rock ‘n’ roll that has underscored her finest hours from the start.\n\nAfter setting the tone with “If It Makes You Happy,” Crow proceeded through such classics as “A Change Will Do You Good,” the decidedly Stonesy “My Favorite Mistake” (which always makes me think of “Goats Head Soup”), her stellar cover of Cat Stevens’ “The First Cut Is the Deepest,” “Soak Up the Sun,” her breakthrough single “All I Wanna Do” and “Every Day Is a Winding Road.”\n\n“Can you believe this weather?!” she asked. “It’s supposed to be snowing in Nashville today. I’m just really happy to be here, if nothing else to give myself a killer suntan.”\n\nShe also took a moment to note another cause to celebrate this weekend.\n\n“Yesterday was my birthday,” she said. “I’m 38 again.”\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nThe downtown Phoenix Super Bowl action has moved to Hance Park\n\nThe Super Bowl Experience at Phoenix Convention Center is officially over, and the NFL fans who have swarmed downtown Phoenix for the past week moved north to Margaret T. Hance Park for the free Super Bowl Experience fan event.\n\nThat’s where the NFL’s first ever official Super Bowl watch party is taking place on what officials claimed were the largest LED screens in Arizona. An hour and a half before kickoff, the bar scene near the Convention Center was subdued, with a smattering of patrons at venues such as Majerle’s Sports Grill and Barrel and Bushel.\n\nThe real fans — sorry, not sorry — were at Hance Park, biding their time by completing the QB obstacle course, playing corn hole and enjoying local food and drinks.\n\nThe lines for the bars, craft beer and portable toilets were manageable with an hour to go before kickoff. Visitors were eager to get their hands on some food; lines for the vendors on the north side of Hance Park far surpassed the shorter ones on the south side.\n\nBut the majority of fans were staked out in front of the screens, braving the full sun exposure (my weather app showed it was 76 degrees) as they sat on blankets and folding chairs.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nHance Park dining guide:What to eat and drink at the 2023 Super Bowl Experience\n\nWhat channel is the Super Bowl on?

Then she reportedly removed all her photos with MGK and unfollowed everyone except Harry Styles, Timothée Chalamet and Eminem.\n\nShe has since appeared to have deactivated her Instagram.\n\nOnly time will tell what this development actually means.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nRihanna, Dave Grohl, Paris Hilton:Celebrities spotted in Phoenix for Super Bowl 2023\n\nSibling rivalry at Super Bowl 57\n\nCornell and Darlene Brooks are siblings who may agree on some things, but football isn't one of them. Though the pair are attending Super Bowl 57 at State Farm Stadium together.\n\nCornell, from Chicago, wore a Kansas City Chiefs jersey. Darlene, from coastal Mississippi, wore a Philadelphia Eagles jersey.\n\n“She doesn’t know what she’s doing,” Cornell said of his sister. “She’s starting to get on my nerves.”\n\nFor her part, Darlene responded with an eye roll. Nothing like sibling rivalry.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nA peek inside the swag bags for premium seat ticketholders\n\nAs if great seats weren’t enough, fans sitting in the best seats in State Farm Stadium had a cooler full of snacks waiting for them.\n\nZachary Ginsberg of Scottsdale was one such fan. He was sitting with his father, who got the tickets.\n\n“I’m a plus-one,” Zachary said.\n\nInside the collapsible cooler was a Twix candy bar, almonds, Skittles, Doritos and … condiments.\n\nWhy condiments?\n\n“You can never have enough mustard and ketchup,” Zachary said. Fair enough.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nSuper Bowl announcers walk the field at State Farm Stadium\n\nThe NFL on Fox crew set up on the field just outside the Kansas City Chiefs endzone.

Even the pop-up store in State Farm Stadium. It’s open for Arizona Cardinals games all season long, but Sunday its stock was limited to Frito Lay and Anheuser-Busch. So if you wanted Lay's potato chips or Bud Light, this is the place for you.\n\nOn the other hand, what else do you really need?\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nOh, it’s on: Puppy Bowl is happening now.

By 12:30 p.m., hundreds of people were trudging down the street in a line toward the stadium.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nPlan ahead: Super Bowl travelers should allow extra time when returning rental cars to Sky Harbor Airport\n\nAt least 180,000 passengers were expected at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on the Monday after the Super Bowl. That's about 60,000 more people than an average day.\n\nThousands of those people will be returning cars to the Rental Car Center. If you’re one of them, allow yourself ample time to drop off your car and ride the PHX Sky Train to your terminal. Airport staff recommends Super Bowl travelers allow at least four hours before departure to return car rentals.\n\nThe Rental Car Center is at 1805 E. Sky Harbor Circle South, south of Buckeye Road. It's accessible via exit 149 off Interstate 10. It’s roughly 2 miles from Terminal 3 and Terminal 4.\n\nHere are more tips on how to navigate Sky Harbor Airport after the Super Bowl.\n\n— Michael Salerno\n\nWhat to expect from Rihanna's halftime show, in her own words\n\nIn the event that you’re wondering what to expect from Rihanna when she hits the stage at State Farm Stadium, she shed some light on that in downtown Phoenix on Thursday, promising “a jam-packed show.” Her biggest challenge was \"trying to cram 17 years of work into 13 minutes,\" she said.\n\n\"That was the hardest, hardest part, deciding how to maximize 13 minutes, but also celebrate.

Been a long time since I’ve been home….”\n\nThe answers range from the genuinely helpful — Coach House in Scottsdale comes up, which is an excellent choice, as is Arizona Wilderness — to the funny.\n\n“There are no bars in Scottsdale,” one person responded. “It’s a dry county now.

No one ever broke any substantial news at an event like this, but it’s still fun.\n\nFor Burkhardt and Olsen, seated on a stage, reporters and camera crews waited in line for a brief audience, kind of like what you’d see at a wedding reception.

Businesses are relocating here. Top Chef launched its latest season in the city, complete with footage of the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Hoan Bridge and other landmarks. And while Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much these days, they both decided to hold their conventions in Milwaukee in recent years – or at least try to.\n\nWe wanted to celebrate our great city by honoring some of the things we love about it. The trouble is, there’s so much to love about Milwaukee that it was tough to decide which objects to highlight. (We settled on 100 objects; a push to do 414 was quickly shot down by editors.)\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nWe also know Milwaukee isn’t perfect and has long faced deep problems like racism, segregation and inequality. So we also wanted to focus on the struggle for a better future by including key locations in the city, such as the 16th Street Viaduct, in an effort to honor the fair housing marches of the 1960s.\n\nNext time somebody starts trashing Milwaukee, please tell them the city’s brightest days are still ahead. And maybe send them this list of 100 objects as a reminder that Milwaukee is indeed “the good land” full of promise – and some pretty great things.\n\n—Mary Spicuzza\n\n100 objects that make Milwaukee\n\nArchitecture\n\nCulture\n\nEntertainment\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood & drink\n\nHistory\n\nSports\n\nHow did we come up with these 100 objects? Here's an explanation.\n\nWhat did we miss? What doesn’t belong? Let us know here: bit.ly/MKE100More.\n\nThe Polish immigrants who poured into Milwaukee in the late 19th century wanted a beautiful church that telegraphed their strong Catholic faith and ethnic heritage. And they were willing to do anything for it.\n\nThey mortgaged their homes to raise money. They volunteered their labor. Fr. Wilhelm Grutza, the blacksmith-turned-pastor, shipped 500 rail cars of salvaged materials from a shuttered Chicago post office. He died five weeks after the church's dedication in 1901, exhausted from overwork.\n\nIn a city dotted with steeples and infused with Catholic tradition, the Basilica of St. Josaphat stood out. Modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, its 220-foot-high copper dome was only second in size to the U.S. Capitol at the time.\n\nToday, 123 years later, the ornate basilica is still larger-than-life. It’s a tourist destination as well as a hallowed space. The faithful who gather understand they’re among tens of thousands who have knelt in the pews for prayer, and heard the acoustics echo, and craned their necks to take in the intricately decorated cupola.\n\nIt’s Milwaukee’s largest church. It’s always been an anchor of the south side. But its dome – first illuminated at night in 2019 – cemented the basilica’s place in Milwaukee’s skyline for years to come.\n\nEven as church attendance and religious belief decline, the dome is a reminder of Catholics’ indelible impact on the city.\n\nIt calls to drivers passing on Interstate 43: I’ve been here over a century, and I’m here to stay.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nMilwaukee has a contentious history with public art (Google “Blue Shirt” if you need a reminder). Ensconced in O’Donnell Park at the lakefront, Mark di Suvero’s steel-beam sculpture “The Calling” has survived several rounds of controversy with the staying power of the sun that it abstractly mimics.\n\nFunded by an anonymous donor, it is made of steel I-beams painted orange and stands 40 feet tall. After 11 argumentative public hearings and much political grandstanding, the Common Council approved the artwork, which was dedicated in April 1982.\n\n“Di Suvero certainly was aware that many people would see his work from great distances and from the windows of rushing cars, buses and trucks,” Milwaukee Sentinel art critic Dean Jensen wrote in 1982. “Through its great size, its garish color and the grammar of its simple forms, it asserts its essence quickly and directly.”\n\n“The Calling” enjoyed a bonus kerfuffle in 2001 when architect Santiago Calatrava’s gleaming white addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum opened. Killjoys wanted the di Suvero away from the Calatrava sightline. The artist responded bluntly: “If you don’t want it, take it apart and ship it to me.”\n\nAs for the architect, he told Journal critic Whitney Gould that he designed the MAM addition with “The Calling” in mind. And if you stand along Wisconsin Avenue in the right spots, you’ll see that “The Calling” and the Calatrava addition line up perfectly.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of spring, when warmer weather finally thaws the winter roads. It’s the sound of the wind blowing across your face and through your hair. It’s the sound of speed, freedom, the open road. It’s the sound of summer, long rides cross-country or a short trip to the beach.\n\nIt’s the sound of friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson’s turn-of-the-20th-century ingenuity that grew from tinkering in a backyard shed to the construction of a two-wheeled, motor-powered bike and the desire to make it go fast, then faster. It’s the sound of a business born in 1903 and raised in Milwaukee, then taking off to become an internationally known brand. It’s the sound linked to leather, and the smell of gasoline. It’s the sound of putting the pedal to the metal.\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of a Harley.\n\n-Jessica Van Egeren\n\nJune 19, 1865, is the most crucial day in African American history. On that day, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared that the Civil War was over and all 250,000 enslaved people in the state — the last remaining slaves in the South — were now free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 1997, a flag was designed to commemorate Juneteenth and was later revised.\n\nThe flag features red, white, and blue colors — from the American flag — with a white bursting star of freedom in the middle. An arc runs through the flag’s center to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for African Americans. The blue is above the red because the red represents the ground soaked with blood from all those who came before us and fought for freedom.\n\nMilwaukee’s annual Juneteenth celebration is one of the country’s oldest — the city was one of the first in the northern states to began officially celebrating Juneteenth, in 1971.\n\nJuneteenth and its flag are significant for me as an African American. My grandparents, who lived in Mississippi, referred to it as “Jubilee Day,” and they celebrated it by enjoying strawberry soda and red velvet cake that symbolized the blood shed by enslaved West African ancestors.\n\nThis flag should be flown on Juneteenth and every day in our country.\n\n-James E. Causey\n\nIf you live anywhere in the Milwaukee area, you’ve almost definitely seen an Oak Leaf Trail sign. The over 135-mile multi-use trail traverses throughout Milwaukee County and is beloved by cyclists, runners, walkers, birders, skateboarders, rollerbladers and more. It’s a mainstay in numerous local running races throughout the year.\n\nThe Oak Leaf can take you pretty much anywhere in Milwaukee and offers beautiful views; nearly a quarter travels along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The trail’s nine branch lines connect users to dozens of county parks, beer gardens and attractions in the area.\n\nThe Oak Leaf also intersects with various other municipal trails, allowing for travel beyond the county. The northern terminus connects to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which users can take all the way to Sheboygan County.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine the Oak Leaf without its variety of users today, it was not open for non-cycling use (or given its current name) until 1996. The trail’s origins date back to the late 1930s, when local cycling enthusiasts established an about-65-mile bike route around Milwaukee County.\n\nThree decades later, the trail was officially recognized by the county parks department. In 1976, it was christened the “76 Bike Trail” in honor of the national bicentennial.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nFor more than 150 years, few objects have represented the city of Milwaukee better than a mug of beer – the key component of gemütlichkeit, which Milwaukeeans have pursued since long before prohibition.\n\nBeer steins clutched in the hands of dozens of strangers crowded together at long wooden tables under tree canopies represents the city’s long devotion to the craft of beer brewing and community, and pays tribute to the city’s sturdy Germanic roots.\n\nGerman immigrants inspired the creation of the city’s breweries and made beer gardens the quintessential gathering spot of Milwaukee. According to the Milwaukee County Parks Department, more than two dozen breweries were in operation by 1856, making way for beer gardens along the Milwaukee River.\n\nProhibition in the 1920s curtailed such gatherings, but the idea has experienced a revival in recent years.\n\nThe city has several permanent beer gardens, including the popular Estabrook Beer Garden along the river greenway in the city’s northeast side, between Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. And the county’s Traveling Beer Garden tours bring the beer garden experience to neighborhood parks around the city throughout the summer.\n\nHere, you can fill your beer stein with Hofbrau, wash down bratwurst or a soft pretzel, and watch your neighbors polka – just like Milwaukeeans did generations before.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nMusic can bring a community together.\n\nWant proof? Just visit Washington Park’s bandshell on a Wednesday evening in the summer.\n\nYou’ll see families and friends spreading out blankets and popping open lawn chairs on the grassy amphitheater.\n\nYou’ll smell barbecue, wood-fired pizza and popcorn wafting from local vendors’ food trucks.\n\nAnd depending on the night, you’ll hear classical, jazz, reggae, opera, folk, rock, punk or a fusion of genres.\n\nThe stunning art deco bandshell is formally known as the Emil Blatz Temple of Music, named for the man who came from a brewing dynasty and donated $100,000 for its construction in the city’s largest park.\n\nAt its dedication in 1938, a crowd of 40,000 – “a mass of mothers, fathers, maidens, swains and wide-eyed children” – heard a performance from the Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra and singer Jessica Dragonette, The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n“If this temple of music gives you as much pleasure as it has given me in donating it, I am fully repaid,” Blatz told those who gathered on the lawn.\n\nIn the 86 years since, the bandshell has hosted musical legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Lily Pons, often as part of its “Music Under the Stars” program, which ran for 55 years.\n\nToday, Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on the tradition, providing a welcoming space for neighbors of all ages to sing, dance and listen.\n\n-Ashley Luthern\n\nWhen it comes to Frank Lloyd Wright, most Wisconsinites think of Taliesin, the architect’s home and workshop in Spring Green, the S.C. Johnson headquarters building in Racine or Monona Terrace in Madison.\n\nBut did you know there’s an entire block on the city’s south side that’s a showcase for Wright’s more modest designs?\n\nThe Burnham Block is a one-of-a-kind collection of six buildings constructed in 1916 as models for affordable housing for working-class people. The collection of single-family homes and duplexes on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street have the typical Wright touches of rich woodwork, tall vertical windows and natural construction materials, but they’re substantially smaller than the homes Wright had previously designed.\n\n“These are Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision to house every person, every American in a beautiful, artistic place to call home,” said Mike Lilek, curator for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block, Inc., the nonprofit that owns five of the six buildings.\n\nThe organization has restored two buildings, which now function as a museum that is open for public tours. Plans are being developed for restoring the home on the northwest corner of South Layton Boulevard and West Burnham Street.\n\nYou can make reservations for a guided tour at wrightinmilwaukee.org.\n\n-Karl Ebert\n\nGreeting visitors by water from the east, the Hoan Bridge is both Milwaukee’s iconic and ironic symbol for the city’s socialist history.\n\nFormer Mayor Daniel Hoan, the city’s longest serving socialist mayor, had much of Milwaukee onboard with his policies, but when the bridge for part of Interstate 794 was erected in his honor, many were dismayed.\n\n“Where transportation was concerned, Dan Hoan was no fan of car culture,” said Phil Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University. “Quite the opposite. He often bitterly complained that cars locked the city into a dynamic of ever-greater spending on ever-widening streets and that greater traffic jeopardized public safety.”\n\nThe public gets an up close and personal view of the Hoan, which opened for traffic in 1977, during the highlight of Milwaukee’s warm months — Summerfest.\n\nIt crosses over the Milwaukee Harbor, welcoming shipping, and connects downtown to Bay View and other parts of southern Milwaukee County. It’s in the foreground of many photographers’ shots of the city skyline, and is lit every night, often to honor an event or person.\n\nCoined the “bridge to nowhere” during construction, the Hoan has very much become part of Milwaukee’s image.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nYou don’t have to be the commissioner of Major League Baseball or owner of the Milwaukee Bucks to eat like them.\n\nAt Jake’s Delicatessen, 1634 W. North Ave., patrons can walk and eat in the shadow of former MLB Commissioner Allan H. “Bud” Selig and late Bucks owner Herb Kohl, who frequented the deli.\n\nJake’s Deli opened in 1955 and catered to the many Jewish families who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Haymarket and Sherman Park neighborhoods. In 1969, Selig bought an ownership stake in the business and held it until Wajeeh Alturkman bought it in 2021.\n\nJake’s has a modest appearance with a vertical street sign that reads “Jake’s.” Those in search of a good sandwich don’t need any further description.\n\nJake’s is known for its corned beef, but it’s the pastrami sandwich that gets people talking. Patrons have a choice to get the rye bread toasted or keep it plain, with yellow or brown mustard and their choice of cheese.\n\nIf they take a seat on the bench by the counter, the meat is cut slowly right in front of them. And a pickle spear is served on the side.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nLike its subject, downtown’s mural of Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is larger than life — covering the three-story back wall of a historic office building at 600-606 E. Wisconsin Ave. It was painted there in spring 2022 by local artist Mauricio Ramirez. The building is owned by Dan Nelson Jr., a Bucks season ticket holder and president and chief executive officer of Nelson Schmidt Inc., a marketing communications agency that operates at the building.\n\nFor Giannis fans, it’s a must-stop photo op, and perhaps Milwaukee’s best-known mural.\n\nHis legacy is still being written, but already includes being named Most Valuable Player in the 2021 NBA championship series and two regular season MVP awards in 2019 and 2020. And it will always include Milwaukee, where we’ve watched him grow from a teenager to a dominant player, an involved father and a noted fan of chicken nuggets.\n\nBucks in six!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nHow do you decide on an iconic symbol to symbolize a place that is so iconic?\n\nI’m speaking of the Milwaukee Public Museum. And, if you’re in a roomful of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, the answer is, not without a fight.\n\nThe museum has been around (in various iterations and locations) since 1851. And it’s become a go-to place for field trips and weekend excursions.\n\nSo this reporter (having been on many such field trips and excursions) suggested the rattlesnake button for MPM’s symbol. Because how could you possibly end a trip to the museum without sitting on the ledge surrounding the bison hunt exhibit, reaching your hand underneath and flicking the switch? The answer is, you cannot.\n\nAnother reporter proposed the T-Rex, which for decades has been famously munching on the remains of his fallen prey in the museum’s strikingly realistic (and scary) dinosaur diorama.\n\nAfter vigorous debate, we were outvoted by proponents of Granny, who calmly rocks in her chair on the porch of her house in the Streets of Old Milwaukee. Granted, she does live in possibly the most popular exhibit ever at the museum. And (especially impressive for someone her age), she has her own social media accounts. So who is this reporter to argue?\n\nBut MPM apparently agrees the rattlesnake button and T-Rex are iconic since they’ll be making the trek to the new museum, slated to open in 2027. Granny will be there, too.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nMost will agree that a trip (or two or several) to the Milwaukee County Zoo is necessary if you want to call yourself a true Milwaukeean.\n\nAnd many Milwaukee children (or grownups waxing nostalgic about their childhoods) will agree that a trip to the zoo is not complete without a ride on the train and a Mold-a-Rama souvenir of their favorite animal. This is universal.\n\nLess universal is choosing your favorite zoo animal. Milwaukee has had some famous ones over the years, from Gordy the groundhog to Chandar the Bengal tiger to Onassis the geriatric Giant South American River turtle.\n\nPerhaps the most famous is an animal that members of the Millennial generation and afterward never even met. But he lives in the memories of middle-age and older Milwaukeeans.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Public Library, Samson the gorilla arrived as a baby in Milwaukee in 1950 (back when the zoo was located in Washington Park). He moved to the zoo’s current location in 1959, and would for years grab the attention of delighted, fascinated and (sometimes) terrified zoo visitors when he pounded on the glass of his enclosure.\n\nSamson died of a heart attack in 1981, but Milwaukeeans can pay homage to him with a visit to the Milwaukee Public Museum, where there is a lifelike re-creation of the famous gorilla.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nIf you’ve never lived outside Milwaukee, you may be wondering why a clearly universal celebration like St. Nick’s Day — that perfectly timed mini-holiday to tide you over till Christmas with a few little treats in your stocking or shoes — is being honored in a dedication to Milwaukee things.\n\nBut Milwaukee is one of relatively few places that have been lucky enough to hold on to the tradition, along with other cities with large German or Dutch influence, such as Cincinnati; Holland, Michigan; and St. Louis.\n\nThe feast of 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas is celebrated Dec. 6. Traditionally, St. Nick is thought to go from house to house on the night of Dec. 5, leaving treats in the shoes of children.\n\nIn most places, St. Nick has become synonymous with Santa Claus, and everybody knows he brings treats and gifts just once a year — on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor kids new to the city (and their parents), now you know: Milwaukee kids get two mornings in December to wake up to find gifts.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nThe Milwaukee County War Memorial is one of the most recognizable buildings on the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nSituated just north of the Milwaukee Art Museum, the War Memorial overlooks the lake from the east side of downtown on East Mason Street, and its plaza is a popular spot for gathering to see lakefront fireworks.\n\nIts mission comes down to six words: “Honor the Dead. Serve the Living.”\n\nThe building was dedicated on Veterans Day 1957, the work of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, according to the War Memorial’s website.\n\nThe building’s design was “influenced by the abstract geometry of modern French architect Le Corbusier,” according to the Milwaukee Art Museum website.\n\nThe building is not only a memorial but a “hub for veteran activities,” the War Memorial website states.\n\nAn eternal flame memorial sits in a small pool, illuminating a black granite honor roll that includes names of Milwaukee County residents who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nOn your way to a fancy night out in the Third Ward, take the right path and you’ll come across a permanent trio of massive ladybugs that look like they could be headed the same direction as you.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how massive they are, exactly: They’re perched way up on the side of the Milwaukee Building on North Water Street.\n\nAt least, it’s a hard calculation looking up at them from the sidewalk or from a car whizzing by.\n\nThe fiberglass bugs are each about 6 feet long and 3 feet deep and have been hanging there since July 1999.\n\nThey were thought up by John J. Burke to decorate the building that houses the company he started, Burke Properties, according to his obituary.\n\nNot much has been written about them, which is a testament to how many interesting things Milwaukee offers — we take even giant beetles for granted.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nThe most quintessentially Milwaukee treat, especially on a hot summer day. (But, let’s be honest: We Midwesterners enjoy a cold cone even when it’s below zero.)\n\nFrozen custard is a step up from your average ice cream because it includes egg yolks that make for a richer texture.\n\nTravel Wisconsin lists Milwaukee as the unofficial “frozen custard capital of the world,” a kind way of saying no visitor should leave the city without trying frozen custard from at least one, if not multiple, locations.\n\nMight we suggest a formal custard tasting?\n\nThree places to start: Gilles, Leon’s and Kopp’s. Each serves a couple of basic flavors every day, plus a Flavor of the Day that’s often more unique.\n\nGilles Frozen Custard opened in 1938, making it the oldest operating stand in the city, according to Travel Wisconsin. Find it at 7515 W. Bluemound Road, and don’t be shy about taking a look at the full menu of non-frozen treats.\n\nLeon’s Frozen Custard popped up just a few years later, in 1942, and is still operated by the original family, according to its website. The year-round business at 3131 S. 27th St. bills itself as a “classic 1950s-style family owned drive-in, specializing in frozen custard.”\n\nKopp’s Frozen Custard: Come for dessert, stay for dinner. With locations in Glendale, Brookfield and Greenfield, you’re never too far from the custard shop that’s also known for its massive burgers.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nYou might know it from the 1970s and 80s sitcom Laverne & Shirley, in which “Welcome Milwaukee visitors” is displayed in all-caps across the bell tower in the opening credits.Or, you might just be familiar from passing the iconic building that sits on a triangular slice of land with its north end at the intersection of East Kilbourn Avenue and North Water Street.\n\nThe Flemish Renaissance-inspired structure in the heart of downtown Milwaukee was completed in 1895, becoming a fixture of the city’s skyline. It cost about $1 million to construct, according to the city.\n\nIts atrium in the building’s center rises eight stories and serves as the site of city functions and news conferences by officials and those challenging their actions.\n\nOn the floors that ascend from the atrium are various city offices, including the Mayor’s Office and the Common Council Chambers where the 15-member council conducts its public meetings. Others include the Assessor’s Office and City Attorney’s Offices.\n\nFrom the base of the bell tower to the top of the flagpole, the building ascends 393 feet in the air. For a few years after City Hall opened in 1895, it was one of the tallest habitable buildings – if not the tallest – in the nation and world.\n\nThe tower holds the bell known as “Solomon Juneau” after Milwaukee’s first mayor, according to the city. The bell was made from church and firehouse bells from around the city and first rang on New Year’s Eve 1896.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nIn the heart of Marquette University’s bustling campus, a medieval remnant offers respite for the soul.\n\nJoan of Arc Chapel began its life as a place of worship circa 1420 in the village of Chasse, southeast of Lyon, France. Named then after St. Martin de Seysseul, it served the people of Chasse-sur-Rhône for hundreds of years before falling into disrepair.\n\nJoan of Arc, the legendary warrior and patron saint of France, is said to have prayed at the chapel in 1429. That was part of its attraction to Gertrude Hill Gavin, who bought it in 1927 and had it moved to her estate in Long Island, N.Y.\n\nMarc Rotjman, a former president of Racine’s J.I. Case Co., and his wife, Lillian, bought the chapel in 1962 and later donated it to Marquette. Over nine months, its 30 tons of stone and 18,000 terracotta roof tiles were carefully disassembled, labeled and shipped to Milwaukee. The reassembled and renamed chapel opened here in 1966. Its nave was lengthened to allow seating up to 60 people; radiant floor heating and electricity were also added.\n\nThe Gothic chapel is a striking landmark amid so many buildings centuries younger. But it continues to be an active worship site, with as many as seven Masses a week when classes are in session, including a Sunday afternoon liturgy in Spanish.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nFor many people, just balancing on ice skates is hard ... now imagine maintaining control while skating at 30 miles per hour and racing fellow skaters. That’s the sport of speedskating.\n\nMilwaukee is home to one of the top speedskating facilities in the world: the Pettit National Ice Center. The Pettit is one of only two 400-meter indoor speedskating ovals in the country and is an official U.S. Speedskating training facility. It opened in 1992 and replaced the outdoor Wisconsin Olympic Ice Rink, which occupied the site from 1967 to 1991.\n\nAll of the U.S. speedskaters to compete in the past six Winter Olympics have raced or trained at the Pettit Center. The facility has hosted the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Trials and other elite competitions. Over the years, the Pettit has been the home training facility of numerous speedskating greats, including five-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, 1994 gold medalist Dan Jansen and four-time Olympic medalist Shani Davis.\n\nThe Pettit also boasts two international-size hockey rinks and a 443-meter walking and running track. It is the home of multiple local hockey and skating clubs and offers figure skating, speedskating and hockey lessons for children and adults.\n\nThe track is a popular winter training spot for high school, college and adult runners. It hosts track practices, meets and even a 95-lap indoor marathon.\n\nBut, if you’re looking for something a little less athletically intense, the Pettit also has ample public skate hours with skate rentals ... perfect for date night or a fun family activity.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nPecan fingers, snickerdoodles, butterscotch bars and more.\n\nWisconsin residents have been making Christmas treats published in the annual We Energies Cookie Book for nearly a hundred years.\n\nEvery year, the company compiles recipes submitted by residents in a book celebrating themes like military service and hometown favorites.\n\nPicking up a copy of the book has become a Christmas tradition in many Wisconsin households. Some longtime Wisconsinites collect copies for years, passing them down through generations.\n\nThe We Energies Cookie Book was introduced in 1928, back when the company was known as the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.\n\nThe book was sent to customers to promote the company’s appliances. Through the 1930s, the book grew in popularity and was distributed at the Public Service Building in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nThe book has gone through temporary changes over the years. During World War II, the 1942 edition had 14 recipes for wartime cookies, featuring cookie low in shortening and sugar to accommodate for rationing ingredients during the war.\n\nAfter the 1973 book, the company stopped publishing the book until 1984 due to rising energy costs. The book was published in 1991, 1998, 2002 and restored to its annual printing tradition in 2006. You can find each cookie book digitally archived at we-energies.com/recipes/archive.\n\n-Alex Groth\n\nIf you’ve dined at a Wisconsin supper club or visited a traditional cocktail lounge, chances are you’ve heard of (or enjoyed) the Pink Squirrel. In the family of ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, the Pink Squirrel has a special Milwaukee connection: it was, as far as anyone can tell, invented at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, 1579 S. 9th St., in the 1940s.\n\nWith just three ingredients — vanilla ice cream, creme de cacao (chocolate liqueur) and creme de noyaux (almond-flavored liqueur) — the Pink Squirrel is a sweet, nutty, creamy way to drink your dessert.\n\nBoth the rosy hue and nutty flavor can be attributed to the creme de noyaux, a liqueur made from apricot, peach or cherry kernels and originally colored with cochineal.\n\nAs the story goes, Bryant and Edna Sharp opened Bryant’s as a Miller Brewing tied house in 1936. Within a few years, Bryant abandoned the beer hall approach and transformed the business into the first cocktail lounge in Milwaukee and, quite likely, Wisconsin.\n\n“People who knew him described him as quiet and serious, with a talent and passion for mixology,” a history of the bar says of Bryant Sharp. “He also was known for putting together unique flavors, which he sold to cordial companies.”\n\nIt’s only fitting that this classic ice cream cocktail can trace its roots to one of the Dairy State’s favorite drinking establishments.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nSince 1994, drivers traveling north on I-43 have seen the giant eagle and only slightly smaller dove on the wall of a National Avenue building. Back then, Esperanza Unida director Richard Oulahan commissioned artist Reynaldo Hernandez to create a mural to reflect the heritage and aspirations of the south-side community. “The Mural of Peace,” about 80 feet by 150 feet, shows both birds with an olive branch, with a bolt of lightning between them and a background of colored stripes representing flags of different lands.\n\nThe mural is painted not on the building’s cream city brick, but on nearly 300 panels affixed to it. After a few years, weather damaged some panels. Contributors to a fund drive to restore the mural included Tippecanoe Elementary students, who raised more than $566 in a penny drive.\n\nThe Walker’s Point building at 611 W. National Ave. is now the Mercantile Lofts Apartments. During its conversion to living spaces, modifications were made that created windows on that wall for inhabitants but still kept the bold colors of Hernandez’s design visible.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nThe Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, located on South 2nd Street and just north of Greenfield Avenue, has been a staple of Milwaukee’s skyline and for decades was the largest four-sided clock tower in the world.\n\nSitting atop what is now Rockwell Automation, the 283-foot-tall clock was revealed on Halloween 1962. The clockworks were built by the Allen-Bradley company, which specialized in electrical controls.\n\nThe tower is four separate clocks running on individual motors. About once a month its gears require greasing, but it’s lit by LED bulbs that rarely need to be replaced.\n\nTwice a year everyone moves their clocks forward or back an hour, usually by pushing a button. Changing the Allen-Bradley clock requires a security guard on the outside with a radio looking up at each face while someone with a special key turns four switches inside a room on the first floor.\n\nIn its early years it was referred to as the “Polish moon” because of the bright display in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. But over time more Mexican immigrants and families moved to the south side and the nickname was changed to the “Mexican moon” to recognize how the neighborhood has changed.\n\nThe clock also illuminated the fight against discrimination in labor in 1968, when the Latino and Black communities joined efforts to fight discriminatory hiring practices at the Allen-Bradley Company.\n\nThe protest was started by Father James E. Groppi. Younger Latino residents took up the cause and more activism against the company continued for another year. The march on Allen-Bradley is considered a success, given the consciousness it created and the progress Latinos in Milwaukee have made in the half-century since.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nFirst things first: The correct pronunciation is poonch-ka, says Joe Parajecki, a chef at the Polish Center in Franklin.\n\nAnd yes, they are similar to jelly-filled donuts, but they’re much richer. Ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs and yeast are put into the dough before giving them up for Lent.\n\nPaczki is traditionally eaten on Fat Tuesday in Milwaukee, though in Poland, it’s actually celebrated on the Thursday before Lent.\n\n“You can’t believe the lines in Poland to get paczki on Fat Thursday. People eat a dozen or more each,” Parajecki said.\n\nMilwaukee is one of the “capital cities of Polish America,” according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Two decades after the city was founded, 30 families organized the first Polish Catholic congregation in urban America.\n\nA traditional paczki is the size of a walnut and doesn’t look like a donut at all, Parajecki said. It’s sweet dough wrapped around a prune or filled with rose jam, which is “a very acquired taste. It’s like eating a jar of perfume.”\n\nPrune and raspberry are the most common fillings in America, but there are newer flavors like Nutella and lemon. Parajecki is amazed by how many people who celebrate paczki, even those who aren’t Polish.\n\nHe doesn’t care about the paczki vs. donut discussion — more important is tying it to a memory, like sitting around grandma’s table.\n\n“We’re not eating it to debate those things. We’re eating it to remember, we’re eating it to have a good time.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nYou just got through TSA at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. You’re missing a shoe, toiletries are bursting from your carry-on, and where is that boarding pass again?\n\nA sign past the security checkpoint: Recombobulation Area. An invitation and a space to put your things back in order.\n\nIt all started in 2008, when former airport director Barry Bateman told the sign shop he had a great idea.\n\nHe was told “recombobulation” wasn’t an actual word, the airport’s director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said. Bateman knew that.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s try to make this a little bit more fun during this stressful experience. If someone gets a chuckle when they go through the checkpoint, then we’ve done our job.’”\n\nAs far as Mester is aware, Milwaukee is the only airport to use the “recombobulation” phrase. “Recomposure” is the more technical term, but as Mester pointed out, “that’s an actual word.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society once declared “recombobulation” the most creative word of the year. And the term has inspired other branding efforts in Milwaukee, from billboards to beer.\n\nIt’s also the namesake of a blog by Dan Shafer. As he put it, recombobulation is the “opposite of discombobulation.” He is often tagged in the many selfies taken in front of the sign.\n\nThe sign represents Milwaukee’s sense of humor about itself, Shafer said.\n\n“It’s just one of those quintessentially Milwaukee types of things. It’s just quirky and weird enough and resonates with people.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nWalk into a Milwaukee supper club or bar on a Friday night and you’ll likely see bartenders lining up rocks glasses and filling each with maraschino cherries, orange slices and a dash of sugar. Next comes a shot of soda water and a muddler. Then, the brandy.\n\nThe Old Fashioned cocktail isn’t supposed to be made with brandy, but like anything in Wisconsin, we’ve taken an idea and made it our own. And boy, do we own it.\n\nDuring an average weekend at the Five O’ Clock Steakhouse on West State Street, bartenders serve more than 100 brandy Old Fashioneds, general manager Hegel Terron told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDuring the week, the daily average probably tops at 75, he said.\n\nAt the Packing House supper club on East Layton Avenue, general manager Chris Wiken said he’s ordering two cases of Korbel brandy per week.\n\nThe vast majority of customers are asking for brandy Old Fashioneds sweet, Wiken said. But in recent years, customers are getting a bit more picky about which brandy they want – ordering Milwaukee’s Central Standard or even comedian Charlie Berens’ spirit.\n\nOn a good Friday night, the Packing House is filling a couple hundred rocks glasses with Wisconsin’s favorite cocktail. In a year’s time, that’s tens of thousands, Wiken said.\n\n“I cannot keep Korbel on hand. It just flies out the door,” he said. “Friday night is probably when we sell the most because the pairing with the fish fry is a really good pairing.”\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, there are a few ways to give yourself away. First: Order a bourbon Old Fashioned instead of brandy sweet. Second: Wear a Cardinals hat. Third: Ask for directions to the nearest water fountain.\n\nInexplicably, public water fountains here are called bubblers and pretty much only here. There are some in Rhode Island, for some reason, but the vast, vast majority of the nation adopted “drinking fountains” and “water fountains.”\n\nMilwaukee appears to be ground zero for the use of bubbler, according to UW-Madison’s Dictionary of American Regional English. Its origins are fuzzy but may be tied to its use by Kohler Co., one of Wisconsin’s most famous brands – a manufacturer of faucets among other water-related products.\n\nThe company in 1914 promoted a water fountain created by Kohler as being fitted with a “continuous flow bubbler,” according to the UW-Madison dictionary.\n\nA former dictionary editor in 2015 told Wisconsin Public Radio that “bubbler” was used especially in the southeastern area of the state starting in the mid 1910s. More than a century later, we’re still using bubblers.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nSundays in Milwaukee have a smell: buttery, fresh-baked rolls.\n\nAfter church, it’s tradition to pick up what’s known as hot ham and rolls – an end-of-weekend feast with origins in the cream city’s German or Polish roots, depending on which bakery owner you speak to.\n\nFor less than $30 at Grebe Bakery, for example, you can get three pounds of ham, 18 rolls and two pounds of potato salad.\n\nThe meal is part of Milwaukee’s identity, so much so that former Gov. Scott Walker made it part of his politico persona along with other attributes Walker promoted to assure voters he was as Wisconsin as they were.\n\nHe tweeted nearly 20 times about procuring hot ham and rolls from now-shuttered Fattoni’s deli after church in Wauwatosa during his first term as governor.\n\nBrian Schwellinger, president of Badger Ham, which provides the hams for many bakeries’ meal deals, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2021 the hot ham and rolls tradition is likely rooted in religion.\n\n“There were so many churches that the church tradition was a strong part of the community, and after service is when you had your first meal of the day,” Schwellinger said.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nThe Great Lakes may seem like an limitless resource, but the world’s largest surface freshwater system faces major threats from pollution, climate change, invasive species and overexploitation.\n\nAnd to understand and protect it, scientists need to be out on the water.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences has made its mark on Great Lakes research. It’s the only graduate school of freshwater sciences in the country and one of only three in the world.\n\nUW-Milwaukee’s main research vessel, the Neeskay, is the only research vessel out on the lakes year-round.\n\nBefore the Neeskay started powering scientific expeditions in 1970, it was an Army T-boat used during the Korean War. Its name comes from the Ho-Chunk word for “pure, clean water.”\n\nScientists use the Neeskay to study algae blooms, invasive quagga and zebra mussels, and microbes that live out in the lakes. It’s also used to deploy buoys that monitor weather and lake characteristics, like temperature and nutrients.\n\nBut the Neeskay, along with a fleet of small boats, are only just the start. The university has been raising money since 2016 to build the Maggi Sue, which will become the most technologically advanced freshwater research ship in the country.\n\nThe Maggi Sue is expected to open many doors in understanding what’s going on out in the Great Lakes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe Bucks’ mascot has delighted crowds with dunks and stunts, from the Milwaukee Arena to the Bradley Center to Fiserv Forum, for almost 50 years.\n\nBango made his debut in the team’s 1977-78 home opener — which pitted the Bucks against the Los Angeles Lakers two years after NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for L.A.\n\nNamed for the call the team’s original radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, made when players made a long-range basket, Bango was the moniker chosen by fans in a contest.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s gone through several makeovers and celebrated many milestones.\n\nIn 1984, he got his first car (it’s unclear whether he was old enough to drive; we’re not sure how deer aging equates here). He got married in 2002, and welcomed Bango Jr. in 2005. Two years later, Bango and Bango Jr. first appeared in their inflatable forms. 2010 was a big year for Bango: he nailed a few new dunks and was honored as the NBA Mascot of the Year.\n\nThe next few years brought more cervid celebrations: Cartoon Network’s “Most Awesome Mascot,” a human hamster ball dunk and a featured role on the Hulu “Behind the Mask” documentary. There were also a few mishaps along the way — a torn ACL and a broken rim during a Badgers halftime show.\n\nWhether he’s wearing a sweater or a full uniform with the number 68 (for the team’s first season), doing acrobatics on the court or making appearances in the community, Bango is Milwaukee’s most dominant deer.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nOne call, that’s all.\n\nIt’s not a particularly unusual slogan. Milwaukee isn’t home to the only law firm that has used it. But say those words around Milwaukee, and you’ll get immediate recognition, and probably a smile. Is it weird that simply saying the slogan or name of a personal injury lawyer, albeit a locally famous one, can cultivate ... joy?\n\nDavid Gruber, the lawyer in question, has been using the slogan in TV advertisements since the late 1990s, born from a collaboration with a Dallas media company.\n\nHe looks into the camera and punctuates every ad with those famous four words, a catchphrase that has become the dictum around which his entire brand has been constructed.\n\nThe celebrity lawyer can be found in the first few rows of Milwaukee sporting events and has partnered with just about every major sports operation in the city, a nod to his lengthy interest in athletics.\n\nAnd it’s not hard to score a “Gruber Law Office” T-shirt at a sporting event or at street fairs around the city, the perfect giveaway to spread the Gruber gospel and let everyone around you know how Milwaukee you are.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIn Milwaukee, the herald of winter’s thaw is not that growing patch of green on a lawn or the first magnolia blossom peeling open or that last crusty pile of parking lot snow.\n\nNo: It’s the first aroma of match meeting propane, that sizzle of cold meat on hot grates, the collective tower of smoke rising above the interchange at American Family Field.\n\nIt’s spring. It’s grilling season.\n\nYou don’t have to be the one grilling to enjoy its benefits. The first sunny day in March when it’s light past 5 p.m. — that’s when it happens. The first smells of a neighbor lighting charcoal and laying down some hamburger patties.\n\n“Someone’s grilling,” you say, and you smile.\n\nGrill smells permeate the air in Milwaukee from spring to fall. On a summer day, you can drive around with the windows down and you know when the neighbors are gathering. You can be sure there’s a cold beer in a koozy and the charcoal is heating up.\n\nAnd then there’s the tailgate, that communal grilling session. Many urban ballparks have parking garages or no parking at all, thus no opportunity to truly enjoy the baseball experience. But the tailgate endures in Milwaukee. On a sunny day (or rainy or snowy, we’re hardy people), the American Family Field parking lots are packed with canopies, games of corn hole and folding chairs all huddled around one thing: the grill.\n\n-Lainey Seyler\n\nAre you a “call an ace” player or a “picker and jack of diamond” player when you sit down at the sheepshead table? And if you don’t know what those phrases mean, you probably aren’t familiar with “leaster,” “re-crack” or “schmear.” To know the card game is to speak a certain kind of Milwaukee dialect.\n\nThe trick-taking game often features five players but has its share of variants, with different rules and terminology for different parts of the state. But this isn’t a pastime that’s achieved a high level of popularity outside the state’s borders.\n\nLike Milwaukee, sheepshead’s roots are deeply German — the game is Schakopf in its native country, and the unofficial history involves disgruntled peasants inventing the game that gave kings a lower ranking. Sheepshead arrived in Milwaukee with a large population of German immigrants, many of whom worked in brewing.\n\nThe card game’s patron saint, Bob Strupp, published “How To Play ‘Winning’ 5 Handed Sheepshead” in 1983. The lifelong Milwaukeean attended Common Council meetings to advocate that the game should be declared Milwaukee’s official card game, a campaign that proved successful.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Glendale has claimed to serve as home to the largest sheepshead tournament in the world; a nurse from Kewaskum won in 2024.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere was a time when Milwaukee had earned the title as “The Bowling Capital of America.”\n\nEvolving from German “kegling,” German-Americans helped raise the game’s popularity in the states, and a city like Milwaukee with a deep German heritage was quick to adopt. But as nationwide popularity fell, Milwaukee’s bowling culture wasn’t ... well, uh, spared.\n\nThe United States Bowling Congress, which once called Greendale home, moved to Texas in 2008. The PBA Tour, once sponsored by Miller Brewing, stopped making the city a regular tour stop after 1990, bowling centers closed and WTMJ’s wildly popular “Bowling With the Champs” TV series, which made local celebrities out of top bowlers and served as a precursor to reality competition television, ended after 41 years in 1995.\n\nBut bowling’s history remains visible around the city and state. Milwaukee tavern The Holler House houses the oldest sanctioned bowling alley in the United States, and the miniature version of the sport still has a place at legendary Koz’s Mini Bowl, home to “the last duckpin bowling in the U.S.” The Vulcan Corporation in northern Wisconsin became a major manufacturer of bowling pins.\n\nAnd the PBA even returned for a stop in Wauwatosa in 2023.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIt’s the floor that made Milwaukee famous.\n\nDesigned for $27,500 by New York pop artist Robert Indiana — a man with the perfect name to match the flamboyance of the masterpiece — the MECCA floor was a controversial addition in 1977. The Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center (known today as the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, but then abbreviated as the MECCA) served as home to the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette men’s basketball team. Marquette basketball, known for its eclectic uniforms and the fiery personality of recently retired head coach Al McGuire, was the perfect match for the look.\n\nThe floor featured two giant Ms consuming either half of the court, somewhat hidden in the two-toned yellow paint scheme, a red bull’s eye at center court and blue lettering for “MECCA” wrapped twice around the center circle. Dark red for the lanes, dark blue for the sideline and dark green for the perimeter.\n\nThe gaudy floor didn’t quite fit everyone’s aesthetic tastes immediately (including new MU head coach Hank Raymonds), but it was a hit with plenty of fans (and Bucks coach Don Nelson). It became part of the Milwaukee color palette until the Bucks moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks re-created the floor for a “Return to the MECCA” game in 2017, a return to the building that harbored the 1971 NBA champion and 1977 NCAA champion.\n\nIndiana rose to fame because of his “LOVE” sculpture, but the MECCA floor remains a distinctly Milwaukee concept.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere are many places around Milwaukee where you can take a drink of history, including many brewery tours.\n\nBut there is also a non-alcoholic option nestled between Wentworth Avenue and Superior Street in Bay View:\n\nThe Pryor Avenue Iron Well, a source of drinking water since 1882.\n\nOriginally drilled to provide drinking water and fire protection, it’s the last surviving public well in the city, according to the Historical Preservation Committee. The city named it a historic structure in 1987.\n\nWhile the well is just a short walk from Lake Michigan, the water actually comes from an aquifer nearly 120 feet underground.\n\nThe iron-rich water tastes a bit different than city water. The water is clear with a distinct metallic taste. Sometimes there might be a faint smell of sulfur.\n\nElevated levels of strontium, a natural element found in bedrock, were detected in 2015. But according to the EPA, the levels are only an issue for sensitive populations after drinking the water over the course of a lifetime.\n\nOverall the water is safe to drink, according to Milwaukee Water Works and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn fact, the well was a lifeline for many during the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak that ravaged the municipal water supply.\n\nSo fill a jug or take a sip from the bubbler. Just ignore the penny-like metallic notes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe drive along the Hoan Bridge offers some of the best views of the Milwaukee skyline and Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd if the wind blows in the right direction, it’s also where you can get a good whiff of Milwaukee’s signature funky scent.\n\nNo, Eau de Milwaukee isn’t hops, brats or cheese curds. It’s Milorganite, a lawn and garden fertilizer made from our very own wastewater.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District started making Milorganite – named after Milwaukee organic nitrogen – at the city’s sewage treatment plant on Jones Island in 1926.\n\nThe city used a new method to treat wastewater, called the activated sludge method, which mixed microbes with sewage and air to remove 95% of the bacteria from the city’s sewage and 90% of the solids.\n\nAfter wastewater enters the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility, microbes are added that feast on the organic material. When the microbes die they settle to the bottom, leaving clean water above that is returned to Lake Michigan.\n\nWater is squeezed out of the microbes before they are dried and turned into pellets that become the nitrogen-rich fertilizer sold around the country.\n\nTurning this waste into fertilizer has kept 10 billion pounds of waste out of landfills since 1926, according to the sewerage district.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nA mark of Milwaukee’s annual celebration of Bastille Day, the 43-foot Eiffel Tower that appears each year in Cathedral Square Park is a testament to the city’s determination.\n\nThe tower has had to go through several rounds of repairs and reinforcement to keep up its yearly appearances. There have been a few years that an inflatable Eiffel Tower took the real one’s place, but it always returns, as it did in 2023 after a year of repairs.\n\nThe tower was initially built as part of an indoor department store display in the late 1980s, possibly in Minneapolis, according to a 2022 OnMilwaukee report.\n\nThe tower was never supposed to be permanent, and it definitely wasn’t meant to be assembled and disassembled each year for its appearance at the festival. But that won’t stop the tower, nor the organizers of the Bastille Day celebration, who are asking for donations to complete more repairs and restoration.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is far from the only French-themed activity of the weekend. There’s also the Storm the Bastille 5K run and walk, in addition to can-can dancers and plenty of French fare. The celebration is meant to honor the storming of the Bastille, the 19th-century French prison, an event that helped to start the French Revolution.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nGo into about any Milwaukee restaurant, tavern or even the corner bar on a Friday after work, and you’re likely to see diners enjoying fish alongside a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned.\n\nThe crisp crunch of walleye, perch, cod or maybe even bluegill, paired with some type of potato, coleslaw, tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and perhaps a slice of rye bread.\n\nFish fries are actually so popular in Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers declared Feb. 16, 2024, as Friday Fish Fry Day, honoring the history of the meal. According to his proclamation, the fish fry became popular when a large population of Catholic European immigrants settled in Wisconsin in the 1800s and needed something meat-free to eat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nThen, during Prohibition, the meal helped to keep Wisconsin’s breweries and taverns alive, too, further cementing the tradition.\n\nToday, fish fries in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin serve as a weekly opportunity to gather with friends and family at your favorite establishment, catch up and swap stories over a plate of deep-fried fish.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nA piece of Milwaukee’s baseball history, Bernie Brewer’s Chalet was once one of the crowning jewels at County Stadium. Bernie Brewer would slide out of the chalet and into a giant stein of beer after every home run or if the Brewers won the game, setting the stage for celebration.\n\nNow, the chalet is a part of another popular Milwaukee stop: Lakefront Brewery. It’s a stop on the brewery’s tour through the facility, and now it can even be booked for a romantic dinner for two, overlooking the kettles of the brewery.\n\nLakefront Brewery was born in 1987 out of something distinctly Wisconsin: some 55-gallon stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. Jim and Russ Klisch, the founders, sold one barrel of beer to a tavern within rolling distance of the brewery.\n\nLakefront has come a long way. Now housed at 1872 N. Commerce St., the brewery has produced as many as 46,848 barrels in one year (2017) and offers 20 different beers across 30 states, and even some other countries, according to the brewery’s website. The brewery also offers tours for over 80,000 people a year, and was the first to offer beer before, during and after the tour.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, this food item may repulse you – or at least make you do a double take.\n\nBut here in Milwaukee, it’s a delicacy.\n\nWe’re talking about the cannibal sandwich: a base of rye bread topped with fresh raw beef, chopped onion and a little salt and pepper. It’s deeply rooted in the state’s history and still enjoyed today.\n\nVersions of the sandwich also exist in Germany, where it’s called mett or hackepeter. The idea is thought to have been brought over by German immigrants to Wisconsin when they arrived and began to establish cattle farms, giving them easy access to fresh meat.\n\nToday, it’s still a popular tradition served during holidays and family gatherings — though not without a little scrutiny. Eating raw meat, after all, is a health risk. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reminded residents of as much in a 2020 tweet that went viral as those unfamiliar with the sandwich gawked.\n\nBut those who enjoy it are likely to keep paying homage to their heritage. Some Milwaukee delis and butcher shops sell thousands of pounds of high-grade raw beef around the holidays to eager customers.\n\nTasty or mildly terrifying, it’s one of the city’s cultural staples.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nIf you’re looking for a home away from home, look no further than Mr. Perkins Family Restaurant.\n\nWhile the fried chicken and collard greens are rave-worthy, the real showstopper at this 55-year-old establishment is the customer service.\n\nWhen the restaurant, located on the corner of West Atkinson Avenue and North 20th Street, opened in 1969, owners Willie Sr. and Hilda Perkins created a family feeling that brings in regulars and even politicians and celebrities like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.\n\nA staple for the Black community in Milwaukee, the restaurant serves comforting southern flavors that can be hard to find here in the Midwest.\n\nWhen Willie Perkins Jr. took over in 1999, he continued creating that feeling, filling customers in on the latest news about the Green Bay Packers and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWhen Willie died in 2010, his wife, Cherry, took over. Now, Cherry and a small team — her sister, her son and one other worker who might as well be family — continue the legacy, remembering regulars’ names and orders and creating community in addition to delicious food.\n\n-Zoe Takaki\n\nIt’s synonymous with Green Bay Packers fandom today, but the Cheesehead made its first appearance at a 1987 Milwaukee Brewers game — a completely, ahem, organic creation.\n\nThe legend is well-known now: Ralph Bruno went to his mother’s south-side Milwaukee home to help her reupholster a couch. When he took it apart, he thought the foam inside looked like cheese — so, naturally, he cut a piece into a triangle, burned some holes into it and spray-painted it yellow. It was a self-deprecating homage to an insult Wisconsin sports fans received from their neighbors in Illinois.\n\nTo Bruno’s friends’ surprise, the hats were a hit. So he made more, and sold them from a garbage bag at the next game he attended. That led to neighborhood retail sales and, eventually, the creation of Foamation Inc. — and a robust variety of Cheesehead variations including cowboy hats, baseball caps and koozies. The Packers acquired Foamation in 2023, solidifying the relationship just like a good curd.\n\nOver time, the Cheesehead has inspired song parodies and been featured in a Lil’ Wayne tribute to the Green & Gold (er, Yellow). It’s been worn or displayed by famous figures including George W. Bush, Jodie Foster, Phoebe Bridgers and John F. Kennedy Jr. And despite Chicago Bears fans’ efforts to shred them with their answer — the Graterhead — Cheeseheads are here to stay.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo parallel metal tracks stretch across the roads in downtown Milwaukee, soaking up the heat of the summer and the frost of the winter. You wait a bit, a streetcar the length of two buses slides slowly toward you.\n\nYou wonder if it’s automatic, running robotically and beeping like that, until you see a conductor in the front seat and you let out the breath you’d been holding — it will stop at traffic lights and behind cars. On the side of the car golden letters read in all caps: “THE HOP.”\n\nThe Hop is a fixed-transit network that gives a ride to more than 1,000 people a day, going to various destinations in downtown Milwaukee. Its route stretches from Veterans Park to Milwaukee Public Market and expanded to the lakefront in spring 2024.\n\nThe Hop is a relatively new addition to the city, having started running in 2018. But it’s a continuation of a long history of streetcars in the city — the first electric streetcar started giving rides in 1890 and for decades was the primary form of transportation.\n\nToday, The Hop has become a staple of downtown life, whether or not you ride it.\n\n-Eva Wen\n\nIf Milwaukee was going to have a mountain, it’s fitting that that mountain would be made of the thing that keeps the city moving during its cold, icy winters: road salt.\n\nAlong with the pungent aroma of Milorganite, the gigantic salt piles are likely what most Milwaukeeans associate with the city’s Jones Island, once home to a commercial fishing village of Polish immigrants.\n\nToday, the island holds tens of thousands of tons of road salt delivered to the Port of Milwaukee for use in melting icy streets, highways and interstates across Wisconsin.\n\nIn recent years, concern has grown about excess road salt washing off of streets and into nearby bodies of water, including Lake Michigan.\n\nRoughly 2.2 billion pounds of chloride (a component of road salt) flush into the lake each year, according to a December 2021 study. And while the size of the lake helps dilute the salty pollutant, smaller tributaries aren’t so lucky. In the Milwaukee River basin alone, for example, over 100 miles of waterway are impaired by chloride, some with levels several times that which can be toxic to fish and aquatic life.\n\nMany municipalities and private businesses, including some in the Milwaukee area, have made adjustments to reduce their salt use in the name of protecting freshwater, including brining, where salt is mixed with water before being applied to roads.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nA Milwaukee sub sandwich staple, Cousins Subs began in 1972 when cousins Bill Specht and Jim Sheppard opened their first shop at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive to “bring their favorite style of sub sandwich from the East Coast to their new hometown of Milwaukee,” the company’s official story reads.\n\nCousins offers classics like the Italian Special, Pepperoni Melt and Tuna, plus specialties like Wisconsin Cheese Steak. And in Milwaukee, Cousins stands apart from national sandwich chains — not only for its local roots but its very-us offerings like Wisconsin mac and cheese, shakes and fried cheese curds.\n\nThe Cousins sandwich — carrying the slogan “Better bread. Better subs” — is so popular the company had to cancel a free sub promotion in early 2024 when restaurants couldn’t keep up with the overwhelming response.\n\n-Erik S. Hanley\n\nWouldn’t you like to go to Orlando in mid-February? Not for Disney, but for the greenery, the smell, the sense that things are alive.\n\nThat’s what you’ll find in the Tropical Dome — where you can sit in the sun with a book in hand, no matter the season. Roll up your sleeves, find a bench and relax.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re always too hot, the Desert Dome stays 50 degrees through the winter. If you have kids with you, think Show Dome and occasional choo-choos.\n\nThe three beehive-shaped Domes, aka Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory, sometimes seem the forgotten child of Milwaukee attractions. They’re fighting for their future. Yet even the common name – Domes – has a Milwaukee humility about it.\n\nWith more than 1,800 plant species, cleverly described with signage, the Domes are worth a walk.\n\nSince Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the Domes in the fall of 1965, other accolades have followed. In 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave “National Treasure” status to the Domes.\n\nAnd the Domes have a characteristic that Milwaukeeans love: They’re cheap.\n\nThe priciest admission costs $9, and parking is free, unlike at the stadium, the zoo, or almost the entire downtown.\n\n-Pete Sullivan\n\nBratwurst. Polish. Italian. Hot Dog. Chorizo.\n\nBrewers fans have been cheering for one sausage or another during their race at the bottom of the sixth inning for more than 30 years. What started as a cartoon competition on a County Stadium scoreboard made its way to Miller Park (now American Family Field) as a treasured Milwaukee tradition.\n\nThe real-life Racing Sausages debuted June 27, 1993, and gave rise to live-action mascot races throughout Major League Baseball, such as racing presidents and pierogis. The idea to take the links from the scoreboard to the field came from Michael Dillon, who worked as a graphic designer with McDill Design at the time, and their first appearance was a surprise to almost everyone in the ballpark.\n\nThe matchup of 7-foot-tall encased meats was sponsored by Klement’s until 2018, when Johnsonville took the reins.\n\nThe sausages have had their ups and downs over time. Among the wurst: In 2003, then-Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon whacked the Italian Sausage with a bat, causing the Hot Dog to tumble as well. Both finished the race, thanks to an assist from the Polish (the Bratwurst won). There was also the time in 2013 that the Italian Sausage’s casing (er, costume) was stolen (and ultimately returned) in Cedarburg. A few years later, Hot Dog took a tumble and brought Chorizo and Bratwurst along with him. And as recently as the team’s 2024 season opener, Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton narrowly missed being taken out by Bratwurst.\n\nNo matter the wiener, Milwaukee will always love its Racing Sausages.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nLegend has it George Webb first predicted Milwaukee’s baseball team would win 12 games in a row back in the 1940s – and maybe even hinted that his namesake restaurant would give out free hamburgers to celebrate the winning streak.\n\nDecades passed before his prophecy came true, but in April 1987, the Milwaukee Brewers finally pulled off the feat – and some 168,194 people lined up outside George Webb Restaurants for free burgers. It’s hard to describe how big of a deal it was to those who didn’t experience it firsthand, but trust us, there are few things us frugal Wisconsinites love more than free stuff. Combine that with baseball and burgers, and it basically felt like a street festival.\n\nWhile most people ate their free burgers, some decided to save the historic freebies for posterity. One man even had his bronzed for his father. Others threw theirs in basement freezers, only to find them decades later. (This reporter would like to apologize to her older brother, Paul, for throwing out his 20-year-old frozen burger instead of bronzing it.)\n\nThe Brewers did it again in 2018, and for only the second time in Milwaukee history people lined up to celebrate and claim their free burgers.\n\nEven when it’s not promising free burgers, George Webb is a beloved burger joint open 24 hours a day. Still, any long Brewers winning streak definitely starts to feel like a free-burger watch party.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nBob Uecker didn’t sign a broadcasting contract with the Milwaukee Brewers until 2021.\n\nBefore then, it was handshake agreements with owners Bud Selig and Mark Attanasio.\n\nUeck tries not to take himself too seriously. It’s part of the reason why he is such a revered figure among Americans, specifically Milwaukee natives and Brewers fans.\n\n“Mr. Baseball” being the butt of the joke is why the “Uecker seats” named in his honor are considered the best worst seats in baseball. “I must be in the front row,” Uecker said to a stadium usher in a mid-’80s Miller Lite commercial who told him to move to where his ticket was located — way up high.\n\nUecker seats used to be sold for as little as $1, but there was a catch: Fans would need to wait hours before first pitch at the box office to get their hands on the tickets, and the seats were less than desired — up in the nosebleeds with an obstructed view, but near Uecker’s statue.\n\nUecker, 91, has been speaking into his microphone for the Brewers radio broadcast since 1971. He wouldn’t want to hear it, but his mic serves as a symbolic gold standard for not only sportscasters but also the entertainment figures we allow into our living rooms.\n\nHe’s been a regular guest on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1984 and had roles in Hollywood films — his delivery of “Juuust a bit outside” in the 1989 cult classic film “Major League” (filmed at County Stadium) endures today.\n\nUltimately, the reason he finally signed a contract with the Brewers was because he lost benefits from the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nWhen she was a teenager, UW-Milwaukee professor Chia Youyee Vang remembers how her mother and aunt wrapped a long, purple cloth into a turban around her head. Then decorated with a black-and-white striped ribbon, it was one piece of the elaborate traditional clothing Vang would wear to celebrate the Hmong New Year.\n\nToday, the phuam txoo suab is more hat than headwrap. It’s often sold pre-wrapped, and it might be embroidered with silver coins or shiny beads. At annual New Year celebrations at Wisconsin State Fair Park, it’s a common headpiece for girls and women.\n\nThe headwrap’s evolution parallels Milwaukee’s Hmong community in some ways. Today’s young generation fuses American culture with the traditions of their parents and grandparents, who fled Laos as refugees in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nOlder immigrants worry about language and culture fading. But they also see their descendants blossoming: earning degrees, running businesses and buying homes in neighborhoods across the area.\n\nMilwaukee County is home to about 13,000 Hmong, census data shows. That’s nearly one-third of all Asian residents in the county.\n\nLike the Germans, Poles and Italians before them, the Hmong have made their mark on Milwaukee. The ways they’ll express and share their traditions with the city will only become more intricate as their roots deepen.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nOpening a box of Italian cookies from Peter Sciortino Bakery has an undeniable sweetness – like a mix of happy family memories and buttery goodness.\n\nSince Peter Sciortino and his wife, Grace, opened the bakery in 1947, it has grown into a beloved fixture on Brady Street. It opened just one year after Glorioso’s Italian Market, another legendary business that still calls Brady Street home. Both first became institutions as Italians began moving north from the Third Ward to the east side neighborhood decades ago, and have since become a tradition for families throughout Milwaukee.\n\nThe aroma of fresh-baked bread and cookies typically surrounds Peter Sciortino Bakery, and inside, cannoli is made fresh with each order.\n\nLuckily the cookies are sold by the pound, so there’s no need to choose between cimino, biscotti, amaretti, chocolate mezza luna, or any of the other varieties – just make sure you get a big enough box to try as many as possible.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nWhere Russell Avenue meets Superior Street in Bay View, an understated brown sign pays homage to one of the most significant sites in Milwaukee’s history: a 19th-century iron mill where a march for an eight-hour work day turned deadly.\n\nThe historical marker recalls the events of May 5, 1886: the Bay View Massacre.\n\nThat year, labor organizations nationwide were demanding an eight-hour work day, and they wanted it by May 1. Many Milwaukeeans were working 10-hour days, six days a week for paltry wages, Milwaukee historian John Gurda noted in his book “The Making of Milwaukee.”\n\nAs companies balked at the demand, strikes grew. By May 3, about half of Milwaukee’s men were on strike, Gurda found. They marched through the city, urging more workers to join them. Panicked officials called in militia from across the state after police were unable to “quell the disturbance,” the Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\nOn May 4, tension mounted at the Bay View mill where executives refused the eight-hour demand. Militia forcefully dispersed a crowd of protesters.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, about 1,500 marchers returned to the mill. When they were about 200 yards out, the militia fired. Among the seven dead was a 12-year-old boy.\n\nThe next day, streets were deserted. Local officials conferred about how to prevent “socialistic agitation,” deciding to arrest as many demonstrators as they could, the Journal reported.\n\nLabor leaders, meanwhile, had public opinion on their side. They turned their focus to winning elections.\n\nThat year, the labor-backed People’s Party of Wisconsin won elections up and down the ballot, with priorities including progressive taxes, child labor restrictions, and arbitration of labor disputes, Gurda wrote. While socialist leaders initially supported that party, they later split and ran their own candidates, launching Milwaukee’s socialist era in 1910.\n\n-Rory Linnane\n\nYou just moved to Milwaukee. You are sitting in your bungalow in Bay View and staring at the blank walls. You are a full-fledged grown-up, so those leftover posters from your college dorm don’t cut it anymore.\n\nFor generations, the Milwaukee neighborhood posters have provided an easy and classy way to decorate your new space. They were unveiled in 1983 by the City of Milwaukee’s Discover Milwaukee program, with colorful, eye-catching artwork by Jan Kotowicz of local landmarks, like the lower east side’s Oriental Theatre and Washington Park’s bandshell. Wait, what is Pigsville? Thankfully, local historian John Gurda provided illuminating text on the back of the posters about each neighborhood. The posters even popped up in “Wayne’s World” to lend authenticity to Alice Cooper’s Milwaukee-centric cameo.\n\nBest of all, the posters follow the egalitarian spirit of the city. The original run of 21 neighborhoods initially cost just $2 apiece. Now there are 39 options available from Historic Milwaukee, Inc., including one with all the neighborhoods, for only $10. There’s no excuse for those blank walls.\n\n-Ben Steele\n\nAmerica’s Black Holocaust Museum is the first and only museum of its kind in the U.S. It’s an unflinching look at more than 400 years of slavery, dehumanization, lynching and mass incarceration of Black Americans.\n\nThe dream for the museum began as a small collection in Dr. James Cameron’s basement. In 1930, when he was 16, Cameron narrowly survived a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He spent the rest of his life in Milwaukee collecting photos, artifacts and books that shed light on the histories of African Americans. He regularly welcomed guests into his home to learn this history.\n\nThe museum moved to its first official location in the Sultan Muhammad Islamic Center. Its grand opening was Juneteenth Day in 1988.\n\nCameron passed away in 2006. The museum subsequently moved buildings and briefly closed, and now resides at 401 W. North Ave., part of a redevelopment project in the heart of Bronzeville called the Griot — a West African term for “storyteller” — in honor of Cameron.\n\nThe museum starts in Africa in 300 CE, long before Europeans arrived, and ends with issues impacting Black people today, like police brutality and mass incarceration — covering the 16 generations of slavery in the U.S., reconstruction, 100 years of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA tree with branches stretching along the ceiling pays homage to the powerful song “Strange Fruit,” made popular by artist Billie Holiday, that fearlessly protested the widespread lynchings of Black Americans.\n\n-Gina Castro\n\nPabst Brewing Co. shut down its Milwaukee operations in 1996. But the huge “Pabst” sign that’s stretched far above West Juneau Avenue for several decades has remained a constant — even as the former brewery was redeveloped over the past decade or so into offices, housing, a craft brewery and other new uses.\n\nThe sign is attached to an iron footbridge that is anchored by Pabst’s former malt house, now The Malt House apartments, and the old brew house, now the Brewhouse Inn & Suites. The glowing red sign has undergone repairs in recent years, with the iron bridge’s restoration being completed this spring, according to Erin Stenum, manager of the neighborhood improvement district at the former Pabst complex, now known as The Brewery. Ein Prosit!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nThe soundtrack to most city parks includes the ping of a bouncing basketball, the tinny reverb of a faraway stereo or the sizzle of a grill fired up for sausages.\n\nYou’ll hear those at Burnham Park, too, but there’s another layer to the score: the soothing hum of a handful of taco trucks parked just outside, and the chatter from hungry hoards waiting in the wings for a carne asada taco, a lengua huarache or a cooling horchata on a hot summer night.\n\nThese food trucks are part of the fabric of Burnham Park. Beyond the neighborhood, the south side is dotted with family-owned fleets carrying specialties all their own, parked on Historic Mitchell Street, West Lincoln Avenue, West Becher Street and across the neighborhoods tucked in between.\n\nYou could stop at one to satisfy a craving or you could go on a full expedition, grabbing an al pastor taco shaved straight off the spit at La Guelaguetza (go on Wednesdays to nab ’em for a dollar each), head to Marta’s Tamales Food Truck for a juicy pambazo dipped in red pepper sauce, and finish at Isa’s Ice Cream for a creamy scoop of mango or passionfruit nieve de garrafa to round out the night.\n\nThey’re the tastes of the neighborhood and the passion from a piece of Milwaukee with undeniable flavor all its own.\n\n-Rachel Bernhard\n\nThey only surface for one week.\n\nBut for that one week, they’re everywhere.\n\nThey are the ribbons worn by Northwestern Mutual agents during the company’s annual gathering in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nEach summer, the Milwaukee insurance and financial services company brings more than 12,000 employees and agents together for a week of meetings and events; ground zero is usually the Baird Center and Fiserv Forum, but they can be seen all over downtown.\n\nAnd every agent wears a nametag lanyard with attached ribbons denoting sales goals achieved, landmarks passed, accomplishments reached.\n\nSome agents have two or three ribbons. A few sport a ribbon that goes down to the floor.\n\nTo outsiders, the ribbons might look like scout badges or sashes from a secret society — swag from a party they weren’t invited to.\n\nTo the agents, the ribbons are an expression of how far they’ve come in the business — and where they rank among their colleagues. After the week’s meetings are over, they’re put away.\n\nIn a way, they’re like cicadas: They swarm the city for a brief period, and then they’re gone.\n\nBut we know they’ll be back.\n\n-Chris Foran\n\nJust over a year after moving to Milwaukee, I arrived at Wolski’s Tavern with a singular goal: Get that damn sticker. You know the one. The ubiquitous capital-letter “I CLOSED WOLSKI’S” sticker plastered on dive bar bathroom walls and 20-somethings’ water bottles.\n\nEven if you don’t know what Wolski’s is, exactly, it’s still likely you know about the stickers. The fantastic marketing strategy has worked wonders for the more-than-a-century-old bar.\n\nWhen we arrive that night, we sit outside despite the evening’s light rain. I find myself tiring long before 1 a.m. But the lure of the sticker provides energy as the night goes on.\n\nAs 2 a.m. passes, a man urinates off a tree-shielded wall and an employee yells it’s time to go. A sloppy early-20s crowd, a few stray middle-age folks and I begin to filter inside. The crowd lingers, holding glass beer mugs and Miller High Lifes.\n\nTen minutes later, another call to leave rings out. This time, people form a line to a door guarded by a young doorman holding a stack of stickers. One in front of me doesn’t take it, but later reverses her decision. The doorman teases she can’t have one, and receives a kiss on the cheek when he concedes.\n\nI give him a nod and thank-you, taking my prize.\n\nI closed Wolski’s — now I just need to find where to put the sticker. Any ideas?\n\n-David Clarey\n\nIn Milwaukee, seemingly every component of the gooey globules known as cheese curds — pieces of young cheese that during the cheesemaking process become separated from the whey — is as malleable as the cheddar itself.\n\nA simple scan of the city’s pubs, bars and even fine-dining restaurants is evidence of an oft-repeated Wisconsin stereotype: It’s the cheese curd capital of the world. And per usual, Milwaukee isn’t going to skimp on the party.\n\nRestaurants generally buy fresh curds of white or yellow cheddar — in rarer cases, mozzarella or pepper jack — before adding their own personality via batters, sauces and names. Milwaukeeans take pride in experimenting with curd coatings: they might be buttermilk-battered, pancake-battered, beer-battered, honey lager-battered, Lakefront Riverwest Stein-battered, or slathered in an ambiguous “house-made batter.”\n\nThose curds are then “fried up squeaky clean” (at the Wicked Hop), turned into “mini explosives” disguised as curds (at Safehouse Milwaukee), or transfigured into “little pillows of cheesy heaven” (at Joe Mama’s Bar). Many restaurants serve up half-pound portions; some, like Steny’s, offer a full pound of cheese.\n\nNotably, the Journal Sentinel didn’t come across any menus advertising curds served with ketchup. But various varieties of tomato, like marinara sauce and tomato jam, made appearances. Many menus experiment with ranch varieties like buttermilk, garlic, chipotle or jalapeño, or specialty sauces like buffalo blue cheese aioli, maple syrup, Bloody Mary buffalo, or sweet and spicy pineapple.\n\nAs Brothers Bar and Grill puts it, the final step is up to you: transporting the morsels “from the cheese curd capital of the world to your mouth!”\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nRyan Putskey isn’t fazed by calls to the Oriental Theatre asking if “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is “appropriate.” Or, calls telling him it’s not.\n\n“To be fair, it can be kind of graphic. But, I mentioned this to the cast — it’s been like this for probaby 40 years,” said Putskey, the theater’s longtime caretaker.\n\nA quick Google search confirms the historic East Side theater gets national kudos for its longstanding commitment to Rocky Horror. In some tellings, the Oriental takes the crown for the longest single run of the movie since its release in 1975.\n\nPutskey humbly said that’s a point of contention: the Oriental’s tradition dates back to January 1978 — before its rival for Rocky Horror longevity, the Clinton Street Theater in Oregon — but has logged fewer individual shows.\n\nRegardless, Rocky Horror devotees consistently show up for the movie and live stage performance at midnight on the second Saturday of each month to call out virgins in the audience and throw toast at the stage. They never tire of watching the transformation of an under-sexualized engaged couple, Brad and Janet, as they wander into a castle and are soon seduced by a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual and his Frankenstein-esque creation, Rocky.\n\nThose details aren’t unique to Milwaukee. But the Oriental’s minaret towers and lioness statutes add an otherworldly, in-person touch to the celebration of madness, weirdness and sexuality that demands to be taken seriously.\n\n“You’ll consistently be there with — and I say this will all due respect to all of them — a bunch of weirdos,” Putskey said.\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nNobody has to be from Cleveland to know that the city has been the subject of more than a few one-liners over the years.\n\n“Attention Cleveland, your river is on fire!”\n\nOr ...\n\n“In Cleveland, Velveeta cheese can be found in the gourmet section of the supermarket.”\n\nBut here’s a burning question, why did Cleveland become the butt of a zinger of a gag in Milwaukee’s Bay View, of all places?\n\nIn 1978, while having lunch with his assistant, now retired photographer and artist Mark Gubin decided to have some fun with air travelers flying into Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.\n\nRealizing that low-level planes coasted over his studio and home (the former Bay Theater) in the path of a runway, he painted “Welcome to Cleveland”on his roof.\n\nWas there any specific reason behind the Cleveland tomfoolery, these 6-foot high letters that have given more than a few air travelers an uneasy, eerie (or Erie) feeling?\n\nNope, it was just Gubin’s wicked sense of humor, the right time to welcome visitors to the wrong place.\n\n“I never did it as any kind of thing to help my business or anything like that. It was just plain madness. You need that in the world,” Gubin told former Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl in 2015.\n\nThe internet, cyberspace and social media have helped Gubin’s prank reach a sort of rock star quality.\n\nNow 46 years later, the gag certainly hasn’t gotten old … it’s still flying.\n\n-Emmett Prosser\n\nIn the 1980s, many members of the Forest County Potawatomi tribe lived in poverty.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, members of the tribe receive tens of thousands of dollars in dividends.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Potawatomi Casino in the Menomonee River Valley happened.\n\nWhen it first opened around 1990 at 1720 W. Canal St., the facility was a large bingo hall with a few hundred slot machines of questionable legality and little outside regulation.\n\nThe tribe’s reservation is in northern Wisconsin, making the Milwaukee casino the nation’s first off-reservation tribal casino. The land where the casino is located is believed to have once been a Potawatomi village, according to a Milwaukee Public Museum history of the tribe.\n\nIn its initial years, the tribe shared its gaming revenue with the Indian Community School and a non-Indian management company. Those deals have since expired.\n\nToday, the casino is a major Milwaukee tourist attraction and an unmissable part of the city’s skyline. It rakes in more than $400 million in gambling winnings a year. A chunk of those winnings goes to members of the tribe in the form of per-capita payments estimated to be more than $70,000 per member.\n\nThe gambling hall draws nearly 6 million visitors a year and the 784,000-square-foot casino offers a range of ways to win or lose money, including about 3,000 slot machines, sports book, craps and a variety of table games including poker and blackjack.\n\nAnd since 1999, The Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has donated about $75 million to Milwaukee-area nonprofits, according to a spokesperson for the tribe.\n\n-Cary Spivak\n\nDo you know where you were in 1880?\n\nThat’s a trick question — you were surely not born, but if you were, you could’ve been among the first to munch on some of the finest sausage to come out of Milwaukee at that time.\n\nLuckily, you still can enjoy it. That’s because Usinger’s Famous Sausage has stood the test of time since founder Fred Usinger moved to Milwaukee from Germany and started his own successful sausage shop in 1880.\n\nIn the nearly century and a half since, the company has grown to have a wide shipping network while retaining its beloved place in Milwaukee, with its vintage-style building, tasty and bountiful meats and a rather helpful staff. Don’t forget about the storied elves — prominent in local advertisements and in the deli’s window displays, the company touts them as the invisible makers of its beloved sausage.\n\nUsinger’s sausage earned a spot in the Milwaukee Public Museum’s Streets of Milwaukee exhibit and in an episode of “Top Chef.” There’s even an annual Fred Usinger Day on Feb. 23.\n\nPerhaps a 1980 ad in the Milwaukee Journal put it best: “In 1880, Milwaukee got its first electric street lights, its first native mayor, and its first taste of Usinger’s sausage. It was a very good year.”\n\nIt was a very good year, indeed. And, thankfully, those tastes have continued for 144 years.\n\n-David Clarey\n\nWisconsin’s oldest continually operating gay bar wasn’t always easy to spot. When June Brehm opened This Is It! at 418 E. Wells St. in 1968, Milwaukee’s LGBTQ+ scene operated under the radar, and closeted patrons made use of the bar’s rear entrance to avoid being identified.\n\nToday, This Is It! welcomes patrons with a concrete facade adorned with a diamond pattern in the colors of the rainbow.\n\nDrag superstar and Wisconsin native Trixie Mattel became a co-owner with George Schneider in 2021.\n\nNot only is This Is It! a Milwaukee institution — it’s one of the country’s oldest LGBTQ+ bars. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin recognized Brehm and her son Joseph for their contributions to Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ community, and the bar became the site of the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display in 2019.\n\n“This Is It! is not Milwaukee’s favorite gay bar, it is Milwaukee’s favorite bar,” Mattel said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Everyone in town has a personal story or anecdote, or sometimes even a night they can barely remember. The exterior has rainbow accents that invite all walks of life into the space, and remind people to come in and act right. It reminds people that even if you’re homophobic, not in this (expletive) building you’re not.”\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nA symbol of Milwaukee’s proud brewing history, bottles of Miller Lite can be seen in the hands of drinkers at dive bars and tailgates across Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s probably the most ubiquitous of the Miller beers — Miller Chill, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life and Miller 64 Extra Light — in a town where the Miller name still looms large (literally — the large red Miller sign can be seen by anyone driving into downtown from the west on Interstate 94).\n\nIn 1973, Miller Brewing bought a low-calorie “Lite” brand of beer from Chicago-based Meister Brau Inc. and turned it into what’s now known as Miller Lite. From there, the company advertised the beer with the help of sports stars like Mickey Mantle, John Madden and Bob Uecker with the popular line “Tastes great … less filling.”\n\nToday, Miller Lite and other Miller beers are under the MolsonCoors’ list of brands.\n\nIn 1996, Miller acquired the naming rights to the Milwaukee Brewers’ yet-to-be-built stadium, which opened in 2001. It was called Miller Park until the naming rights agreement expired in 2020 and American Family Insurance took over, renaming the stadium American Family Field.\n\nBut naturally, Miller Lite can still be found for sale at the stadium during Brewers’ games.\n\n-Alec Johnson\n\nCathedral Square is home to many summer festivals.\n\nThere’s Jazz in the Park, Bastille Days and the dazzling Christmas tree display that wash Cathedral Square in lights at night.\n\nBut on the corner of Kilbourn and Jackson stands a metal plaque that marks a little-known event that occurred more than a century and a half ago. Passersby rarely stop to note the significance of that historical marker, erected in 2001 by the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nIt tells the story of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave from Missouri. Glover found refuge and freedom in Wisconsin until he was captured and jailed under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. His imprisonment stirred nearly 5,000 anti-slavery demonstrators who stormed the Milwaukee County Jail — which stood on present-day Cathedral Square — to break Glover out on March 10, 1854.\n\nBut Glover was still a wanted man.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act called for the recapture of freedom seekers or escaped slaves like Glover to be returned to their owners. Glover was on the run for years fearing recapture by his slave owner, a man named Benammi Stone Garland.\n\nWith the help of Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses manned by abolitionists who offered safety and shelter to runaway slaves, Glover eventually made his way to Canada and to freedom.\n\nGlover’s story is also depicted on a mural on the I-43 overpass on Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\n-LaRisa R. Lynch\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Milwaukee at least twice. Now, Milwaukee honors King’s legacy with a statue in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nKing’s first recorded speech in Milwaukee was in August 1957 at the Grand Avenue Congressional Church, now the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center on West Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nHe returned during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement in January 1964, where he spoke to over 6,000 at the Milwaukee Auditorium (now the Miller High Life Theatre).\n\nIn the biggest showing of support for King, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people marched on Milwaukee just a few days removed from his assassination. The march was considered the largest civil rights demonstration in the city’s history.\n\nKing’s Milwaukee sculpture is located at North King Drive and West Vine Street. The sculptor, Erik Blome, once said he hoped to capture King animated as if he was giving a speech.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nMarquette won the NCAA basketball trophy on March 28, 1977, with a 67-59 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels, which sent students streaming down Wisconsin Avenue in an impromptu party-parade to the lake.\n\nUnder the brash, colorful (and quotable) Coach Al McGuire, the team – which famously took its team photo in tuxedos while sitting in a classic car – had captured the attention of the city, and the nation.\n\nThe teams were unseeded — it was the last year before teams came into the tournament with a ranking. And the term “March Madness” — describing the unpredictability of upsets and bracket busters — was not widely used until the ’80s.\n\nIt was legendary coach Al McGuire’s last game leading Marquette. He came into the game with a 25-7 record, after sneaking into the tournament, to the Tar Heels’ 28-5 record.\n\nOne of McGuire’s key strategies was to not give North Carolina any lead. If they led, the Tar Heels were sure to do the dreaded Four Corners Offense, a “stall offense” where the players would pass the ball to kill time.\n\nThe teams could take 10 minutes for one possession — there was no 30-second shot clock to keep the game moving. There was no 3-point line.\n\nDespite the fact basketball was played so much differently then, it is still remembered each year when Marquette plays in the NCAA tourney — as the only time Marquette men’s basketball won it all.\n\nIf anyone needs any reminding, the original trophy is in the Walk of Champions display at Marquette’s Al McGuire Center.\n\n-Cathy Kozlowicz\n\nCue the “Happy Days” theme song. The Bronze Fonz, a life-size statue that pays tribute to Arthur Fonzarelli, is a pillar of the city’s downtown RiverWalk.\n\nThe set-in-Milwaukee sitcom ran in the ’70s and ‘80s, but Fonzie — played by Henry Winkler — remains a beloved Brew City icon.\n\nVisit Milwaukee had spearheaded an effort that raised $75,000 for the statue, and artist Gerald Sawyer brought it to life. The statue arrived in 2008 with a lot of fanfare, including a parade, the king of cool himself, other castmates and the stars of “Happy Days” spinoff “Laverne & Shirley.”\n\n“It is a great honor,” Winkler said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview. “You cannot be blase about that, no matter how much time goes by.”\n\nWhen the statue disappeared to undergo routine maintenance a couple years back, it caused quite the stir. About 40 people attended a ceremony marking its return.\n\nWant to see the Bronze Fonz for yourself? It’s located on the east side of the RiverWalk just south of Wells Street. And while you’re there, you might want to snap a pic. The statue is one of the city’s most selfied landmarks.\n\n-Hannah Kirby\n\nTomatoes are just one of the many vegetables you’ll find planted at Alice’s Garden, one of the city’s best-known community gardens, on the city’s north side at North 21st Street and West Garfield Avenue.\n\nBorn out of an abandoned highway project, the 2-acre garden is located along a larger, 3-mile corridor where entire blocks of houses were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Park West Freeway. The project cut through the city’s west and north sides, displacing several thousand residents and disrupting the community’s economy. Ultimately, the highway was never built, largely because of sustained neighborhood opposition. In its wake, large swaths of empty land were left.\n\nOut of that empty land sprang Alice’s Garden, now a thriving community garden and gathering place. The garden is there to reconnect city residents to the land and to oft-lost traditions of growing fresh, healthy food.\n\nGardeners come from all ethnicities and cultures, and their plots often speak to their heritage. In a Native American’s garden might be corn, beans and squash, known as “the three sisters” for how they are planted close together, for mutual benefit. A Black gardener might grow black-eyed peas, collard greens and okra in homage to past ancestors.\n\nNot only is the garden a place to cultivate food, but also relationships. Walking paths lined with herbs invite visitors for a stroll. Kids race across the grass or sit on picnic blankets for monthly storytimes. The pavilion shelters people sharing fellowship and a meal.\n\n-Sarah Volpenhein\n\nOne sign that summer is here in Milwaukee is the volleyball nets going up at Bradford Beach. Once the weather gets nice, it’s common to see people of all skill levels bumping, setting and spiking at the city’s largest beach during the afternoons and evenings pretty much any day of the week.\n\nFrom late May until September, the beach is home to more than 30 volleyball nets. The nets are currently managed by Volley Life, a local company that organizes beach volleyball clinics, tournaments and leagues.\n\nIn 2016, the beach hosted the USA Volleyball Junior Beach National Championships, and, at the end of this summer, it will host the Badger Region Beach Championships.\n\nBut, you don’t need to be a former high school volleyball star to join in on the summer fun.\n\nVolley Life has multiple leagues nearly every day of the week encompassing skill levels from those just learning the game to experienced players competing for prize money. When leagues are not playing, nets are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nThe nickname “Cream City” might make some think of milk.\n\nBut Milwaukee’s popular moniker does not stem from the dairy or beer typically associated with Wisconsin. It has to do with brick.\n\nLook around and you’ll see them. The light-colored, yellowish bricks are the main material in a number of old buildings across the city: the former Schlitz brewery, Holy Trinity Church (now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church), the Woman’s Club of Wisconsin and other industrial buildings and row houses.\n\nThe so-called cream city bricks were first used in the Milwaukee area in the 1830s. The material came from a clay found in the Menomonee River Valley filled with magnesium and lime. When put to fire, the clay produced a yellowy, cream-colored brick.\n\nThe bricks were widely exported and made it to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York. But they remain a distinctly Milwaukee look and give the state’s largest city its name: Cream City.\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nA hidden gem in Milwaukee’s premier lakefront property, Lake Park, is a 2,000-year-old ancient Indigenous burial mound.\n\nIt is a large conical mound about 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet high overlooking Lake Michigan near Lake Drive and Locust Street.\n\nThe mound was built by Indigenous people during what archaeologists call the Middle Woodland Culture between 300 B.C. and 400 A.D.\n\nMilwaukee was once home to hundreds, or even thousands, of these ancient mounds, but they were destroyed by development. The Lake Park mound is the last one left in the city.\n\n-Frank Vaisvilas\n\nFew signs bring as much joy as the one that reads “MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MARKET.”\n\nThe large red neon sign hovers above the market’s west entrance, beckoning to passersby and serving as a de facto billboard for downtown and the Third Ward. It glows at night, and casts a shimmering reflection even on the rainiest of days. Get off that concrete freeway, it tells visitors. (Who among us hasn’t driven past the sign and wondered why they’re still on I-794 instead of walking through the public market, stopping by the lakefront, or visiting one of the city’s many festivals?)\n\nThe sign alone has basically become a local landmark. And the market itself, which opened in 2005, is a sleek space full of natural light and packed with local vendors selling an impressive range of goods – including cheese, spices, wine, fresh fish on ice, flowers, chocolate and Milwaukee merch.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Market sits at the corner of what was once known as Commission Row, a stretch of Broadway that was once packed with Italian fruit and v", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/09/17/tributes-grow-honoring-stabbing-victim-hero/72368272/", "title": "Tributes grow honoring stabbing victim as hero", "text": "robin brown\n\nThe News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON Tributes grew on local and international levels Thursday for Thomas L. \"Cannibal\" Cottingham, who was fatally stabbed Monday night in Rodney Square as he protected a young mother and child from a deranged attacker.\n\nMore than 100 people including members of Wilmington's PeaceKeepers group gathered Thursday night at Rodney Square, holding hands in a circle to pray for Cottingham and his family.\n\nA Facebook tribute and GoFundMe account were set up and Insane Clown Posse, a Detroit-based hip-hop duo, posted a massive tribute to the slain 27-year-old rapper.\n\nThe group noted that just two months ago Cottingham won the top honor at the annual Gathering of the Juggalos, as their fans are known, out-rapping the other contestants.\n\n\"He was the top MC at the contest,\" read the group's post. \"He was one talented ninja and ... also an all around amazing person and Juggalo, exemplifying what the Juggalo Family is all about.\"\n\nThe duo said they will have a moment of silence in tribute to Cottingham at their upcoming October concert at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia.\n\nCottingham died at Christiana Hospital after being repeatedly stabbed at about 9:30 p.m. Monday. He had stopped Calvin Hooker III, 25, of Elsmere, from chasing a woman with a baby stroller around a bus stop at the square, court documents say.\n\nHooker, charged with first-degree murder and six other felonies, remains held without bail at Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington. He is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in Superior Court on Sept. 22.\n\nCottingham's sister Kieara Robinson of Newark said another vigil is being planned for 4 p.m. Monday at the site of his death to convince city officials to place a marker at the square to honor his heroism.\n\nAlthough friends and family said they appreciated Mayor Dennis P. Willliams issuing a statement calling him a hero, his sister said, \"There should be a plaque here.\n\n\"This is where he gave his life to protect people he didn't even know,\" she said. \"That's who he was.\"\n\nFellow Juggalo Daniel \"DJ Psycho\" McJunkin of Elsmere, said everyone who knew Cottingham has a story of his generosity.\n\nDo you support a plaque in Rodney Square honoring the man who died defending a woman and her baby?\n\nRodney Square stabbing victim hailed as a hero\n\nPolice: Suspect begged to be killed, admits fatal stabbing\n\n\"One day, my wallet got lifted out here and he walked around for three hours helping me look for it,\" he said. \"We found it in the trash and the money was gone – I didn't care – but the point is that he stayed and helped me find it.\"\n\nMcJunkin said he and other Juggalos thought the tribute by the Insane Clown Posse was perfect: \"He was a great artist.\"\n\nAmong hundreds of posts and comments on the duo's web and Facebook pages, one of the most poignant was by a man named Robert Tidwell, who said he met Cottingham at the Juggalos' last gathering in Ohio.\n\n\"He came up to me and started telling me that being a Juggalo meant so much to him because it turned his life around,\" Tidwell said.\n\n\"He made mistakes,\" his sister said, \"but he was a kind-hearted guy, he was a loving person.\n\n\"He earned his angel wings.\"\n\nFriends and relatives still smile when they talk about Cottingham's \"look.\"\n\nHe died his hair many colors – sometimes more than one at once.\n\nHe had numerous facial piercings, cut patches in his eyebrows and had gauges in his ears.\n\nHis tattoos were plentiful, all designed and inked by himself, including on his arms and neck.\n\nCottingham's look tied in to his Insane Clown Posse fandom, grown from his love of music.\n\n\"He was an original,\" said his cousin, Alaina Reams of Newark.\n\n\"He started all this at the age of 15,\" she said, adding his love of music began with \"his little beat machine.\"\n\n\"As kids, we did everything together,\" she said, smiling.\n\n\"He grew up in Belvedere, Newport,\" she said, and he graduated in 2007 from Alexis I. du Pont High School.\n\nHis family is \"holding it together as much as possible,\" Reams said. \"As much as possible.\"\n\nCottingham and his brother, Phil – brokenhearted by his death – attended the annual gathering of Juggalos together and were close, said friend PoJo Radcliff, who shared Cottingham's passion for skateboarding.\n\nRadcliff and other friends organized a memorial at Rodney Square.\n\nAt one point on Thursday, as friends and strangers who admired his heroism continued to leave tributes and sign a T-shirt, city personnel began to remove some items.\n\nBut after friends and admirers objected, much of the makeshift memorial remained. Friends took away some things, then brought them back to the memorial.\n\nThat memorial nearly included a special skateboard.\n\nRadcliff, a sponsored skateboarder who had skated recently with Cottingham at Newport Skate Park, said his friend had needed parts. Because he got them free, Radcliff told Cottingham he would take care of him.\n\n\"We were supposed to meet at Rodney Square,\" he said. He carried the board there the night after his friend's slaying and was going to leave it with the candles and other tributes, but friends said he shouldn't because it would be stolen.\n\n\"So I broke it in half,\" he said. \"I left half and I'll put the other half on his grave.\"\n\nThursday afternoon, state Department of Transportation Secretary Jennifer Cohan presented a medal to a DART driver who called 911, then whisked the mother, baby and frightened bystanders to safety in his bus.\n\nCohan called Cottingham \"a hero\" and said she felt certain the loss of life would have been greater, had he not intervened.\n\nBus driver Renaldo Epps, 42, of Wilmington, accepted the DelDOT Challenge Medal, \"on behalf of Thomas Cottingham, who is the real victim and the real hero.\"\n\nGiven the medal at the opening of DelDOT's annual legislative briefing, Epps pointedly addressed elected officials about the underlying issue in the deadly attack, which investigators determined was unprovoked and randomly targeted.\n\n\"Please send more money to mental health issues,\" Epps said, his voice pleading.\n\nAlthough he had seen crime at Rodney Square before, Epps said he had never seen such extreme violence. \"He was on top of him, just stabbing and stabbing and stabbing.\"\n\nDedicating the medal to Cottingham \"was just beautiful,\" said Lillian Shavers, president and business agent for Local 842 of the Amalgamated Transit Union. What Epps did was important and probably saved lives, but Cottingham gave his life protecting strangers, Shavers said.\n\nEpps, who nodded in agreement, added, \"He is the hero.\"\n\nHis funeral is 11 a.m. Sept. 24 at Congo Funeral Home, 2317 N. Market St., Wilmington, with viewing 9-10:45 a.m. and burial in Silverbrook Cemetery.\n\nContact robin brown at (302) 324-2856 or rbrown@delawareonline.com.

The National Trust for Historic Preservation has recognized the Mount Vernon Arsenal and Searcy Hospital as one of the nation’s most endangered places. Officials are trying to develop a plan and raise money to save the area, located north of Mobile. The arsenal was established in the early 1800s, and many of those buildings remain. Apache leaders including Geronimo were interred there in the late 1800s. The facility became a mental hospital for African Americans in 1900s when Alabama was racially segregated by law. It was integrated decades later and closed in 2012. About 40 buildings remain at the site, but many are deteriorating.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Wildlife officials are making plans to deal with an invasive species at a pond in the middle of the city. The Anchorage Daily News reports more than 150 orange, white and red goldfish are swimming in Cuddy Pond near the city’s main library. The aquarium pets are domesticated carp originally bred in China. Goldfish can carry diseases and bacteria that harm the ecosystem and other marine animals. Alaska Department of Fish and Game invasive species research biologist Krissy Dunker says the department last year tried using electroshock equipment to stun fish and make them easier to catch. She says the fish simply swam deeper. Dunker says it’s more humane to euthanize unwanted pet fish than to release them into the wild, where they’re likely to starve in winter.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Inspectors with the state School Facilities Board once identified critical problems at schools during inspections – high carbon dioxide levels in one school’s classrooms, a 50-year-old air-conditioning system in another school, fire alarm systems in need of repair. But those inspections are almost extinct. Since 2017, officials have conducted just one inspection of one school. State law requires that the School Facilities Board inspect all district school buildings once every five years for building deficiencies and conduct preventive maintenance inspections at 20 randomly selected districts every 30 months. Arizona has 2,001 district school buildings, according to the state Department of Education. Officials conducted 20 deficiencies inspections in 2015 and 18 in 2016. They did no inspections in 2017 and 2018 and one in 2019.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Buffalo National River park has been designated as the state’s first International Dark Sky Park. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that park officials spent two years getting 345 light fixtures into compliance. It recently became the world’s 71st dark sky park. Mark Foust, who heads the park, says he hopes the designation can serve as an example for other parks in the region that want to partake in the process. The park stretches along 135 miles of the Buffalo River. Park ranger Cassandra Johannsen says most of the 1.2 million visitors go to float the river, but she has encountered people who visit exclusively for the night sky. Bruce McMath, chairman of the Arkansas Natural Sky Association, says park rangers and amateur astronomers have developed impressive dark-sky programs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A floating device designed to catch plastic waste has been redeployed in its second attempt to clean up a huge island of trash swirling in the Pacific Ocean between California and Hawaii. Boyan Slat, creator of The Ocean Cleanup project, announced on Twitter that a 2,000-foot-long floating boom that broke apart late last year was sent back to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch last week after four months of repair. A ship towed the U-shaped barrier from San Francisco to the patch in September to trap the plastic. But during the four months at sea, the boom broke apart under constant waves and wind, and the boom wasn’t retaining the plastic it caught. Fitted with solar-powered lights, cameras, sensors and satellite antennas, the device intends to communicate its position at all times, allowing a support vessel to fish out the collected plastic every few months and transport it to dry land.\n\nColorado\n\nManitou Springs: A Coloradan is trying to break a record for hiking a notoriously steep and difficult trail as many times as he can in a year. The current record is 1,719 ascents of the Manitou Incline near Manitou Springs. The Colorado Springs Gazette reports 62-year-old Greg Cummings is now about halfway toward breaking his friend Roger Austin’s record. Cummings is averaging over five ascents and descents a day and has completed the trail about 870 times since January. The trail is short but climbs nearly 2,000 feet in less than a mile. The trail consists almost entirely of hundreds of steep steps up a mountainside. Cummings says the challenge is especially difficult because he has Type 1 diabetes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: A Yale University library will display a rare copy of the Declaration of Independence and hold a public reading to mark the 243rd anniversary of the nation’s founding. The Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library says the document is one of only 26 known copies of the first printing of the Declaration of Independence. Those copies are known as the Dunlap Broadside, named after John Dunlap, who printed about 200 copies in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776. They were distributed to the original 13 states. The Yale copy will be displayed in a temporary exhibition case at the library from June 27 through July 11, except for the July 4 holiday, when the library will be closed. The public reading is scheduled for July 5 at 4 p.m.\n\nDelaware\n\nPrices Corner: Calling attention to what has been described as “a violent and often-ignored chapter of Delaware history,” legislators and more than 100 community members gathered Sunday to unveil a historical marker commemorating the only documented lynching in the First State. Installed by the Delaware Public Archives at New Castle County’s Greenbank Park in Prices Corner, the marker memorializes the 1903 lynching of laborer George White at the hands of a white mob. He was burned at the stake, according to historical accounts and newspaper archives. “I don’t think he’s ever going to be forgotten,” said Savannah Shepherd, a rising senior at the Sanford School in Hockessin, standing in front of a tower that is all that remains of the New Castle County workhouse White where was imprisoned before his death. The high schooler was instrumental in getting the memorial put up.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The 2018 Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals are among 11 new entrants into the district’s Sports Hall of Fame. The Capitals earned entry after bringing the National Hockey League title to Washington for the first time. Owner Ted Leonsis accepted the induction plaque in a ceremony Sunday at Nationals Park. Other honorees included former Redskins defensive end Charles Mann; Tom Brown, who played for the Senators and Redskins; University of Maryland women’s lacrosse coach Cathy Reese; former DeMatha Catholic High School and Duke basketball player Danny Ferry; Maryland soccer coach Sasho Cirovski; two-time Olympic gold medal swimmer Tom Dolan; horse racing writer Andrew Beyer; and Kevin Payne, first president and CEO of DC United (soccer).\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A woman’s effort to protect herself from domestic violence has become a flashpoint in the debate over gun rights and victims’ safety. Courtney Irby gave her estranged husband’s guns to police after he was charged with domestic violence-aggravated battery, only to find herself arrested for theft. Now a state lawmaker and gun safety advocates are championing her cause, asking a state attorney to drop the charges, while gun rights advocates want her prosecuted. Irby spent six days in jail on charges of armed burglary and grand theft. At the time she turned in the assault rifle and handgun, Joseph Irby was spending one day in jail, accused of ramming into her car after a divorce hearing. She had received a temporary injunction for protection. Federal law prohibits people under a domestic violence restraining order from possessing guns, but it’s up to local law enforcement to enforce it, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A hand-painted silk flag carried into battle by members of the 127th United States Colored Troops in the Civil War now has a home at a museum in the city. The piece of history recently auctioned off in Philadelphia landed in the collection of the Atlanta History Center and is the most expensive artifact the center has acquired. According to the center, at least 180,000 African Americans served in the United States Colored Troops, a branch of the U.S. Army formed after the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863. The units were segregated and commanded by white officers. Estimates are that three-fourths of the soldiers were formerly enslaved men. The history center has 11,000 items in its Civil War collection, which is one of the largest in the nation. But items specifically associated with the U.S. Colored Troops are very rare, and the center owns only a dozen.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A new altar has been built near the summit of Mauna Kea, less than a day after state officials dismantled two other “ahu” in preparation for the construction of one of the world’s most advanced telescopes. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports the new ahu isn’t directly blocking access to the site where the Thirty Meter Telescope is planned. The two dismantled ahu were blocking access to the site. The new ahu is across the road from the Maunakea Visitor Information Station where a structure called Hale o Kukiaimauna stood until state officials took it down Thursday. State officials announced they were giving permission for construction to begin on the Thirty Meter Telescope. The decision came after the state Supreme Court in October upheld the project’s permits.\n\nIdaho\n\nKelly Creek: Wildlife officials are urging black bear hunters to choose their targets with care after a protected grizzly bear was spotted in north-central Idaho for the first time in a decade. A hunting guide restocking a black bear baiting site encountered the 3-year-old male grizzly in the lower Kelly Creek area of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests this month. The grizzly bear is collared and tracked by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The agency says the bear crossed into Idaho last August, but wildlife officials captured it and sent it back to Montana. Wayne Kasworm, who monitors bears for the agency, says the bear headed south again after it was released. Idaho Fish and Game officials say hunters need to be cautious for the rest of black bear season.\n\nIllinois\n\nJoliet: State troopers are teaming up with truck drivers in the Chicago area to crack down on distracted driving. The (Joliet) Herald-News reports the “Trooper in a Truck” program has troopers riding along in the cabs of commercial motor vehicles to better spot distracted drivers. Maj. Robert Meeder says troopers have a better vantage point from a truck’s cab to see if drivers in other vehicles are texting or doing other things that are unsafe. If the trooper sees something, he or she notifies police units up ahead to stop the violators. Meeder said during a news conference in Joliet that distracted driving is a leading cause of traffic crashes.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The region’s archbishop has forced a Catholic high school to fire a gay teacher, just days after another school in the city defied a similar order despite church officials saying they would no longer recognize it as Catholic. Cathedral High School announced Sunday that it’s terminating the teacher’s contract to avoid a split with the Indianapolis archdiocese. Leaders of Cathedral High School, a private school affiliated with the Brothers of the Holy Cross religious order, said in a letter on the school’s website that disobeying Archbishop Charles Thompson would cost the school its nonprofit status and its ability to have Mass celebrated on campus. This is the third Indianapolis Catholic high school that’s faced pressure from Thompson over employees in same-sex marriages since he became archbishop in July 2017.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A University of Iowa team has won a $115million grant to develop satellites for studying a system of radiation created by the sun – “space weather.” The NASA grant will underwrite development of satellites expected to be launched within the next three years with more satellites developed by Southwest Research Institute scientists. The satellites are designed to gather data on how the sun creates solar wind and how Earth responds to the solar wind. NASA scientists say goal is to understand what drives space weather so humans can mitigate any harmful effects. NASA official Nicky Fox says solar particles generated by the sun can interfere with undersea cables, power grids, radio communications and other electronic equipment.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State education officials are raising pay and fast-tracking various teaching professionals in a two-pronged effort aimed at combating teacher shortages. Last year, Kansas schools had more than 600 vacant positions, many in rural areas and the state’s most urban districts. Low pay has been blamed for much of the trouble attracting and retaining teachers. Legislative approval of multiyear school funding increases amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars has given districts a chance to offer teacher raises that were difficult to include in previous budgets, the Kansas News Service reports. Fast-tracking teaching assistants and other professionals to head classrooms is the other part of the plan. Education officials say they believe the upcoming funding boost will alleviate teacher shortages.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: University of Louisville professor Stuart Williams was experimenting with a case of bourbon when he made an accidental discovery – a drop of the spirit, when diluted and evaporated under certain conditions, formed a microscopic pattern of thin strands. Williams calls the pattern a “whiskey web,” which looks like a lattice of lightning when it’s lit up. And he believes it may prove to be a unique “fingerprint” that can be used to identify different bourbons, although his research is still in the early stages. Thousands of flavors contribute to the taste of a bourbon, Williams says, and he believes the physical components that make up those flavors, such as fatty acids, are primarily responsible for generating these webs. Only American whiskeys, which are aged in a new, charred barrel, appear to create these webs, based on the research so far, he says.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A new federally led study of oil seeping from a platform toppled off Louisiana’s coast 14 1/ 2 years ago finds releases lower than other recent estimates but contradicts the well owner’s assertions about the amount and source of oil. Oil and gas have been leaking into the Gulf of Mexico since a subsea mudslide caused by Hurricane Ivan on Sept. 15, 2004, knocked over a Taylor Energy Co. production platform. Taylor is fighting a federal order to cap the well. The company says oil sheens on the water’s surface indicate there’s only a dribble of oil. The new report says its findings contradict that. The scientists used sonar and a new tool they call a “bubblometer” to estimate the seepage. Taylor says it wants verifiable scientific data about the leak and a scientifically and environmentally sound solution.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: City officials are waiting on a decision from the state about whether new African immigrants here can receive state assistance. The Portland Press Herald reports the Portland City Council canceled a meeting that had been scheduled for Monday to discuss financial support for the asylum-seekers. Mayor Ethan Strimling says the city postponed the meeting to give Gov. Janet Mills more time. More than 200 people were staying at an emergency shelter in Portland late last week. Most are from Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and they’re seeking asylum in the United States. City Manager Jon Jennings says the number of immigrants arriving in the city seems to have stabilized in recent days. They’re staying at a basketball arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Assateague Island welcomed new life Friday with the birth of a wild horse. “Ms. Macky,” also known as N2BHS-AL, gave birth to a male bay pinto colt. “The new foal, N2BHS-ALR, and band live most of the year in the very busy developed area and campgrounds. For this reason, the National Park Service expressly reminds visitors that it is essential to remain a minimum of a bus length (40’) away from the wild horses at all times,” the National Park Service said in a release. About two-thirds of foals in the Assateague Island National Seashore are born in April, May and June. “A mare will be very protective of her new foal and it is vitally important for their well-being that visitors give them, and all of the wild horses, plenty of space,” the release said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Researchers on Cape Cod are launching a new study focused on the hunting and feeding habits of the region’s great white sharks following last year’s two attacks on humans. Greg Skomal, a state marine biologist leading the effort, says the hope is to contribute critical information to the ongoing debate over how to keep Cape beachgoers safe. The new research calls for placing sophisticated tags on sharks to track their swimming speed, depth and body position in the water. Skomal says researchers also hope to determine how many seals great whites are eating and whether that’s affecting the seal population. Local officials have been wrestling for months with how to respond to public concern over last year’s attacks, which included the state’s first shark-related fatality in more than 80 years.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: State officials are questioning whether crews digging water service lines in the city near an American Indian burial ground found human remains after an inspector found work was being conducted without an archaeologist. The Flint Journal reports the inquiry came in a June 18 letter from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to Flint Public Works Director Robert Bincsik. The work appears to have been done without required professional oversight, violating an agreement among the state, Flint and the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan. The letter asks for details and plans for future work. City spokeswoman Candice Mushatt says no human remains were found, and the city is seeking an archaeologist so excavation can continue.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Starting July 1, Minnesotans who rape their spouses finally can be charged with sexual assault. Wage theft becomes a crime. And drug manufacturers will help shoulder the costs of the opioid epidemic. Those are some new laws taking effect July 1 along with the state’s new $48 billion budget. Minnesota will have what sponsors say is the country’s toughest wage theft law. It comes down hard on employers who cheat workers by making it a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. An estimated 39,000 Minnesotans annually are victims of wage theft in some form. Drug manufacturers and distributors will now have to pay much higher registration fees, which will raise about $21 million annually to help fight the opioid epidemic in the state.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A historical marker has been placed near the river where two men in southern Mississippi said they were abducted by aliens in 1973. News outlets report the city of Pascagoula dedicated the marker Saturday at Lighthouse Park. Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker said they were on the shores of the Pascagoula River when what appeared to be aliens pulled them onboard a UFO, examined them for about 30 minutes and then returned them to Earth. Both reported the event to the sheriff’s department and were checked out at a hospital after it happened Oct. 11, 1973. The story has become known worldwide. Parker published a book about the experience in 2018. Hickson died in 2011. Both said many people doubted their story. A few witnesses have come forward to corroborate some details.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A judge ruled Monday that the state’s lone abortion clinic can continue performing abortions through Friday but kicked the clinic’s lawsuit out of court. St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer extended a preliminary injunction he previously issued in order to give a Planned Parenthood affiliate in the city time to take a licensing fight before an administrative panel. Stelzer ruled the clinic has not yet exhausted its options outside court to handle the dispute over its license to perform abortions. The state health department on Friday declined to renew the clinic’s abortion license. The judge directed Planned Parenthood to take the issue up with the Administrative Hearing Commission, a panel that typically handles disputes between state agencies and businesses or individuals.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana Rail Link has been awarded a $3.5 million federal grant to design a safety system for a railway between southern Montana and northern Idaho. The Billings Gazette reports the Federal Rail Administration grant will fund the design and environmental review of implementing a positive train control, an automated system to stop a train before a crash. The safety system would be designed to identify potential problems and warn train operators. It would stop the train if the operator doesn’t act. Montana Rail Link aims to install the system on the 655-mile line running from near Billings to Sandpoint, Idaho. The grant was awarded under the federal Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements Program and the Special Transportation Circumstances Program.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Visitors to Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium can now see two newborn sea lion pups in the zoo’s Sea Lion Pavilion. The first pup was born June 12 to 9-year-old Gemini. Another was born Tuesday to 10-year-old Coco. The sexes of the pups are not yet known. The sea lion pups and their mothers are on display with the father of both pups, 15-year-old Chino. The zoo currently has eight sea lions: two males, four females and the two pups. Next year, the zoo is set to open Owen Sea Lion Shores, a new sea lion habitat that will include underwater viewing. The area also will include a natural beach that will allow females to give birth on land and gradually introduce pups to the water, as they would in their natural habitats.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Eldorado Resorts will buy Caesars in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $17.3 billion, creating a casino giant. The acquisition Monday puts about 60 casinos and resorts in 16 states under a single name, one of the biggest gambling and entertainment ventures in the United States. “Together, we will have an extremely powerful suite of iconic gaming and entertainment brands, as well as valuable strategic alliances with industry leaders in sports betting and online gaming,” Eldorado CEO Tom Reeg said in a statement. The company, which will be called Caesars, will be led by Reeg, along with Eldorado Chairman Gary Carano. It will be based in Reno, where Eldorado is based, with a “significant corporate presence” in Las Vegas, where Caesars is based.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire is going to help residents who want to support the state’s pollinators by creating wildflower meadows. The university says pollinators such as bees are critical for New England’s fruit and vegetable crops, and residents have the ability to help by enhancing local habitats. The university is hosting a free event on the subject July 30 at the New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station’s Woodman Horticultural Research Farm in Durham. The university says the state has a diverse set of native bees, but habitat loss is a threat to the pollinators. Cathy Neal, a researcher with the agricultural experiment station, says hundreds of pollinator gardens and habitats have been installed in the Granite State in recent years.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMorris County: A photo of a 3-year-old lab mix as he sat beside his recently deceased owner’s empty hospital bed went viral and resulted in his adoption. The dog named Moose was photographed waiting for his owner to return to the hospital bed, apparently unaware he had died, according to a post on the Eleventh Hour Rescue’s Facebook page. Moose was returned to the county-based shelter and its Randolph kennels, where his new family found him. “MOOSE HAS BEEN ADOPTED by a wonderful family who will care for and love him for the rest of his life!” Eleventh Hour Rescue said in the social media post. “Thank you again from the bottom of our hearts! We wish all of our dogs had the same chance at finding a home as Moose does now!”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A longtime advocate and employee of the University of New Mexico University Libraries is donating his collection of rare George Orwell books. The university says professor and curator emeritus Russ Davidson has agreed to donate his Orwell book collection, which includes first editions of “Animal Farm” and “1984” in various languages. Davidson’s extensive collection also includes scarce editions of many of Orwell’s other books, essays and journalistic writings. The collection will be part of an Orwell exhibit in Zimmerman Library from September through next spring. Davidson worked at University Libraries for 25 years. The British-born Orwell was known for his allegorical novella “Animal Farm” and dystopian novel “1984,” both of which tackled totalitarianism. “1984” has become a best-seller in the U.S. again during the Trump administration.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: During Pride month, “somewhere over the rainbow” means crossing the street – over the multicolored crosswalk leading to the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. On Saturday evening, crews from the city’s Department of Transportation painted the pedestrian crossing closest to Stonewall, at Christopher Street and Seventh Avenue, in solidarity with the LGBTQ community. That pavement was hardly celebratory 50 years ago, in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, when a police raid on Stonewall touched off riots that inspired the global Pride movement. The Stonewall Inn is now part of a national monument honoring LGBTQ civil rights. Embedded in the epoxy base of the new Village crosswalk are U.S. pennies from 1969, along with a Stonewall 50 logo enamel pin.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTrenton: Nine months after Hurricane Florence inundated the state, communities such as this one illustrate the slow and uneven pace of recovery. With hurricane season starting June 1, the courthouse and jail have yet to reopen as judges hear cases in an office building and inmates are housed in another county. Dozens are seeking federal buyouts of ruined homes, threatening Trenton’s tax base. Even the mayor has yet to move back into her house, due to a shortage of available construction workers. The county also lacks a newspaper or television station to help tell its story. But several residents say that charities have helped spread the word and have done work to get them moved back in, offering hope. The September 2018 hurricane turned downtown into a shallow lake of muddy water, flooding 106 homes – all but about 20 of the town’s households, town officials say.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The Ralph Engelstad Arena at the University of North Dakota is preparing to unveil what it calls the largest video display in college hockey, a 50,000-pound scoreboard manufactured by South Dakota-based Daktronics. The Engelstad Family Foundation, which has been at odds with recently departed school president Mark Kennedy over a basketball floor logo and other issues, has donated $4 million for the $6 million project. The remaining $2 million is coming out of the building’s long-term repair and building fund. Arena manager Jody Hodgson says the idea to upgrade the video display was suggested by foundation trustee Kris Engelstad McGarry about a year and a half ago. Hodgson says the four 34-foot-wide by 15.5-foot-high video boards complement “the original vision” of Ralph Engelstad, a former North Dakota hockey player.\n\nOhio\n\nAshland: BalloonFest is back. The 29th annual extravaganza will be held at Ashland’s Freer Field from Thursday through Saturday. Mindi White, president of Ashland BalloonFest, says 30 hot air balloons are scheduled to be part of this year’s festivities. Food vendors will open at 4 p.m. Thursday, though opening ceremonies won’t happen until 6:15 p.m. on the main stage. The media flight is scheduled to follow at 6:30. The first of three balloon glows will take place at 9:15. All flights will be dependent on the weather. Balloon glows will take place at the same time Friday and Saturday. Saturday’s balloon glow has been named in honor of John Moran, who had taken part in 23 BalloonFests and died at last year’s event when he hit his head on burners while disassembling his balloon.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Drivers who owe fines and fees for traffic violations will be able to settle for pennies on the dollar under an amnesty program approved by the City Council. Beginning July 1, drivers whose citations were issued at least two years ago will have until March 31 to resolve them. People who can’t pay their fines and fees could have their costs waived. People who have dragged their feet to pay a basic traffic ticket or show up for court will be able to settle for $155, a reduction from $613. The cost of the same ticket for someone who pays on time is $172. Officials say the program could help resolve more than 116,000 outstanding cases and help people with suspended driver’s licenses to get them back.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A law passed by the Legislature gives farmers and ranchers immunity from liability while fighting dangerous wildfires, such as the one that chewed through acres of wheat fields and grasslands last year, The Capitol Press reports. The law is similar to one that prevents bystanders from being sued if they try to help during an emergency, according to the newspaper. Gov. Kate Brown signed the bill last week at a ceremony with the Oregon Wheat Growers League. Wheat farmers were the first to respond to the rapidly spreading fire and used their disc plows and water trucks to slow it down before any firefighters arrived. The blaze destroyed 122 square miles of dry wheat fields and grasslands and was devastating for wheat farmers. Its sponsor, Sen. Bill Hansell, R-Athena, says the farmers who used their plows to create dirt firebreaks around homes and small communities were critical in slowing the flames.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Lawmakers say a just-unveiled compromise budget package won’t include any extra money for the state to bolster federal census efforts. House Republican officials said Monday that there’s no need for the state to help fund a federal government function. A commission tapped by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf to study how to ensure an accurate census in Pennsylvania had asked for $1 per person to aid the outreach, or close to $13 million. Some states are undertaking a similar analysis and, in some cases, devoting money to the cause. The government takes a headcount every 10 years to allocate seats in Congress and billions in federal dollars for such things as transportation projects and education. Wolf’s office says the state would lose almost $2,100 a year for each person who isn’t counted.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNorth Kingstown: A company specializing in wind power blade maintenance has chosen the state for its U.S. headquarters, a sign of Rhode Island’s growing offshore wind industry. Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor told the Boston Globe last week that British company GEV Wind Power has committed to staying at Quonset Point in North Kingstown for at least 12 years. The company plans to create 125 jobs in the state. Pryor says he traveled to the United Kingdom twice in recent months to secure the deal. Pryor acknowledged that Massachusetts is building its role in the wind power industry but says Rhode Island is the “first mover” in this field. The Rhode Island Commerce Corp. was scheduled to vote Monday on a $1.9 million tax credit for GEV.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: This year, the Confederate flag won’t temporarily be raised at the Statehouse to mark the day it was permanently taken down. A group calling for racial fairness – Showing Up for Racial Justice Columbia – has a permit to rally on the grounds July 10. The South Carolina Secessionist Party has raised a Confederate flag on a temporary flagpole the past three years to protest the date the rebel banner was permanently removed. Showing Up for Racial Justice Columbia founder Sarah Keeling told The State newspaper she applied for the permit the minute it was available so the Secessionist Party couldn’t gather. Officials review requests to hold events partly to prevent conflicts with other groups. The Secessionist Party might not have shown up because the group has splintered.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Arc of Dreams is changing the city’s skyline. And once it’s standing, the massive art piece that will be SculptureWalk’s staple art piece downtown itself will change from day to day thanks to an illumination system at the base of each side of the arc. The arc is equipped with 18 high-powered LED bulbs – nine on each side – that will splash color onto the steel structure from the ground up. In each bulb are red, white, green and blue diodes, which can be mixed and matched to create any number of colors. The lights are connected to digital software that will give SculptureWalk the ability to schedule color changes and even create the look of movement by rapidly changing colors that are splashing up and down the arc.\n\nTennessee\n\nMartin: A couple is donating $22 million to provide scholarships at the University of Tennessee-Martin, marking the largest gift in campus history. A news release says the gift by Bill and Rosann Nunnelly was announced during the University of Tennessee’s board meeting Friday. The donation will occur after the Nunnellys’ deaths, although four Hickman County students will begin receiving scholarships this fall. Dickson, Giles, Lawrence, Lewis, Maury and Humphreys county students could qualify for future scholarships. More than 90 scholarships could be awarded annually. Bill Nunnelly was raised on a farm in the Hickman County community bearing his family’s name. The semi-retired entrepreneur earned an undergraduate degree from UT Martin in 1970.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: A worldwide sailing competition has returned to the city this week as the 2019 CITGO Etchells World Championship Regatta is contested on Corpus Christi Bay. The weeklong event will feature nearly 120 sailors from across the world, competing for the coveted championship trophy. Racing begins at noon Tuesday and is at the same time each day through Saturday. The Etchells sailboat traces it roots back to the 1950s, when E.W. “Skip” Etchells designed a boat for a yachting magazine competition to find a new three-man Olympic keelboat. The design lost out to the “Soling” for the Olympics but took hold in other sailing competitions. The boat is just over 30 feet long and has a main sail area of 188 square feet. It is considered one of the most popular competition boats in the world.\n\nUtah\n\nWest Haven: As the state’s population booms, some farmers in Weber County are making the tough but sometimes lucrative decision to sell their land as small family plots give way to homes. The Standard-Examiner reports that Phil Green is among Ogden-area farmers who recently sold land to housing developers. Green sold 56 acres that his family used for a dairy farm and to grow hay and corn. Today, more than 100 new houses fill that land. Green says it was hard to let the land go, and he sometimes cries when he walks through the subdivision. But he’s also glad he had the opportunity to sell. Weber County Commissioner Scott Jenkins says selling the land is sometimes a no-brainer for farmers struggling to make profits working the land.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state Fish & Wildlife Department is looking for volunteers to count bats this summer. The department says the little brown bat is endangered in the state, and long-term volunteer monitoring is critical to its management and recovery. It’s holding a training session for volunteers next week in Fair Haven. The little brown bat population has declined by up to 90% in Vermont. Volunteer citizen scientists help by monitoring rare colonies of female bats and their young. State biologist Alyssa Bennett says the state has shown that the small surviving population appears to be holding steady. The free presentation and training will be held Friday at Bomoseen State Park from 8 p.m. to after dusk. Afterward, volunteers will be given sites to monitor.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia is considering a petition to remove a statue of a Revolutionary War hero because it depicts a potential attack on Native Americans. The Daily Progress reports that the school’s segregation commission is considering a petition to remove a statue of George Rogers Clark from campus that shows him and his soldiers possibly about to attack a group of Native Americans. The statue calls Clark the “Conqueror of the Northwest” and was given to the school in the 1920s. Clark led a militia that fought the British and their Native American allies during the Revolutionary War. In 1779 he routed the British from Fort Sackville in the Battle of Vincennes in present-day Indiana. He is the brother of William Clark, who co-led the Lewis and Clark expedition.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: Wind is damaging the state’s cherry crop, but how much is not yet known. “Some say significant, but we won’t know until it runs over the line,” said B.J. Thurlby, president of Northwest Cherry Growers in Yakima, referring to when wind-damaged fruit reaches packing lines. Before winds reaching 35 mph hit the area last Wednesday, up to 90% of cherries were being packed, which is an excellent rate, Thurlby told the Capital Press. That percentage will probably drop. Wind bangs cherries around, bruising them as they hit or rub branches, leaves and other cherries. The riper the fruit, the more susceptible to damage they are. Rainiers bruise more easily than dark cherries. A lighter crop helps in some areas because clusters aren’t so tight, putting cherries in constant contact with each other.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The leader of the state’s Republican Party is applauding a state senator’s call for intolerance against members of the LGBTQ community. Republican state Sen. Mike Azinger wrote an opinion article Sunday titled “The Shame of LGBTQ Pride” in The Parkersburg News and Sentinel after the paper covered a gay pride picnic. State GOP chairwoman Melody Potter then wrote on Facebook that Azinger’s article was “right on.” Azinger wrote that “sexual deviancy is going mainstream” and said the solution “is not political correctness and tolerance.” Azinger says he’s taking a biblical position. Potter did not return a call to her office. Andrew Schneider, executive director of the advocacy group Fairness West Virginia, says Potter and Azinger are forgetting their scripture when it comes to loving others.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison is setting up a new marker recognizing the campus as the ancestral home of the Ho-Chunk tribe. The university announced Monday that UW-Madison leaders and Ho-Chunk Nation officials dedicated the plaque on Bascom Hill on Thursday. The marker is entitled “Our Shared Future” and acknowledges the campus occupies ancestral Ho-Chunk land, a place the tribe called Teejop. The marker notes the tribe was forced to give up the territory in 1832. The plaque says both the federal and state government tried unsuccessfully to force the tribe out of Wisconsin, but UW-Madison recognizes the Ho-Chunk Nation’s sovereignty, as well as the sovereignty of the other 11 tribes that reside in the state. The marker will be part of all prospective student tours.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A national park and a nonprofit group plan to spend $8 million to improve boating facilities and address environmental damage along the Snake River in western Wyoming. The Snake River Gateways campaign is a joint effort between Grand Teton National Park and the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. The project will focus on boat launches and landings near Moose, Pacific Creek and Jackson Lake Dam. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports plans call for adding shelter for visitors at the busy landing site at Moose. The boat ramp at Pacific Creek will be replaced, and a nearby parking area will be reconfigured. The Jackson Lake Dam site will also get a new boat ramp and parking area.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2017/07/14/archive-exploring-charms-frenchtown-hunterdon-county/479349001/", "title": "Archive: Exploring the charms of Frenchtown in Hunterdon County", "text": "Virginia Rohan\n\nStaff Writer\n\nI've always had a thing for cute little towns, locales that evoke other times and places. So it was a happy day when I discovered the tiny and charming Frenchtown.\n\n\n\nThat happened about a decade ago, quite by happenstance — which I suspect is how many people stumble upon this picturesque borough. As I recall, my husband Bob and I were taking back roads home from a far better known New Jersey river town —Lambertville — when we suddenly found ourselves on a quaint-looking main street with one section that seemed straight out of a village in Normandy.\n\n\n\nFrenchtown — like Ocean Grove, Chester and Lambertville — has since become one of my favorite cute little towns in the Garden State.\n\n\n\nLocated along the banks of the Delaware River in Hunterdon County — across the small Uhlerstown-Frenchtown Bridge from Bucks County, Pa. — the borough, formed by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 4, 1867, got its name from an early tract-holder, Swiss-born Paul Henri Mallet-Prevost, who purchased the land in 1794. He and other early settlers spoke French, which led some locals to begin calling the place \"Frenchtown.\"\n\n\n\nNowadays, there's an annual celebration of France's Bastille Day, which is actually today — July 14 — but will be observed in Frenchtown on Saturday. This annual event features \"live music, great food, art and family fun.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's been an interesting event, since [the town] was named after someone who spoke French, but was actually Swiss,\" says David Miller, who no longer lives in Frenchtown, but still visits often and remains one of the town's unofficial historians, having lived there for 25 years.\n\nBASTILLE DAY:Where to eat French food\n\nOUTDOORS:Where to get out on the water this summer\n\nDINING:Rutherford Food Crawl: 6 great spots\n\nOn a recent weekday, Bob and I made the roughly one-hour trip from our Ringwood home and meandered along the main drag. As we walked along down toward the river, we checked out whatever shops were open. (Note to the wise: If you want to shop, check the website, Frenchtownnj.org, for store hours before you go. We didn't and let's just say that retail-wise, my husband was happier with the outcome than I.)\n\n\n\nOne place that was open was the delightful new Merge Gallery (26 Race St.). Opened in April it is, owner Christopher Hiltey explained, \"a merge of art, antiques and architectural.\" Hiltey, an artist-sculptor who lives in Stockton, sells everything from midcentury art and furniture to antiques to his own sculptures and self-made and/or repurposed furniture (some of the latter in a charming side garden he installed). And some of Hiltey's welded sculptures are on display directly across the street.\n\n\n\n\"I think it's an up-and-coming art community,\" says Hiltey, who describes Frenchtown as \"a sleepy little river town\" that's geared to a more \"mature\" crowd. \"If you come back there at 10 o'clock at night, the whole place is closed down. It's not the riff-raff ... It's got a laid-back, cool energy to it.\"\n\n\n\nAcross Race Street you'll find stores like Modern Love (23 Race St.), B. Mila (29) and Grouse Studios (17), owned by artist Julia Rose, who has been in this location for 5 1/2 years and had a previous shop around the corner.\n\n\n\n\"I like that there are so many artistic-minded people here,\" says Rose. \"I just find it serene and beautiful living along the river. I get a lot of inspiration from it.\"\n\n\n\nRace Street curves around into Bridge Street (which also has a number of neat-looking stores to explore), and at the elbow-like juncture of the two is that aforementioned European-looking stretch. At the café (What's Brewin' at Maria's, 52 Bridge St.), I can just picture people with berets and poodles at the sidewalk tables taking in the scene.\n\n\n\nMost of the buildings in this little section recently underwent extensive renovations, Miller says. Race Street continues as a walkway that has colorful storefronts and brick pavers.\n\n\"The reason it's called Race Street is that the raceway for the mill came from the creek further north and went underneath some of those [renovated] buildings and underneath a couple of other buildings before it became above the surface for a short period then went right into the mill, which is at the end of that walkway,\" he says, adding that while you would no longer recognize it as such, \"it was a very popular and busy mill back in the 19th century.\"\n\n\n\nOn our most recent visit, we had a casual lunch on a covered patio of the hopping Bridge Café (8 Bridge St.), a small restaurant and bakery that's located in what was Frenchtown's once-booming rail station. (The Belvidere-Delaware Railroad line was built in about 1853 and continued to operate as a freight-only line until 1976.) Our food and drink was delicious (birch beer is a specialty) and served by a waiter who entertained his customers with magic (coin and card) tricks.\n\n\n\nOn previous trips, we've stopped to eat at The Frenchtown Inn (7 Bridge St.), which was built in the 19th century, when Frenchtowngrew and prospered, and bustled with local mills. Long a hotel (during the 1930s, Nathanael West lived and wrote there), TheFrenchtown Inn is now known for its fine dining. Nearby, The National Hotel (31 Race St.) still operates as a hotel, and also has a restaurant and bar, as well as The Rathskeller, a cellar pub that dates to 1851, when, its website says, \"the original building was rebuilt from a stagecoach stop and a brothel to what the building is today.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Miller, after World War II, Frenchtown \"sort of stagnated\" for a long while, but in the early 1980s, it \"went through a renaissance,\" thanks to an influx of grant money. \"Streets got fixed up and curbing and sidewalks ...There've been a lot of grants since then, but that was the impetus that turned things around in the very early Eighties.\"\n\n\n\nThen, Miller says, \"People from out of the area were buying buildings, and that's when the renovations started. So, from the middle of the Eighties till now, there's been constant rehabbing of buildings to where it is today. It's gorgeous.\"\n\n\n\nAfter lunch, we walked along a tree-shaded path that's part of the Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park Trail, which runs continuously for nearly 70 miles and follows the towpath of the canal, which was built in the early 1830s as a transportation corridor between Philadelphia and New York.\n\n\n\nOn our stroll, we saw lots of bicyclists and couples with dogs and with children, including a dad and his young daughter who emerged, very wet, from the Delaware, where they'd been tubing.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, one of Frenchtown's most famous residents — and biggest cheerleaders — has been \"Eat, Pray, Love\" author Elizabeth Gilbert. She and second husband Jose Nunes — whom she called Felipe in that best-selling 2006 memoir and the 2010 sequel \"Committed\" — bought and restored an Italianate Victorian that was built in 1869 by the great-grandson of John Reading, Colonial New Jersey's first native-born governor. They also opened a massive store called Two Buttons, which they filled with statues, jewelry, furniture and textiles from all over the globe.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago, Gilbert sold the Victorian and moved into a smaller house closer to the heart of town. In March, she and Nunes closed Two Buttons, and on July 1, Gilbert told her 1.6 million Facebook followers that she was separating from her husband, writing, \"He has been my dear companion for over 12 years, and they have been wonderful years. Our split is very amicable. Our reasons are very personal.\"\n\n\n\nIn happier days together, Gilbert wrote, \"There's a reason we live in Frenchtown. Because it's The Greatest.\"\n\n\n\nAnd yet, judging from my own circle of friends, there are still many folks who have yet to discover this cute little Jersey town.\n\n\n\n\"Actually, the slogan of the town for quite awhile was, 'Frenchtown — the best-kept secret,' \" says Rose, the artist and shop owner. \"But now it's 'Frenchtown is magnetic,' because once you come once you tend to repeat the visit.\"\n\n\n\nSo true. Frenchtown is magnetic — and magnifique.\n\nIf you go (updated for 2017):\n\n\n\nWHAT: Frenchtown's annual Bastille Day Fete.\n\n\n\nWHEN: 3 to 9 p.m., Saturday, July 15.\n\n\n\nDETAILS: Visitors can enjoy art, music, mimes, puppets, a waiter race and more throughout the town, and shops and restaurants will offer Bastille Day specials (The Lovin' Oven will serve a pastry creme-filled napoleon, Madeleine cookies and creme puffs, for example).\n\nHOW MUCH: Free. Parking will be available just off Route 12, along the river, in the Design Plan Lighting lot on Route 29 and at OldFrenchtown Field on Harrison and Eighth Street — all of which are within walking distance of the festivities.\n\n\n\nMORE INFO: Delaware River Towns site, frenchtownnj.org or the Frenchtown page on Facebook.\n\nThings to do:\n\nIf you can't make Bastille Day or you'd like to more actively explore Frenchtown, here are two possibilities:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/14"}]}

Kim Reynolds, joined veteran riders for the day, gliding along the wide, smooth highways of central Iowa.\n\nUp to 60,000 riders or more passed through Slater, Madrid, Polk City and Ankeny before proceeding down U.S. 69 ― Ankeny Boulevard ― to Des Moines, where it becomes East 14th Street. RAGBRAI last came to Des Moines in 2013.\n\nBikes streamed through the downtown streets and past the steps of the Iowa Capitol, where riders stopped for pictures. Some cheered and threw their hands into the air as they passed under a large, inflatable banner reading \"desmoines-apalooza\"\n\nDarren and Ann Patrick of Dallas posed with their bikes for a time-delayed photo on the Capitol steps.\n\nHaving grown up in the Quad Cities and been away for more than 20 years, the couple said participating in their first RAGBRAI was a sort of homecoming. Plus with the 50th anniversary, they said they couldn't pass up the chance to be a part of history.\n\n\"That's why we wanted to do it,\" said Darren Patrick, 53.\n\nMore:RAGBRAI's 50th anniversary ride is coming to Des Moines! Here's what to know\n\nThe Wednesday night campground was set up at Water Works Park, where a free concert by Lynyrd Skynyrd and other entertainment is planned at Lauridsen Amphitheater.\n\nThe Patricks said they were intrigued to see what the crowds would look like as the massive ride picked up tag-alongs throughout Wednesday's route.\n\n\"We're interested in what's going to happen here,\" Darren Patrick said. \"People scared us. First, they said there's going to be 30,000 people ― no, there's going to be 60,000 ― there's going to be 100,000 people! So we don't know.\"\n\nTens of thousands join the ride to Des Moines\n\nAbout 9,000 registered one-day riders were expected to join the 20,000 registered weeklong riders Wednesday. And their ranks were swelled by tens of thousands of unregistered cyclists who wanted to be a part of the historic day.\n\nDes Moines RAGBRAI officials said they expected 60,000 riders ― a number that would far exceed the previously largest day, a 2018 ride from Winterset to Indianola through Norwalk that drew 40,000.\n\nThe Tremmel family parked their car in uptown Ankeny with plans to ride just the final 15 miles of the day's route. As they lathered on sunscreen and unloaded their bikes, 10-year-old Liam Tremmel had a clear goal in mind: tacos.\n\n\"We're hoping there's food at (Water Works Park),\" said dad Nick Tremmel. \"If not, somebody missed the memo.\"\n\nMichael Josten of Clear Lake and Mason Winsauer of West Lafayette, Indiana, joined the ride in Ames Wednesday morning. Josten said he did a similar one-day stretch on last year's RAGBRAI.\n\n\"One day's about all I can take off work,\" he said.\n\nMore:See live video of RAGBRAI's Des Moines arrival, departure on city SkyCam\n\nAlso among the many one-day riders was the governor, who started the day in Ames with her brothers, her nephews and a few friends.\n\n“I have been wanting, honestly, to do this for a really long time, and it's just really hard with my schedule to get it done,” said Reynolds, who was having a quick cup of coffee before the ride. “So, I am really excited to finally be riding on RAGBRAI and then to have it be the 50th anniversary and then to have my family.”\n\nMore:Gov. Kim Reynolds joins her first RAGBRAI: 'Such a legacy'\n\nMore heat ahead Thursday and Friday\n\nWednesday was the hottest day so far of the week-long ride, which began Sunday in Sioux City and will end Saturday in Davenport.\n\nThe heat Wednesday topped out at 95 degrees, a little lower than expected, though the heat index, or “feels like” temperature, reached 105 and Des Moines was under a heat advisory.\n\nThe route from Ames to Des Moines, however, was the shortest and flattest of the week, giving riders a bit of a break after some long, high-mileage days.\n\nPlus, Iowans were ready to welcome sweaty riders with sprinklers, water bottles, popsicles and more.\n\nMedicap Pharmacy manager Krystal Bell set up a luau-themed \"hydration station\" in front of the business on Garfield Avenue in Des Moines, complete with water, Liquid IV and BIolyte. But the crowd favorite appeared to be a large beach ball sprinkler perched nearby on the lawn.\n\nRiders navigated toward the sidewalk hoping to get spritzed before moving along, and a few stopped to drench their heads. Many of them yelled thank yous or gave grateful nods and smiles.\n\n\"It's fun sitting here watching them all zig-zag over to get into it,\" she said.\n\nDes Moines hospitals reported that, despite the thousands of riders exerting themselves in the heat, they weren’t seeing many heat-related illnesses in their emergency rooms.\n\nUnity Point said the only one it had by midday was not from the ride, and Broadlawns had none. Mercy One reported four RAGBRAI-related cases, but it wasn't clear if any stemmed from the heat.\n\nStill, the scorching weather is expected to continue across Iowa through Friday.\n\nThe National Weather Service predicts a Thursday high of 99 degrees in Des Moines, and 98 degrees at the campground in Tama. Thursday's ride will be just shy of 90 miles, the longest of the trip, and will have the most elevation gain.\n\nOne bit of good fortune: The forecast Thursday calls for a tailwind that will help push the riders along.\n\nFirst-timer David DiCarlo is used to riding in the heat where he lives in Austin, Texas. But he said the sweltering ride was daunting, especially compared with his usual five-mile commute to work.\n\n\"I left Austin to get out of the heat,\" he joked. \"I came to the wrong place.\"\n\nRAGBRAI plans to provide extra support-and-gear vans, or SAG wagons, and buses on the route to aid riders who need a lift.\n\nAlso, riders are advised to pace themselves, as some were clearly doing Wednesday, stopping in the shade of downtown skyscrapers and dodging into air-conditioned bars and restaurants, clearly in no hurry to complete the ride.\n\n“Know your limits,” RAGBRAI ride director Matt Phippen said in Madrid, where he was urging riders to hydrate and eat to keep their temperatures down and energy up. “If you think you could push forward and your body is acting funny, there’s a chance that your body telling you that you need to slow down and you need to stop, so listen to your body.\n\n“Like I’ve always said, this is not a race, it’s a ride and you’ll get there in the end.”\n\nRiders wary of swelling crowds, tight-packed roads\n\nRAGBRAI riders new and old told the Register they had been nervous about the number of people participating in this year's ride.\n\nThe crowds were particularly notable on Sunday, as the mass of participants set out from Sioux City. One rider said the first seven to 10 miles were like \"being in rush hour traffic in New York.\"\n\nCrowded roads and new riders led to a busy first day for both the SAG wagons, which pick up bikes from riders who are unable to complete the route, and for ambulance transports.\n\nGoing into Wednesday, with even more riders expected to join the route, riders were apprehensive.\n\nTaking a breather at TrailSide Tap in Ankeny, eight-time RAGBRAI rider Terri Whitson said it was \"a little scary\" to prepare for the crowded roads, and she said part of the route Wednesday morning required them to walk their bikes in the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd.\n\nBut overall, North Carolina resident Whitson said the crowds were not as bad as she expected.\n\n\"I thought it was going to be so packed, but there has been plenty of room, people are being safe,\" she said. \"I think it's been really good.\"\n\nJason Livingston, a Beaver, Pennsylvania, resident riding his first RAGBRAI, acknowledged there was \"a little anxiety\" associated with the upcoming ride to Des Moines.\n\n\"Not going to be a lot of space to move around,\" Livingston said. \"But we'll see if the heat chases people away.\"\n\nRiders had to navigate crowds off the bike as well, as thousands of cyclists jockeyed for the same food stands and bar stools.\n\nMarlene and Gary Read of Florida said they struggled to find shuttle busses to take them to nightly concerts, and they've had to wait in long lines for food, which has been made even more difficult by Marlene's gluten allergy.\n\n\"It's just packed, and the lines are so long. I don't know where to go to eat,\" Marlene Read said.\n\nEven so, the Reads said their first RAGBRAI has been unforgettable.\n\n\"I love the bike ride,\" Marlene Read said. \"It's been challenging. I think the challenge of it too for me is something I'm finding I'm enjoying. … it empowers you a bit.\"\n\n'I'm so glad it's still going'\n\nLiving up to \"Iowa nice,\" residents along East 14th Street, the route that brought the riders into the city, greeted RAGBRAIers with Indian food, burgers and brats, music and lemonade stands.\n\nEast 14th Street resident Calista Nichols and her son laid out Gatorade, water and popsicles on a stand in front of their home. By noon, she said, she had already met riders from as far away as Jamaica.\n\nNichols, who rode RAGBRAI multiple times in the early 2000s, said she wanted to be outside to cheer on passersby.\n\n\"We're telling them they've only got 8 miles left to go,\" she said. \"It's really nice to see people out alongside the roads, cheering you on. It gives you the extra burst.\"\n\nNichols said she was thrilled the ride made it to its 50th year.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" she said. \"I'm so glad it's still going.\"\n\nMore:See RAGBRAI 2023 from above as cyclists ride through Iowa State's Jack Trice Stadium", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/26/burro-bandits-sugarcane-shake-naked-bike-ride-news-around-states/40010601/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state will require new forms for getting married beginning Thursday. The Alabama Department of Public Health issued guidance about the new process last week. Instead of a marriage license, couples will fill out a new form, have it notarized and then take it to the probate judge within 30 days. A wedding ceremony is no longer required, but a couple can still have one if they choose. The Legislature this year voted to change marriage procedures to accommodate conservative probate judges who objected to same-sex marriage. A few probate judges had refused to issue marriage licenses to anyone so they didn’t have to give them to gay couples. Republican Sen. Greg Albritton proposed the change, saying it should allow people to get marriage documents everywhere.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Charlene Zanoria used her summer internship to give underrepresented cultures a moment in the spotlight. Zanoria, a freshman at University of Alaska Southeast and graduate of Thunder Mountain High School, interned for Juneau Public Libraries this summer. For her connected learning project – an effort that combines interests, supportive relationships and learning – she came up with a celebration of people of color that featured music, dancing and food, Capital City Weekly reports. “I wanted to make an event that would include minorities that aren’t normally represented in the library,” she said. Zanoria, who is Filipina, said she hoped P.O.C. Palooza, which was held Aug. 16, reminded people Juneau Public Libraries are for the entire community. Among featured songs and performances were some that incorporated the Maori culture of New Zealand.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state starts a first-of-its-kind experiment Tuesday. Ninety days after the legislative session ended, the state will roll out a professional licensing law that Gov. Doug Ducey has touted as a game-changing tool to make it easier to move to Arizona and work in a range of regulated fields, from cosmetology to real estate and optometry. Known as universal recognition, the policy was a central part of Ducey’s legislative agenda this year and just one of several steps to roll back the power of state boards that oversee numerous skilled professions. The governor argues that those bodies have, at times, abused their power or gotten in the way of job-seekers. Arizona is the first state to try universal recognition, but the policy’s potential for real change remains unclear.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Cheryl Maples, an attorney who successfully challenged the state’s gay marriage ban before the nation’s highest court said same-sex couples could wed, has died at age 69. Melina Maples-Granger, Maples’ daughter, said Maples died Thursday in Little Rock from complications of congestive heart failure. Maples represented same-sex couples who challenged Arkansas’ constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. A county judge struck the amendment down in 2014, which led to more than 500 same-sex couples marrying before the ruling was suspended by the state Supreme Court. Justices didn’t rule before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015. Maples also represented same-sex couples who successfully challenged Arkansas’ birth certificate law.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Someone has been killing the wild burros of the Mojave Desert, and the Bureau of Land Management is offering up to $10,000 to anyone who can help catch the culprit or culprits. Over the past three months, 42 burro carcasses containing gunshot wounds have been found scattered along a 60-mile stretch of Interstate 15, the main highway linking Los Angeles to Las Vegas. The animals, like wild horses, are protected under federal law. Anyone found guilty of harassing, branding or killing one faces a fine of up to $2,000 and a year in jail. More than that, burros are an enduring symbol of the American Southwest. With their pointy ears and distinctive “Hee-Haw” voices, they evoke a time when their sure-footedness in rocky terrain and ability to carry heavy loads long distances without complaint made them perfect pack animals for prospectors and others.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The U.S. Air Force Academy has announced it will close its cadet chapel for extensive renovations beginning next month. KOAA-TV reports the military academy says Sept. 3 is the final day scheduled for visits prior to the chapel’s three-year closure. Officials at the academy near Colorado Springs say a $158 million restoration and preservation project is scheduled to begin Nov. 1. Officials say work crews are expected to remove furniture and conduct other preparation work between Sept. 3 and Nov. 1. The chapel was originally scheduled to close in June, but the project was delayed. The Air Force says the funds were reallocated for repairs at Florida’s Tyndall Air Force Base following Hurricane Michael in October 2018. The chapel is registered as a national historic landmark.\n\nConnecticut\n\nVoluntown: The state plans to conduct mosquito control spraying in parts of Pachaug State Forest considered to be at high risk for mosquito-borne illnesses. Spraying will be conducted Monday at Mount Misery campground, the nearby horse camp, and roads leading from the main forest entrance to Hell Hollow Road. Spraying will begin at 7 p.m., weather permitting. It will continue overnight, and roads will be closed to vehicular traffic. The state’s mosquito management program, an interagency response to mosquito-borne diseases, says there’s a high concentration of mosquitoes in the area infected with Eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. The state is using a pesticide called Anvil. Officials say the location is not a residential area, and those living in surrounding areas do not need to take precautions during the spraying.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A high-profile case of a doctor convicted of raping and abusing more than 85 children has led to major changes in how the state investigates and disciplines doctors. Since Earl Bradley’s arrest in 2009, 178 Delaware doctors have received some form of disciplinary action from the state. In the decade before that, licensing records show only 48 doctors were disciplined by the state. Bradley’s ability to keep practicing exposed several failures in how the state’s medical community reported and disciplined doctors. The case led to the General Assembly passing a series of laws, one of which made it easier to suspend the license of a doctor who poses a “clear and immediate danger.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: As D.C. kids get ready to go back to school Monday, some have more to worry about than the grades, WUSA-TV reports. Those living and going to school in Southeast face the specter of violence every day, with some parents reporting hearing gunfire “almost every night.” One parent tweeted Saturday: “I see DC Public Schools Turner Elementary in Ward 8 still has bullet holes in glass over the front doors after months … kids left being greeted by tape & bullet holes daily, they shouldn’t come back to it.” Within a couple of hours, the D.C. Department of General Services had tweeted that it was investigating. When WUSA paid a visit to Turner Elementary to check out the damage, crews were already working on repairs.\n\nFlorida\n\nMarathon: A non-native, juvenile olive ridley sea turtle has been released off the Florida Keys. Officials say the 30-pound turtle named Harry was released Thursday with a small satellite transmitter affixed to the top of its shell. The electronic device should provide tracking data to help marine biologists gain insights into the reptile’s movements in unfamiliar territory, before it detaches in two to six months. Harry was rescued by recreational boaters in early February, entangled in a large fishing net, off the Upper Keys. Emaciated and near death, the reptile was transported to the Florida Keys-based Turtle Hospital for treatment. Hospital officials say olive ridley turtles typically live in the southern Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They say only six olive ridleys have been documented in Florida waters.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A new report says the state’s public colleges and universities had an economic impact worth $17.7 billion statewide during the 2018 fiscal year. The University System of Georgia said in a news release that the economic impact of its 26 schools increased by 5% over the previous fiscal year. It credited Georgia’s public colleges with creating 168,284 jobs – 70% of which were off-campus positions in the private and public sector. The annual study was conducted by University of Georgia economist Jeffrey Humphreys. The latest report covers the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2018. University system Chancellor Steve Wrigley says the results show that Georgia’s colleges and universities play an “important role in generating jobs and boosting businesses across the state.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Scientists in the state have started to prepare for a major coral reef bleaching event due to warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. The Star-Advertiser reports the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration analyzed ocean temperatures across the islands and found they’ve risen by 3 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists say coral bleaching has occurred before, but they are already seeing worse signs at Kealakekua Bay on Hawaii island and at Kaneohe Bay and Hanauma Bay on Oahu. Experts say coral bleaching is a change from normal coloration of browns, yellows and greens to a nearly white color because of increased exposure to environmental stressors, including temperature increases. Scientists say coral reefs are important for marine habitats; have cultural, recreational and economic benefits; and also provide protection for coastal shorelines during storms.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state must provide gender confirmation surgery to a transgender inmate who has been living as a woman for years but has continuously been housed in a men’s prison, a federal appeals court said Friday. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a federal judge in Idaho that the state’s denying the surgery for 31-year-old Adree Edmo amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, a violation of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Under the ruling, Edmo would become the first Idaho inmate to receive gender confirmation surgery while in Idaho Department of Correction custody. “This is a complete win for Ms. Edmo,” said her attorney, Lori Rifkin. “Our client is immensely relieved and grateful that the court recognized her basic right to medical treatment.” Republican Gov. Brad Little said he planned to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIllinois\n\nWaukegan: The Chicago-area hometown of the late, famed science fiction writer Ray Bradbury marked his birthday with the dedication of a statue in his honor. The 12-foot-tall stainless steel statue outside the Waukegan Public Library depicts Bradbury astride a rocket ship while holding a book. The (Lake County) News-Sun reports artist Zachary Oxman told those at Thursday’s ceremony that the statue tells the story of a man “beaming with unbridled imagination, curiosity and surprise.” Bradbury was born in Waukegan in 1920 and often spoke of the hours he spent at the city’s library before his family moved to Los Angeles when he was a teenager. He died in 2012. He wrote hundreds of works, including “Fahrenheit 451” and “The Martian Chronicles.” The $125,000 project was financed primarily through donations.\n\nIndiana\n\nPortage: The National Park Service has reopened beaches in northwestern Indiana, more than a week after a spill of cyanide and ammonia from a steel factory along Lake Michigan. The agency says three consecutive days of tests came out positive, including two days with no detection of cyanide. The government says samples were taken by Indiana environmental regulators and ArcelorMittal and reviewed by independent labs. The Park Service had closed the Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk beach areas at Indiana Dunes National Park. Fish were killed. ArcelorMittal says the spill occurred after its Burns Harbor mill had a failure at a blast furnace water recirculation system. Wastewater containing elevated levels of ammonia and cyanide was released in the Little Calumet River’s east branch. The company has apologized.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Google gave two local nonprofits $175,000 on Friday through the company’s Impact Challenge Iowa grant program. Five judges picked Iowa Jobs for America’s Graduates and Ethnic Minorities of Burma Advocacy and Resources as winners, along with three other nonprofits. Voters can cast ballots through Friday to pick the “People’s Choice” grant winner, which will receive another $125,000. IJAG is a mentor program that partners graduating students with employers in industries with a lot of job openings. The reward for EMBARC is for its RISE program, which helps prepare refugees for the workforce. The refugees work for other nonprofits in the state through the program, giving them job skills and helping them market themselves in the workforce.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: City police will begin using a system that places alerts on addresses where potential swatting targets could be living. Swatting involves someone making a hoax emergency call to send law enforcement officers, particularly SWAT teams, to a particular address. The program announced Friday is voluntary and open to people who think they might become victims of swatting. The alerts would be available to first responders. Officer Paul Cruz says the alerts wouldn’t slow emergency responders but would make them aware they might be responding to a hoax call. In 2017, Wichita police fatally shot Andrew Finch after a caller falsely claimed a murder and hostage situation was occurring at his home. The call was aimed at someone who lived at the home before Finch.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A print shop owner who refused to make a gay pride T-shirt argued before the state Supreme Court that he shouldn’t be compelled to promote messages that go against his religious beliefs. Blaine Adamson, owner of Hands-On Originals in Lexington, declined to print a shirt promoting an LGBT pride festival in 2012. The city’s Human Rights Commission said that refusal violated its gay-rights fairness ordinance. On Friday, the high court heard an attorney for the T-shirt maker argue that the First Amendment protects him from having to print that message. An attorney for the Human Rights Commission says the T-shirt maker cannot pick and choose who it wants to serve in the community. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments from attorneys and will issue a ruling at a later date.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: One of the world’s northernmost sugarcane fields has been planted at a Louisiana State University research station in central Louisiana. The LSU AgCenter is looking into how well various varieties can survive chilly weather. The Dean Lee Research and Extension Center is generally considered too far north for the tall tropical grass. However, steady yields and prices have prompted some of the state’s farmers to push the limits, planting sugarcane in what has traditionally been corn and soybean country, an AgCenter news release says. One farmer is growing sugarcane a few miles south in the Lecompte area. There’s little data to indicate which varieties can best withstand central Louisiana’s deeper, more frequent freezes. So the AgCenter is working to get such information on eight varieties, some commercially available and some still experimental.\n\nMaine\n\nMillinocket: The Friends of Katahdin Woods and Waters group says it’s pleased with progress in the three years since the national monument was created in northern Maine. The group says improvements include a new bridge over Katahdin Brook, improved trails along the Loop Road at Deasey Pond and the Esker Trail built by Appalachian Mountain Club, and new trail signs put up by the National Park Service. Superintendent Tim Hudson says long-awaited road signs along I-95 and local roads should be going up by year’s end. As the Friends group hosted a celebration Saturday night to mark the third anniversary with music, dinner, awards and an auction, director Andrew Bossie thanked volunteer groups including the Baxter Youth Conservation Corps for their help.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City fire officials say they plan to dispatch fewer firefighters to initial fire alarms, as departments see the number of medical emergency calls rise above those of fires. A Wednesday memo said three engines, one truck and one battalion chief will respond to alarms starting Sept. 1, down from the five engines, two trucks, two battalion chiefs and one medic unit that’s considered a full assignment. Seventeen personnel will respond, still higher than the National Fire Protection Association standard of 15. Chief Niles R. Ford told The Baltimore Sun the reduction will free units for medical calls. More responders can be dispatched if needed. Baltimore’s firefighters union criticized the plan, saying it’d put responders and citizens in danger, but Ford pushed back.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSherborn: A “peace park” in this Boston suburb has been forced to take down a United Nations flag after residents objected. Pacifist Memorial founder Lewis Randa recently removed the flag at the Sherborn site because residents of the condo development where it’s located argue that it violates their property agreement. The Abbey Road Condominium Trust says the 2012 land deal with Randa only allows him to maintain the memorial’s permanent installations, not to add new or temporary ones. But Randa says that while the U.N. flag was not part of the original memorial, one had flown for decades on the grounds. He suggests the dispute is rooted in long-simmering opposition to the memorial. Loretta Heuer, who heads the condo association, says the issue isn’t the flag but respecting property rights.\n\nMichigan\n\nIshpeming: An arsonist has severely hampered Santa’s toy production this fall. Mlive.com reports that Ishpeming Police on Saturday asked for the public’s help in solving the overnight arson and property damage case involving the Santa’s Workshop building used at Christmastime. Police said officers were dispatched to the site where the building is stored to find the structure destroyed. A city-owned pickup parked in the area was also damaged. Residents expressed their dismay on the police department’s Facebook page. Some offered to rebuild it for free in time for Christmas. One commenter suggested the guilty party rebuild it at no cost in addition to facing criminal charges. Another said that it’s “sad that the actions of a few people can ruin it for so many.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The ever-present danger of rip currents in Lake Superior has some people in Duluth calling for more to be done to improve public safety. Retired police officer Dennis Hoelscher tells Minnesota Public Radio News that lifeguard services need to be improved. Lifeguards don’t work on “red flag” days that have high risk of rip currents. Hoelscher and others think guards should work on those days, work longer hours in general, work more beaches and be trained to work in big waves. The Duluth YMCA, which runs the lifeguard program on Park Point, says posting lifeguards misleads people to think it’s safe. And expanding services is difficult in what is currently mostly a break-even arrangement. MPR reports communities across the Great Lakes struggle with how to pay for lifeguards.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: Officials say the city was on its way into debt but has turned its finances around, saving about $805,000 since March. The Commercial Dispatch reports Mayor Robert Smith told councilmen last week that the city saved about $329,000 while adding $476,000 to unbudgeted revenue. Accountant Mike Crowder in March told the city it’d be more than $300,000 in debt by September if spending continued. Smith says several decisions helped the city save, like freezes on hiring and wages, upping the employee health insurance deductible from $100 to $500, and opening the court clerk’s office on Fridays, which collected $26,206 in additional fees. Smith says the city had $7 million in its coffers, including about $2 million in the operating funds. It’s unclear whether the fund will finish the fiscal year at a deficit.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Authorities say a shirtless man reportedly dragging a topless, unconscious woman through downtown was actually lugging around a life-size doll. Police said in a tweet that callers reported the man looked like he wanted to throw the woman over a bridge, had dropped her and appeared to be trying to dress her. One caller said he was yelling “savior” while holding the woman. Police said that when officers learned the woman actually was a doll that the man had found in a trash bin, he was told “not to carry it around in public anymore.” Police titled the tweet: “And here is today’s episode of ‘Not What We Expected Going Into That.’ ” A traffic camera captured some of the incident.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State officials say U.S. health officials have approved Montana’s plan to create a reinsurance pool that aims to lower individual health insurance premium costs. Gov. Steve Bullock and State Auditor Matt Rosendale say the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a waiver that authorizes the reinsurance program. A bill passed by state lawmakers this year creates a pool to help reimburse insurers for high-cost claims from $40,000 to $1 million. It will be funded with money that otherwise would have been used as premium tax credits and through a premium tax on all major medical plans sold in the state. The three Montana companies that offer health insurance policies on the individual marketplace are proposing reduced rates in 2020, in part because of the reinsurance program.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state’s highest court lifted one of the last major hurdles for the Keystone XL pipeline in the state Friday when it rejected another attempt to derail the project by opponents who wanted to force the developer to reapply for state approval. The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld the decision of regulators who voted in November 2017 to greenlight a route through the state. The court’s decision was a victory for the $8 billion project, which has been mired in lawsuits and regulatory hearings since it was proposed in 2008. Despite the victory for Canada-based TC Energy, opponents vowed Friday that the legal fight to block construction was far from over. “The risky pipeline project’s fate is still very much in doubt, as three separate federal lawsuits continue to proceed that challenge the controversial project’s permits,” leading pipeline opposition group Bold Alliance said in a statement.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Safari Club International plans to hold its national convention in Las Vegas in 2021 instead of Reno. The sportsman’s club is ending its initial three-year agreement with the Biggest Little City a year early. The 2020 convention will continue in Reno in February. The club hasn’t officially announced the venue change, but the move has been confirmed by the Reno Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority. RSCVA Board Chairman Bob Lucy says it’s disappointing, but the board continues to have a good relationship with the club and hopes it returns someday. Safari Club returned to Reno this year following a five-year absence and declining attendance in Las Vegas. The RSCVA says this year’s convention generated an estimated $20 million in economic impact for the Reno-Tahoe area, including more than 17,000 room nights for the region’s hotels.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A year after Gov. Chris Sununu’s unsuccessful push to prolong school summer vacation until Labor Day, the vast majority of the state’s communities are sticking with their earlier start dates. Schools in 80% of districts will be starting before Labor Day this year. While four districts that started earlier last year will now start after Labor Day, two other districts went the other way. Sununu, a Republican, created a “Save Our Summers Study Commission” last August to explore a mandatory post-Labor Day start date. The group issued a report without taking sides, though it emphasized the economic benefits. Subsequent legislation to enact a mandate, however, was retained in the Senate Education Committee for reconsideration next year. Businesses tied to tourism support later start dates, while teachers oppose the idea.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Brunswick: Rutgers University’s daily student newspaper will cease print publication on Fridays and shift to reporting more news online. The Daily Targum’s student leaders say the decision to cut their printing days to Mondays to Thursdays is meant to help it stay afloat after a devastating vote last spring resulted in a loss of all student fee funding. NJ.com reports the student newspaper will save money in its $750,000 budget by cutting printing to four days a week. The organization will also save money by tapping into advertising revenue and donations raised online. Rutgers says it will hold another vote to ask students if they want to use student fees to fund the campus newspaper. The paper says it will continue to pay its student reporters, photographers, editors and three-member professional staff.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nBloomfield: The city has asked residents to help fund the remaining balance of fees resulting from a Ten Commandments monument lawsuit. Bloomfield launched an online fundraiser asking for help coming up with $467,000 it owes the American Civil Liberties Union lawyers after courts ruled against the city. Officials say the ACLU represented several residents who said the monument violated their First Amendment rights. Officials say the city owes lawyers $700,000 by June 30, 2021, and has already paid more than $200,000. Anything not raised will be paid for using the gross receipts tax and is currently budgeted. Officials say the resident-funded monument was displayed in front of city hall before being moved to a nearby church.\n\nNew York\n\nTupper Lake: Organizers of a new semi-pro baseball team in the Adirondacks are rooting around for a new nickname after some residents grunted at the proposed moniker “River Pigs.” The Adirondack Daily Enterprise reports that Tupper Lake Village Board Trustee David Maroun posted on Facebook that the name of the new Empire League team will be changed. The name River Pigs was chosen to reflect the region’s logging history. River pigs were skilled loggers who broke up logjams on rivers. But when the team was announced in late July, some Tupper Lake residents said the name “Pigs” sounded demeaning. Fire Chief Royce Cole says the village baseball committee will discuss other options over the weekend. The team is slated to arrive in Tupper Lake next summer.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State election officials on Friday certified bar code ballots for use in elections starting next year despite an outcry that they can’t be trusted by voters uncertain their choices are accurately counted. The State Board of Elections voted 3-2 to allow a voting-machine maker to sell equipment that digitizes votes into bar code data, which is then tallied by the company’s counting machines. Almost two dozen speakers urged the elections board to reject bar code systems because voters can’t read the bar codes to check that they’re correct. But Democratic board chairman Damon Circosta sided with two Republicans on the five-member panel, citing the risk of delay after touchscreen-only equipment is disallowed in December. New voting machines in about a quarter of the state’s counties need to be replaced as primary elections loom in March.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A study finds that converting a historic railroad bridge into a pedestrian bridge can be done but would be expensive. Landscape architecture professors at North Dakota State University looked at repurposing the Bismarck-Mandan Rail Bridge as a footbridge. The Bismarck Tribune reports the study concluded that would cost almost $6.9 million. Proponents of saving the structure acknowledge they don’t yet have any funding commitments. Bridge owner BNSF Railway maintains that converting the 136-year-old bridge – rather than demolishing it – would delay a needed new bridge and also cause safety concerns. The bridge over the Missouri River connects Bismarck and Mandan. Friends of the Rail Bridge is proposing to convert the bridge into a pedestrian and bicycle path.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: Celebrities and musicians came out Sunday evening for Dave Chappelle’s Gem City Shine benefit. Earlier in the day, Kanye West brought a surprise Sunday Service gospel experience to RiverScape Metro Park. Actor and comedian Jon Stewart made a surprise appearance to help Chappelle introduce Chance the Rapper. Chapelle escorted music legend Stevie Wonder out to perform following Chance the Rapper’s set. The Gem City Shine block party kicked off at 4 p.m. to benefit the families and survivors of the Aug. 4 mass shooting that rocked the city. The sold-out event was held in the Oregon District, blocks away from where a gunman killed nine people and injured 27 others.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city council is expected to set a citywide vote for a one-cent sales tax that would generate nearly $980 million over eight years to fund dozens of city projects, including money for social services like mental health and homelessness. The proposal outlined Friday is the fourth iteration of Metropolitan Area Projects, a comprehensive capital improvement program first approved by city voters in 1993. The council is expected to consider a resolution Tuesday that calls for a special election Dec. 10. Funding in the MAPS 4 proposal includes $40 million for mental health and addiction services and $38 million for a family justice center offering services to victims of abuse. Another $50 million would be earmarked for affordable housing for the homeless.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: After two walkouts this year by minority Republican senators in the Legislature, Democrats say they’ll ask voters to change quorum rules, allowing the Statehouse to convene with only a simple majority of lawmakers present instead of the current two-thirds requirement. The boycotts by the Republicans prevented the Senate from convening. Democrats dropped proposals on gun control and vaccines, and Democratic Gov. Kate Brown ordered state police to bring the missing lawmakers back during the second walkout. The Republicans left the state to avoid apprehension and returned only after a sweeping bill to combat global warming was moot. Senate Democrats said Majority Leader Ginny Burdick will introduce a constitutional amendment next year to lower quorum requirements. Voters would then decide on the proposed change in the 2020 election.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Hundreds of bicyclists have been caught with their pants down – and their shirts and underwear off, too. The cyclists gathered in a Philadelphia park Saturday to disrobe before saddling up and setting off on the annual Philly Naked Bike Ride. About 3,000 riders pedal a 10-mile course around the City of Brotherly Love while taking in sights including Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, organizers say. Some riders wear their birthday suits, while others flaunt their underwear or sport just a splash of body paint and glitter. The ride is intended to promote positive body image, advocate for the safety of cyclists and protest dependence on fossil fuels. It used to be held in September but was moved up to August because the nude and scantily clad participants complained about chilly weather.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A state lawmaker says he’s frustrated that mandated replacement license plates will have a design similar to the state’s distinctive “wave” plates in use since 1996. Sen. Louis DiPalma tells the Providence Journal the new design is supposed to make it easier for police to tell from a distance that a plate is old. The Department of Motor Vehicles told lawmakers last week the new plates would maintain the integrity of the current wave design with enough differences to serve the purpose of the plate reissue. Gov. Gina Raimondo’s spokesman says the new design will “closely mirror” existing plates. DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, wants to meet with Raimondo and DMV officials to get an explanation. Rhode Islanders with existing wave plates will have to get new ones starting next year.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nNorth Charleston: The city is giving $1 million to a new African American history museum and asking it to include the city’s story. The North Charleston City Council voted unanimously Thursday to give the money from the city’s taxes on hotels to the International African American Museum being built in Charleston. Mayor Keith Summey says he hopes the money helps tell the story of North Charleston’s predecessor Liberty Hill, where a black couple bought farmland during the Civil War that was later sold to other African Americans. North Charleston’s history also includes racial struggles. The city paid a $6.5 million settlement to the family of a black man, Walter Scott, who was shot in the back and killed by a white police officer in 2015.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A state board is weighing whether to raise bonding requirements for natural gas and oil drillers. The Rapid City Journal reports the Board of Minerals and Environment is considering the increase as the state pursues a $15.5 million lawsuit against a Texas-based company for abandoning gas wells in western South Dakota. Spyglass Cedar Creek drilled 40 natural gas wells near Buffalo and then abandoned them after natural gas prices plummeted. Board members called the Spyglass saga a “perfect storm.” Department of Environment and Natural Resources Minerals and Mining program administrator Mike Lees says the state has not had similar issues with other oil and gas developers in the state.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: A baby giraffe has officially been named Big Girl Two but will be called Bea. Zoo Knoxville officials announced the 2-month-old giraffe’s name at a Saturday event for zoo members. They also celebrated the fourth birthday of Bea’s mother, Frances. Frances gave birth to Bea, her first calf, on July 1. Zookeepers found mother and her healthy baby when they arrived for work that morning. Bea is the first giraffe calf born at the zoo in 17 years. She’s part of herd made up of her mother; her father, Jumbe; and female giraffe Lucille. The four live in the zoo’s Africa Grasslands natural habitat.\n\nTexas\n\nWaco: More farmers in the state are wading into the whiskey business, but their end users are far removed from the era of moonshine stills and midnight raids by ax-toting lawmen. The Waco Tribune-Herald reports the burgeoning Texas whiskey industry is doubling down on Lone Star pride by recruiting growers. An ode to this phenomenon is High Plains Texas Single Malt, a whiskey produced at Balcones Distilling in Waco using Texas-grown barley malted by Blacklands Malt in Leander. The finished product had its roots in an experiment involving Balcones, Blacklands and Texas A&M University Agrilife, which was exploring ways to develop a barley industry in Texas. Now, after more than two years of aging, High Plains Texas Single Malt has arrived. It is priced at $80 a bottle and available exclusively at Balcones.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A new U.S. government management plan unveiled Friday clears the way for coal mining and oil and gas drilling on land that used to be off limits as part of a sprawling national monument in the state before President Donald Trump downsized the protected area two years ago. The plan released by the Bureau of Land Management would also open more lands to cattle grazing and recreation and acknowledges there could be “adverse effects” on land and resources in the monument. But while allowing more activities, the plan would also add a few safeguards for the cliffs, canyons, waterfalls and arches still inside Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument that weren’t in a proposed plan issued last year. Among them are opening fewer acres to ATVs and canceling a plan that would have allowed people to collect some non-dinosaur fossils in certain areas.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Police are investigating the theft of about $37,000 worth of equipment stolen from a music center during the Lake Champlain Chamber Music Festival. The Tuesday night or Wednesday morning burglary at the Elley Long Music Center in Colchester occurred when at least one person broke into an engineering room and stole a case of audio equipment. Rosina Cannizzaro, the executive director for the Vermont Youth Orchestra Association, calls it a “cowardly act.” She says she hopes the equipment can be returned to the owner. MyNBC5 reports the music center says it has implemented overnight security and will be removing all valuable items like sound gear and cash from the building every night.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: Gov. Ralph Northam and other state officials are observing the arrival of enslaved Africans to what is now Virginia 400 years ago. Northam said he signed a directive Saturday to create a commission on African American history in the state. He says it will review educational standards and instructional practices to teach black history in the state. Northam says the state must ensure that all students develop a full understanding of the African American voices that contribute to the nation’s story. He made the announcement at the 2019 African Landing Commemorative Ceremony in Hampton. The landing in August 1619 is considered a pivotal moment that presaged a system of race-based slavery.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium is celebrating the birth of its first tamandua pup, which is the size of an avocado. KING-TV reports the southern tamandua is a species of anteaters native to South America that lives in trees. The healthy pup was born Aug. 18 and weighs just more than a half-pound. The baby tamandua will make a public debut once it is stronger and more confident. Until then, it will practice riding on its mother’s back and begin eating fruit and insects in about two months. Zookeepers won’t know the baby’s gender until it is older.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPipestem: Fans of all things horror gathered at Pipestem Event Center on Saturday to visit the first-ever FearFestWV. “It’s important to bring something like this to this area. There are fans of all ages here from age 5 to 75,” said event hostess and personality Coen Beck, also known as Coen the Butcher. Guests enjoyed vendors specializing in horror merchandise, live music of the metal genre and big-name horror actors. With VIP tickets, guests could meet and speak one-on-one with their favorite big-screen menaces. Actors present included Bill Moseley (“The Devil’s Rejects,” “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” and “House of 1000 Corpses”), Michael Berryman (“The Hills Have Eyes,” “The Devil’s Rejects”) and Tony Moran, known for his iconic role of Michael Myers in “Halloween.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A rare bee not seen in the state in more than a century has turned up in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. U.S. Forest Service scientists found the bee in July while surveying pollinators as part of an inventory of native bees in the Great Lakes region. It’s known commonly as a cuckoo bee, but its scientific name is a mouthful: Epeoloides pilosulus. The bee was once widespread in eastern and central America but was thought to have gone extinct. It was then found in 2002 in Nova Scotia, Canada – and only two such bees have been found since, in Connecticut in 2006 and New York in 2014. Wisconsin has about 500 native bee species.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The city will begin restoring another stretch of the North Platte River in October, the next step in a long-term project expected to cost at least $23 million. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the upcoming work will cost $2.5 million and cover about half a mile of the river. It will include adjusting the channel, stabilizing the banks, removing debris, restoring native vegetation and installing a boat ramp. The river suffered from decades of pollution from industry and a landfill. The city launched the restoration project in 2015, and the upcoming work will be the fourth of seven planned phases.

Many have interpretive signs along the trails so you can learn more about the site's lore or soak up nuggets of information while on a stroll.\n\nFor more routes, go to Delaware Greenways, which lists trails in all of Delaware's three counties. Another good site is All Trails, which can be found at alltrails.com\n\nThis free Sussex County coastal walking and biking trail starting in Lewes not only has great views but also has an interesting history. Junction & Breakwater Trail was named after a Pennsylvania Railroad line that ran between Lewes and Rehoboth in the mid-1800s. It delivered passengers to the Atlantic Coast resort areas but was abandoned in the 1970s. It was made into a trail in 2003.\n\nYou can start the trail at Gills Neck Road in Lewes, and it's about a 7-mile hike to Rehoboth. At the end of the trail in Rehoboth, you can wet your whistle at the Revolution Craft Brewing Co. (on a hot day, we liked the Sussex County Mule, a blonde ale with 5% ABV) or maybe even get a vegan carrot hotdog from the Silly Rabbit food cart that operates there occasionally.\n\nThe sites along the flat trail, a mix of crushed stone and asphalt trail, include native plants; wildlife; and the Salt Marsh, a coastal wetland that helps improve the water quality of bays and oceans. An 80-foot-long railroad bridge originally built in 1913 crosses Holland Glade stream.\n\nThe Lewes Library Trailhead, 111 Adams Ave., has bathrooms, water fountains, an informational kiosk, a bike station and plenty of parking. Parking also can be found about a quarter-mile from the trail's start on Gills Neck Road. There also are several places to rent bikes in Lewes if you prefer wheels instead of walking.\n\nWinterthur Museum founder Henry Francis du Pont's first love was gardening, and it certainly shows in the 1,000 acres of rolling hills, streams, meadows and forests of his former estate off Route 52 (Kennett Pike), between Greenville and Centreville.\n\nFirst things first: You need to pay admission ($20 to 22) or have a Winterthur membership ($30 to $1,000) to walk the 10 miles of roads and 25 miles of paths and walking trails. The trails are between a half-mile to almost 2 miles long. You'll need to wear an admission tag or display a membership card.\n\nBring your best friend:Dog-friendly places to take your best friend in Delaware\n\nYou can request a garden map at the Visitor Center or download a PDF of the Winterthur Estate Map. The map shows roads and paved paths as well as the locations of restrooms and emergency call boxes on the estate.\n\nTicketed guests can walk between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Members can walk daily from dawn to dusk. Keep your dog at home. No pets are allowed on the property.\n\nStill, many visitors say it's well worth the price because du Pont experimented with thousands of plants and he refined the color combinations that are the essence of the Winterthur Garden. Almost any time of the year, there is something new to see.\n\nAlthough Winterthur is a key part of Delaware’s history, there are no signs outside touting that the 175-room du Pont mansion, built in 1837, has the most significant collection of American decorative arts in the world. It has pieces dating back to 1640.\n\nHowever, there are trail markers on the grounds and interpretive signs along the walking paths in the 60-acre historic garden area; that content is focused primarily on Winterthur, du Pont and plant specifics.\n\nThe garden design preserves the look created by du Pont and his close friend and landscape architect Marian Coffin.\n\nPicnics are allowed and you can bring outside food and drink to the garden.\n\nHistoric New Castle is certainly the place to marinate yourself in what it was like to be in the First State back in the day.\n\nThe town, also known as Old New Castle, originally was named Fort Casimir when it was founded in 1651. Just 10 minutes south of downtown Wilmington, it is one of the most important Colonial/Federal villages in America — second only to Williamsburg, Virginia, in the number and authenticity of its historic structures.\n\nThe free, open-to-the-public 3.7-mile paved walking, hiking and biking trail in Battery Park, at the end of Delaware Street, runs along the Delaware River and offers views of waterfowl, ships and the Delaware Memorial Bridge.\n\nIn the summer, it's not unusual to see the Kalmar Nyckel, a replica of the 1638 tall ship that brought the settlers who founded little Fort Christina, later the city of Wilmington, at the public dock at 1 Delaware St. The tall ship frequently sails the Delaware River and will return to the Copeland Maritime Center campus at the Wilmington Riverfront shipyard in September.\n\nYou'll probably share the trail path with gaggles of geese (watch where you step!), and there's a nice mix of shade and sun. Picnic tables are located in some grassy areas, and benches are planted along the pathway for people watching. Views include rocky beaches and various jetties.\n\nAfter a hike, take a stroll on the cobblestone streets of the Colonial town and enjoy beverages and snacks at one of several restaurants including Jessop's Tavern, Nora Lee's and Zollies Jazz Cucina.\n\nTrail update:'Camp Fright' no more? Spooky 100-year-old Mill Creek-area site will get a new look\n\nFridays and Saturdays in October, the New Castle Historical Society hosts ghost-walking tours through the town. Visitors can stroll New Castle’s streets and alleyways and hear tales of hauntings, Victorian death and funeral customs, and crime and punishment that span the town's almost 370-year history. Tours begin at 7, 7:30 and 8:30 each night. Visit newcastlehistory.org for more information.\n\nThe 72-acre, New Castle County-owned park at 4651 Washington Street Extension in Penny Hill has a picnic grove, gardens, urban wildlife habitat, a pet-friendly parkland and paved trails linking to the Northern Delaware Greenway. It's free and open daily from dawn to dusk.\n\nOne of the park's best features is the 1.2-mile loop trail asphalt path that takes amblers by Rockwood Mansion, a retirement estate started in 1851 and completed in 1854 by wealthy Wilmington merchant baker Joseph Shipley while he was living in the village of Allerton, near Liverpool, England.\n\nShipley, a descendant of prominent Quakers, wanted the Victorian Gothic Revival mansion to be similar to Wyncote, his country estate in England. The gardens were designed to reflect his love of English architecture and landscape design. Shipley, a bachelor with no children, shared Rockwood with his unmarried sisters, Sarah and Hannah.\n\nMarkers on the property point out interesting details such as the house's conservatory, which had a hot-water heating system installed under the floor to keep Shipley's plants thriving in the winter. In the summer, all the plants were taken out to the garden.\n\nShipley died in 1867. After the death of the last sister, Hannah Shipley, in 1891, a great-nephew, Edward Bringhurst Jr., took over the estate. He and his family moved into Rockwood the next year and extensively redecorated the interior.\n\nAnother marker near the trail tells the story behind \"Edward's Playhouse.\" The ruin, near the walking path, was the surviving part of a farmhouse that had stood on the site when Shipley first purchased the land. In the 1890s, the Bringhurst family altered the structure and turned it into a playhouse for their youngest child, Edward, who died at the relatively young age of 55.\n\nVarious Bringhurst family members lived at Rockwood until 1972 when the estate, on the National Register of Historic Places, was donated to New Castle County.\n\nOf course, every old spooky-looking mansion has a ghost tale or two, including Rockwood. The house is said to be haunted by ghosts named Mary and Eddie, and in 2016 the mansion was featured on the SyFy TV show \"Ghost Hunters.\"\n\nThe museum is taking advantage of its spirits and will hold paranormal walking tours from 8 to 10 p.m. beginning Sept. 10. The Rockwood Paranormal Experience Team will lead visitors, 14 and older, through Rockwood’s gardens, fields and architecture using \"state-of-the-art' ghost-hunting equipment.\n\nThe cost is $35 for county residents and $45 for non-residents. Visit newcastlede.gov/431/Rockwood-Park-Museum\n\nOn several nights in October, Rockwood also will host 90-minute \"ghost story\" walks through the gardens that will be led by a character holding a lamplight known as a “Revisionist,” a person that can \"speak with the unliving.\" A cash bar and \"spooky\" concoctions will be available after each walk.\n\nIn 1935, Pamela and Lammot du Pont Copeland purchased more than 126 acres of land near the village of Mount Cuba near Hockessin where they built a Colonial-Revival style house and began planning formal gardens. In 1949, they brought in landscaper Marian Coffin to plan the formal gardens. She also worked with Henry Francis du Pont at Winterthur. The couple, like du Pont, were life-long gardeners. Lammot Copeland was a former president and chairman of the DuPont Co.\n\nThe Copelands envisioned the elegant gardens they cultivated on their estate would someday inspire a community of conservation.\n\nFlower power:Longwood Gardens travel guide: What you need to know if you go\n\nAfter the Copelands' deaths, Mt. Cuba eventually was opened to the public and began charging general admission in 2013. In 2018, Mt. Cuba Center's 582 acres merged with the 501 acres of the adjoining Red Clay Reservation. Mt. Cuba is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nMt. Cuba Center at 3120 Barley Mill Road in Hockessin has more than 2 miles of trails throughout its more than 1,000 acres.\n\nThere are four short trails, each less than a mile, that can be visited now through Nov. 20. You will need to purchase a general garden admission ticket ($8 to $15) or have a membership ($84 to $182) to walk the trails.\n\nOnly service animals are permitted on the property. Not all the terrain is even. Golf cart transportation to select locations throughout the garden is available upon request, so are wheelchairs, walking sticks and a walker.\n\nThe scenic trails throughout Mt. Cuba Center’ are maintained in their more natural state and take on a “wilder” aesthetic, as opposed to the carefully curated gardens. You'll see native tree plantings and various species of plants and birds. New this year is the shaded \"Understory Trail\" that goes through a forest full of native hardwoods, across a stream, through a black walnut grove, by a pond as well as a low-lying meadow full of native wildflowers.\n\nMt. Cuba's garden and trails are open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday to Sunday. Tickets may be purchased in advance online or on-site at the Ticketing Office.\n\nIt's not exactly a secret, but The Laurels Preserve, a stunning, limited-use 700-plus acre preserve near Unionville, Pennsylvania, (not that far from the Delaware state line) is the kind of place that you have to know to know.\n\nThe Laurels Preserve has existing trails, roads and paths and it is open to members of the Brandywine Conservancy & Museum of Art every day from dawn to dusk. Visitors should carry their Brandywine membership cards. Membership ranges from $40 to $100.\n\nThe entrance to the Laurels is 100 yards off of Route 82 on Apple Grove Road, 4 miles west of Unionville, Pennsylvania. It feels exclusive because it has parking for only 10 cars about a quarter mile from the main gate.\n\nDogs are allowed, but they must be kept on a leash. If there are no open parking spots, the Brandywine Conservancy, which manages the land, asks that visitors not park on the grounds and return when a spot is available.\n\nNative Americans once fished the streams that are now called Buck and Doe runs, according to the conservancy. Millworkers harnessed the water for gristmills and a steel rolling mill during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. For decades in the 20th century, the King Ranch grazed cattle in lush pastures adjacent to the streams.\n\nThe Conservancy created the Laurels Preserve, named for on-site mountain laurel trees, from 771 acres of donated land. The site has almost 500 acres of hardwood forest including mature red, black, white and chestnut oaks, tulip poplar, beech, white ash and hickory species.\n\nIt is also considered an important bird area by Audubon Pennsylvania, and about 160 species have been observed nesting in or migrating through the Laurels. It also has a variety of wildlife, including beavers and wild turkeys.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at ptalorico@delawareonline.com and follow her on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}]}

To help make their celebration something very special, I brought in a vase of red roses and a bottle of champagne with two wedding glasses.”\n\nSituated along the Kiskiminetas River, guests are invited to kayak, try various fishing spots, and hike the rolling hills.

And that would include things like furniture, boats, cars and even houses.\n\nOne artifact that would probably not immediately come to mind would be a moped.\n\nBut, for a good many enthusiasts in southern Delaware, there is nothing more rewarding than finding a vintage moped to restore and ride.\n\n\"It's a hobby that kind of takes over your life,\" said Rob Schwarzkopf of Ocean View.\n\nMopeds are actually small motorcycles that became popular in the 1970s during the energy crisis because of low cost and incredible gas mileage, often approaching 100 miles per gallon.\n\nThey also gained popularity because many states did not require special licensing to operate a moped, unlike the regulations for motorcycles.\n\nIn most instances, the underpowered mopeds will not exceed 40 miles per hour.\n\nThe name probably derived from a Swedish term — motor-velocipede — that referred to a pedal cycle with an engine. The name was later shortened to moped.\n\nNow, many — but not all — mopeds are still equipped with pedals similar to a bicycle.\n\nThe most popular brands, including Puch, Benelli and Motobecane are European. And the major department store retailers, including Sears, Montgomery Ward and JC Penney also offered mopeds under their own brand name.\n\nBut as quickly as they became popular, sales started to decline in the 1980s, mostly because auto manufacturers started producing lower priced, fuel efficient cars.\n\nWhile sales of new mopeds never returned to the halcyon days of the 1970s, the lure of low cost and fuel efficiency has continued to be an attraction. And Chinese manufacturers have entered the market with low-cost mopeds.\n\nThrough it all, mopeds from the 1970s and '80s have continued to intrigue a core group of enthusiasts who, like the earlier generation of buyers, are attracted by the lower cost and fuel efficiency.\n\n\"It's almost become an underworld cult,\" said Schwarzkopf.\n\nREAD MORE: Soup kitchen's founder launches effort to expand ministry\n\nDom Pandolfino, a chef at Crooked Hammock in Lewes and a resident of Rehoboth Beach, had a Tomos moped in his younger days but sold it when he moved from Delaware.\n\nBut, shortly after returning to Delaware, a friend offered to let him ride his Moto Guzzi Robin moped. That was all it took to reignite his interest.\n\n\"I got the itch to buy one, he said.\n\nAfter buying a somewhat unreliable 1982 Honda Hobbit moped, he sold it and got a Sears Freespirit, which has proved to be a little more dependable. And he now owns three other mopeds, some running, others needing attention.\n\nCurrently, Pandolfino rides his Freespirit moped regularly to work and elsewhere and has even attended rallies as far away as Oregon.\n\n\"It's been fun over the years riding them and going to rallies all over the country,\" he said.\n\nAnd he recognizes how popular vintage mopeds have become.\n\n\"The culture is so big,\" he said.\n\nAnd that culture includes Pandolfino and a cadre of other Delaware enthusiasts who gather informally to share moped comaraderie.\n\nDerik Fife bought a rare Puch Monza moped and brought it to Delaware this summer to work on it, with help from Pandolfino and other enthusiasts. Fife, a Pennsylvania resident, spent the summer tending bar at the Shorebreak Lodge in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe bike is rare because Puch never sold the Monza model in the states.\n\n\"The first time I laid eyes on it, I had to have it,\" he said.\n\nFife actually bought it to compete in the Pinball Run, a moped rally that began in Portland, Maine and ended in Key West, Florida. But mechanical gremlins plagued the Puch and Fife never even started the event.\n\nAnd the magnitude of needed repairs forced Fife to put the project on the back burner.\n\n\"It required a rebuild from the ground up,\" he said.\n\nThough Fife eventually rebuilt the Puch mechanically, he did not worry about cosmetics.\n\n\"I didn't want to get neurotic about it,\" he said.\n\nAnd, like other moped enthusiasts, Fife said repair and restoration parts are easy to find — even though many models have been out of production for years.\n\nAlso helping: A nationwide club called the Moped Army, which is a clearinghouse for new and used parts for most models.\n\n\"There are parts out there,\" said Fife.\n\nREAD MORE: Horror film competition wreaks havoc on Delmarva\n\nSchwarzkopf, on the other hand, likes to do total restorations on his moped projects. And, since retirement, he has been restoring and selling them as a hobby.\n\nHis latest restoration project is a 1976 Motobecane Moby, covered with dirt, dust and grime when he found it.\n\n\"I actually found it in a barn,\" he said.\n\nNow for sale at $1,500, Schwarzkopf said the restoration took a year.\n\n\"It does take time,\" he said.\n\nWhile he tries to sell the Moby, he started to restore several other mopeds, all Motobecanes.\n\n\"Once you get started, it's like a sickness,\" he said.\n\nraetyson@gmail.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2017/08/31/labor-day-weekend-festivals-fairs-fireworks-funerals/607333001/", "title": "Labor Day weekend festivals, fairs & 'funerals'", "text": "After a few weeks of mild temperatures during what is usually a scorching August, we wouldn't dare complain about rain in the forecast for Labor Day weekend, right?\n\nWrong!\n\nThe extended holiday weekend is one of the busiest in the state when it comes to fairs, festivals, fireworks and even \"funerals.\" So gray clouds and rain drops don't mix well.\n\nOur fingers will be crossed for Saturday's celebration at Freeman Stage at Bayside (31750 Lake View Dr, near Selbyville), tied to both Labor Day and conclusion of the venue's 10th season.\n\nSTORY: Rock north, country south: Delaware's musical Mason-Dixon Line\n\nSTORY: 5 ways to say farewell to another Delaware summer\n\nSTORY: After 28 years, Bottle & Cork's no longer just 'greatest rock 'n' roll' bar\n\nThe free 7 p.m. event will feature music by the Mid-Atlantic Symphony Orchestra, who will perform with U.S. Army Blues.

There are hundreds of handmade crafts and antiques vendors paired with a food court selling everything from kettle corn and funnel cakes to hot dogs and pizza. And mixed in among the fair's activities are Arden residents and others who make the most out of the throwback fair. We spotted a guy there dressed as Gandalf from \"The Lord of the Rings\" last year. Maybe we'll get a Littlefinger from \"Game of Thrones\" this year? (Too soon?)

But a growing number of super-sized buildings in Sussex County's sand towns now have room to accommodate the larger numbers of sun-baked tourists expected to flood in for day trips and vacations over the next few months.\n\nThere were a record 9 million visitors to Delaware in 2016, according to the state tourism office. That's a whopping number of house guests considering the state's population is now estimated at a little more than 971,000.\n\nDining out is second only to going to the beach when it comes to the Top 10 visitor activities, a 2017 visitor survey report found.\n\nSpreading out is no longer limited to unfolding a blanket on the 25 miles of oceanfront that stretches from Lewes to Fenwick Island.\n\nBig Oyster Brewery, The Station on Kings and The Wheelhouse are three new, extra roomy restaurants that have recently opened in Lewes.\n\nA not-yet-named Indian restaurant, which could hold up to 100 seats including 20 on the porch, is coming soon to an old Victorian home on Savannah Road in Lewes.\n\nIron Hill Brewery & Restaurant's brand new, 9,000-square-foot Del. 1 location in Rehoboth Beach also has plenty of elbow room.\n\nWith a banquet room, patio and indoor dining area and a full view of the kitchen and brewing operation, the Sussex County Iron Hill can seat up to 425 people. That's twice as many as its flagship Newark location.\n\nThe newish Dogfish Head Brewery owned eateries, Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats (180-seats) and Chesapeake & Maine (160 seats), in downtown Rehoboth are anything but cramped.\n\nComing soon to the Dogfish restaurant complex on Rehoboth Avenue is an outdoor courtyard for even more people.\n\nThe Pines, a modern coastal tavern on Rehoboth's Baltimore Avenue expected to open in July, is a complete redo of the old Hobos restaurant. It will have seating on both floors as well as an outdoor area with 750 square feet of seating.\n\nBigger isn't just better in Lewes and Rehoboth. The Big Chill Beach Club at the Delaware Seashore State Park in North Bethany is a mega, multi-deck outdoor hospitality center.\n\nThe restaurant, which marks its second year in business but first full summer season, doesn't just have sweeping 360-degree views of the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian River Inlet, and the Indian River Bay, it also can host outdoor concerts. And it seats 200 people on the rooftop deck.\n\nThe restaurant is run by La Vida Hospitality Group, which also operates The Crooked Hammock, a Lewes eatery that has a summertime barbecue atmosphere. Opened since 2015, the 7,000-square-foot brewpub can host about 270 people both indoors and outdoors.\n\nScott Kammerer, president of SoDel Concepts, which owns 10 coastal restaurants, a catering company, a food truck and other food-related businesses and nonprofits, says the trend toward bigger restaurants is cyclical.\n\nKammerer remembers 20 years ago many beach restaurants \"were huge.\"\n\n\"The thought was they were only busy for a couple of months and they had to fill as many seats as possible in a short amount of time to make money,\" he says.\n\nBut Kammerer says as the so-called shoulder seasons, the time period between peak and off-peak seasons, started becoming more popular, smaller, more refined beach restaurants became the norm.\n\n\"They didn't need to fill their seats more than one or two times,\" he says, because diners were coming to the restaurants more frequently.\n\nIn recent years, the pendulum has swung back to bigger buildings due to an increase in year-round visitors and more full-time residents.\n\n\"It used to be people came on weekends. Then, those people would buy second homes down here. Then, those people moved here. Now, we see them year-round,\" says Kammerer.\n\nRolling out the red carpet for Delaware guests is important to the economy. Beaches, dining and tax-free shopping continue to be popular activities for visitors. They spent an average of $384 per trip to the state in 2016, according to state tourism figures.\n\nKammerer estimates he now feeds 50,000 people a week at the company's 10 restaurants located in Fenwick Island, Bethany Beach, Ocean View, South Bethany, Rehoboth and Lewes.\n\nLast summer, Kammerer opened one of SoDel's biggest restaurants to date, Bluecoast Seafood Grill on Del. 1 in Rehoboth. The restaurant – 4,500-square-feet inside and 2,500-square-feet outside – can accommodate 260 guests. It's located in the Rehoboth Gateway shopping center.\n\nThe idea behind the bigger building was to create different experiences on one property so guests will stay longer. Kammerer says at Bluecoast there are two bars, a large outdoor gathering area, fire pits and an acoustic stage.\n\n\"You can go in the library area and have one experience, or go sit at the raw bar and have a different feeling. As guests' tastes evolve, they like to have multiple experiences in one place in one evening,\" he says.\n\nThe bigger space has another advantage – lots of free parking. \"The parking is really important. We have 600 parking spots,\" Kammerer says.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Southern Delaware Tourism survey, visitors said that more parking is needed in the beach resort towns.\n\nRehoboth, which in early Hebrew meant “broad places,\" does have a limit on super-sized buildings.\n\nThe 6,300-square-foot new Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats, which opened to great fanfare in 2017, will likely be the last restaurant of its scale in the downtown area.\n\nIronically the original brewpub, founded in 1995 and razed this past fall to make room for the new courtyard, was considered the smallest commercial brewery in America.\n\nIn November 2016, Rehoboth Beach commissioners voted on restaurant size limits. Eateries that serve alcohol within the city will now be allowed 2,500 square feet of seated dining area and 500 square feet of bar area, with no limits on storage or kitchen space.\n\nThis is a change from the previously allowed 5,000-square-foot total, an area regulation that had been in effect for two decades. The ordinance also regulates brewpubs, dining establishments which make, bottle and sell alcohol on site. Such establishments will only be allowed to produce up to 4,000 barrels of beer per year.\n\nBig Oyster Brewery, a new restaurant located in a 6,000-square-foot barn-like structure off Kings Highway in Lewes, can seat about 100 people inside and outside. Nearby, the sprawling Wheelhouse at Fisherman's Wharf on the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal, which opened in mid-April, can serve around 400 customers.\n\nThe Wheelhouse has more than 9,000 square feet, with tables on two floors of the structure along with raw bars, a fire pit and an area where patrons can sit with their pet dogs.\n\nAt The Station on Kings, a new cafe/market/bakery on Kings Highway, soaring, lofty ceilings and bright, white decor help create its spacious atmosphere.\n\nThe openness is further enhanced by the sunny and generously-sized glass-enclosed greenhouse dining area where customers can sit and enjoy coffee and eat made-in-house French macarons or duck pastrami sandwiches.\n\nMike Anderson, director of sales and distribution for Fins Hospitality Group, which runs Big Oyster Brewery, says the spaciousness of its new brewpub was intentional.\n\nHe says the Kings Highway site was initially a floral/garden center and home. Fins built the barn structure from the ground up and designed it as a homage to Lewes' and Sussex County's agricultural history.\n\nThe building was supposed to be primarily a beer production facility, showcasing its 15-barrel system with 30-barrel fermenters. Large windows throughout the building allow customers can see the brewing process.\n\nBut Anderson says half of the space now is devoted to dining.\n\nDELAWARE FOOD\n\nBeach tacos, margaritas: MezCali Taqueria, new to Dewey Beach scene\n\nNew in Rehoboth: Upscale steakhouse, wine bar, crab house\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/reviewed/2024/09/08/best-fall-sales/75131622007/", "title": "Fall sales: 40 best sales at Pottery Barn, Target, HexClad, more", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Here are four of their stories.\n\nThe kindness of the Keltons\n\nMartha Hartway's story began in 1864.\n\nThat's when the 10-year-old fled from the bonds of slavery in Virginia along with her 14-year-old sister, Pearl. The Keltons — Fernando Cortez Kelton, Sophia Stone Kelton and their children — a wealthy, well-liked Columbus family with anti-slavery leanings, gave the sisters shelter in the midst of the Civil War.\n\nThe Keltons operated a station along the Underground Railroad inside their Victorian-era home, first built in 1852, now known as the Kelton House Museum & Garden in Downtown's Discovery District.\n\nMartha Hartway was too sick to move further north along the Underground Railroad, so the Keltons took her in and raised her as their own.\n\n\"I think what people don't know is that the story didn't end in 1865,\" said Sarah Richardt, executive director of the Kelton House Museum & Garden. \"People put the story of Martha there during the Civil War, and when the war is over, slavery is over and the story ends.\"\n\nRichardt explained that Hartway lived with the family and met her future husband, Thomas Lawrence, in the Kelton House. They got married in 1873 in the front parlor room.\n\n\"It wasn't just a moment in time,\" Richardt said. \"It went on for decades, and the families were close for decades. They named children after each other.\"\n\nTours of the Kelton House at 586 E Town St. can be made Monday through Wednesday by appointment by visiting keltonhouse.com, or people can drop in Thursday through Sunday from noon-4 p.m to take a tour on the hour.\n\nDr. Pinney's speaking tube\n\nIn the early 1820s, Dr. Eli Morrison Pinney lived on South Riverview Street along the Scioto River in Dublin. He served as a doctor for what was then a poor farming village north of Columbus.\n\nBut unbeknownst to his neighbors, Pinney also was an avid abolitionist who took in freedom seekers and hid them in a nearby barn on his property, according to Tom Holton, a volunteer with and former president of the Dublin Historical Society.\n\nHolton explained that Pinney would communicate with those seeking refuge in the barn through a speaking tube, discovered by Dublin historian Emmett Karrer in the 1980s.\n\n\"It was called a speaking tube, but you would not have wanted to speak through it, in case someone was walking along the street,\" Holton said. \"Escapees may not have known the doctor was there, so they may have poked something through the tube — a long piece of grass, or blown through it.\"\n\nPinney gave the freedom seekers food, shelter and medical attention during the day, and at night they would travel north along the Scioto River to the next stop, Holton said.\n\n\"The rivers were like the freeway for them,\" he said. \"The Olentangy and Scioto rivers were pathways to follow.\"\n\nMore information about Pinney is available at dublinohiohistory.org. To request a walking tour of the city along the Scioto River that includes a stroll past his home, fill out a Dublin Historical Society Tour request form at bit.ly/3HheWTc.\n\nThe heart of the Hanby House\n\nWilliam Hanby came to Ohio after fleeing indentured servitude.\n\nHis mother was a widow, and as one of five children he was contracted to work with a harness-maker for his best chance to learn a trade and make a living. But his master was cruel and Hanby, a white man, escaped to Rushville, Ohio, in Fairfield County from western Pennsylvania.\n\nIt was in Rushville and later Circleville that he became involved in the Underground Railroad movement.\n\n\"He had a little more of a sense of what servitude was than most people who were dealing with the Underground Railroad because of his indentured [past],\" said Beth Weinhardt, president of the Westerville Historical Society.\n\nShe said Hanby eventually moved to Westerville in 1853 with his wife, Ann, and their eight children. Their house, also a stop on the Underground Railroad, has been moved to the corner of Main and Center streets, located at 160 West Main Street. He co-founded Otterbein University and championed access to education for women and Black people.\n\n\"His conscience led him to be involved in this movement,\" she added.\n\nHis son, Benjamin, helped his father hide freedom seekers in the elder Hanby's harness shop in Westerville. It was Benjamin who penned the famous Civil War-era tune, \"Darling Nelly Gray\" — inspired by the tragic story of Joe Selby, an escapee who lost his love, a slave at an adjacent plantation, after she was \"sold down river.\"\n\nSelby died in the Hanbys' home in Rushville before he could reach Canada and purchase Gray's freedom.\n\nThe Westerville Historical Society manages the Hanby House for the Ohio History Connection, which owns the property. Free tours can be scheduled by appointment by calling 614-891-6289 or emailing Weinhardt at WHSpres@westervillehistory.org.\n\nDelaware County's first Black-owned farm\n\nAbraham \"Abram\" Depp knew the costs of bondage firsthand.\n\nBorn as a slave on a tobacco plantation in Virginia, Depp made his way to Ohio after being freed. He then purchased nearly 400 acres of land in Delaware County, making it the first Black-owned farm in the county.\n\nThe Depp family turned the farm into a community and was dedicated in assisting freedom seekers, who hid in the limestone caves along the Scioto River adjacent to the property during the day.\n\nAt night, the Depps would ring a bell, the \"all clear\" signal for freedom seekers to leave the caves so the family could guide them north, said Michael Hamilton, a local historian.\n\nIn the 1920s, Depp's daughter, Lucy, sold part of the land to her cousin Robert Goode, who founded the Lucy Depp Park, a 102-acre subdivision with 720 lots, next to Shawnee Hills, said Hamilton, who grew up in Lucy Depp Park and still lives in one of the original homes built in 1932.\n\nThe neighborhood offered Black people in central Ohio a community, and later, during the Jim Crow-era, a sanctuary from Columbus' racist housing policies.\n\n\"Joe Louis, the heavyweight boxer from the 1930s, was known to stay in Lucy Depp Park during the summers,\" said Hamilton, explaining that the neighborhood gained notoriety as an African-American resort over the years.\n\nTo learn more about the Depp Settlement and Lucy Depp Park or schedule a visit, email hello@lucydepppark.com or visit lucydepppark.com.\n\nCéilí Doyle is a Report for America corps member and covers rural issues in Ohio for The Dispatch.

He was removed in the early '60s when I-95 came through.\n\nIn the years since, the statue has found other homes before it was dropped in 1978, shattering into dozens of pieces.\n\nNow, nearly 40 years later, a $100,000 campaign is underway to rebuild the zinc Gambrinus statue from its original pieces, and display him at the Delaware Historical Society.\n\n\"For me, it's the perfect symbol for the rebirth of the brewing industry in Delaware, which was shattered by Prohibition,\" says John Medkeff Jr., who owns the statue and is leading the campaign. \"It was an icon for 80 years and it's the most significant item that remains from Delaware's golden age of brewing.\"\n\nSo how did a leading Delaware beer historian come in possession of the statue? And why restore the king all these years later?\n\nMedkeff, author of 2015's \"Brewing in Delaware\" ($21.99, Arcadia Publishing), has owned the statue since 2014 and now houses it in a safe space as fundraising for statue surgery begins.\n\nIt's been a long journey for Delaware's king of beers, which has been battered over the years, even spending some time in a junkyard on Airport Road near New Castle. A 1978 News Journal file photo shows two men posing with the stately statue at the salvage yard.\n\nIn the years since, Gabrinus' pieces have languished in a storehouse before Medkeff acquired it from the estate of Wilmington resident Robert Howard, a curator of technology at Hagley Museum and Library who died in 2012.\n\nIt was a scene right out of a movie.\n\nMedkeff had contacted the Howard estate after hearing about the statue's location, looking to take photos of it for his book.\n\n\"The attorney asked me, 'Do you know anyone who would want this?',\" remembers Medkeff, who just happened to be perhaps the most perfect person in the state to ask. \"They wanted to clear out the house. It was headed to the scrap yard. So I dumped it in my truck and got it home.\"\n\nNow, Medkeff is Gabrinus' Geppetto. But while Medkeff won't be the one doing the Gambrinus repairs, he's the main force behind the king's resurrection.\n\nWith only a handful of small fundraisers held already -- Wilmington's recent Brew-Fest and the \"Delaware: A Brew Story\" series at Blue Ball barn in Rockland -- about $5,000 has been raised. The campaign, expected to take three to five years, will begin formal fundraising soon. Donations can be made at restoretheking.com.\n\nDelaware's King Gambrinus was born in the early 1880s when Wilmington-based Joseph Stoeckle Brewing Co. purchased it from Brooklyn's M. Gebelt & Brothers Co.\n\nAs Medkeff notes, the statue stood high above the corner of Fifth and Adams streets in Wilmington until the brewery went bankrupt in 1955. The statue came down in 1962 when the brewery was demolished to make way for I-95.\n\nCohen Brothers Furniture purchased the brewery complex, including the statue. And for a short time, it was placed in the window of the furniture store a couple of blocks away from the brewery at 511 Madison St.\n\nBy the next year, King Gabrinus was sold to restaurateur Francis Corridori and found a new home: in front of the old King's Inn on Naamans Road in Brandywine Hundred, where Harry's Savoy Grill now stands. Not surprisingly, local teens enjoyed drinking beers near the statue.\n\nWhen the business closed in 1972, Gabrinus was moved to storage and remained until Medkeff acquired it.\n\nIn a neat twist, local musician Daniel Corridori, son of the late Francis Corridori, performed at the recent Brew-Fest, which partially benefited the Restore the King campaign.\n\nCorridori worked at his father's restaurant doing everything from parking cars to doing dishes as a teenager while Gambrinus stood guard out front. If restored, Corridori says he would recognize a familiar face.\n\n\"Absolutely. We always had fun with The King while he was there. It was a landmark,\" he says. \"It'll be fantastic to see him again. I'd love to see that. It's a good memory and a good time for my family back then.\"\n\nOnce the statue is restored, it will have a new overseer: Delaware Historical Society Executive Director Scott Loehr and his team at the Market Street Museum.\n\nIt's not every day that the society welcomes an 11-foot man with a frothy beer in hand, but Gambrinus didn't catch them by surprise. Medkeff is regularly there doing research on his Delaware beer projects.\n\n\"We've long known about John's dream and vision of restoring the Gambrinus statue for some time,\" Loehr says.\n\nAn exact display location within the museum, which underwent a $7 million renovation last year, has not been decided, he added.\n\nWhen the Cohens first purchased the statue in 1962, the original plan was to have it restored to its original condition since its arm holding the goblet of beer had broke off a few years earlier.\n\nFifty-five years later, Medkeff is dedicated to finishing the job.\n\n\"Unlike the recent controversies going on with some of the Civil War statues, I doubt many people, except maybe prohibitionists, would have a problem with ol' Grambrinus,\" he says.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Southern comfort food blended with tastes of other longitudes and latitudes summarizes the UBK menu: gumbo to salmon, surf 'n' turf pasta to honey garlic pork chops, and gumbo worthy to stand with anything from south Louisiana. Hands-on warm service, where co-owners will likely stop by to ask about your meal, and variations on down-home standards such as mac 'n' cheese and sweet potato fries, make patrons feel at (a slightly better version of) home. Though it opened only three years ago, it has fast become not only a Druid City hit but the place you take visitors to show off. − Mark Cobb, The Tuscaloosa News\n\nDetails: 2001 E. Apache Blvd., Tempe, Ariz.; 480-916-3690, cocinachiwasaz.com\n\nCocina Chiwas restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends mesquite-fired Mexican cooking — comfort food taken to new heights.\n\nAt Cocina Chiwas, a wall of windows opens onto a patio nearly as large as the modern dining room. It is anchored by a sleek bar showcasing unusual agave spirits on one side and an open kitchen built around a mesquite-fed grill constructed by co-owner Armando Hernandez himself. He and Nadia Holguin co-own other Phoenix restaurants, including James Beard Award nominee Bacanora, but opening Cocina Chiwas in February 2023 was especially personal, a chance to play with the flavors of their childhoods. Bright Mexican seafood aguachiles and seasonal salads shine ahead of the main event: wood-fired parrillada featuring tender skirt steak carne asada, sweet-spicy al pastor and chorizo con papas served with diner-style rice and beans and fresh corn tortillas. It’s comfort food taken to new heights. − Felicia Campbell, The Arizona Republic (Phoenix)\n\nDetails: 2333 E. Osborn Road, Phoenix, Ariz.; 602-595-5881, glaibaanaz.com\n\nGlai Baan restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this spot on permanent rotation for food lovers in Phoenix.\n\nGlai Baan means \"far from home\" and is an ode to chef Pornsupak \"Cat\" Bunnag’s homeland in northern Thailand. She and Dan Robinson opened the intimate restaurant in 2017, and it has been packed ever since with diners eager to enjoy dishes like kanom jeeb pork dumplings and yum het tod tempura oyster mushrooms and cocktails infused with Thai ingredients. The charming patio is adorned with flapping flags and string lights, and the cozy dining room feels like stepping into Bunnag’s childhood home. Consistently excellent, Glai Baan was a 2023 James Beard semifinalist for its outstanding wine and beverage program and is on permanent rotation for food lovers in Phoenix. Word to the wise: The restaurant’s popularity warrants making a reservation to avoid long waits. − Bahar Anooshahr, The Arizona Republic (Phoenix)\n\nDetails: 77734 Country Club Drive, Palm Desert, Calif.; 760-200-5400, alpsvillage.com\n\nAlps Village restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends a German favorite with old European charm.\n\nA taste of Europe is never far away when you sit down at Alps Village in Palm Desert. Not only does the interior evoke old European charm with its wooden tables and barrel-like chairs, but chef Milka Damjanovic worked in German kitchens in the former Yugoslavia during the war in the 1990s. After the family immigrated to the United States, her daughter Blanka Sanin opened the restaurant in 2016, and it has become a staple in the Coachella Valley. There are several German favorites on the menu, such as Wiener schnitzel and spätzle (egg noodles), alongside Balkan staples like cevapcici (sausages), shopska salad and cabbage rolls. No visit is complete with a piece of the not-too-sweet white cake. − Ema Sasic, The Desert Sun (Palm Springs, Calif.)\n\nDetails: 1005 W. Stuart St., Fort Collins, Colo.; 970-999-5757, beijingnoodlecolorado.com\n\nBeijing Noodle restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends a hidden gem with from-scratch Chinese food from Henan province.\n\nTucked inside a squat strip mall in west Fort Collins, Beijing Noodle solidly falls into “hidden gem” territory, serving comforting, authentic Chinese fare not often found in northern Colorado. Walk into the cozy restaurant with dark wood paneled walls, and you’ll often find Tianxi “Dennis” Zhang smiling behind the counter and his wife, Yirong Sun, back in the kitchen. She's whipping up everything from rou jia mo, a common, daily meal in northwest China known stateside as “Chinese hamburgers,” to Henan gravy noodles, which are a favorite in Sun’s home province of Henan. Not sure what to order? Try Beijing Noodle’s fan favorite: oil spill noodles, poured over with hot oil to make a spicy garlic topped with house-made Sichuan sauce. − Erin Udell, The Coloradan (Fort Collins)\n\nDetails: 2020 Naamans Road, Wilmington, Del.; 302-475-3000, harryshospitalitygroup.com/harrys-savoy-grill\n\nHarry's Savoy Grill restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this special occasional steakhouse.\n\nDelaware's best ambassador of hospitality is easily Xavier Teixido. His classy Harry's Savory Grill has been setting the bar high for the state's dining since 1988. Teixido, who worked at the Brennan family’s legendary Commander’s Palace in New Orleans, has been honored by the National Restaurant Association. His business partner Kelly O'Hanlon started as a Harry's bartender in 1995. Harry's, known as \"Delaware's premier steakhouse,\" is the place to go with a gathering of friends, a dinner with parents, a birthday or anniversary celebration, or a night out on the town. Start with icy cold raw oysters and make sure to order either the signature prime rib or a 45-day aged rib-eye. You won't be sorry. − Patricia Talorico, The News Journal (Wilmington, Del.)\n\nDetails: 415 N. Alcaniz St., Pensacola, Fla.; 850-208-6913, brotherfoxsisterhen.com\n\nBrother Fox restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this Spanish-influenced favorite from a 'Chopped' champion.\n\nAt Brother Fox, the bones of the Old Mount Olive Baptist Church assembled in 1928 come back to life. Now, friends gather in fellowship to break Catalan-style toasted bread and sip Spanish sangria. The menu merges the city’s history as America’s first settlement with the modern expertise of executive chef Darian Hernandez, a Food Network “Chopped” champion. Dishes like the Low Country shrimp boil “a la España” — with Florida Gulf shrimp, Spanish chorizo, charred corn and potatoes — are the menu’s heart. But you can’t miss the dishes made on the fire, from cabbage baked in embers to sous vide coal-fired chicken with anticucho. Once finished, meander inside speakeasy Sister Hen − abbreviated \"S.H.,” pronounced “shh” − for a nightcap under candlelight. − Brittany Misencik, Pensacola News Journal (Fla.)\n\nDetails: 330 S. Washington Ave., Titusville, Fla.; thedaleytrade.com\n\nThe Daley Trade restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this ever-changing menu with out-of-this-world food.\n\nIn a town better known for rocket launches than out-of-this-world food, diners are over the moon for The Daley Trade. Glass walls, lush greenery and midcentury decor give the airy dining room the feeling of a mod terrarium, while the tropical back bar offers a secret garden escape. Chef Terrence Daley, a Culinary Institute of America graduate who worked in fine-dining kitchens across the country, landed in wife Laura’s hometown during the pandemic. He began making bread and pasta for home delivery. Now located in a historic downtown building, The Daley Trade has transitioned into a marketplace and restaurant. Look for an ever-changing menu inspired by the Daleys’ world travels and featuring seasonal, locally grown ingredients, often served with house-made pasta and sourdough bread. − Suzy Fleming Leonard, Florida Today\n\nDetails: 12306 46th Ave. W., Cortez, Fla.; 941-794-1243, starfishcompany.com\n\nStar Fish Company restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the exceptional Gulf seafood with a view of the bay.\n\nNestled along Sarasota Bay in the fishing village of Cortez, Star Fish Company offers exceptional Gulf seafood with a generous serving of Old Florida charm. Credit Karen Bell, a third-generation Cortezian dedicated to preserving her family's commercial fishing heritage. She not only owns Star Fish and its adjoining fish market but also a fleet of commercial fishing boats and the adjacent “fish house.” While dining at her dockside restaurant boasting a century of history, you'll be captivated by the fishermen working alongside seabirds and the occasional dolphin. Star Fish serves expertly prepared Florida favorites like grouper, shrimp and oysters. However, the restaurant is particularly renowned for its mullet, a fish best enjoyed fried or blackened with a side of cheese grits. − Wade Tatangelo, Sarasota Herald-Tribune (Fla.)\n\nDetails: 2000 PGA Blvd., Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.; 561-408-3685, StagePGA.com\n\nStage Kitchen & Bar restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the creative modern Indian fare.\n\nStage, with the clean, modern lines of its spacious dining room and leafy outdoor patio, brought big-city buzz to a once monotone patch of Palm Beach County. A lively vibe spirits you through the dining experience, but it is chef/co-owner Pushkar Marathe’s creative, modern-Indian plates that will bring you back. Those bites include a bruleed chicken liver pate spiced with cardamom, green ginger and fenugreek, local fish served in Bengali-style sauce, tandoori churrasco, plus an eclectic array of small plates. Marathe’s innovative cooking earned Stage national acclaim, including a 2023 James Beard Award semifinalist nod. He and Stage partner Andy Dugard defied the odds, having opened just days before the 2020 pandemic shutdown and rebounding into destination status. − Liz Balmaseda, The Palm Beach Post (Fla.)\n\nDetails: 1801 Habersham St., Savannah, Ga.; 912-777-6286, cottonandrye.com\n\nCotton & Rye restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the elevated comfort food that nod to Savannah's long history as a global port city.\n\nA cheese and wine shop was just one of the many ventures that tried and failed to take hold in the midcentury bank building until Savannah native Zach Shultz captured lighting in a bourbon bottle in 2015. With Cotton and Rye, Shultz created a warm industrial space in which to savor elevated comfort foods that seem both achingly familiar and entirely new with each bite. Executive chef Caleb Ayers assembles artful charcuterie boards filled with house-made sausages and cured meats. His curry-infused chicken and dumplings winks and nods at Savannah’s long history as a global port city. Ayers’ chicken thighs and mac ‘n’ cheese are worth the caloric splurge. − Amy Paige Condon, Savannah Morning News (Ga.)\n\nDetails: 301 SW Water St., Peoria, Ill.; 309-431-7801, ardorbp.com\n\nArdor Breads and Provisions restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends dishes cooked over the crackling flames of a live-fire hearth.\n\nFood cooks over the crackling flames of a live-fire hearth at Ardor Breads and Provisions. The idea of fire and burning is carried into the restaurant’s name. Ardor has roots in the Latin word for burning and describes an intense passion. Founder Cody Scogin opened the business as a “small, humble bakery” in 2020.\n\nAs community support grew, though, Scogin said it became evident that “Peoria wanted more.” So Ardor melded its original bakery with a new, full-service restaurant. The business continues to offer its staple baked goods and pastries but now has a seasonal menu for dining. Don't miss the wood-grilled swordfish, corned beef tongue and a kimchi fried chicken sandwich. − Cassidy Waigand, Peoria Journal Star (Ill.)\n\nDetails: 614 E. Second St., Bloomington, Ind.; 812-407-4339, elmbloomington.com\n\nThe Elm restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends seasonal small plates, including pork two ways.\n\nNestled in the Elm Heights neighborhood next to a 70-plus-foot American elm that gave the restaurant its name, owners Martha and David Moore created a gathering space that invites guests to sit for a cup of coffee and pastry, a cocktail and small plates to share or a meal crafted to excite. Photographs of worldwide adventures adorn the walls while plates are filled with seasonal fare presented in unique ways, from the small plate of Ararat-roasted carrots with chickpea hummus to the pork dish with crispy pork belly and cochinita pibil with orange corn grits, braised and crispy kale and pickled red onions. — Carol Kugler, The Herald Times (Bloomington)\n\nDetails: 402 E. 16th St., Indianapolis, Ind.; 317-925-5000, tinkerstreetrestaurant.com\n\nTinker Street restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this celebration of food, meticulously crafted to delight.\n\nHead chef and owner Tom Main brought more than two decades of restaurant experience when he opened Tinker Street in 2015, but it's Main's lifetime of loving food that shines through. The twinkling lights of Tinker's patio entrance welcome diners to a celebration of food, starting with flutes of complimentary champagne dubbed the Tinker Toast. Where a lesser restaurant might call good enough good enough, Main and company fastidiously experiment and, fittingly, tinker with every dish until it's meticulously crafted to delight. Be it crunchy hazelnuts dotting the fried Brussels sprouts or pickled cranberries bursting amid whipped butternut squash, every forkful is a loving ode to all things wholesome and delicious. − Bradley Hohulin, The Indianapolis Star (Indiana)\n\nDetails: 2724 Ingersoll Ave., Des Moines; 515-244-1314, harbingerdsm.com\n\nHarbinger restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the vegetable-forward small plates influenced by the chef-owner's annual trips to Southeast Asia.\n\nFive-time James Beard Foundation semifinalist for Best Chef: Midwest Joe Tripp opened his vegetable-forward small plates menu restaurant Harbinger in Des Moines in 2018 with an emphasis on advanced cooking techniques and Asian influences. Tripp takes yearly trips, often with staff, to Asia — specifically Vietnam, Korea and Thailand — and brings back ideas to create new seasonal dishes that incorporate farm-to-table ingredients from Iowa. Chef Ryan Skinner makes dishes such as soured farm carrots with a house-made lemongrass sausage, a duck breast roasted with hoisin, and three varieties of steam buns. For a taste of what’s to come, order the tasting menu, seven experimental courses that may end up on the next iteration of the frequently changing menu. — Susan Stapleton, Des Moines Register\n\nDetails: 202 N. Linn St., Iowa City, Iowa; 319-800-0720, thewebsteric.com\n\nThe Webster restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends sharing several plates and stealing a bit from every dish.\n\nLess than a mile away from Iowa City’s crowded bars catering to college students is the Webster, providing patrons an elevated dining experience in the city’s historic Northside neighborhood. Chef and restaurateur Sam Gelman, whose culinary experience includes years with the Momofuku group established by chef David Chang, operates his restaurant at the site of what was a drugstore he visited for lunch with his father and grandfather as a youngster. The Webster, named after his grandfather, offers guests a menu reflective of the seasons with a focus on sourcing products from the Midwest. Small portions encourage diners to order several plates for the table — and to steal a bite from every dish. — Paris Barraza, Des Moines Register\n\nDetails: 10500 W. Highway 42, Goshen, Ky.; 502-398-9289, hermitagefarm.com\n\nBarn 8 restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this destination restaurant set on a modernized old horse farm where you can dine right in a stall.\n\nBarn 8 sits on the 600-acre Hermitage Farm, where visitors can take in the sights of rolling equine farmland, edible gardens and greenhouses. Since Laura Lee Brown and Steve Wilson, known for founding 21c Museum Hotels among other ventures, opened Barn 8 in 2020, the place has become a go-to for locals and visitors alike. And why not? What could be more Kentucky than tables available inside horse stalls and surrounded by stacks of bourbon barrels? While the 19th-century structure maintains the frame of a barn stuck in time, the space is modernized with decor, artwork, leather chairs and upscale details. From the seasonal menu, consider the cast iron cornbread, which requires a 15-minute wait to be made from scratch, and go from there. Simple dishes such as house-made bread, spaghetti and burrata shine, while the pork loin and duck breast entrees are favorites. Dessert options also change frequently, but a banana date cake is a top recommendation during the winter. − Amanda Hancock, The Courier-Journal (Louisville, Ky.)\n\nDetails: 835 E. Main St., Louisville, Ky.; 502.690.2067, nami-restaurant.com\n\nNami restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this modern Korean steakhouse from the city's best known food personality, Edward Lee.\n\nAfter 20 years in Louisville, the city’s best-known food personality, Korean American chef Edward Lee, opened a Korean restaurant here. Lee last opened a Korean restaurant as a 25-year-old first-time owner in New York City. Louisville, which has championed the chef for the success of 610 Magnolia and his many awards, was ready for a look at Nami, which means “I am beautiful” in Korean. The modern Korean steakhouse arrived last May, and it’s clear people like what they see and taste. Between the welcoming atmosphere and menu, featuring Korean barbecue dishes, bibimbap rice bowls and kimbap hand rolls, there are many reasons to return. − Amanda Hancock, The Courier-Journal (Louisville, Ky.)\n\nDetails: 3814 Magazine St., New Orleans; 504-493-939, dakarnola.com\n\nDakar NOLA restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the menu that makes delicious connections between Senegalese and Creole cuisine — where diner is as much a performance as a meal.\n\nSerigne Mbaye grew up in Senegal. When he arrived in New Orleans, he found familiar flavors. The city’s Creole cooking, like the food he grew up eating, often relies on layered, slow-cooked dishes. At Dakar NOLA, his first restaurant, Mbaye mines the connections between the two cuisines. Guests sit at communal tables, and the prix fixe dinner is as much a performance as a meal. With each course, Mbaye comes out of the kitchen and offers a story. The intensely flavored black-eyed peas with palm oil, for example, were inspired by the last meal fed to enslaved Africans before crossing the Atlantic. His jollof rice, an African staple, is delicious evidence of the origin of Louisiana’s jambalaya. Mbaye, a quiet perfectionist, can also leave the room speechless with the confidence of his cooking. − Todd A. Price, USA TODAY Network (South)\n\nDetails: 3030 Creswell Ave., Shreveport, La.; 318-351-2253, fatcalfbrasserie.com\n\nFat Calf Brasserie restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends seasonal French-inspired Southern dishes, including crispy Brussels sprouts.\n\nA brasserie is a small, informal and unpretentious neighborhood restaurant. Owners Anthony and Amanda Felan fulfill that definition with their small but welcoming restaurant serving French-inspired Southern cuisine. Customers can expect a variety of shareable appetizers and hearty entrees, a nice selection of craft beers, specialty cocktails and wine. The menu, with plates such as a crispy Brussels sprouts and crispy duck breast, changes with the seasons and uses locally sourced ingredients. − Makenzie Boucher, The Shreveport Times\n\nDetails: 310 Main St., Warren, Me.; 206-276-5231, blackgoatsupperclub.com\n\nBlack Goat Test Kitchen & Supperclub restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the special-occasion multi-course feasts that are very much a taste of Maine.\n\nOverlooking the scenic St. George River in the sleepy midcoast town of Warren, dinners are treated to an intimate meal served at a long, rustic table set for 12. Candlelight provides ambience while aromas waft from the adjacent open kitchen. There, chefs Derek Ronspies and Cat Biggar prepare the multi-course feasts of Black Goat’s supper club. The pair moved to Maine from Washington state in August to run their special event restaurant. They collaborate with a local brewery, winery or cidery for a four-course pairing dinner. Their menus are very much a taste of Maine, from local oysters to freshly caught arctic char to native mushrooms or black garlic. Ronspies' dishes are layered with flavors and textures: contrasting meats and vegetables, greens and grains. Biggar’s desserts are sampler plates likely to include, but not star, macarons and ice cream. − Gail Ciampa, The Providence Journal (R.I.)\n\nDetails: 3921 2nd Ave., Detroit, Mich.; 313-438-5055, seldenstandard.com\n\nSelden Standard restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends seasonal ingredients, housemade pastas and breads and Michigan-raised meat charred at a wood-fired hearth.\n\nWhen it opened in 2014, Selden Standard brought a fresh culinary perspective to midtown Detroit, a neighborhood better known for its fast-casual spots and takeout joints than upscale dining establishments. In the decade that followed, the New American restaurant has become a pillar in midtown, which is now a hotbed for some of the city’s most popular restaurants, and a beacon for Detroit’s culinary scene at large. The Selden Standard team has racked up six James Beard nominations and in 2015, the restaurant was named the Detroit Free Press/Metro Detroit Chevy Dealers Restaurant of the Year. The space’s modern aesthetic serves as an ideal backdrop for a rotating menu of simply prepared seasonal ingredients, house-made pastas and breads and Michigan-raised meat charred in a wood-fired hearth. − Lyndsay C. Green, Detroit Free Press (Michigan)\n\nDetails: 420 South First Street, Minneapolis, Minn.; 612-444-1846, owamni.com\n\nOwamni restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends delicious, healthful menus featuring food native to North America.\n\nOwamni overlooks its namesake on the Mississippi − Owámniyomni is the Dakota name for the only waterfall on the river, known as St. Anthony Falls in English. At the downtown Minneapolis restaurant, chef Sean Sherman provides a vision of what modern Indigenous food can be. It's not about re-creating traditional dishes but rather removing colonial ingredients and supporting Indigenous food producers through delicious, healthful menus featuring food native to North America. That looks like tepary bean dip, pheasant tacos and a smoked bison ribeye dripping with flavor that shouldn't be missed. Go ahead and order a selection of the tasty sauces to take everything to the next level. By its nature, much of Indigenous food is plant-based and friendly to restricted diets. Sherman has won multiple James Beard awards and is executive director of his nonprofit that seeks to build an entire economy around Indigenous foods. − Liz Schubauer, The Tennessean (Nashville)\n\nDetails: 1801 Dalton St., Jackson, Miss.; 601-352-4555, stampssuperburgers.company.site\n\nStamps Super Burgers restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends massive burgers served with a friendly smile.\n\nStamps is a well-known burger joint that offers massive beef burgers, along with turkey burgers, and a portobello burger that weighs 11 ounces − sometimes even more. The family-owned business has a popular, walk-in atmosphere that serves all with a juicy burger and a vibe anyone would love to feel. Owner Phil Stamps Jr. is known to give everyone a greeting when they walk into Stamps Super Burgers, which has been operating in the Washington Addition neighborhood since 1986. − Kiara Fleming, The Clarion Ledger (Jackson, Miss.)\n\nDetails: Louis' Basque Corner, 301 E. Fourth St., Reno, Nev.; 775-323-7203, louisbasquecorner.com\n\nLouis' Basque Corner restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends rustic Basque fare served at communal tables — a quintessential Nevada experience.\n\nLouis' Basque Corner is not up-and-coming; it's not trendy like some Las Vegas dining experience. Sometimes you're seated a little too close to the kitchen. But what Louis' does offer is a taste of Old Nevada, where customers dine at communal tables on fare that sustained the Basque shepherds − soup, beans and bread, lamb, steak and oxtail with fries to sop up the savory juices. The atmosphere is rustic, inviting you to relax, dig in and strike up a conversation with your tablemates. This is the place to bring out-of-state guests for a unique Nevada experience, and it never disappoints. − Peggy Santoro, The Reno Gazette-Journal (Nev.)\n\nDetails: 387 Crooks Ave, Paterson, N.J.; 973-345-8558, albashausa.com\n\nAl-Basha restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the incomparable hummus, delicious mezze and meat platters served on wooden boards.\n\nFood lovers will drive for hours, even get on a plane, to dine at the most recent, most fashionable, most buzzed-about spot they've read about, but they never step foot, and thus dine, in one of the most interesting cities in New Jersey: Paterson (America's first industrial city, home of the Great Falls, birthplace of Lou Costello). Big mistake. Paterson has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country and some of the most delicious Middle Eastern eats. The best of them all? Al-Basha, a quarter-century-old Palestinian restaurant, which arguably offers the best hummus in the region, if not, well, the planet. Scoop it up with torn pieces of warm, fluffy pitas. They are reason enough to trek to Al-Basha. But then again, nearly every mezze item is a standout: the crisp falafel, the flavor-packed muhammara, the creamy labneh, the refreshing tabbouleh. Fans know to leave room for the generous array of grilled meats that arrive on big wooden boards. They also know that this is a strict no-booze spot; reward yourself instead with a tall glass of delicious mint lemonade. Bring along the family and lots of friends. This food is meant to be shared. Odds are, however, you’ll still go home with leftovers and a deep desire to return for more. — Esther Davidowitz, The Record (Bergen, N.J.)\n\nDetails: 3853 County Road 516, Old Bridge, N.J.; 732-727-9444, heirloomkitchen.com\n\nHeirloom Kitchen restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the high-end fare served in an approachable, airy space. You'll never be served the same dish twice.\n\nHeirloom Kitchen in Old Bridge sprouted from a cooking school tucked in a strip mall into a bustling BYOB dining destination with James Beard semifinalist and “Top Chef” contender David Viana in the kitchen. The restaurant serves creative and colorful renditions of classic dishes with a four-course prix fixe menu and a vegan prix fixe menu. Each week, one dish comes off each menu, never to return, and is replaced with something new. But in the best of both worlds, this high-end fare is served in an approachable, airy space with an open kitchen, chef’s table, mismatched chairs, pops of greenery and a book nook packed with beloved cookbooks, making Heirloom Kitchen a true hidden gem that remains in the unassuming strip mall, even on the heels of astronomical success and two additional restaurants. − Jenna Intersimone, Courier News (Somerville, N.J.)\n\nDetails: Address provided upon reservation, Ridgefield, N.J.; sushibysea.com\n\nSushi by Sea restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the intimate, 12-seat spot that serves 17 courses of globally-inspired sushi to two rounds of guests a night.\n\nGood luck finding Sushi by Sea from the street − New Jersey’s most hush-hush omakase restaurant has no signs, no parking lot and no address on its social pages. As far as the outside world is concerned, the place doesn’t exist. But snag a referral or an invite and you’ll be welcomed into a culinary paradise. Led by an anonymous sushi chef who goes only by the name of “Cris,” the intimate, 12-seat spot serves 17 courses of globally inspired sushi to two rounds of guests a night. Imagine international sashimi from Spanish akami to Korean fluke (with a welcome appearance from Japan’s buttery uni), and you’re just scratching the surface of what the secret restaurant can do. − Kara VanDooijeweert, The Record (Bergen, N.J.)\n\nDetails: 405 Main St., Armonk, N.Y.; 914-273-6805, mariachimexico.biz\n\nMariachi Mexico restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends farm-to-table Mexican dishes served in an intimate setting with simple decor.\n\nMariachi Mexico in Armonk is not your average Mexican restaurant. You won’t find hanging papel picados or colorful Frida Kahlo murals. Instead, you’ll discover a simple decor and the motto \"Eat. Drink. Smile. Love. Cheers to Life\" handwritten on a beam near the bar. But it’s not just the interior that sets this intimate, 47-seat restaurant apart. It’s the commitment to local and authentic Mexican ingredients that makes it a standout. Chef-owner Joana Herrera is passionate about using what’s available from local farms and what she finds on her \"día de plaza,\" market days, all of which are listed on the dining room blackboard. Herrera also grows some of her own ingredients on-site. Her commitment to her Mexican birthplace − and its food − is contagious, making for a memorable meal that she often comes out of the kitchen to briefly educate you about. Two things to try: the guacamole with fresh crudités and the shrimp tacos, which features plump shrimp nestled alongside salsa tatemada de molcajete, herbs and lime. − Jeanne Muchnick, The Journal News and lohud.com (Westchester, N.Y.)\n\nDetails: 24 Winthrop St., Rochester, N.Y.; 585-483-7333, reddrochester.com\n\nRedd restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends wood-fired pizzas and pork belly with apple puree prepared by a Michelen-starred chef.\n\nIn what was originally home to a horse-drawn ambulance company, Redd has been serving upscale globally inspired fare in an airy, comfortable environment since 2019. Michelin-star chef and co-owner Richard Reddington had worked in some of the world’s best kitchens before starting his eponymous restaurants Redd, which closed in 2018, and Redd Wood in Napa Valley. His Rochester location, now his home base, is co-owned with Dennis Wilmot. The seasonal menu changes often, and seafood dishes are a highlight. Perennial favorites include wood-fired pizzas; Thai-inspired chicken wings; lobster risotto; and pork belly with apple puree and soy caramel. If you don’t score a reservation, it’s an equally fun experience to sip cocktails and dine at the bar. − Tracy Schuhmacher, Democrat & Chronicle (Rochester, N.Y.)\n\nDetails: 701 Haywood Road, Asheville, N.C.; 828-552-3880, nengjrs.com\n\nNeng Jr's restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this avant-garde Filipino-meets-Southern eatery, a shining star in West Asheville.\n\nNeng Jr’s, an avant-garde Filipino-meets-Southern eatery, is a shining star in West Asheville. Neng Jr’s hidden entrance, in a back alley and up a set of stairs, leads to an unassuming, intimate, 18-seat dining room. Sit at a table or get a front row seat to the kitchen from the counter-style bar. The rotating menu features comforting and delightfully delicious food and exquisite cocktails. Executive chef/co-owner Silver Iocovozzi transports diners to his family’s origins in the Philippines and North Carolina with dishes like adobo oyster, duck adobo, scallop and peach inihaw, pickled shrimp and pork belly lechon. − Tiana Kennell, The Asheville Citizen Times (N.C.)\n\nDetails: 6623 Market St., Wilmington, N.C.; 910-799-3847, catchwilmington.com\n\nCatch restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends dishes inspired by the Carolina coast prepared by a Bravo 'Top Chef.'\n\nProof that great things can be found in otherwise nondescript shopping centers, Wilmington native Keith Rhodes, along with wife Angela, opened Catch in 2006 and created a cozy and classy space with a bar and dining room. From his appearance on Bravo TV’s “Top Chef” to two − and counting − nominations from the James Beard Foundation, Rhodes has become a well-known proponent for local ingredients, especially seafood. Look for dishes inspired by the Carolina coast (like shrimp and grits and Gullah Geechee seafood stew) as well as those with an international flair (like drunken noodles and Korean-style grilled octopus). Plus, Catch serves great casual fare with its food truck and the Tackle Box Kitchen concept. − Allison Ballard, Wilmington, N.C., StarNews\n\nDetails: 404 N. High St., Columbus, Ohio; 614-484-5286, fyrshortnorth.com\n\nFYR restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends dishes cooked over six different types of fire.\n\nDon’t expect dinner at Fyr to arrive at your table with deep, dark grill marks. Although chef Sebastian La Rocca estimates that at his Latin American-inspired restaurant fire touches 90% of the food, it’s not cooked like food at 90% of other open-fire restaurants. Instead, Fyr serves dishes using locally sourced ingredients that are cooked with techniques he learned in his native Argentina. That includes six types of fire: direct or indirect, in embers or on them, in a wood-fired oven or smoked. The result is dishes such as a 45-day dry-aged tomahawk steak, cooked for three hours near indirect flame and finished on the grill. Even Fyr’s popular chilled tomato is first oven-roasted; it’s served with panela honey, goat cheese, charred onions and sumac. − Bob Vitale, The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio)\n\nDetails: 1634 N. Blackwelder Ave., Oklahoma City, Okla.; 405-900-5503, maderlaokitchen.com\n\nMa Der Lao Kitchen restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends Laotian dishes such as crispy rice salad, grilled beef and laab, love letters to chef-owner Jeff Chanchaleune’s heritage.\n\nLao for “come through,” Ma Der is chef-owner Jeff Chanchaleune’s love letter to his family and heritage. Opened in September 2021, Ma Der has been named to top-restaurant lists by The New York Times and Bon Appetit, and Chanchaleune received his second James Beard nomination in 2023, becoming a finalist for Best Chef: Southwest. The menu more than satisfies with family-style service that allows guests to sample various Laotian dishes at a wallet-friendly price point. Freestyle Fridays and regular pop-ups bring new and off-menu ideas and collaborations to the table. The crispy rice salad, grilled beef and laab (available in a vegan option) are must-haves, and keep an eye on the daily specials, which are delicious flavor bombs unique to each weekday. — JaNae Williams, The Oklahoman (Oklahoma City)\n\nDetails: 4533 Baltimore Ave, Philadelphia, Pa.; 215-921-6558, alifamilyrestaurants.com\n\nDoro Bet restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the life-changing fried chicken.\n\nNot everyone can claim to have invented a cuisine. But before Mebruka Kane made her first batch of berbere-spiced, wafer-crisp and unendingly juicy Ethiopian fried chicken in the spring of 2021, it’s fair to say nothing like it existed in the world. “Fried chicken is not traditional in Ethiopia,” she said. But her American-born children loved Chick-fil-A, so she added her own twist. Sure, you could die of tender heartbreak while tasting Kane’s fresh-built shawarma or long-simmered doro wot chicken leg at Doro Bet, the clean-lined West Philly fast-casual Ethiopian chicken house Kane shares with her sister, Hayat Ali. But it’s their fried chicken that made them famous for hundreds of miles: breaded with the nutty pop and crackle of teff and tapioca flours, marinated in buttermilk with earthy-fiery berbere spice mixed by a sister in Ethiopia. Like it mild? The gentle turmeric in the mild “alicha” fried chicken, also found in Doro Bet’s heavenly collards, will soothe you into submission. Even better, for those long denied their fried chicken fix? It’s all gluten-free. − Matthew Korfhage, The News Journal (Wilmington, Del.)\n\nDetails: 6326 Greenhill Road, New Hope, Pa.; thespeckledegg.net\n\nThe Speckled Egg Cafe restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the ever-changing menu of breakfast and lunch.\n\nOpen Tuesdays and Saturdays at Rice’s Market, The Speckled Egg Cafe feels like stepping into a cozy kitchen where customers are welcomed like long-awaited houseguests. The laid-back and charming owners, Tony Artur and Chef Megan Loos, originally opened their cafe in 2021 across the river at the Golden Nugget Antique Flea Market before landing at Rice’s in 2022. The cafe features a regularly changing menu of breakfast and lunch items, showcasing the pair’s creativity at turning locally sourced ingredients into unexpected dishes. Recent specials have included sticky pork belly congee, tomato eggs Benedict atop a zucchini waffle, and a honey-brined chicken thigh on creamy mascarpone polenta. And if it's available, don't miss their sought-after rosewater-glazed sesame doughnuts. − Michele Haddon, The Intelligencer (Pa.)\n\nDetails: 2535 E. Market St., York, Pa.; 717-846-9302, vietthaimarketstreetcafe.com\n\nViet Thai Cafe restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this pioneer of Asian fusion dining in central Pennsylvania.\n\nA pioneer of Asian fusion dining in central Pennsylvania, the Viet Thai Cafe has grown under the care of the same family since 1996. Originally trying to run a neighborhood diner serving American food, Yen Nguyen suggested to her son Hoa that they try cooking what they know. Yorkers tasted Thai food for the first time and kept coming back with the personal touch of the family. Today, in a larger location, daughter Jennifer and Joseph DiMarcello, who started as a dishwasher in 1998 and married into the family, manage the restaurant with Jennifer's brother Francis. They offer a large menu of Vietnamese, Thai and Loa fusion and a sushi bar. − Lena Tzivekis, York Daily Record (Pa.)\n\nDetails: 4349 South County Trail, Charlestown, R.I.; 401-642-7350, slyfoxdenrestaurant.com\n\nSly Fox Den Too restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this spot where Sherry Pocknett became the first Indigenous female chef to win a James Beard Award.\n\nTucked away in a rural corner of Rhode Island, the red façade of Sly Fox Den Too looks more like a home, with a little herb garden and a lot of picnic tables, when visitors first drive up to it. Chef Sherry Pocknett opened the cozy spot in 2021, and just two years later she became the first Indigenous female chef to win a James Beard Award. The menu is a reflection of Pocknett’s cultural roots and creativity, with dishes like Fire Cracker Shrimp & Nausamp topped with a spicy garlic sauce, the Three-Sisters Succotash with an East Coast mix of corn, squash and beans, and the Cape Coddah’ featuring cranberry walnut hotcakes. Restaurants where you can order authentic Indigenous cuisine are rare, and this spot will leave you wishing there were more of them. — Katie Landeck, The Providence Journal (R.I.)\n\nDetails: 272 Westminster St., Providence, R.I.; 401-383-3813, gifthorsepvd.com\n\nGift Horse restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends local catch served in a convivial environment with a U-shaped bar.\n\nThe prominent U-shaped bar makes clear Gift Horse is meant to be a social environment. Guests have views of the raw bar, the busy kitchen and the bartenders making their drinks. Ben Sukle’s restaurant has a clean, modern look that pairs perfectly with chef Sky Haneul Kim’s menu. The focus is on the local catch served in dishes ranging from seafood towers to smoked fish dip with puffed seaweed chips, along with a huge lineup of oysters on the half shell. Caviar and doughboys is an homage to the state's deep-fried savory treat. The smoked scallop rolls spiced with jalapeños will make you forget lobster rolls. Paired with desserts like a cake in a cup and refreshing cocktails, Gift Horse makes a meal to remember. − Gail Ciampa, The Providence Journal (R.I.)\n\nDetails: 318 N. Gay St., Knoxville, Tenn.; potchkedeli.com\n\nPotchke restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends Babkas, lox bagels and matzo ball soup at this Jewish deli with a Ukrainian chef-owner.\n\nTucked behind a towering downtown condo building is an unassuming storefront, branded with just seven cutout letters hanging like an art project in its window: “Potchke.” The word means to fuss or waste time in Yiddish, though dining at this Jewish deli is always time well spent. What’s all the fuss about? At Potchke, chef Laurence Faber, an alum of Tennessee's renowned Blackberry Farm, explores his roots in Ukraine through delicious food with a story in a relaxed environment. Babkas, lox bagels and matzo ball soup are among fan favorites at this pop-up-turned-permanent fixture of Knoxville’s dining scene. — Ryan Wilusz, Knox News, Knoxville, Tenn.\n\nDetails: 2305 12th Ave. S., Nashville, Tenn.; locustnashville.com\n\nLocust restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends exceptional dumplings, clams on buttery toast and oysters with far too much caviar.\n\nEverything about Locust is disarming by design. The chefs, who will also turn out to be your affable, knowledgeable servers, shout boisterous “Hellos!” from the open kitchen as you walk through the door. The 36-seat dining room of blond wood and big windows feels airy and open. The soundtrack ranges from The Pogues to Pantera. You might be encouraged to have a bracing shot of horseradish vodka at lunchtime. You should. James Beard-nominated chef Trevor Moran is behind the tiny restaurant with the huge following, all chasing after a menu so mutable it could change a couple of times in one day. But you can bet on reliably excellent tartare to roll in toasted nori, exceptional dumplings, and some other sumptuous thing such as clams on buttery toast or oysters with far too much caviar. But beyond the stellar ingredients and obvious talent is an X-factor that makes Locust special: It's a really fun place to be. − Mackensy Lunsford, The Tennessean (Nashville)\n\nDetails: 5811 Manor Road, Austin, Texas; 512-270-8021 mumfoodsatx.com\n\nMum Foods Smokehouse and Delicatessen restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the brisket, ribs and sausage that make Mum one of the best barbecue joints in the city.\n\nGeoffrey Ellis’s Mum Foods has been drawing lines for more than a decade, beginning with local farmers markets. But late last year, the chef opened a full-size restaurant serving, yes, his market-famous brisket and pastrami, but also peppery pork ribs, fiery sausage links, corned beef and more. The brisket, ribs and sausage make Mum one of the best barbecue joints in the city, and the corned beef and pastrami sandwiches make it one of the city’s best delis. The pastrami is popular, but the coriander-buzzed corned beef is my favorite. It’s steamed to a tender finish but doesn’t hit the smoker, giving it a purer, beefy, deli meat taste. Stacked high, draped with Swiss cheese and served on a slightly malty and sweet house-made sourdough rye, it makes for the perfect sandwich. − Matthew Odam, Austin American-Statesman (Texas)\n\nDetails: 939 S. Second St., Milwaukee, Wis.; 414-763-5881, oddduckrestaurant.com\n\nOdd Duck restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this vibrant small-plates restaurant with a globe-trotting menu.\n\nFor more than a decade, this vibrant small-plates restaurant has effortlessly blended a crafty, globe-trotting menu with pure Midwestern charm. You see it in the handwritten notes left at your table on a special-occasion dinner. You feel it in the vibrant dining space filled with perky potted plants and dozens of duck figurines tucked into the decor. You taste it in the ever-evolving menu, where dishes like Filipino-style pork belly lechon kwali with peanut kare-kare, Haitian beef short rib joumou and chicken-fried oyster mushrooms with Nashville hot sauce share space in artful cohesion. A 2022 James Beard Award semifinalist for outstanding restaurant, the eatery effortlessly doubles as an after-work hangout or a celebration spot where everyone can feel at home. — Rachel Bernhard, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nOther restaurants that make our food team swoon\n\nThough most of the restaurants on our list are in the communities in or near where we live and work, our writers love to travel, and when they do, they seek out great meals.\n\nThe following are places our writers continue to crave, months after vacation is over.\n\nDetails: 3655 S. Grand Ave. Unit C9, Los Angeles, 213-986-9972, holboxla.com\n\nDoes a restaurant need to be white-tablecloth fancy and over-the-top expensive to earn national accolades? No, and certainly not if that restaurant is Holbox. The counter-service eatery in a Los Angeles food hall serves fresh California seafood inspired by chef-owner Gilberto Cetina’s native Yucatan Peninsula. Cetina, a 2023 James Beard finalist for Best Chef: California, opened the restaurant in 2017 in South Central LA’s Mercado La Paloma. Eight restaurants share a common dining area in the converted garment factory that also houses shops and nonprofits. The Holbox menu features dishes such as Ceviche Mixto with Yucatan octopus, wild Mexican shrimp and Baja striped bass; house-smoked kanpachi tacos with queso Chihuahua, salsa cruda, avocado and peanut chili oil; and Camarones al Mojo de Ajo with roasted local shrimp, garlic butter, cilantro rice, black beans and grilled bread.\n\nDetails: 3127 Fillmore St., San Francisco Calif.; 415-440-0460, ateliercrenn.com.\n\nAt Atelier Crenn, chef and owner Dominique Crenn unites her French heritage with California’s natural bounty to create an unforgettable 14-course pescatarian tasting menu. As the first female chef in the United States to earn three Michelin stars, Crenn is dedicated to providing guests with a unique experience while taking care of the planet. Atellier Crenn is a meat- and dairy-free restaurant with produce supplied by Crenn’s Bleu Belle Farm in Sonoma. Opened in 2011, the restaurant underwent a four-week makeover in early 2023, resulting in a modern dining room with warm wood accents and elements that evoke California’s natural beauty.\n\nDetails: 259 E. Broadway, Manhattan; 646-692-8300, ernestosnyc.com\n\nLet’s begin exactly as you should at Ernesto’s, a darling Basque restaurant that has wowed critics and diners alike since it opened nearly four years ago in a rather remote part of Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Order the restaurant’s signature dry, 5-finger Martini, a delicious concoction made with two kinds of sherry and blanc vermouth, garnished with three plump olives on a thin skewer. Leisurely enjoy your drink and then slowly move on to those delectable bar snacks called pintxos: cheesy, shredded chicken croquetas; skewers of sweet and spicy green peppers, green olives, and umami-rich anchovies called gildas; spicy house-made Basque sausage; and that Insta-famous mound of crisp, house-made chips covered with Iberico ham. You can make a meal out of these small plates − and many do − but then you’d miss out on the roasted meats and grilled fish that in the hands of chef Ryan Bartlow may have you swooning. The menu changes frequently. Many of these dishes may no longer be available when you show up. No matter. When a chef is this talented, your only worry is how many dishes you will be able to eat.\n\nDetails: 2350 E. Union St., Seattle; 206-391-8140, communionseattle.com\n\nThey call it Communion for a reason. Chef-owner Kristi Brown’s grandmother was a deacon and a pastor, and her mother was a church pianist, so the name of this “Seattle Soul” restaurant pays homage to her religious roots. But the restaurant itself brings about communion, a convergence of spirits. It’s about people coming together, feeling intimate and close in this space − all copper and rich blues and browns − and about bringing Seattle itself to the table. Brown, a caterer for many years before opening the restaurant in 2020, has created her own style of cuisine by sourcing ingredients from her city’s neighbors, including immigrants from Southeast Asia and East Africa. She combines that with culinary influences from her childhood and local ingredients − especially seafood − and turns out delightful dishes like coconut clams with Laotian sausage, coconut milk and lemongrass, and a seafood-and-panko stuffed trout with a decadent Bernaise sauce. There’s a sophisticated cocktail program, and you can enjoy drinks and dinner looking out the floor-to-ceiling windows of the ground floor of the former Liberty Bank Building, one of the first Black-owned banks in the Pacific Northwest.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/15"}]}

Dupont Middle School on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nDozens of people representing and supporting candidates for both state and county-wide races showed out in big numbers, welcoming cars into the crowded parking lot and directing people to voting booths.\n\nThe two candidates vying for the position of Wilmington mayor were also present at the middle school, which is historically one of the most centrally-located and highly-visited polling places in both the city and county.\n\nOutgoing Gov. John Carney spoke about the need to campaign on a smaller scale than his team is typically used to − though he visited at least six different polling locations Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“It’s much more intense, much more personal and individual-focused,” Carney said of running for mayor versus governor. “It’s not clear if they’re going to vote for me.\"\n\nHe added that regardless of Tuesday's result, he's \"just going to be happy that I did my best.\"\n\n\"One way or the other, it will be positive,” Carney said.\n\nVelda Jones-Potter, Wilmington's former treasurer, said she'd also been to a number of polling places throughout the day.\n\n“I heard them say they’re excited for some change,” Jones-Potter said. “I think the main thing is for us to really focus on people in this city: Communities, neighborhoods, people and meeting some of the fundamental needs that people have.\"\n\nThe environment at P.S. Dupont, while chaotic, was largely joyous. A large bus decked out in “Vote Meyer” signs was selling Philadelphia Eagles merchandise, food and playing music loud enough for the crowd to sing along to.\n\n- Reporter Molly McVety\n\nA slow day for voting at Lewes sites\n\nA volunteer at Cape Henlopen High School in Lewes said they had seen about 300 voters by 5 p.m., and a handful of electioneers waited outside while people arrived for a volleyball game.\n\nFor about 10 minutes, there were no voters at all. When one finally appeared, an electioneer told her Bethany Hall-Long would appreciate her vote.\n\nThere were only two electioneers at the nearby Lewes Public Library, though voters were showing up more regularly there than at Cape Henlopen High. Still, there were no lines at the library.\n\nJean and Richard Woolley of Lewes, 80 and 89, respectively, said the economy is the issue that most affects their vote. Richard Woolley added immigration and drilling are key issues for him, as well.\n\nVoter Beth Polakoff, 62, said \"choice, rights and democracy\" are what she's concerned with.\n\n- Reporter Shannon Marvel McNaught\n\nVoters trickle in to cast their ballots at Townsend Fire Company\n\nSeveral residents of the Middletown-Odessa-Townsend (MOT) area arrived to cast their ballots at the Townsend Fire Company in Townsend for the primary election – many out of responsibility, others out of desire for change.\n\nBill Ferguson, of Townsend, said he voted because “it’s what you’re supposed to do.”\n\nMiddletown resident Jason Hunt, who owns the small business Elite Feet, said he came to vote because it is “a civic duty.” His focus was on supporting candidates that “talk to the people” this election, including those who support local businesses and want to allocate resources for small businesses.\n\n“I’m all about small business and economic thriving from a small business standpoint,” Hunt said.\n\nAnother Middletown resident, Maria Malone, said she voted Tuesday because “it’s a very important election.” Her key issues included women’s rights, climate change and the current state of democracy.\n\nIt's \"very important stuff,” Malone said, adding that “we’re not going to be able resolve any of the other issues if our democracy is no longer intact, so I believe it's important for people to come out and do something about it.”\n\n- Reporter Olivia Montes\n\nA steady trickle at Hodgson Vo-Tech:\n\nSupporters for various candidates in Tuesday's primary election camp outside of Hodgson Vo-Tech High School in Glasgow as a steady trickle of afternoon voters come to fill out their ballots. Wearing campaign shirts, hats and other candidate swag, most campaign crew members came prepared with foldable chairs, water bottles and a few snacks as they wait out the sunny day at the polls.\n\nA \"thank you for voting\" is the popular greeting of the day as people enter and exit the high school, where three voting booths sit in the corner of the main lobby area.\n\nAlong the school's main entrance, and in the grassy areas surrounding the front parking lot, dozens of campaign signs supporting some candidates and denouncing others are rooted in the ground. The parking lot sees a healthy stream of cars as voters come and go.\n\n-Reporter Krys'tal Griffin\n\nGovernor candidate drops by kid's school to vote\n\nGubernatorial candidate Collin O'Mara stopped by his daughter Alana's elementary school in Bear on Tuesday afternoon -- this time, to place a ballot.\n\nSome volunteers for county and state legislative candidates stopped their own campaigning briefly to pay their respects and take photos of O'Mara, his wife Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, and two young daughters Alana and Leya.\n\nThe youngest, Leya, turned out to be a surprisingly fast runner. Set loose briefly on the parking lot until her parents caught up to her, the toddler unleashed perhaps the most unbridled enthusiasm that the somewhat sleepy polling location had seen all day.\n\nThe family then went inside to vote, presumably for O'Mara.\n\n\"I guess he's my neighbor,\" said one campaign volunteer for New Castle County Executive candidate Marcus Henry, after O'Mara disappeared inside the elementary school.\n\n\"He is unless he wins,\" said the woman next to him.\n\nThe man took a short moment to register this.\n\nGreat weather to vote:\n\nStefano and Barbara Medio wished State Representative Candidate Margie Lopez Waite good luck as they left Hodgson Vo-Tech High School Tuesday morning.\n\n“We vote every time,” Stefano Medio said, adding today’s weather just made the day better to vote.\n\n“I voted,” his wife added. “It’s my duty. I’m a U.S. citizen.”\n\n-Reporter Esteban Parra\n\nNewark senior citizen: the Democratic primary for governor has been spicy\n\nA Newark senior citizen contacted Delaware Online/The News Journal on Tuesday trying to get in touch with New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer about the negative ads he's seen about Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long. He typically \"doesn't bother\" with primary elections, but concern over an elected official paying their spouse in campaign donations didn't sit well with him.\n\nHe expressed frustration with this year's election that has inundated Delawareans with negative ads and bombarded them with text messages.\n\nHere's some links to catch up on that controversy:\n\nAudit finds Hall-Long's campaign finances 'incomplete, inaccurate, misleading'\n\nLt.

Simpson Elementary School in Wyoming saw a small but steady group of voters before early lunch time on Tuesday.\n\nOne of the voters at the polling station was Carrie Goodman who said she's \"concerned about family issues, border issues, and the overstepping of gun control.\"\n\nNancy Quinn of Wyoming is a retired art teacher who said she's \"voting for people who support new ways of finding energy for us.\"\n\nKaitlyn Heverin of Camden said her biggest issue is affordable housing, and she's also concerned about how the teacher shortage can be filled.

She lived within walking distance of the school. Shortly after 11 a.m., poll workers and a couple of people holding up signs for Marcus Henry for County Executive were the only people at the site.\n\n-Reporter Patricia Talorico\n\nGovernor candidate shakes hands at local diner\n\nMatt Meyer, a Democrat vying to be Delaware's next governor, made an appearance at the Long Neck Diner this morning. Here's a rundown of Meyer's campaign, as well as those of his two opponents in today's primary.\n\nThrowback: Gordon v. Meyer (and Grimaldi) plus internet sock puppets in 2016\n\nThe controversy around the current Democratic primary for governor contains a parallel to the great sock puppet battle of the 2016 race for New Castle County Executive.\n\nLeading up to that race, then-incumbent Tom Gordon had just gone through an epic breakup with his second-in-charge and once protégé David Grimaldi. During the fallout, Grimaldi began leaking phone calls he recorded with Gordon, creating some wild sound clips and subsequent newspaper articles.\n\nThen, dueling sock puppet accounts posting on Twitter drove the county political scene bonkers and spawned at least one lawsuit as election season built toward the primary.\n\nOne anonymous account was Ncco_Politics, which leaked Grimald's phone recordings and trashed Gordon with posts like one that featured Gordon as a windup doll that can only answer questions with subjects, verbs and the word \"police.\"\n\nThen there was the Victoria Hobson account, who did double duty trashing Grimaldi and Gordon's opponent.\n\nMatt Meyer, then a political newcomer and Gordon's opponent in the primary, sought to distance himself from the fray, loaning his campaign a raft of cash and purchasing dramatic television ads that tied Gordon's past corruption allegations to the troubles of his then-current administration.\n\nMeyer eventually won that primary and, after eight years as county executive, is now vying to be Delaware's next governor. Some of the controversy around Bethany Hall-Long, one of his current opponents, contains a common character from Grimaldi's clandestine recordings.\n\nIn one, Grimaldi asks Gordon why he didn't fire Dana Hall-Long, Bethany Hall-Long's husband, for reportedly leveraging his position as a government housing contractor to pressure voters living in subsidized housing to support his wife, then a rising state legislator in 2014.\n\nIn the recording, Gordon told Grimaldi that when he learned who Dana Hall-Long was married to, he thought: \"woah, in that case, everyone deserves a second chance.\" A link to that recording is below.\n\nThe Ncco_Politics account − which Grimaldi, despite obvious connections, never publicly admitted to operating − no longer exists. However, the Victoria Hobson account, which Gordon's daughter later copped to, is still around.\n\nHere's a link to the current controversy around Hall-Long's campaign and husband.\n\nAnd here's a link to information about the Democratic candidates vying for governor.\n\nAnd, in case you're interested, here is that phone call:\n\nEmbedded content: https://www.delawareonline.com/videos/news/politics/2016/04/06/82730214/\n\n-Reporter Xerxes Wilson\n\nDemocracy underway below the canal\n\nAt the Sunnyside Elementary polling site in Smyrna, Darrell Birl said he was most interested in the 29th District representative race. Birl said he wanted to vote “to ensure that our representation is what we want it to be on the issues we find important.”\n\nFor Manuel Green, the race for Delaware’s next chief executive topped his priorities.\n\n“I want to help decide our new governor. That’s what I’m focusing on,” Green said.\n\nVoting is important to him “because I recently talked with an older person who told me how they struggled to vote. It wasn’t easy back in their day. Because of their struggle, I have a voice and I’m going to use it by pushing that button.”\n\nTurnout was light. There wasn’t a line. From 7 to 7:30 a.m., 11 people entered the school. In Clayton, at the Clayton Firehouse polling site from 7:45 to 8:15 a.m., 10 people entered.\n\n-Reporter Ben Mace\n\nShout out to Delaware's registered Mandalorian voters\n\nDelaware has 351,000 registered Democrat voters, 205,000 registered Republicans and 99 people that have registered to vote as “Mandalorians,” according to Delaware Department of Elections statistics.\n\nUnfortunately, it will be an uneventful day for those 99 folks as Delaware operates closed primaries. This means you can only vote for candidates in your own party on primary day. Some people think this is lame.\n\nAnd, also unfortunately, the Mandalorian contingent in Delaware has yet to run a candidate, which I think we would all love to see come the next round of elections. This is the way.\n\nYou can have a look at how many people are registered to various political parties and funnies here.\n\n-Reporter Xerxes Wilson\n\nSpeaking of closed primaries:\n\nPrimary day always reminds me of the time then-Wilmington mayoral candidate Mike Purzycki, a Democrat in registration, rallied a bunch of city Republicans to change their registration to Democrat ahead of the 2016 primary.\n\nPurzycki ended up winning that primary by a slim margin in an overloaded field of eight candidates. Today, sitting Gov. John Carney is vying to replace Purzycki in the Democratic primary against Velda Jones-Potter.\n\nIf you want to take a spin down memory lane, here was some coverage of the great Wilmington Republican swap from back in the day.\n\n-Reporter Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhy can I not register to vote on election day?\n\nIn Delaware, you can't register to vote and actually vote on the same day. The deadline to register to vote for today's primary was Aug. 17.\n\nYou might ask: why?\n\nDelaware is among about half the states in the U.S. that don't allow same-day voter registration. They have tried, however.\n\nThe General Assembly in 2022 passed legislation that would allow for such as part of numerous efforts in recent years to make voting easier. Conservative interests have attacked those efforts in court and successfully saw the Delaware Supreme Court strike down the state's same-day voter registration law in 2022.\n\nSo if you see your buddies' cool \"I voted\" stickers today and are feeling left out, your next shot at a cool sticker is the general election in November.\n\nGranted, the general election is in many ways (and for some people) is less fun than the state primaries, but it is still part of the process. The deadline to register for that in Delaware is Oct. 12.\n\nRead more: Delaware's early voting, mail-in ballot rules reinstated with latest Supreme Court ruling\n\n-Reporter Xerxes Wilson\n\nWho is on the ballot?\n\nGet acquainted with your ballot before heading to the polls this morning with our guide to the 2024 primary here.\n\nYou'll find roundups of both the statewide and local races, as well as some deeper profiles on the gubernatorial candidates.\n\nVOTING:Your guide to the 2024 primary election\n\nAdditionally, you can find the League of Women Voters guide here − input your address and it will help you find the races you'll get to vote on.\n\nWhat you need to know before heading to the polls this morning\n\nWe rounded up some important details about voting in Delaware's primary.

This means that no primary election will be held for races in which only one candidate from each party is on the ballot. Instead, these races – such as the race for Delaware's open seat in the U.S. Senate and some statehouse seats – will only appear on the general election ballot.\n\nSome races are contested only for a specific party. In that case, only the party with multiple candidates vying for the nomination will be on the primary ballot.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nSome races may be too close to call on election day\n\nWhile it's always nice to know the projected winner of a party's candidacy on the day of the election, it's possible that some races will be too close to call Tuesday night. This is especially true for close races, which may come down to a small number of votes.\n\nThe race for the Democratic nomination for governor, for example, is expected to come down to the wire. Unofficial results will be published online at elections.delaware.gov.\n\nYou must vote at your assigned polling place\n\nUnlike early voting, Delawareans voting in person on election day must vote at their assigned polling place. The location is listed on your voter registration card, which should have come in the mail after you registered.\n\nIf you are not sure of your polling place, you can search your address on ivote.de.gov. The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nBE INFORMED:Your guide to the 2024 primary election\n\nYou can vote on races only in the party you're registered for\n\nOnly registered Democrats and Republicans can participate in the primary election. You cannot change your party or declare one at the polling place. When you enter the polling booth, you will be able to vote in races for your party only. For example, a registered Republican can vote in primary races between Republican candidates only.\n\nThis is not true for the general election, during which anyone can vote for any candidate regardless of party.\n\nYour name and party will be called when you vote. That's normal\n\nBefore you head to the voting booth on Tuesday, a poll worker will say your name and party affiliation. The poll worker is required to do so by law, and the announcement is typically noted by any challengers at the location. Vote challengers are selected and authorized by candidates on the ballot and their party, and only one for each party is allowed at a polling place.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:These 4 statewide races have contested primaries in Delaware. Meet the candidates\n\nVoters can be challenged if the challenger has a \"valid reason\" to believe the voter isn't duly registered, isn't who they say they are, doesn't live at their registered address or was bribed into voting. The challenge will immediately be decided by a majority vote by the inspector and judges of that polling place.\n\nChallengers also typically note turnout among registered voters in their party to assess campaigning strategies.\n\nSend story tips or ideas to Hannah Edelman at hedelman@delawareonline.com.

While \"Terrifier 2\" was released two years ago, Art's popularity has only grown since then, and with a Christmas-themed \"Terrifier 3\" set to premiere this October, his legend is as alive as ever.\n\nArt is popular in the decoration world as well, like the Spirit Halloween animatronic pictured above.

The series was also renewed for a second season in 2023, meaning the interest is likely to stick.\n\nOf course, Wednesday's black tulle school dance dress is an iconic pick for fans of the show, though her classic attire and that of her family still hold broad appeal, especially the Morticia and Gomez couples get-up.\n\nTarget has a selection of Wednesday and Addams family costumes, including this adult version of Wednesday's Rave'n Dance dress for $52.99, this kids' version for $25, this adult Morticia dress for $53.39 and this Gomez suit for $54.15.\n\nDallas Cowboys cheerleaders\n\nNetflix's docuseries \"America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders\" quickly reached top-watched status on the streaming platform upon its release in June.\n\nThe show offers a glimpse behind the scenes of the iconic team from auditions for the 2023 roster through training camp and football season performances, encouraging viewers to cheer, laugh and cry along with their favorites.\n\nThe virality of the series paired with the simplicity of the cheerleaders' flirty and fun costumes means there will definitely be some superfans sporting blue and white or other unspecified cheer costumes this Halloween.\n\nThere are several options to get a similar look to the DCC cheer squad, including this youth costume (with a covered midriff) from the NFL shop for $44.99, this one for pets on Amazon for $22.99 and this adult version for $51.75 on Amazon.\n\nHope you aren’t afraid of clowns:See Spirit Halloween’s 2024 animatronic line\n\nReal people and pop culture moments\n\nLove it or hate it, pop-culture references and replicas of real people have become increasingly popular costume options.

With a sparkly, rock'n'roll getup this fabulous, people are already searching for their own versions to wear this Halloween.\n\nRaygun\n\nFor better or worse, breakdancer Rachael \"Raygun\" Gunn took pop culture by storm after her performance at the Summer Olympics. Regardless of how you feel about her skills, Google Trends shows that one of the top searched Halloween costume ideas thus far are for Raygun. The ease of putting together the costume may also be a big appeal to some.\n\nTaylor & Travis\n\nAnother year, another set of Taylor Swift looks to emulate. While Swift has plenty of iconic looks to pick from, the pink, blue and purple sequin \"Midnights\" bodysuit is a clear winner when it comes to both fun and recognition. Of course, couples will not want to leave out her beau Travis Kelce, who is an easy enough addition with a simple red-and-gold Kansas City Chiefs jersey sporting number 87.\n\nPresidential candidates\n\nIt happens every year, but especially during an election year; expect to see some political costumes. Latex or giant cardboard masks of politicians' heads and faces are a classic, but we're also likely to see some more referential pieces, including unmarried cat ladies, coconut trees, mugshots and perhaps even a certain vice presidential candidate with a couch prop.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/holiday/2024/10/15/most-popular-halloween-costumes-2024-google-adults-kids-pets/75678074007/", "title": "The most popular 2024 Halloween costumes in Visalia, according to ...", "text": "The Google Trends are in and with them, insight into this year's top-searched Halloween costumes in the Stockton area.\n\nWith October marching steadily forward, major retailers have their themed decor and outfits out in full stock and people are starting to piece together plans for their 2024 holiday getups.

From bubblegum pop to diss tracks, there are plenty of pop culture inspired costumes to try out this year.\n\nSabrina Carpenter\n\nSabrina Carpenter has skyrocketed this year from an artist with a small but loyal fanbase, to opening for Taylor Swift and releasing some of the year’s most ear-worm worthy hits like \"Espresso'' and \"Please Please Please.''\n\nAs her new album Short and Sweet implies, a costume inspired by the 5-foot starlet will almost definitely include a high-platform heel, pastel-colored dresses and maybe a cup of espresso to get you through the festivities.\n\nBeyoncé, Cowboy Carter\n\nThe once-in-a-generation superstar released Cowboy Carter, another critically acclaimed album, in 2024. This time Beyoncé drew from country music inspirations both old and new.\n\nIt might be harder to get a replica horse, but a red-white-and-blue ensemble paired with a Cowboy Carter sash, a cowboy hat and boots will be enough to clue people in. While you’re at it, warm up your vocal cords before leaving the house.\n\nKendrick Lamar\n\nSpeaking of bonafide superstars having a major year, Kendrick Lamar may be the most talked-about artist this year. From a heavily publicized beef with rapper Drake, Lamar released \"Not Like Us,\" quickly becoming a mainstream hit. He also recently signed on to be the Super Bowl performer in 2025.\n\nIn the \"Not Like Us\" music video, Lamar has a few outfits that are easy enough to replicate for Halloween, or look to his viral performance at The Kia Forum this summer donning a white get-up and red hoodie.\n\nChappel Roan\n\nAnother major rising star of 2024 is the eclectic-pop newcomer Chappel Roan. The star went from a more undergound favorite to a mainstream pop star amassing some of the biggest crowds of the year with her live performances.\n\nChappel Roan is known for her wild outfits on stage like painting her entire body green like the Statue of Liberty, dressing like a nun and a Nacho Libre-esque costume. If you’re looking to go all out this Halloween, Chappel Roan may be a good source of inspiration.\n\nAthletes dominating 2024\n\nFrom Team USA’s dominant showing at this year’s Olympics in Paris to the rise of women’s college, and now professional, basketball, here are a few athlete-inspired Halloween costumes. The best part about these – all you need is a jersey and some sneakers to perfect it (for the most part).\n\nWomen's basketball stars\n\nCaitlin Clark and Angel Reese, despite the perceived rivalry between the two players, are major parts of the surge of interest in women’s basketball. Both players have shown fierce determination and competitiveness that have broken records on and off the court.\n\nClark currently plays for the Indiana Fever and Reese plays for the Chicago Sky. A red or blue jersey, respectively, would be an easy way to pay homage to the rising athletes.\n\nTeam USA\n\nIf you have a group of friends whose costumes need to be coordinated, any Team USA costume will be well-received.\n\nIf you have a group of 12, you can argue over who gets to wear a Stephen Curry or Lebron James jersey while representing Team USA’s gold-winning men’s basketball team.\n\nSimone Biles further cemented herself as the GOAT of gymnastics in her dominant showing at the 2024 Olympic Games. A red leotard and a gold medal (or seven) is a simple Halloween costume that is topical to the year. Warning, people may ask you to do a double pike in the air, so you might want to stretch beforehand.\n\nAnother Olympic gymnast that made headlines this year was Stephen Nedoroscik, aka the “Pommel Horse Guy,” whose performance on the pommel horse led the U.S. men’s gymnastics team to win their first Olympic medal in 16 years. To dress like the fan-favorite gymnast, try a red-white-and-blue tank top paired with a pair of red pants and socks – and maybe some glasses to top it off.\n\nOther champions this year\n\nIt's always easy to rep your favorite sports teams around Halloween time. For the Philadelphia sports fans, now would be a great time to invest in Saquon Barkley merchandise, Red October costumes or add a gold medal to a Joel Embiid jersey.\n\nOther recent champions include the star quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his sidekick and professional pop star boyfriend Travis Kelce, golf pro Scottie Scheffler and a certain Boston basketball team that won't be mentioned by name.\n\nCostumes inspired by movies and TV\n\nThis year may not have had Barbenheimer, but there have been plenty of big-ticket movies and TV shows that have caused enough buzz to warrant a Halloween costume.\n\nBeetlejuice\n\n\"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,'' the sequel to the 1998 film, was just released this week starring many of the original cast members and introducing rising star Jenna Ortega into the mix. \"Beetlejuice'' costumes are always in style, but the release of the new film is bringing the classic movie back into the limelight, and there are plenty of iconic outfits to replicate yourself.\n\nWicked\n\nThe classic musical’s film adaptation is set to release in theaters this November, but if you’re looking for a costume for dynamic duos to try, looking to \"Wicked'' might be the best answer. This simple costume requires an Elphaba and a Glinda, so just decide which person in your pair looks better in green versus pink, add a witch hat and a wand, and work on hitting the high note in \"Defying Gravity,'' then you’re all set!\n\nFall Hiking Guide:Best, underrated hiking trails in Delaware to explore this fall\n\nThe Bear\n\nThe award-winning FX series The Bear is another perfect low-effort costume. To channel chefs Carmy and Syd all you’ll need is a blue apron over a white t-shirt, a hair net and the amount of pent-up anxiety of someone being hunted for sport. Don’t forget to shout orders, and demand that everyone say “Yes, Chef” to you.\n\nInside Out 2\n\nIf you have a large friend group or family with a wide range of emotions, dressing like the Inside Out 2 emotions is another low-maintenance costume that also pays homage to the sequel’s 2024 release. All you’ll need for this costume is a distinction of which person resembles each emotion the most, and an outfit that matches that particular color.\n\nMolly McVety covers community and environmental issues around Delaware.

In two months, the global price for cocoa shot up over 75%, from $4,094 per metric ton on Jan. 8 to $7,170 on March 6.\n\nChanging weather has threatened cocoa tree health and production, according to the report. Heavier rainfall last crop season caused an increase in diseases among cocoa trees. Now cocoa tree farmers in West Africa are facing dry temperatures and extreme winds from this year’s El Niño.\n\nCocoa trees are especially sensitive to climate change, only growing in a narrow band of approximately 20 degrees around the equator. The majority of global cocoa production is concentrated in the West African nations of Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Cameroon, and Nigeria.\n\nCapitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates\n\nCocoa prices have been steadily increasing as the supply has been gradually diminishing. This is the third year cocoa harvests are coming up short, the report said. Between October and February, cocoa shipments from the Ivory Coast were 32% lower than the same time the year before.\n\nThe International Cocoa Organization projected the global cocoa supply deficit to increase by 405% from 2022/23 to 2023/24. As climate change only heightens the threat to cocoa production, prices will likely remain high through 2025, the report said.\n\nThe rise in prices “implies manufacturers will have to continue to raise prices” while lowering production, David Branch, sector manager with the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute and author of the report, told USA TODAY.\n\nBranch also expects a decrease in demand from consumers, especially as people are already struggling to purchase daily necessities amid high inflation. “Luxuries like chocolate, which typically are impulse buys at the grocery or convenience store checkout, will suffer,” he said.\n\nCandy companies are also adapting by shrinking the size of their chocolates or diversifying and reducing the cocoa ingredients in their products.\n\nIn a statement on Feb. 8, Michele Buck, president and chief executive officer of Hersey, one of the world’s biggest chocolate companies, said that the company is expecting limited earnings growth this year due to the price increase, but \"our strong marketing plans, innovation and brand investments will drive top-line growth and meet consumers' evolving needs.\"\n\nTake its latest permanent Kit Kat bar flavor, for example.

(Australian authorities had imposed tough new biosecurity measures on all arrivals after a foot and mouth disease outbreak in Indonesian livestock.)\n\nIn a separate incident a few days earlier, an Australian woman was fined $1,844 after she forgot to declare a leftover Subway sandwich she bought in Singapore.\n\nIn the past year alone, US border officials have fined passengers for bringing a wide range of undeclared food items in their luggage, including balut eggs, pork bologna and turkey ham. Border officials conducted “630,150 positive passenger inspections” in 2021, according to statistics for the fiscal year released by US Customs and Border Protection, and issued thousands of penalties and violations to travelers who failed to declare prohibited agriculture items.\n\nCBP officials at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston discovered balut eggs in a passenger's luggage on March 6. Balut eggs contain a duck embryo, and are boiled and eaten from the shell. US Customs and Border Protection\n\nFailure to declare food products at US air, sea and land border entry points can lead to fines and penalties of up to $10,000, according to the CBP.\n\nHere’s what you need to know before bringing food products into the US.\n\nWhy are some foods not allowed?\n\nTravelers bringing food products into the US can inadvertently introduce foreign pests and food-borne diseases into the country, which can have a devastating effect on agriculture and the environment. And a pest or disease outbreak could impact more than just farmers. It also means higher grocery bills and shortage of some food items for consumers.\n\nLast year, border officials discovered 264 pests at US ports of entry, a slightly higher number than the 250 found the prior year. Pests intercepted last year include a Saunders 1850 butterfly larvae found in pineapples from Costa Rica. The larvae feeds on plants and legumes, and is considered an invasive pest mainly found in Amazonian tropical rainforest. Introducing it in the US ecosystem could be detrimental to the agriculture industry, the CBP said.\n\n“We work closely with the US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Health Inspection Services to prevent the introduction of plant pests and foreign animal diseases,” a CBP spokesperson told CNN.\n\nWhat food products are not allowed into the country?\n\nMost meat, poultry, milk and egg products are either banned or restricted in the US – with rules depending on the country of origin and what livestock diseases are prevalent in the region.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture prohibits animal and bird products from countries with reported cases of livestock diseases such as mad cow, foot-and-mouth, avian flu and swine fever. The USDA provides a link where travelers can check common animal diseases in specific countries.\n\nSometimes, there are gray areas. Pork products from Mexico are banned, for example, but a small amount for personal use – like a ham sandwich – may be allowed at land borders if the meat is thoroughly cooked.\n\nWhat food products can you bring?\n\nA long list of food items are allowed into the US, including condiments, cooking oils, bread, cookies, crackers, cakes, cereal, packed tea and other baked and processed products. The CBP provides a list of allowed items on its website.\n\nJarvis, a beagle, works in the baggage claim area at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. He's part of the Beagle Brigade, which works with border officials to sniff out banned food items in luggage. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut there’s a catch: If a traveler brings over 50 pounds of an item, it’s considered a commercial shipment and must undergo additional measures, including extra safety inspections. And every agricultural food item has to be declared on US Customs forms, so inspectors can examine them and ensure they do not carry harmful foreign pests or diseases.\n\n“The declaration must cover all items carried in checked baggage, carry-on luggage or in a vehicle,” the CBP’s website notes.\n\nCan you bring in fruits or vegetables?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nNearly all fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables are prohibited from entering the US due to risks of pests and diseases – some of which can survive in frigid temperatures, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Even the fruits and vegetable snacks provided on an airplane or cruise ship should be left behind, says Lucero Hernandez of the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n\nTravelers crossing a land border into the United States from Canada can bring some fresh fruits and vegetables – as long as they were grown in Canada. But they need proof that the produce is free of soil, pests, and diseases, and that it was grown in Canada, not just sold there, the USDA says.\n\nAnd in all cases, travelers coming to the US should save receipts and original packaging to prove food products’ country of origin, according to the CBP.\n\nWhat happens if you bring forbidden items?\n\nTravelers who declare agricultural products in their luggage don’t face penalties – even if an inspector concludes the items are not eligible to enter the country, the USDA says. In such cases, the food is destroyed.\n\n“An apple or snack that can mistakenly be brought won’t always make a significant incident,” the CBP spokesperson explained of an unintentional failure to declare a food item. “However, attempting to bring in prohibited items would lead to traveler delays and may result in a fine.”\n\n“Failure to declare a prohibited food item may result in the issuance of a civil penalty,” the spokesperson added.", "authors": ["Faith Karimi"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2013/06/16/best-boardwalks-for-food-across-the-usa/2425577/", "title": "Best boardwalks for food across the USA", "text": "Erica Rivera\n\nTheDailyMeal.com\n\nThe Drifters had it right when they sang \"Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, on a blanket with my baby is where I'll be.\" Boardwalks are where it's at.\n\nSpending a day at a boardwalk is the ultimate summer experience — they're home to amusement park rides, play lands, arcades, shopping, and, most importantly, delicious food. Boardwalks are so beloved, they have inspired songs, been featured in films like Beaches, and provided a backdrop for TV shows like Jersey Shore.\n\nThe first boardwalk in the U.S. was built in Atlantic City, N.J., in 1870. Today, at least 60 towns nationwide boast a boardwalk. These layman's landmarks have survived wear, tear, and nasty weather, and continue to be gathering places that appeal to every generation.\n\nVisiting a boardwalk isn't just a great hot weather diversion — it's a way to support the local economy. Several boardwalks recently reopened after being damaged and then rebuilt, due to devastating hurricanes. Patronizing these venues now ensures they'll be around for many generations to enjoy.\n\nWe chose the top 25 boardwalks around the country based on reflection of region, price, and quality of ingredients. Expect plenty of fried delights, cavity-inducing confections, and foods on a stick. Whether you're taking a daylong retreat from the rigors of the working world or a weeklong vacation with the kids, these boardwalks are the places to indulge with abandon. We wouldn't blame you if you planned an entire road trip dedicated to sampling from every eatery on our list!\n\n1. Coney Island Beach & Boardwalk (Brooklyn, N.Y.)\n\nFrom fried clams at Ruby's to cheap tacos at Plaza Mexico Doña Zita, the options to satisfy savory cravings are ubiquitous at Coney Island. Nathan's Famous, long known for their outstanding hot dogs, recently opened a clam bar and serves wine with their wieners, too! For dessert, pick up one of eight flavors of caramel apples or four varieties of marshmallow sticks at Williams Candy.\n\n2. Atlantic City Boardwalk (Atlantic City, N.J.)\n\nThe oldest and longest of all the boardwalks in the U.S. has been dubbed the \"Salt Water Taffy Capital of the World.\" James Candy Company sells their signature taffy in souvenir boxes and by the bucket. Fans of battered food will enjoy nibbling on fried Oreos and fried pickles from Vanina's Ice Cream as they take in the view.\n\n3. Jersey Shore Boardwalk (Ocean City, N.J.)\n\nKohr's Frozen Custard at the Jersey Shore Boardwalk is home to many sweet-tooth-pleasing treats, including flavors like cotton candy and orange cream. It's perfect for cooling down on a hot day!\n\n4. Ocean City Boardwalk (Ocean City, Md.)\n\nIt'll be difficult to pick just one kind of hand-dipped donut from Fractured Prune, where 15 glazes and 11 toppings combine to form specialty flavors like Pebble Beach (glaze, cinnamon, sugar, and mini chocolate chips) and Morning Buzz (mocha plus crushed Oreos). For a salt fix, grab a fistful of Thrasher's hand-cut vinegar fries. For a taste of the sea, try the blue crabs at Mug & Mallet.\n\n5. Ocean Front Walk (Venice Beach, Calif.)\n\nMuscle Beach gym-goers flock to Jody Maroni's Sausage Kingdom for \"haute\" sausages infused with flavors like mango, pomegranate, molé, and tequila. Prefer a sandwich instead? Try the Italian beef at Chicago Nick's. If you're carbo-loading, head over to Schulzies, whose specialty is bread pudding. With 108 flavors, you're bound to find one that suits your palate.\n\n6. Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk (Santa Cruz, Calif.)\n\nIf you like it hot, try Surf City Grill's infamous Cajun corn dogs. If you're looking for something tamer, their clam chowder bread bowl is also a winner. For a portable dessert, grab a strip of chocolate-covered bacon at Marini's Candies.\n\n7. Seaside Heights Boardwalk (Seaside Heights, N.J.)\n\nCheese and grease are the mainstays at this New Jersey boardwalk. Pick up an authentic pizza pie at Three Brothers From Italy or double-fist it with legendary cheesesteaks from Midway Steak House.\n\n8. Carolina Beach Boardwalk (Carolina Beach, N.C.)\n\nThere's no embellishment necessary at Britt's Donut Shop, where the big O's have been served hot, fresh, and in one variety only — glazed — since 1939. Unless you want to get glared at by the locals, don't suggest they expand their menu; just order a dozen and try not to eat them all in one sitting.\n\n9.

That’s considerably down from October and November, when inflation was up, .8 and .9%, respectively.”\n\nOn Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Democratic senators were locked in intense, emergency meetings. But they weren’t working to alleviate the pressures on people like Godinez. They were trying to persuade holdout moderates to change Senate rules to pass voting rights bills. The talks came a day after Biden effectively put his presidency on the line, declaring that the most important challenge before the country is the effort by Republicans to sabotage democracy.\n\nThese are three snapshots from a nation exhausted and driven to political distraction by the worst public health crisis in 100 years, its punishing economic consequences and the political estrangement left in the detritus of the Donald Trump presidency.\n\nOne year into the Biden administration, they hint at a disconnect between Democrats in Washington and the critical swing-state voters who will decide November’s midterm elections and are suffering genuine pain and anxiety. Such feelings explain a measure of nostalgia among some voters for the Trump economy of 2019, before anyone had ever heard of Covid-19. The sour national mood paints a path back to power for congressional Republicans in November – offering an easy opening for a classic message rooted in economic well being.\n\nDid Democrats make a strategic error?\n\nThe deprivation felt in a swing state like Nevada, which is home to a key Senate race this year, and across the nation reflects the unpromising environment for Democrats trying to maintain control of Congress. It also raises questions about the legislative priorities of their narrow Senate and House majorities. The situation is not without irony, since Biden placed improving the lives of American workers at the center of his agenda.\n\nThe President’s sweeping social spending and climate change plan is specifically designed to help working Americans filling their trunks in Costco parking lots all over the country. It would expand child care, home care for the sick and elderly, education and cut the cost of health care. But even if a bill eventually squeezes through the Senate, any political payoff for Democrats will be years down the line and won’t bring immediate relief with lower grocery bills and gas prices. In fact, Wednesday’s cost of living data may cause West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, one of two Democrats along with Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema currently holding up the program, to dig in since he’s warned about the impact on inflation of massive spending.\n\nThe reality Democrats may be missing is that people are hurting right now. There’s nothing more fundamental than struggling to feed a family. Voter testimony in Nevada recalls the evidence in the Virginia gubernatorial race when Republican Glenn Youngkin pulled off a shock win by actually listening to what voters were saying about education and the cost of groceries, while Democrats were running against the extremism of ex-President Trump.\n\nEven some Nevada Democrats still loyal to Biden expressed frustration with what they view as their party’s inability to explain its accomplishments over the last year. Mark Weinberger, a 74-year-old retired dentist from Reno, described Biden’s communication as “piss poor.”\n\n“Biden needed to communicate more of what he accomplished, and what he did, but none of that has been out,” Weinberger said.\n\nThe President’s aggressive political relaunch over the last week, in which he has called out Trump over the Capitol insurrection and compared opponents of voting rights reform to segregationists, has pleased some Washington pundits. But it may not go down quite so well out in the country.\n\nIt’s true that Trump and his acolytes pose the greatest threat to American democracy of modern times, and Democrats feel compelled to act. But lofty speeches over the right to vote, like Biden’s in Atlanta on Tuesday, can seem esoteric compared with the reality of a $400 grocery bill. And if Biden isn’t completely to blame for high inflation, he’s probably going to get the blame anyway. That’s how politics works.\n\nMany economic experts argue that rising inflation can largely be explained by the extreme circumstances of the pandemic. Supply chains are clogged – as factories in Asia close amid waves of infections and transportation seizes up in ports and rail yards. Americans stuck at home for months have money to burn, further injecting demand into the economy and hiking prices.\n\nBut some voters in Nevada are convinced that by pumping trillions of public money into the economy with spending bills, Democrats caused soaring prices – a view being amplified by Republicans.\n\nJessica Morrison, a 41-year-old independent and single mom, thinks Democrats “jumped the gun” with their Covid relief package last year and “gave the aid too fast” – leading her to believe that caused the prices of everyday items to soar.\n\n“I don’t think we needed it then,” she said of the government aid, arguing that she could do with the help now with goods hard to find and prices higher. “We did all this stuff, and everybody scaled back and now no one knows what to do. Pure chaos,” Morrison said.\n\nIt’s not unusual to find a contradiction between the lived experience of working Americans and the dry analysis of economic data. But politically, it doesn’t matter whether it is true that aid packages over cranked the economy. If enough voters believe that is the case, the damage could be incalculable for Biden, and to Democrats who face a long-shot battle to keep control of the House and the Senate.\n\nThe White House misjudged inflation\n\nA sense that Washington is oblivious to the struggles of voters is the most disastrous scenario any party holding the majority can carry into national elections. This is one reason why repeated administration predictions that inflation was merely “transitory” – months ago – have come back to haunt the President. And while the economy is in many ways healthy – the unemployment rate is lower than it has been for years, stocks are rising and consumer spending roared through the holiday period – the grinding struggle of the Covid years, and the peculiarities of the pandemic economy worsened by the Omicron variant, have so far robbed Biden of any credit.\n\nIn the medium term, a country that is learning to live with the virus could see higher growth, lower inflation and some economic breathing room in the next year. But time is running out for a post-pandemic, preelection boom.\n\nWhile some Republicans, like the House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, seem most concerned with proving to Trump they’d be vessels of his political revenge in the majority, others are directing a more focused, effective attack on the Democrats.\n\nRep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Committee who is not running for reelection in November, seized on government data showing that inflation surged year-on-year by 7% in December, the highest rate since June 1982, when Ronald Reagan was president and “E.T” was the big new movie release.\n\n“This crushing report shows Democrats’ spending has pushed Bidenflation to achieve the highest prices in 40 years, killing family budgets and wiping out three years of wage gains,” Brady said in a statement.\n\n“No one is buying Democrats’ excuses: The American people are suffering as they watch this Administration refuse to lift a finger to help them out of this crisis.” An email sent out by the Republican National Committee mailing list was even more scathing, mocking “bare shelves Biden.”\n\nA bad message for November\n\nIn the 1980s, leaders of market economies lived in fear of the disastrous impact of inflation on their careers. But it’s been years since that was the case, which is one reason why rising prices may be so shocking now. While the inflation rate is well below its peak in that decade, the food price index climbed 6.3% last year and grocery prices rose 6.5%. It all adds up fast, especially for families already living from paycheck to paycheck.\n\nAnd Omicron has only made matters worse.\n\nGodinez says the highly infectious new variant aggravated the financial situation that she, her husband and her brother (who lives with them) are facing. Her husband, who works in carpentry, is not paid when he is sick and can’t work – a tough reality they are grappling with when they try to do the right thing by staying home to avoid exposing others if one of them is sick. “One week, one person was sick, and then (the next week) it was the other one, then the other one,” she said. “We don’t work a lot. … And who is going to pay us for this?”\n\nMorrison’s political perspective is being shaped by her own reality. In her job at a convention center, she was expected to do “double the work for the same price” as the staff shrunk. “Being a single mom, I couldn’t just leave my kids” – who range in age from 6 to 18 – “to school themselves,” she said. Now she’s dipping into her savings and has little patience for what she sees as Democrats’ inability to solve what feels like an economic crisis.\n\n“They’re the big dogs on the Hill. It’s their job to figure out how they’re going to help us survive,” she said.\n\nWeinberger, the Reno dentist, worries that Biden’s struggle to corral a divided party will hurt him in November.\n\n“I don’t think he’s consolidated control over the government,” said Weinberger, of a President whose approval rating hit 33% in a new Quinnipiac University poll on Wednesday, with low marks on his management of the economy, the pandemic and foreign policy.\n\n“Everybody’s going off in all different directions in the Democratic Party. There’s no unifying stance on anything,” Weinberger said, remarking that such disarray was hardly a winning midterm election message.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston Stephen Collinson", "Maeve Reston", "Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/good-news/2021/12/17/ri-22-in-2022-people-to-watch-activist-scientist-artist-athlete-musician-nonprofit/8793020002/", "title": "22 Rhode Island people to watch in 2022", "text": "Journal Staff\n\nWhat will 2022 bring?\n\nThere are things we know: the state, the nation and the world will continue to contend with the coronavirus pandemic, which will enter its third year.\n\nAn election will determine control of Congress nationally, and Rhode Islanders will decide who the governor will be for the next four years.\n\nHousing, crime and social justice issues will probably continue to be themes for discussion and debate.\n\nWe asked members of The Providence Journal news staff to share short profiles of people they'll be watching in 2022.

There's a stronger penchant for fuller-flavored, but less hoppy brews such as fruit beers, Berliner Weisses and sours. There's the introduction of the \"cold IPA,\" a crisper version of an IPA that uses pilsner malt and lager yeast. Even in the world of stouts, we're seeing more experimentation with different adjuncts and aging. Oh, and did I mention lagers are making a comeback? (More on that later.)\n\nCraft beer is all over the place entering 2022. And that's a good thing for you, the consumer. It means more variety, more access to great-tasting beer and, perhaps most importantly, a better opportunity for you to find something you truly love.\n\nMore beer: New Holland is Michigan's new largest independent brewery\n\nThis list of top Michigan beers I tasted in 2021 includes one of the best lagers I've ever had, imperial IPAs bursting with hops and flavor, a barrel-aged stout that tastes like a liquid Almond Joy and a dark variation of the state's most popular craft beer. Not all of them are brand-new in 2021, but they were all available during the calendar year and I tried each for the first time.\n\nThis was not an easy list to whittle down. It was originally going to be 10 beers, like last year's list. Instead, it's 12 ... and it could've easily been 15 or 20. Take that as a positive sign. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and all the other challenges this industry is facing and will continue to face, there is absolutely no shortage of outstanding beer to be had in the Great Lakes State.\n\nWithout further ado, here we go: The top 12 beers I tasted in 2021. Cheers! Be sure to leave your favorites in the comments.\n\nFritts Lager\n\n5.5% alcohol by volume, Old Nation Brewing Co.\n\nIf you visit craft breweries as much as I do (kudos, if so), you'll notice lagers are starting to crop up more and more on tap lists. Many of the most well-respected breweries in Michigan are offering at least one these days, and it didn't always used to be like that, partially because lagers in general are more difficult and take a longer time to brew, but also because craft beer fans have long veered away from the style, given its light body and lower flavor profile.\n\nNow, we're seeing a course correction, a true appreciation for the style. Its lighter body appeals to calorie-conscious drinkers. Its refreshing taste makes it enjoyable and crushable all at once. And when done right, it tastes like a beer should taste.\n\nEnter the Fritts Lager, named after Old Nation brewmaster Travis Fritts. It's modeled after the Munich-style Helles Lager, with excellent balance of bread malts and light hops, full of flavor and refreshing, with a crisp, clean finish. It's the quintessential lager and the perfect light beer to snag as a 4-pack for your holiday gathering.\n\n\"It is my thought that beer in its noblest form is subtle and balanced,\" Fritts said. \"For a brewer, finding that balance is the hardest thing to do and making it your own is another level of detail. I've been working 20 years to share a beer like this with as many people as I can, and I'm extraordinarily excited with the response to it so far.\"\n\n2021 No Rules Vietnamese Porter\n\n15% ABV, Perrin Brewing Co.\n\nNo Rules is not an easy beer to find; you either have to snag a bottle at No Rules Day in April, straight from the source in Comstock Park, or find it on tap during a special release or beer festival. But when you do, you'll realize why it's such a rare and high-demand beer among connoisseurs: It's among the greatest imperial porters in America.\n\n\"No Rules is a fun beer to brew because it involves every department of production – making it one of the most unique and tedious beers from Perrin Brewing,\" said Connor Klopcic, director of brewery operations at Perrin. \"No Rules is a specialty beer crafted by melding coconut, cinnamon, maple and turbinado sugar aged in bourbon barrels – together creating a smooth 15% beer that doesn't drink like a typical thick imperial porter.\"\n\nThe 2021 version, the best I've tasted yet, is indeed thick, smooth, full of deep coconut, oak and chocolate notes, and packed with bourbon heat. But here's a fun challenge: If you're lucky enough to snag an extra bottle, let it sit for a year or two and see how the flavors evolve over time.\n\nThe Source Double NEIPA\n\n8.5% ABV, Arvon Brewing Co.\n\nThe beer market is quite saturated with juicy, hazy New England IPAs these days, so it's not easy for a brewery to stand out. Grand Rapids-based Arvon, however, makes standing out look easy with its assortment of IPAs, and The Source — a double IPA brewed with Heull Melon, Hallertau Blanc and Mosaic hops — was the best I tried this year. The Source is bursting with juicy tropical, pineapple, orange and melon notes, it's earthy and slightly dank, while staying nice and bitter through the finish.\n\n\"This German and American hop combination works together magically to provide a well-balanced spectrum of fruit notes such as orange, pineapple and honeydew, as well as a hint of earthy hop character as a reminder it is an IPA,\" said Arvon owner Brett Bristol. \"We wanted to create something special and different. These hops allowed us to explore a different flavor profile than any of our other IPAs and now it has become one of our favorites.\"\n\nFlying Buffalo Screamin' Pumpkin Stout\n\n12% ABV, Griffin Claw Brewing Co.\n\nBirmingham-based Griffin Claw collaborated with the \"Siren of Stout\" — Barb Baker, vice president of Fermenta, a women's craft collective — to create this big, bold imperial stout laced with the pumpkin spices that made its seasonal Screamin' Pumpkin ale so popular. The result is the perfect blend of vanilla oak, pumpkin and bourbon heat, and it's damn smooth for a 12% beer.\n\n\"The idea was straight-forward: our big bourbon barrel aged imperial stout, spiced up with our Screamin’ Pumpkin spices,\" said Jacob Choate, brewer and cellarman at Griffin Claw. \"But the best part was the personal aspect and getting to know another person in the brewing community.\"\n\nAdded Baker: “This beer collaboration was special because Griffin Claw and I wanted to brew a pumpkin stout together since last year and this year ... the time was right! They are open to new people and new ideas and I love that!\"\n\nViticulture No. 2 Wild Ale\n\n6.9% ABV, Barrel + Beam\n\nNext time you're in the Upper Peninsula and anywhere near Marquette, make it a point to stop by Barrel + Beam and try some tasty, funky farmhouse ales, all made with Michigan ingredients. Most of its beers are aged for at least a year in Michigan wine barrels, including Viticulture No. 2, which stands out with its smooth, tarty, acidic taste, like a sparkling wine, with notes of grape and apple cider. It's yeasty, earthy and downright excellent.\n\n\"Viticulture No. 2 features a blend of distinct, barrel-soured, Michigan sourced ales finished on fresh pressed grape juice from Mawby Vineyards,\" said Nick VanCourt, co-owner and head brewer at Barrel + Beam. \"We chose barrels soured with different cultures in order to create a more complex and aromatic blend, and the good folks at Mawby chose a particularly characterful block of grapes to take this ale to the next level.\n\n\"Expect an intersection of sparkling wine and smooth, barrel soured ale.\"\n\nRice Dreams Lager\n\n5.2% ABV, Brew Detroit\n\nWhile the Fritts Lager takes on the traditional Helles style, Rice Dreams is Brew Detroit's rendition of an American adjunct rice lager, \"with a bit more flavor,\" said head brewer Eric Selberg.\n\n\"We dry hopped with two New Zealand varietals of hops: Nelson Sauvignon and Wakatu, resulting in flavors ranging from tropical to green fruit, with a soft herbal quality,\" Selberg added. \"Extended lagering time was implemented for clarity and crispness to make an approachable beer that even non-hop lovers would enjoy.”\n\nWhile Brew Detroit had a heck of year with plenty of top-notch offerings — including Depth II imperial stout, the sequel to last year's Top-10 beer — Rice Dreams is a standout for its genre, with crisp, smooth, light hops, a bit grassy and earthy with a clean finish.\n\nHef's Smoking Jacket Hefeweizen\n\n5.1% ABV, Loaded Dice Brewery\n\nWhen it comes to Loaded Dice Brewery in Troy, it's about taking gambles on classic beer styles. But make no mistake about it: Those gambles are calculated. Somewhat.\n\nTake Hef's Smoking Jacket, for example. It's a classic Hefeweizen, but with a balanced smokiness and cherry sweetness, the perfect complements to the style's soft banana clove notes.\n\n\"We added a small percent of cherrywood smoked malt to give it a lingering smokey finish to complement the clove notes from the yeast,\" said Jef Smith, owner and head brewer at Loaded Dice. \"It's the perfect beer to have with friends around a campfire.\"\n\nRead more: Loaded Dice is all about community. That includes sharing beer recipes.\n\nPoppin' Pastels Sour Wheat Ale\n\n5% ABV, Transient Artisan Ales\n\nWith Poppin' Pastels, like life, you never know what you're going to get.\n\nThat's because every batch of this sour wheat ale from Bridgman-based Transient is a different combination of fruits, buoyed by milk sugars and vanilla sweetness. The result is a sour ale bursting with flavor right out of the glass, every single time.\n\nTake the latest version, for example: prickley pear and pink guava. Earlier this fall, it was cranberry, plum and cherry. Last spring? Guava, pineapple and key lime.\n\n\"Poppin’ Pastels came about as we started digging more into canning 'quick' sours,\" said founder Chris Betts. \"We wanted to take what we were doing with our cocktail- or tiki drink-inspired, long-term, spirit barrel-aged sours (which tend to be very dry) and put them in a package that would be more fitting and sessionable, while retaining some of the sweetness of the drinks that inspired them by adding non-fermentable lactose sugar or maltodextrin, as well as some vanilla to round it out.\n\n\"Sometimes they have a specific basis for inspiration, while others are just a mix of flavors we like that would sound good in a juice or smoothie.\"\n\nAlmond Crunch Barrel-Aged Bourbon Stout\n\n12% ABV, Ferndale Project\n\nEver wanted to know what a liquid, boozy Almond Joy tastes like? Ferndale Project attempted to answer that this past fall with the Almond Crunch Barrel-Aged Bourbon Stout. And it nailed it.\n\nAs you might expect, Almond Crunch is very coconut forward, with notes of deep chocolate, licorice and almond nuttiness on the back end. It's thick, creamy, boozy and well balanced, with good bourbon heat through the finish.\n\nIt's been a big year for Eastern Market Brewing Co., the owner of Ferndale Project; it announced plans to open a new taproom at the former Roak Brewing Co. location in Royal Oak, it collaborated with the Detroit Pistons on a new beer and many of the ancillary businesses it created during the COVID-19 pandemic, including its Peddler beer delivery service, are still going strong. And it doesn't hurt that both its taprooms are still slinging excellent beer.\n\nBelieve In Dinosaurs Imperial NEIPA\n\n9.5% ABV, City Built Brewing Company\n\nMost casual craft beer drinkers know Grand Rapids as the home of Founders Brewing Co., but there is so, so much more going on in Beer City USA (including Arvon, which I highlighted earlier). Take a trip up Monroe Ave. NW north of downtown and you'll find a gem of a microbrewery in City Built, which specializes in a variety of pale ales, IPAs and sours.\n\nThe best of the bunch during my visit earlier this year was Believe In Dinosaurs, an imperial IPA that clocks in at 9.5% ABV. It's \"obnoxiously hopped\" with Nelson Sauvin and Cryo Citra hops and uses Norwegian Kviek yeast, resulting in aromas of white wine, dank, orange juice and raspberry while producing notes of citrus, orange and passion fruit. In other words, it has a ton going on, but it is delicious and refreshing for such a strong beer.\n\nMore beer: What the sale of Bell's Brewery means for Bell's, and all craft beer\n\nBourbon Barrel Mean Vanilla Bean Reserve\n\n15% ABV, Drafting Table Brewing Co.\n\nWhat a name. And what a beer.\n\nAaron Rzeznik, co-owner and head brewer at Wixom-based Drafting Table, took his popular Mean Vanilla Bean imperial stout and aged it in Blanton's oak bourbon barrels, adding double the amount of Madagascar vanilla beans to produce one of the finest stouts this state has seen yet.\n\n\"It's velvety smooth, sweet from the vanilla, chocolatey from the malts, and it clocks in at 15% ABV,\" Rzeznik said. \"We've only released this beer once, and are looking forward to making it again soon.\"\n\nThat's good news for stout enthusiasts across Michigan because this is chocolatey, vanilla, roasty, boozy goodness, and it's well worth the trip to Wixom the next time it becomes available.\n\nBlack Hearted Ale\n\n7% ABV, Bell's Brewery\n\nI probably don't need to overexplain this one; I can just call it the black IPA version of Two Hearted Ale, and you'll know how good Black Hearted Ale is.\n\nEssentially, Bell's Brewery took its flagship American IPA and brewed it with dark, roasty malts to complement the citrus, pine and stone fruit. You won't ever confuse it with Two Hearted Ale, but you probably wouldn't mind drinking it as a change of pace, especially in winter.\n\nBell's has been capitalizing on the success of Two Hearted in recent years with its low-calorie Light Hearted Ale and its polar opposite Double Two Hearted Ale, which tastes close to Two Hearted, but clocks in at 11%. Make sure you give this black IPA version a try, too, because like Two Hearted Ale, it's outstanding and well made.\n\nSpirits of Detroit writer Brian Manzullo covers craft alcohol for the Free Press.

At least 400 people showed up for the unveiling of the statue at the downtown site where Parks got on the bus the day she was arrested, a key moment in the civil rights movement. The unveiling was part of several tributes to the day Parks was arrested for refusing to give her seat to a white man on a city bus on Dec. 1, 1955. Her arrest was one of the events that sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott that challenged segregation on public buses. Along with the Parks memorial, the city presented two historic markers for the plaintiffs of Browder v. Gayle – the landmark case that ruled segregation on Montgomery buses was unconstitutional. Fred Gray, the attorney who defended Parks and many other civil rights heroes, sat in the second row for the unveiling. The civil rights memorials are a partnership between the city of Montgomery, Montgomery County, the Alabama Department of Tourism and the Montgomery Area Business Committee for the Arts. Clydetta Fulmer was the artist commissioned to complete the statue of Parks.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Anchorage Assembly approved funds to study how the city would build a waste-to-energy incineration plant to contend with its landfill limits, officials said. The assembly approved $100,000 from its Solid Waste Services budget Tuesday to fund a plan to be completed in 90 days, The Anchorage Daily News reported Thursday. The $300 million to $400 million plant would require seven to 10 years of work before opening, officials said. The landfill in Eagle River has an estimated 42 operational years left, and an incineration plant would increase that lifespan to 177 years, Anchorage Solid Waste Services Manager Mark Spafford said. Other options include sending trash north to the Matanuska-Susitna Valley or removing it by water using a barge, although neither are economically viable, Spafford said. The study does not commit the city to build the plant, but would give officials a better idea of costs, time needed and benefits, Spafford said. While burning the city’s garbage, the plant would produce 20 to 30 megawatts of power at peak capacity. Anchorage now produces 7.2 megawatts from methane captured at the landfill, officials said. The plant could also burn sludge from Anchorage Water & Wastewater Utility, eliminating the need for a new $100 million incinerator for the utility, Spafford said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Three tornadoes touched down in the metro Phoenix area early Friday morning, according to the National Weather Service. “I can tell you that even getting one (in Phoenix) is pretty rare and getting one from this type of weather system is not too common,” said Andrew Deemer, a meteorologist with the weather service. The first confirmed tornado occurred about 4 a.m. in the Gilbert area of Williams Field Road and the Loop 202, the agency tweeted about 7 p.m. Friday. The second tornado occurred about the same time in the Queen Creek-area while the third occurred in the Paradise Valley-area, it added. Although they were estimated to be weak tornadoes, the agency said each caused damage ranging from downed trees and power poles to damaged roofs. Two tornado warnings were briefly in effect early Friday morning when the rain hit the Valley and snow caused freeway closures and power outages in the high country. The agency tweeted that on May 4, 1976, and Feb. 13, 1992, three tornadoes touched down in Maricopa County each day. Deemer said in 2010, the Flagstaff/Bellemont area had three strong tornadoes around the same time. The Valley last had a tornado in September when one touched down around New River.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home:Sgt. Ken Grayham of the Baxter County Sheriff’s Office rescued an adult barred owl that had been hit by a vehicle on state highway 5 a few miles north of Midway. Grayham responded to the call because there were no Game & Fish Commission officers nearby. Taking a dispatcher’s recommendation, Grayham dropped his raincoat over the bird and after a brief struggle, was able to get the owl into his patrol car. He took the owl to All Creatures Veterinary Hospital in Mountain Home. Dr. Darcy Stephenson, he hospital’s avian expert, said the owl will lose sight in its eye and that the incident caused its brain to swell. That’s the primary concern now for the bird’s health. “We’ll keep an eye on him pretty closely today to monitor the swelling,” Stephenson said. “But he’s already flying around in his cage in the isolation room so that’s a good sign.” Once the bird heals from its injuries, it will be released back into the wild, despite losing sight in its eye. “Owls don’t hunt by sight,” Stephenson said. “They hunt by sound and by smell so the loss of the eye will not impact his ability to feed himself.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nOxnard: Authorities said a garage fire has displaced three people and a large number of reptiles. The Ventura County Star reported Sunday that firefighters found a dozen or two dozen reptiles after battling an electric fire in a detached garage on Saturday. Oxnard Fire Department Battalion Chief Steve McNaughten said the animals included a boa constrictor and a 6-foot-long lizard. He said several animals died in the blaze in the city about 60 miles west of Los Angeles. McNaughten said the Red Cross typically helps with displaced house pets but additional help was sought because of the large number of reptiles.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Housing Catalyst, an agency that helps provide affordable housing, will be able to provide housing for 34 more nonelderly residents with disabilities through a $300,000 grant from U.S. Housing and Urban Development. Housing Catalyst is one of seven public housing agencies in Colorado and 325 across the country to share in a $131.3 million grant. The grant is part of HUD’s Mainstream Housing Choice Voucher Program that provides funding to agencies to help people with disabilities, particularly those who are homeless, previously homeless, at risk of becoming homeless, transitioning out of institutional or other separated settings, or at serious risk of institutionalization, according to a press release from HUD announcing the grant. Housing Catalyst had to get other partner agencies to commit to providing things like home modifications, housing search assistance and tenancy support to win the grant, said Michele Christensen, chief operating officer of Housing Catalyst. The agency is still evaluating the best way to notify those who meet the eligibility criteria and create an application process, Christensen said. HUD has not released the funds yet, so it is unlikely the vouchers would be given out before the new year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: It’s unknown whether efforts next year to make the seasonal flu vaccine more accessible to children will get any traction. Given the anticipated debate about whether to end Connecticut’s religious exemption from certain childhood vaccinations, the CEO of the Connecticut Pharmacists Association said his group doesn’t plan to push for a bill in the next regular legislative session that would allow young people to get a flu shot from a pharmacist. Nathan Tinker said concerns raised by parents skeptical about the safety of vaccines could impede efforts to make the flu vaccine more accessible. Groton Sen. Heather Somers, a Republican, said she still plans to resurrect the bill when lawmakers return in February. She said the legislation will save lives. Currently, pharmacists can only administer flu shots to adults.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle:Firefighters worked Thursday afternoon to control a blaze that tore through a home near New Castle. Multiple fire companies responded to the incident at a one-story house on the 20 block of Jay Drive. Smoke poured out of a broken front windows and crews were seen tearing through the roof and garage walls. At about 4:30 p.m., the fire was under control, a dispatcher said. He could not provide information about the extent of the damage or if anyone was injured. Neighbors who were gathered around the scene said residents of the house did not appear to be home on the holiday. Andrea Flores, who lives around the corner, said she and other neighbors called the fire department when they saw smoke at about 3:30 p.m. There were no cars in the driveway.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:An annual event that features some of the district’s top chefs is back to help support a local foundation's commitment to empowering communities in rural India, WUSA-TV reported. The Vicente Ferrer Foundation USA is holding its annual Recipe for Empowerment Gala on Dec. 7. The foundation is celebrating 50 years of work in India. The event will feature Indian, American and Spanish cuisine from area chefs. Some of them include: K.N Vinod from Indique, Rahul Vinod from RASA, Carlos Gomez from La Taberna del Alabardero and Danny Lledó from Slate Wine Bar and Xiquet, among others, the foundation said. There will also be a silent and live auction. For decades, the organization has focused on supporting women, people with disabilities and marginalized farmers in health care, agriculture, education and rural infrastructure with a grassroots approach, the foundation said.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: Glenn Pitts lived a quiet life after World War II as a laundry manager, building contractor and landlord, but a friend’s tip led to the 94-year-old to receive the Legion of Honor for his part in liberating France. On Nov. 22, the French government named Pitts a knight of the Legion of Honor, its highest distinction, for his part in liberating France from Nazi occupation 75 years ago. “We know what we owe you and your brothers,” Laurent Gallissot, France’s consul general in Miami, told the 94-year-old Army veteran during a ceremony at Jacksonville City Hall. France decided in 2004 – the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landing – to award the medal to any U.S. veteran who had fought on French soil and requested the honor. Drafted when he was 18, Pitts, a native of Eastman, Ga., learned to operate a water-cooled .30-calibre machine gun that could fire hundreds of rounds per minute. He was a private in the Army’s 63rd Infantry Division when he was deployed to Marseilles in December 1944. He was still in Germany when the Nazi government surrendered in May 1945 and was reassigned to a Signal Corps unit where he finished out his service.\n\nGeorgia\n\nLawrenceville: One of Georgia’s largest counties has created a special jail unit just for military veterans. “The Barracks” is aimed at giving veterans behind bars a better chance of success when they’re released, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Gwinnett County’s program joins a broader trend of finding creative ways to help veterans caught up in the justice system. It is among more than 120 U.S. prisons and jails that have separate cell blocks dedicated to military veterans, according to the National Institute for Corrections. Most of them have been added in recent years. Gwinnett County’s program launched in November, and it’s still getting ramped up. There will soon be extra programs and services to help incarcerated veterans, the newspaper reported. The Barracks was the brainchild of Chief Deputy Lou Solis, a retired Army Ranger who joined the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office about two years ago.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: State officials have announced plans to expand the Big Island’s only jail by adding a $12.8 million medium-security building amid concerns about overcrowding. West Hawaii Today reported Friday that the Hawaii Community Correctional Center was designed to hold 226 inmates across two Hilo campuses, but recorded more than 400 inmates last month. Jail warden Peter Cabreros said the jail processes about 5,000 inmates a year. Officials said construction of the new unit is about a year away. Officials said an environmental assessment anticipates room for up to 144 inmates, but funds allow 48 beds in two-bed cells and an optional expansion for another 32 beds. Some neighbors opposed the expansion saying the jail is too close to nearby schools less than 500 feet from the facility.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in downtown Boise has been delayed because the tree fell over. The Idaho Statesman reported that the 45-year-old evergreen toppled sometime Thursday night. The ceremony, which brings a crowd to the Grove in downtown Boise every year, had been set for Friday night. The Downtown Boise Association said it will reschedule the event and that more information will be available next week. It’s not clear why the tree fell. Meanwhile, the annual Idaho Capitol Christmas tree lighting ceremony is scheduled for Monday between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. in front of the Capitol building.\n\nIllinois\n\nSavoy: More than $20 million in construction is planned at Willard Airport in central Illinois during the next two years. The News-Gazette reported that the work includes reconstruction of a runway, and added taxiway and a redone entrance road to the University of Illinois-owned airport in Savoy. Airport officials also expect a new U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility to be completed and opened early next year. Airport Executive Director Tim Bannon said that means private international flights can arrive direct, rather than stopping elsewhere to clear customs. Long-term, airport officials hope to secure federal funding to renovate the terminal that was built in 1988 and add an air control traffic tower. But Bannon said requests for that funding through the Federal Aviation Administration can take time.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: Blast furnace operations are expected to be restored at U.S. Steel’s Gary Works mill several days after flooding at the facility. The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported that the company hopes to bring its steel-making operations back online in the coming days. U.S. Steel spokeswoman Amanda Malkowski said a service water leak was reported Wednesday near blast furnace operations and, as a precaution, the company stopped the furnaces and steel production. United Steelworkers District 7 Director Mike Millsap said the leak was from a massive pipe that brings Lake Michigan water into the mill to cool furnaces and other steel-making equipment. Crews worked over the Thanksgiving holiday to remove the water.\n\nIowa\n\nAmana: State officials are hoping to reduce water pollution by addressing problems in the small waterways that zigzag throughout the state, and they believe something as simple as name awareness can help. The Cedar Rapids Gazette reported that the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Transportation have partnered since 2014 to install more than 900 creek name signs across the state. Stephen Hopkins of the DNR said the focus is on areas with past watershed improvement projects, ongoing work or assessments that might lead to future projects. One project is at Price Creek, a 13-mile stream that passes through Amana before flowing into the Iowa River. Price Creek Watershed project coordinator Rose Danaher has been leading efforts to reduce manure flow into the creek. Price Creek signs were installed on Highway 151. The creek, named after early settler Abraham Price, is on Iowa’s list of impaired waters because of high bacteria levels. The signage is a small part of the effort to make it cleaner. Efforts include fencing out cattle, helping farmers manage manure and replacing failing septic tanks. The $50,000 spent so far on the creek sign program comes from a grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designed to clean up waterways impaired by nonpoint source pollution, which can come from sources including agriculture and industry. Part of the money is to be used for raising awareness, such as through signage.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The toll of massive flooding in Kansas is proving to be high for the agency that operates state parks. KCUR reported that the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism will lose millions of dollars as a result of park closures, property damage and washed out park roads. In much of the state, heavy rains began in early spring and flooding was widespread into the summer. High water levels at reservoirs, where many state parks are located, inundated campgrounds, boat docks and roads. Parks Director Linda Lanterman said the timing was especially bad because May through August are the “Million-Dollar Months,” when revenue is at its highest. This year, state park revenue fell short in those four months. Even now, parts of a few state parks in eastern Kansas remain flooded, preventing the department from fully assessing the damage. Most parks opened by mid-July. Repairing damage will be a daunting task. Floodwaters cracked boat docks, washed away gravel from roads, filled restrooms with silt and removed chunks of land underneath concrete campsites and picnic table pads. Flooding also is killing many trees, preventing the roots from getting needed oxygen.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: Fort Boonesborough State Park is offering a glimpse of Christmas past with an event this week. The “18th Century Christmas at the Fort” is set for Dec. 6 and 7. Admission is $8 for adults, $6 for ages 6 to 12 and free for anyone under 6. Admission includes refreshments, entertainment, crafts and photos with Father Christmas. Guests at the Friday event will be able to see the fort lit with candle lanterns and bonfires. Cabins will be decorated and occupied by living history interpreters. Period music and refreshments will be available in the Blockhouse Tavern with displays of foods from the time period. Children will have a chance to make a toy. Hours are 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Dec. 6 and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Dec. 7.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Anglers can now fish for red snapper seven days a week. State Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Jack Montoucet signed a declaration of emergency this week to expand the season from weekends-only. The Courier reported the bonus season took effect Thanksgiving Day and will continue through noon Dec. 31, or when the state’s remaining catch quota of 27,582 pounds is reached. The red snapper season ran seven days a week from May 24 through mid-August. It switched to weekends-only after the state’s data-collection program determined fishermen had neared the 816,439-pound limit federal officials had set for Louisiana. The daily catch limit for snapper is two per person with a minimum total length of 16 inches. For more information on the extended red snapper season, visit www.wlf.louisiana.gov/red-snapper.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Two studies by Maine-based scientists suggest the U.S. lobster industry is heading for a period of decline, but likely not a crash. Lobster fishermen have brought in record hauls this decade. The new studies were published by University of Maine scientists. They showed a fishery in which warming waters have changed the dynamics of the lobster population. Noah Oppenheim is the author of one of the studies. He said his model projects the lobster catch in the Gulf of Maine “will return to previous historical levels.” That means tens of millions fewer pounds of lobster per year. Oppenheim and colleagues based their opinion on a finding that temperature and the number of young lobsters populating shallow coastal areas allow scientists to predict what lobster catches will look like in four to six years.\n\nMaryland\n\nAllegany County: A State Police helicopter hoisted an injured hiker to safety. Police said the helicopter was used Friday to rescue a hiker with a leg injury from a ravine in Allegany County. Police said the helicopter maneuvered into position about 200 feet above a steep ravine. A rescue technician was lowered down to help the hiker and the pair were lifted back up into the helicopter. The hiker was then transported to a local hospital.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston Pops Brass Ensemble will entertain travelers for free at Logan International Airport this week. The ensemble is scheduled to perform holiday hits at Logan’s Terminal B on Monday. The Pops will have a special giveaway and hot chocolate, coffee, tea, cold drinks and holiday treats including candy canes will be handed out to passengers. The festivities start at 11 a.m. The full Pops has just started its annual Holiday Pops on Tour schedule, which takes it to venues across the Northeast, as well as its home at Symphony Hall in Boston.\n\nMichigan\n\nHannahville: An Upper Peninsula nonprofit organization is supporting a program that educates young people in the Hannahville Indian Community about the dangers of e-cigarettes. The Marquette-based Superior Health Foundation awarded an $11,518 grant to the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan for the Anishinaabe E-cigarette and JUUL Health Education Project. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the use of e-cigarettes is unsafe for children and young adults. Health educator Kelly Hansen of the Hannahville Indian Community said JUUL products also pose risks. JUUL is a battery-powered e-cigarette that generates a nicotine-laced aerosol. Hansen said the tribal project will use a curriculum called “Catch my Breath” to provide teachers, parents and health professionals with information about e-cigarettes and help children make wise choices.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBloomington: Recently released data from Syracuse University showed that pending immigration cases have increased 70% since last year in Minnesota’s Bloomington federal immigration court. The court handles cases from North Dakota and South Dakota in addition to Minnesota. Minnesota Public Radio reported that six immigration judges handle the cases for the three states. Minnesota has 13,703 pending cases, according to the data. It concludes that the backlog of cases is at a record high. More than a million cases are pending nationally. New York, California, and Texas have some of the highest numbers. North Dakota and South Dakota don’t have any pending cases. An immigration attorney attributes the rise in cases to stricter enforcement and not having enough judges to handle the caseload.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: During a university course about the civil rights movement, Mississippi streets became classrooms where civil rights activists and local historians were teachers. University of Southern Mississippi Associate Professor Rebecca Tuuri said Mississippi was ground-zero for the movement. The university’s main campus is in Hattiesburg, where as many as one-third of the black residents participated in civil rights activism during the 1960s. Tuuri said in an interview that the real teachers were the people who lived through that time or preserved their memory and were willing to let students ask them questions. Graduate student Dani Kawa of Richmond, Virginia, said in a school news release that she was amazed by the resilience of civil rights activists, especially in Mississippi.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The longtime leader of the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis has died. Relatives of James Buford said he died Friday at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis after a brief, undisclosed illness. He was 75. Buford was known for his work to try and bridge racial gaps between blacks and whites in St. Louis. He served as president of the St. Louis Urban League for nearly 30 years before retiring in 2013. Mayor Lyda Krewson called Buford a “strong leader of change” in the community. Buford was born in St. Louis in 1944. His father was one of the city’s first black police officers. Details about a memorial service have not yet been released.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The University of Montana has announced a new course entitled “The Art and Science of Happiness,” joining other universities in adding the emotion to the curriculum. The Missoulian reported Wednesday that psychologists John and Rita Sommers-Flanagan are expected this spring to teach about the traits and habits that enable people to flourish. University professors said the course aims to make the research applicable to students’ lives by using contemporary approaches from mindfulness to emotion-monitoring phone applications. Professors said the students will be graded on knowledge-based assessments not on their state of being in the course. Officials said 28 students have registered as of Monday. Officials said a Harvard University course on the topic drew 900 students in 2006 and a similar course at Yale drew 1,200 students in 2018.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Eight months after massive floods washed out chunks of one of the nation’s longest stretches of trail, crews are still trying to repair the scenic pathway used by hikers, bikers and horse riders. The 195-mile-long Cowboy Trail through northern Nebraska was severely damaged during the March floods, and repair costs are estimated to top $7.7 million, according to a recent state budget request submitted to Gov. Pete Ricketts. At least 10 points along the trail were hit, including one 100-foot-long section blown out by the water. Most of the money will come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but state officials might have to cover $1.9 million of the expense. State officials might be able to cover some of the cost with other federal trail grants, but it’s not clear how much money Nebraska might receive. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission has requested $187,000 from lawmakers in a budget request unveiled last month. Ricketts and lawmakers will decide whether to authorize the funding in the next legislative session that begins Jan. 8. State officials created the trail from an old, abandoned railroad line, a practice many local governments and nonprofits have adopted to brighten their communities. The trails are a big draw for bicyclists, runners, dog-walkers and others, and some small towns have used them to attract visitors. The Cowboy Trail stretches from Norfolk in the state’s northeast corner to Valentine, in the middle of remote, north-central Nebraska. State officials eventually hope to extend it to Chadron in northwest Nebraska, making it the nation’s longest rail-trail. Once completed, the full trail will run 321 miles through a scenic region of grass-covered sand dunes known as the Nebraska Sandhills.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Southern Nevada water officials said six trees and a dozen other plants commonly found in Las Vegas-area landscaping could see extreme heat stress in the warming climate. The Las Vegas Sun reported the water authority wants to warn people about some desert flora planted now with the hope of relying on its cooling properties in the decades to come. The Southern Nevada Water Authority has identified nonnative species like the purple leaf plum tree, the ash tree and elm trees, all of which were not well-suited for desert life. The authority’s conservation manager, Doug Bennett, said the plants are not certain to die but will be under increasing stress. Other trees like the palo verde and desert willow have a high heat tolerance and are expected to fare well.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Holiday shoppers paying with $100 bills in downtown Concord should be prepared for some extra scrutiny after a spate of transactions involving counterfeit money. The Concord Monitor reported that at least two store owners have stopped accepting $100 bills, and others will be taking a closer look or only accepting newer versions that have more security features. Authorities said at least three local businesses took in false $100 bills earlier this month and didn’t find out until they tried to deposit them at the bank. Cashiers at The Works Cafe and Gibson’s Bookstore have stopped accepting the bills.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWall Township: Officials said a clown sign that has smiled on motorists at a now-demolished drive-in for two-thirds of a century will be preserved. NJ.com reported that developers of a strip mall at the Wall Township site said they will donate the Circus Drive-In sign for preservation and display elsewhere. The Route 35 drive-in, a vestige of car culture with a white-and-red striped roof resembling an old-fashioned circus tent, closed in 2017. Developer Circus Partners LLC bought the site and demolished the building last year, and last week won planning board approval for the strip mall. But attorney Tim Middleton said the red, yellow, green and white sign featuring a smiling clown’s face will be offered to the township in hopes that it will be placed on public view.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s airport is getting international attention for its display of art. The Sunport’s Lowriders and Hot Rods Car Culture exhibit has landed a spot on the latest list of top airport exhibits in the world by the quarterly publication ArtDesk. The exhibit features an array of photos and a 1964 Chevrolet Impala. The airport also has a permanent collection of more than 100 pieces that include Native American, Hispanic and Southwestern works overseen by Max Baptiste, who has taken on the airport’s newly added role of art curator. Baptiste told Albuquerque television station KRQE he’s not surprised about the recent recognition since New Mexico is what he describes as “an amazing arts community.” He said the goal is to create a sense of pride and that airports are a great spot for doing that.\n\nNew York\n\nSaranac Lake: An Adirondack Mountain village that was put on the map as a cure center for tuberculosis is honoring its novel legacy. Saranac Lake was once a mini-metropolis of medical care, but the boom ended with the rise of antibiotics. Now, a local history group has purchased the old home and medical office of TB treatment pioneer Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau for museum space. And developers bought Trudeau’s old sanitorium with plans to refurbish and reuse it.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMcAdenville: A longtime yarn manufacturer is getting out of the textile business. Pharr announced last week it’s selling three of its five divisions early next year. News outlets reported Pharr Fibers & Yarns and Phenix Flooring will go to Mannington Mills, based in Salem, New Jersey. Pharr High Performance will be purchased by London-based Coats Group. Terms weren’t disclosed. The changes will leave McAdenville-based Pharr with its Belmont Land & Development real-estate arm and Strand Hospitality Services, which manages hotel properties. Privately owned Pharr has manufactured textile-mill yarn since 1939 and employs 1,200 workers. CEO Bill Carstarphen said Mannington Mills and Coats Group will retain Pharr’s workforce and operations in McAdenville and Dalton, Georgia. He said Pharr also will continue its annual “Christmas Town USA” light display in McAdenville.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A bill meant to help law enforcement investigate cold cases of murdered and missing indigenous women that has floundered in Congress for two years might have the missing ingredients to become law – money and muscle. The money comes from an appropriations subcommittee chaired by Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who told the Associated Press that for the first time funding is being directed specifically to murdered and missing indigenous people. The muscle comes from the White House and specifically the Department of Justice, which last week unveiled a plan that would investigate issues raised in the bill like data collection practices and federal databases. It adds up to a strong outlook for Savanna’s Act, which was originally introduced in 2017 by Murkowski, Democratic Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Mastro and former North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. Murkowski and Heitkamp, longtime allies on issues affecting indigenous people, also created the Commission on Native Children, which recently held its first meeting. The bill is named for Savanna Greywind, a Native American North Dakota woman who was killed in 2017 when her baby was cut from her womb. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, chaired by North Dakota Republican John Hoeven, earlier this month advanced another version of the bill to the full Senate for consideration.\n\nOhio\n\nPowell: The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium said a polar bear cub was born early Thursday morning to 13-year-old Aurora. The zoo said polar bear newborns have a low survival rate in their early weeks. Employees are monitoring the cub’s care using cameras in a private den area. Officials said the cub has been nursing, and Aurora is attentive. The bears are expected to remain out of public view until the spring. Aurora has three surviving offspring from previous litters. Those bears now live at zoos in Utah, Maryland and Wisconsin. The newest cub was sired by a 20-year-old bear named Lee. He was moved to Columbus from the Denver Zoo a year ago under a species survival plan recommendation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The nation has a high demand for skilled workers, and industry experts and employers in Oklahoma said a worker shortage has made it difficult to find qualified employees, the Oklahoman reported. Over the next 10 years, it’s expected Oklahoma’s economy will have nearly 7,000 annual openings in construction and extraction occupations, according to an Oklahoma Works study. Construction occupations include electricians, plumbers and some maintenance workers. In general, many of those jobs require some sort of training or education beyond high school, but only about 42% of the current workforce qualifies, the study said. Efforts are underway, though, to increase education and promote the good wages and steady employment opportunities found in these blue-collar careers.\n\nOregon\n\nPort Orford: A small earthquake hit Port Orford on the southern Oregon coast, shaking the small community. The U.S. Geological Survey said the 4.5-magnitude earthquake struck at about 5:45 p.m. Friday, with its epicenter about two miles inland. The Oregonian/OregonLive reported that it differs from earthquakes in October that struck far off the coast. No damage was reported from the most recent earthquake.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Municipalities that are paying to clean up water contaminated with toxic industrial compounds from military installations such as Willow Grove Naval Air Station will get more state help. Legislation signed Wednesday by Gov. Tom Wolf allows municipal authorities to get permission to redirect a portion of state tax revenue generated from the reuse of former military installations contaminated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The money could be used to eliminate surcharges that local ratepayers have been paying. The legislation also directs a state water infrastructure agency, the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority, to create a program to help clean up the chemicals. The state thus far has marshaled more than $20 million in aid to fight contamination in towns near Willow Grove and the former Naval Air Warfare Center.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Student musicians from across the state will again be featured in a series of concerts at the Statehouse to celebrate the holiday season. The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts announced that the concerts begin Monday and will run through Dec. 20. The concerts are free and open to the public. The arts council organizes the series. Executive Director Randall Rosenbaum said more than 2,600 student musicians from 59 schools throughout the state are expected to perform, and the council is pleased to continue the holiday tradition. The series opens with morning performances by high school singers from Cumberland, school bands from North Providence and elementary school guitarists from Providence. The concerts are held on weekdays.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenwood: A second school district in South Carolina wants to change to a year-round calendar. The Greenwood County District 50 School Board approved the calendar change last month to start at the beginning of the 2021-22 school year. The Greenwood Index-Journal reported the calendar greatly shortens the summer break but also includes at least a two-week break every nine weeks. State Education Department spokesman Ryan Brown said McCormick County schools are the only other district in South Carolina operating year-round, but several individual schools have similar calendars. Brown said the agency has heard from several other districts considering the change as they seek community input. Greenwood County District 50 will need approval from the state to make the calendar change.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Police are raising money along with a radio station to buy Christmas gifts for homeless and at-risk children. The Cops ‘N Kids program aims to raise $11,500 to give $100 each to 115 children, and they’re halfway to their goal. Donations currently stand at $5,656. Power 107.1 KSLT is helping. The Rapid City Journal reported the program is run by Black Hills Badges for Hope. The group was formed by two police officers who lost two fellow officers in a 2011 shooting in Rapid City. Last year the Cops ‘N Kids program helped 34 children and the goal this year is to triple the number.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state is projected to have between $345 million and $408 million in new general fund revenue when lawmakers begin setting the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. According to The Times Free Press, the State Funding Board announced last week that the state budget is expected to grow between 2.7% and 3.1% for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, which takes effect July 1. The budget estimate is the lowest the board has set in five years. It’s also below what economic experts had previously suggested. The general fund covers most Tennessee expenditures, including K-12 education funding, state prisons and state trooper pay. This year’s general fund is $34.6 billion and has already seen a $225 million surplus.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Five of the seven people who died in a small plane crash in Kingston, Ontario, were members of a Houston-area family, according to friends of the family. A spokeswoman for the Ontario chief coroner’s office said the victims’ names likely won’t be released for several days. Mehmet Basti, a Toronto college instructor, told local news outlets that five of those killed were his friend Otabek Oblokulov of Missouri City, Texas, his wife and his three children, ages 3, 11 and 15. Basti also said the other two on board were a young couple from Toronto. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said the U.S.-registered, single-engine, six-seat Piper PA-32 airplane crashed about 5 p.m. Wednesday in a wooded area of Kingston, about 90 miles southwest of Ottawa on the Ontario-New York border. The plane had taken off from an airport in Markham, Ontario, a Toronto suburb and was on approach to Kingston’s airport when officials said it took a steep dive into the wooded area. Kingston Police Constable Ash Gutheinz said the area was under a wind advisory at the time, and although winds might not have been as bad as predicted, it was “blustery.” The aircraft did not have a flight data recorder, nor was it required to have one, said lead TSB investigator Ken Webster.\n\nUtah\n\nLehi: A tractor-trailer rig carrying butane was leaking the flammable gas from a tank after overturning on a freeway Saturday, causing evacuations in the area. The Utah Highway Patrol said the double-trailer rig overturned on northbound Interstate 15 in Lehi and that the freeway was closed in both directions as a precaution pending cleanup. Lehi is 26 miles south of Salt Lake City. Assistant City Administrator Cameron Boyle said the area in a quarter-mile around the crash site was evacuated, with residents of an apartment complex relocated to a church building. Information on the cause of the crash wasn’t immediately available. No injuries were reported.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Workers at a hospital have again reported a mysterious odor, a month after more than a dozen got sick on the job. WCAX-TV reported that seven employees at UVM Medical Center’s Fanny Allen hospital in Colchester were evaluated this week for symptoms similar to those experienced by17 workers in mid-October. Officials said they have taken precautions, and that air quality in the building has tested safe. Surgeries planned for next week have been rescheduled.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: A Confederate statue in Charlottesville that became a rallying point for white nationalists has been vandalized again, this time with graffiti that read, “Impeach Trump.” News outlets reported that the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee was also spray-painted Thursday night with “This is Racist.” Tarps were put over the graffiti and city officials expect a clean-up effort to start Monday. The statue was vandalized earlier this year with an expletive directed at President Donald Trump. White nationalists seized on a city plan to remove the statue and flocked there in 2017 for a rally that turned violent and deadly. The city’s effort to remove the statue has been prevented by a judge amid ongoing litigation. The statue has been vandalized several times previously\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Two small areas of northwest Washington likely will be sprayed with an insecticide to stop an outbreak of gypsy moths, including a type native to Asia never before detected in the U.S. The Capital Press reported the Washington State Department of Agriculture said it tentatively plans to release Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki over a small city on Puget Sound called Woodway, and an Everett neighborhood called Boulevard Bluffs. Officials said a Hokkaido gypsy moth trapped in Woodway this summer was the first Hokkaido moth caught in the U.S. Three hybrid Asian gypsy moths were caught in Boulevard Bluffs. Gypsy moths native to Asia are more mobile than European varieties and are considered more of a danger to spread. Before completing plans to spray next spring, the department will conduct environmental reviews and consult agencies including the USDA. Washington has sprayed for gypsy moths for most years since 1979.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBeckley: Raleigh County’s only animal shelter has launched a fundraising effort to save it from closing at the end of the year. The Register-Herald on Thursday reported the leaders of the nonprofit Humane Society of Raleigh County said they need $80,000 to keep from shutting down. The organization said it’s struggling to pay utilities and outstanding taxes after an increase in animal medical emergencies left it with a $150,000 veterinarian bill. The shelter said it has raised $14,000 so far. They’re hoping for large fundraising hauls at their Santa Paws event at the Plaza Mall on Dec. 7 and during the Beckley Art Center’s Giving Tuesday Open House on Dec. 3. The Humane Society of Raleigh County has been open since 1979. It has taken in about 1,300 abandoned, neglected or stray animals this year. County Commissioner Ron Hedrick told the newspaper he wants to help the shelter find funding. Hedrick has invited the humane society’s board members to a meeting next month to talk about shelter finances and possible fundraising solutions, humane society officials said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nHartford: A woman who began sending care packages to her two sons deployed in the Middle East is now doing the same for hundreds of troops overseas in time for Christmas. Hartford resident Leann Boudwine said the soldiers she sends packages to “are like my kids,” even though she has never met them. After first sending packages to her sons, she sent a few more for the soldiers with whom they served. WITI-TV reported that the list grew into the hundreds when Boudwine collected names of soldiers, airmen, sailors and marines all over the world. The care packages include snacks, soap, and boxed mac-and-cheese. The care packages travel thousands of miles to reach their destination, and Boudwine packs, labels and ships each one. Family, friends, businesses and veterans’ groups have begun to help her. She said her nonprofit “Support the Troops” will have shipped 14,000 packages by early next year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A wild horse facility is looking to make its home in eastern Laramie County, but residents near the proposed site have some major concerns. The facility would hold wild horses captured by the Bureau of Land Management, and the BLM would pay South Dakota-based Equine Elite an amount for each horse it houses. But the project hit a snag when it came to gaining approval from neighbors within a 3-mile radius. Because of concerns ranging from water quality to increased traffic, the neighbors didn’t give their approval for the project. In Laramie County, any Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation needs the consent of property owners within 3 miles of the proposed site. At the request of Equine Elite, the Laramie County Commission is considering lowering the distance to 1 mile. Although the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality only requires approval from property owners within one mile, the county commissioners changed its rules to 3 miles years ago when a swine CAFO attempted to situate in Laramie County.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/life/2022/11/21/thankful-to-live-in-arizona/8268176001/", "title": "29 reasons we're thankful to live in Arizona: Route 66, pizza, wine", "text": "Time is nearly up on 2022. Where the year went, we couldn't tell you. What did we learn? Not much. A whole lot. Maybe somewhere in between. It's hard to say. But after a year's worth of ups following downs and chaos punctuated by calm, it's as right a time as any for a little reflection on the good. Of that, we're sure.\n\nHere are three things we know: We're thankful for each other. We're thankful for you. And we're thankful for these 29 things.\n\nGrand Avenue is where it's at\n\nLet other downtown Phoenix stretches cosplay as Mill Avenue Jr. Grand Avenue is holding steady, and then some. Cha Cha's Tea Lounge and Testal are must-trys. Pueblo is verdant as ever and home to an encased Sarah Hurwitz mushroom sculpture. Oh, you want spa vibes? Booking a facial at Skin by Ruby is about as competitive — and worth it — as scoring a brunch reso at Bacanora. Go explore. There's so much more. — Becky Bartkowski\n\nPhoenix record stores keep spinning\n\nFor the promotion of her latest album, “Midnights,” Taylor Swift encouraged her legions of fans to “visit your local record store?” on Oct. 23. I knew exactly where to go that Sunday and headed to my closest Zia Records first thing in the morning to get my hands on a “Midnights” CD. Having a local business to support — and sometimes count on to have signed albums — makes me feel better about the money I spend on my favorite artists. — KiMi Robinson\n\nDowntown Phoenix's cocktail scene is world class and growing\n\nDowntown Phoenix is a seriously good place for a cocktail and I’m not just talking about the OGs like Bitter & Twisted and Little Rituals. A flurry of new bars opened in the last year turning out well balanced cocktails in memorable spaces, like the Palo Verde Old Fashioned at Kim Haasarud's Garden Bar bungalow or the The Silk Road at Khla, where you'll find transporting decor and cocktails. — Felicia Campbell\n\nOur carb kings were crowned\n\nCall 'em the carb kings: Chris Bianco and Don Guerra deal in dough. The respective driving forces behind Phoenix's Pizzeria Bianco and Tucson's Barrio Bread are well known for a reason. They're good at what they do. Like, galaxy-brain good. Small wonder that the James Beard Awards honored Bianco as Outstanding Restaurateur and Guerra as Outstanding Baker. — Becky Bartkowski\n\nArizona's natural beauty is unparalleled\n\nI have a theory that the longer you're in Arizona, the greater the number of sunset photos is in your camera roll. But even those photos can hardly capture the beauty in its full glory, and that goes for all of the state's natural wonders. I still find myself ooh-ing and aah-ing out my car window sometimes when I drive past the beautiful mountain views that I can see from the freeway. — Endia Fontanez\n\nWhen a bookstore feels like a second home\n\nYes, online ordering is convenient, but going to a bookstore is more rewarding. Bookstores are a feeling: the feeling of promise upon entering. Surely those shelves hold a new (or used!) novel to get lost in or a nonfiction that will educate, inspire or even enrage me. Changing Hands in Phoenix and Tempe and Bright Side Bookshop in Flagstaff are my happy places. The booksellers are so welcoming and passionate to help customers find a new gem. I dare you to leave empty handed. Going to a favorite bookstore isn’t merely shopping, it’s community. — Jill Cassidy\n\nThere's always something to do\n\nOne of my favorite things about Phoenix is that I never run out of things to do. As a sports fan, I try not to take for granted that we have so many professional teams. I love cheering on the Cardinals, Suns, Diamondbacks and Coyotes. There's a consistent lineup of concerts for every type of music fan — from must-see shows at Rebel Lounge and underground acts at Valley Bar to unforgettable nights at The Van Buren. — Endia Fontanez\n\nRoute 66 still kicks\n\nThe Mother Road was decommissioned in 1985, but the unique pieces of Americana within its 359 miles in Arizona continue to thrive. Route 66 draws interest from travelers worldwide – including those heading to the Grand Canyon – for the vintage charm of its roadside attractions and historic downtowns. Along with seemingly countless trading posts and diners, Arizona’s Route 66 towns collectively boast limestone caverns, a championship golf course, a meteorite impact site, the observatory where Pluto was discovered and a population of free roaming burros. — Michael Salerno\n\nYou can run this town, thanks to all the paths and trails\n\nWhether you are training for a 5K, a marathon or you’re just trying to get some fresh air, the Valley is teeming with awesome running and walking paths. I ran my first half-marathon in March and was able to explore many routes. Some favorite places included running along the canals, through the Encanto Palmcroft neighborhood, the sprawling Chaparral Park in Scottsdale and around the buttes at Papago park. — Shanti Lerner\n\nThere’s culture and creativity every which way\n\nThere hasn't been a day Phoenix when I haven’t met a person making a mark on this city’s vibrant, colorful culture. Artist Antoinette Cauley came back from Germany with a whole gallery of paintings. Phoenix Art Museum presented a lowrider exhibition for the books. There are fewer blank walls because muralists claim them every day. People truly want to make Phoenix beautiful – and it shows. — Sofia Krusmark\n\nSay hello to the boba boom\n\nMetro Phoenix is home to some fantastic locally owned boba shops, such as Glendale’s Aloha Tea and Coffee and Mochi Fresh in Tempe. But several highly anticipated international bubble tea businesses that serve delicious drinks have arrived in the Valley, too. In the East Valley, there’s Xing Fu Tang, where tapioca pearls are cooked in brown sugar right in front of you, and Meet Fresh, where my go-to is black sugar boba milk tea. It’s a delight having a plethora of options. — KiMi Robinson\n\nThe Nash turns 10\n\nThe Nash celebrated its 10th anniversary in downtown Phoenix as the Valley's premier destination for jazz. But rather than resting on their laurels — like how the venue opened with a Wynton Marsalis concert and was named a great jazz destination by Downbeat magazine — the venue's team spent much of 2022 focused on the future, launching new diversity initiatives and expanding its outreach through the Valley. — Ed Masley\n\nIt's a tennis player's paradise\n\nTennis a sport I never considered until I noticed public courts everywhere. It got me thinking; with little more than a secondhand racket and a good dose of humility, I too could play! At the base of North Mountain, I discovered the joys of whacking a ball at The Gold Key Racket Club. It’s fun, but I never would have made it beyond the first class if it hadn't been for the welcoming attitude. That casual tennis culture means that each week I can have a good time, laugh at myself and get a little better. — Felicia Campbell\n\nAl McCoy is a Phoenix Suns icon\n\nAl McCoy has been calling Phoenix Suns games for 51 years. Let that sink in. The Suns have only been playing for 54. He’s called three trips to the NBA Finals and described the exploits of players from Dick Van Arsdale to Charles Barkley to Devin Booker. And he hasn’t lost a step. Put this one in the ol’ deep freeze. McCoy’s a legend. — Bill Goodykoontz\n\nOur farmers markets are everything\n\nFarmers markets are my feel-good places. It’s not just where I go to buy produce. It’s where I go to connect with people and hear their stories. And I’m endlessly surprised at how some vendors got their start. Marvin Williamson built an entire food business to avoid wasting brisket. Arepa Babe helped Angelica Urrego reconnect to her culture. Stone Grindz Chocolate began with two friends at an apartment and went on to international recognition. — Bahar Anooshahr\n\nArizona sunrises and sunsets in the time of smartphones\n\nIt’s no accident that the Phoenix Suns’ colors are orange and purple. Sunrises and sunsets in Arizona are an explosion of color, often those two. And while they won’t turn you into Ansel Adams, it’s almost impossible not to capture their beauty with a half-decent smartphone. I’ve taken hundreds of such photos. Not one stinks. You have to love anything that makes you an artist. — Bill Goodykoontz\n\nSunnyslope is a gem\n\nI’ve grown fond of Phoenix’s Sunnyslope neighborhood. It’s a place with creativity on tap and businesses that feel like home even though you’ve been once. Tony’s Italian Delicatessen has been around for 55 years – and its old-school charm is magic, not to mention the $4 Italian subs. I fell in love with Cultivate Coffee, too, a place that does more for its community than serve up chai lattes. Just like Sunnyslope, it's special. — Sofia Krusmark\n\nHard-to-find ingredients aren’t so hard to find\n\nI can’t describe the smell or taste of fenugreek except to call it distinctive. It’s the magic behind many Indian and Persian dishes, the fragrant note you just can’t put your finger on. The trouble is that the fresh stuff can be tricky to find. But here in Phoenix, we’re blessed with an incredible array of international markets like Turmeric Indian Cash and Carry. That's where I pick up channa masala, paratha and, you guessed it, fresh fenugreek. There’s almost no ingredient out of reach, which makes me feel #blessed. — Felicia Campbell\n\nWine tasting in southern Arizona is a trip\n\nThe Verde Valley has rightly become a hot spot for people interested in Arizona wine. So many choices in close proximity, and Old Town Cottonwood is walkable. But if you’ve never gone wine tasting in southern Arizona, you’re missing out on an entirely different experience. Wineries like Flying Leap (try Trio, a sassy white blend), Rune and Los Milics have created surprising and delightful outdoor tasting areas where views of mountains and rolling grasslands accompany your tasting. Don’t miss the Pronghorn Pizza wagon sat Dos Cabezas WineWorks. — Jill Cassidy\n\nKWSS-FM is going big\n\nAfter years of slowly fading as you headed east across the Valley, indie radio station KWSS-FM expanded its signal and added a second channel at 99.5 FM. The new channel carries the signal to Mesa, Tempe and Old Town Scottsdale. Listeners in Phoenix will still want to tune to 93.9 FM, home to the radio station known for spinning an eclectic mix of national and local artists since 2005. — Ed Masley\n\nWomen are shaping the beverage scene and beyond\n\nWomen in the beverage scene inspire in ways that go beyond the glass. It’s not just creativity. It’s how they give back. There's Aspen Bingham, the lead bartender at Garden Bar, who's pushing conversations about sustainability. Amanda Gunderson founded a nonprofit that offers emergency funding for hospitality workers and helps advance the careers of women, femme and nonbinary individuals. Her work won her a Tales of the Cocktail award, a.k.a. an Oscar of the beverage industry. — Bahar Anooshahr\n\nZona: The music festival downtown Phoenix needed\n\nTwelve years after founding Psyko Steve Presents, Stephen Chilton is launching his first major music festival at Margaret T. Hance Park in December. And Zona Music Festival is off to a beyond-auspicious start, boasting sets by Beach House, Portugal. the Man, Bleachers, Tegan and Sara, and Japanese Breakfast alongside a truly ambitious commitment to the local scene, from Playboy Manbaby to PAO. No other festival comes close to repping Phoenix on this scale. — Ed Masley\n\nWe can answer the call of the wild on Mogollon Rim Road\n\nHigh above Payson, Mogollon Rim Road winds around pines along the edge of the cliffs. Trails run like veins off the narrow dirt path that invites intrepid drivers with four-wheel-drive vehicles to explore. The rewards for these bumpy rides are primitive campsites where where you’re sure to enjoy unobstructed views of rock formations that stand like steeples amid the dense forest that stretches to the horizon. The price for this million-dollar view is zero. It requires nothing of us but the urge to explore. — Felicia Campbell\n\nDay trips\n\nArizona is a gold mine for refreshing getaways. In a matter of hours, I can be drinking Chai at the Chai Spot in Sedona, walking through the pine trees in 60 degree weather in Flagstaff, or dancing in saguaro cacti in Tucson. And the best part is you can always be back in the comfort of your own home after a full day of exploring. — Sofia Krusmark\n\nNanay's is a little piece of home\n\nOne of the many reasons I'm thankful for Phoenix is that I can get this taste of home — the Philippines — right in the Valley. My favorite Filipino restaurant is Nanay's in Chandler, where you can get a cafeteria-style sampling of different dishes on one plate. My favorite combination is a vegetable dish called pinakbet, chicken adobo, lechon kawali all paired with a generous helping of rice. — Shanti Lerner\n\nAll the sweet tooth fixes\n\nArizona is home to wonderful dessert makers, from Tucson’s Raging Sage Coffee Roaster pastries to Phoenix’s J.L. Patisserie, Geordie’s and Weft + Warp Art Bar + Kitchen. Then there’s Novel Ice Cream. Their Zoe dough melt, a lavender ice cream-stuffed doughnut with cinnamon crunch cereal, keeps me coming back. — Bahar Anooshahr\n\nArizona musicians take the mainstage\n\nIt's always nice to see familiar local faces making waves outside the Valley. Jimmy Eat World and the Maine played one of this year's hottest music festivals, Where We Were Young in Las Vegas. Mega Ran placed a song called \"Tractor Beam\" on the soundtrack to Kevin Smith's \"Clerks III.\" And part-time Valley resident Rob Halford was honored for Musical Excellence by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with Judas Priest. — Ed Masley\n\nThere’s more than one way to experience the outdoors\n\nArizona has a scenic vista for everyone, whether their preference is the saguaro-dotted Sonoran landscapes of Phoenix and Tucson or the vast pine forests of Flagstaff. There’s no shortage of exciting ways to experience the state’s natural beauty: horseback rides through the desert, hot air balloons for unparalleled mountain and desert views, treks through the Sedona red rocks aboard Pink Jeeps and helicopter tours of the Grand Canyon, just to name a few. — Michael Salerno\n\nHalloween is a promise of good things to come\n\nPeople love Halloween for the costumes, the scary movies, the candy, the creepshow vibe. In Arizona we also love it because it is the traditional dividing line between summer and fall — better late than never. Which means the temperature is between surface-of-the-sun hot and just kind of warm. Temperatures drop, moods rise. Now that’s a holiday. — Bill Goodykoontz\n\nReach the editor at rbartkowsk@gannett.com.

A social media legend is claiming horror protagonist Freddy Krueger was once a real man.\n\nKrueger is the villain in the 1984 horror movie “A Nightmare on Elm Street,\" a child murderer's terrifying spirit that haunts teenagers' dreams. After inspiring a five-film series and several spinoffs, the Krueger character has become famous for his fedora, claws and burnt skin.\n\n“DID YOU KNOW.... That the Horror Film Character Freddy Kruger (sic) was based on a real life serial killer who lived in Lightening Creek, Oklahoma in the 1800s,” Michael Phariss posted on Facebook on July 2. \"Later the town was moved and became Alluwe, Oklahoma.\"\n\nThe post then shares eerie details of child murders, factory fires and haunted ghost towns alongside a mysterious photo of a dark figure lurking behind three oblivious toddlers.\n\nThe legend, which was debunked by Snopes in October 2017 and PolitiFact in September 2019, is an evolved rendition of a 2017 Halloween prank.\n\nIt all started with a Halloween joke\n\nIn a much shorter October 2017 Facebook post, Lamaur Foster told his followers about the \"real serial killer\" alongside a photo of a gravestone inscribed \"Frederick Kruger.\" Foster recounted the legend of an 1800s serial killer who allegedly inspired the iconic character before disclosing the post was a holiday joke.\n\n“Actually, I just found this picture and made all that ... up. Happy October everyone!” Foster wrote at the end of the post, which received thousands of shares, likes and comments.\n\nMore:Fact check: No, 2011 'Captain America' film did not predict the coronavirus pandemic\n\nThe legend evolved over time\n\nFoster’s original post shares several themes with the longer version Phariss shared in July. In both posts, the fictional character had a similar death count, weapon choice, crime scene and punishment. They differ in location, photo, detail and disclaimer.\n\nFoster’s account of the legend took place in Cincinnati, where he appears to reside. Other retellings have moved the legend to Brooklyn and Buffalo, N.Y.\n\nThe latest version of the post is accompanied by an old photo of a man in a fedora lurking behind several children as they pose for a photo. Reverse search of the image shows it’s appeared on paranormal-theory sites and creepypastas in various contexts for more than a decade.\n\nThe most glaring difference between the two posts is that Phariss does not disclose that the legend is untrue.\n\nMore:Fact check: Ellen, Oprah, many others are not under house arrest for child sex trafficking\n\nKrueger didn’t create Oklahoma ghost towns\n\nPhariss' version of the legend has unique details about how Krueger has haunted towns and killed children from beyond the grave.\n\n“But shortly after his death a string of unexpected deaths occurred involving young teenagers & children while they were sleeping in their beds, before they died a few parents said their children would wake up in the middle of the night from the night terrors to what they called a burned & scary old man with a claw was trying to kill them and refused to go back to sleep,” claims Phariss’ post.\n\n“Lightening Creek, and Old Alluwe, Oklahoma has since became ghost towns where all residents have long moved away in Fear that it was haunted by His ghost,” it continues.\n\nMore:Fact check: Actor and comedian Tim Allen did not write viral conservative statement\n\nLightening Creek residents changed the town's name to Alluwe in 1883. After the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers bought the land to build Oologah Lake in the 1950s, the town was moved and renamed New Alluwe. The town is estimated to have lost half its population during the 1957 move. It was still inhabited by 90 people in 2010. Old Alluwe refers to the area where Alluwe, formerly known as Lightening Creek, once stood.\n\nLightening Creek/Old Alluwe is not still inhabited because it's been replaced with a lake, not due to a haunting.\n\nCreator says a news article inspired 'Nightmare on Elm Street'\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Vulture, “A Nightmare on Elm Street” director and writer Wes Craven said he came up with the idea for Krueger’s character after reading an L.A. Times article about a family who immigrated to the U.S. from the Killing Fields of Cambodia.\n\n\"Things were fine, and then suddenly the young son was having very disturbing nightmares. He told his parents he was afraid that if he slept, the thing chasing him would get him, so he tried to stay awake for days at a time,” said Craven. “When he finally fell asleep, his parents thought this crisis was over. Then they heard screams in the middle of the night. By the time they got to him, he was dead. He died in the middle of a nightmare. Here was a youngster having a vision of a horror that everyone older was denying. That became the central line of Nightmare on Elm Street.\"\n\nNeither Phariss nor Foster has responded to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nThe social media legend claiming the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" character Freddy Krueger was once a real serial killer stems from a 2017 Halloween prank. The story has evolved over the past several years to offer new details relevant to different areas and lost its original prank disclaimer. \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" creator Wes Craven said a news article inspired Krueger, not a real serial killer.

Derided as \"torture porn\" (a surprise success, the first \"Saw\" arrived in the wake of the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal), the franchise has become increasingly byzantine, placing almost as much emphasis on back story and plot twists as on the back-breaking, bone-crushing literal twists of Jigsaw's torture devices; to that end, this entry is described by Wikipedia as \"both a direct sequel to 'Saw' and a prequel to 'Saw II,'\" with actor Tobin Bell returning as the Rube Goldberg-meets-Marquis de Sade mastermind. Opened Sept. 29.\n\n'The Exorcist: Believer'\n\nDavid Gordon Green, who directed the recent \"Halloween\" trilogy that enabled Jamie Lee Curtis to make literal mincemeat out of Michael Myers, helmed this direct sequel to \"The Exorcist,\" which arrives a half-century after returning star Ellen Burstyn first grappled with the obscene demon Pazuzu.

This adaptation of Suzanne Collins' best-seller may not be a \"horror\" movie, per se; but surely a story set in a world of post-apocalyptic televised death matches is, at least, horrific? 4 p.m. Oct. 15, Collierville and Paradiso.\n\n'The Nightmare Before Christmas'\n\nProduced by Tim Burton and directed by Henry Selick, the 30-year-old stop-motion-animated supernatural adventure that unites America's two most popular (and commercial) holidays returns for a weeklong theatrical run.

Home to the accurately named \"Giant Screen Theater\" (the screen is 50 feet wide), the Museum of Science and History (i.,e., the Pink Palace) hosts a screening of Tim Burton's 1989 hit with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, a film so successful (as was its Prince soundtrack) that it more or less launched the era of superhero cinema that is still with us.

Admission: $5. Visit crosstownarts.org.\n\n'Suspiria'\n\nThe combination of director Dario Argento's over-the-top murder choreography and the equally bravura excess of a pulse-quickening music score by the Italian band Goblin makes for one of the most distinctive and acclaimed movies in horror history, a stylish 1977 shocker about a student (Jessica Harper) who discovers her ballet school is run by witches. 7 p.m. Oct. 19, Crosstown Theater. Admission: $5. Visit crosstownarts.org.\n\n'Edward Scissorhands'\n\nThe plaza on the south side of Madison Avenue at Overton Square is known as \"Chimes Square,\" and most Thursday evenings it hosts free outdoor movie screenings. This month, the movie is a 1990 modern fairy tale from director Tim Burton that casts Johnny Depp as the blade-fingered yet somehow lovable creation of an aged mad scientist (Vincent Price, in a cameo that represents the horror legend's final movie performance). 7 p.m. Oct. 26, Overton Square.\n\n'Fright-tober'\n\nIn an annual festival it dubs 'Fright-tober,' the Crosstown Theater will show two *free* movies every Saturday in October: a kid-friendly matinee and an adult-oriented evening shocker.

With Boris Karloff as a monster who sheds a tear, Elsa Lanchester as his bouffanted bride, and Ernest Thesiger as cinema's most memorable mad scientist. 2:30 p.m. Oct. 28.\n\n'The Thing'\n\nThe ultimate showcase for eye-popping creature effects, director John (\"Halloween\") Carpenter's 1982 remake of a 1951 movie about an arctic-based alien invasion is now esteemed even above its 1951 Howard Hawks-produced inspiration. 6:30 p.m. Oct. 28.\n\nDeviltry at the drive-in\n\nThe October \"Time Warp Drive-In\" event is always Halloween-themed.\n\n'Shocktober!

The recently minted \"Godmother of Horror\" — an honor bestowed upon her at the Wizard World pop-culture convention in Philadelphia last month — is the face of the haunting Insidious franchise, and she takes her third turn as the helpful medium Elise Rainier in Insidious: Chapter 3 (in theaters Friday).\n\nHer scary movies have been numerous — a list that includes a couple of Critters and the upcoming Helen Keller vs. Nightwolves — but filmgoers also have seen her in movies from Pump Up the Volume (1990) to My Sister's Keeper (2009).\n\nShe shares some of her most memorable roles with USA TODAY:\n\nParasol Lady in Goin' South (1978)\n\nShaye lost a part in a Boston production of Candida in 1977 because she made star Eva Marie Saint seem too old. \"I looked like I was 12 at the time,\" Shaye says. But that turned out to be \"the turning point\" in her life: The Detroit native wound up traveling from the New York stage to the big screen as the Parasol Lady in star/director Jack Nicholson's Western comedy Goin' South.\n\nHer interactions with Nicholson stand out in her mind as much as her one line in the film. She recalls having a fever blister during her audition: \"The first thing he said was, 'What happened to your mouth?' \" More of a highlight was his goodbye after the two-week shoot in Mexico. \"He rode up on this big bay horse, tipped his hat at me and said, 'Thank you for coming, ma'am.' He bent over and gave me a kiss, and I thought I was going to faint.\"\n\nTeacher in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\n\nHer role as a high school instructor in director Wes Craven's classic Nightmare was as much her introduction to fright fests as it was villain Freddy Krueger's. The way she won it? Her older brother Bob Shaye founded and ran the movie's studio, New Line Cinema.\n\n\"Bob said to Wes Craven, 'Put my sister in your movie,' \" Shaye says, laughing. \"I'm forever grateful to my big brother, who really started my horror career.\"\n\nMrs. Dumars in Kingpin (1996)\n\nShaye had a small role in Bobby and Peter Farrelly's earlier comedy Dumb and Dumber, but when it came to casting their Kingpin landlady, the siblings couldn't imagine her \"as the angriest, ugliest woman God ever let loose on the planet,\" the actress recalls.\n\nSo she created this wacky persona, begged for an audition and came in with sufficiently stringy hair, bad teeth and dirty fingernails to win the role. Not only was it the first character she ever fell in love with, Shaye says, \"it's some people's favorite thing I've done.\"\n\nMagda in There's Something About Mary (1998)\n\nArguably, Shaye's best-known mainstream role came in the next Farrellys picture, as the oddball neighbor of Cameron Diaz's Mary and owner of Puffy, a dog that gets in a brutally hilarious fight with Ben Stiller and survives after flying out of a window.\n\nTo create Magda's signature sunbaked look, Shaye endured a complicated four-hour process daily involving skin-stretching, latex and tanning makeup. Sounds painful, but \"I loved every minute of it.\"\n\nElise in Insidious (2010)\n\nA psychic mix of Yoda and Mr. Miyagi, Elise is tasked with leading a young girl (Stefanie Scott) out of the clutches of the mysterious Man Who Can't Breathe in the new Insidious, a prequel to the first two movies where Elise was killed but returned as a ghost in the ethereal afterlife locale known as The Further.\n\nShaye remembers getting the first Insidious script and reading the creepy story right before bed. That wasn't such a great idea, she says. \"I was so upset, I took it downstairs and locked it in a closet.

But with all the terrifying features out there, where should you start your spooky movie binge?\n\nAccording to celebrity astrologer Michele Knight, the Zodiac (the calendar, not the killer) can give you a clue. A horror fan herself, Knight is a psychic and astrologer whose celebrity clientele includes Russell Brand, Leona Lewis and Sharon Osbourne. She says your astrological birth chart encompasses \"a map of the soul\" – and your deepest fears.\n\n\"There are certain things that will scare the bejesus out of certain signs,\" Knight says. For instance, \"Cancerians are all about the family. If they're watching a horror film about the family, oh, my God, it's going to freak them out.\"Though she advises against watching horror frequently, Knight says the desire for the occasional scare \"is in our primal DNA.\"\n\nWho knew? Glenn Close is totally down for a 'Fatal Attraction' remake, with one major change\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"Halloween is very important. It allows us to face our fear of death and face our fears of being out of control,\" she says. But a caveat: \"Don't do it all the time. Do it as like a once-a-year thing to cleanse yourself of your fear, to indulge in your fear, to indulge in your shadow.\" Knight outlines what, in her professional opinion, the scariest movies are for each sign. Read on, if you dare.\n\nHalloween costume ideas:What you should be based on your zodiac sign\n\nAries\n\nAccording to Knight, this fire sign loves to be the hero, which makes survival films like 2012's \"The Cabin in the Woods\" a prime choice. If any kind of movie satisfies an Aries, it's one that shows characters determined to survive and that have a clear winner.\n\nThe classic 1979 sci-fi thriller \"Alien,\" for instance, which follows Sigourney Weaver in a fight for her life against a monster from outer space, is another great Aries choice.\n\nAlso try: 2009's \"Drag Me to Hell,\" about a loan officer who becomes cursed after evicting an old woman from her home. \"An Aries often gets in trouble for their big mouth,\" Knight says, \"but they will fight like hell to survive.\"\n\nThe famous 'chestbuster' scene:New 'Alien' documentary shows the funny, phallic origins\n\nTaurus\n\nThese earth signs love a good throwback. Knight recommends horror classics like 1996's \"Scream\" or 1984's \"A Nightmare on Elm Street.\"\n\n\"Taurus are naturally attached to retro horror and films they loved when they were young,\" she advises.\n\nAlso try: When it comes to relationships, meeting the family \"is also a big deal\" for a Taurus, Knight adds. Check out films that give this situation a terrifying twist, like 2017's \"Get Out.\"\n\nThe Mothership podcast: We're celebrating Halloween with Freddy Krueger\n\nGemini\n\nGemini may be the sign of the twins, but duos can seriously freak them out.\n\n\"The astrological twins fear twins!\" says Knight, recommending scary Gemini fare \"where doppelgängers rule,\" like 1980's \"The Shining\" and this year's \"Us.\"\n\nAlso try: This air sign is also known for its multiple personalities, Knight notes, so 2017's \"Split\" is another frightful choice.\n\nCancer\n\n\"Home is where the heart is for Cancer,\" Knight says. So horror films involving families, like \"Hereditary,\" will definitely make waves with this emotionally intuitive water sign.\n\nAlso try: Movies that show kids in danger or put a sadistic spin on a mother relationship will also upset \"sensitive souls\" like the nurturing Cancers. Think 2018's \"A Quiet Place,\" 2019's \"Ma\" and 1960's \"Psycho.\"\n\nLeo\n\nWhich scary movies pair best with the sign of the lion? The 1982 film \"Cat People\" is \"the ideal horror because it involves felines, is sexy as hell and a cool '80s classic,\" says Knight.\n\nKnight also recommends Hitchcock's 1963 film \"The Birds,\" \"where the birds bite back – no lion is happy with that!\"\n\nAlso try: Because the fire sign is known for confidence, Knight also suggests 2015's \"It Follows,\" in which the only way to stop a supernatural force from killing you is by passing it on to someone else through sex. (Yes, you read that correctly. It's basically about a demonic STD.)\n\nFrom 'Addams Family' to 'Zombieland':10 terrifying horror movies you must see this October\n\nVirgo\n\nCan't leave the house without hand sanitizer? You're probably a Virgo.\n\nSince this tidy, detail-oriented earth sign is known for being germophobic, Knight recommends \"any virus movie,\" such as 2011's \"Contagion.\"\n\nAlso try: Brad Pitt's \"World War Z,\" where Virgos \"can relate to a hero saving the world from disease,\" is another terrifying option, Knight says.\n\nLibra\n\nThis air sign is all about keeping the peace, so Knight says movies about chaos will drive Libras insane.\n\n\"Libras love harmony and balance, so are freaked out and adore movies like (1990's) 'Misery,' where to survive they have to try to calm an out-of-control bad guy,\" she says.\n\nAlso try: Additionally, because of their affinity for harmony, a movie like 2014's \"No Good Deed\" where \"nice personalities are not rewards\" will also set Libras on edge.\n\nScorpio\n\nThis water sign is arguably \"the queen of Halloween,\" Knight says. After all, the spooky holiday lands right in Scorpio season! A \"Halloween\" series binge session, anyone?\n\n\"Scorpios are the biggest horror fans in the world, because they live in the underworld,\" Knight says. \"They're happy with the shadow.\" Anything supernatural like 2013's \"The Conjuring\" or 1982's \"Poltergeist\" will keep the intense Scorpios intrigued, she says.\n\nAlso try: Zombie movies are also strongly encouraged.\n\nAppreciation:Vera Farmiga mourns death of Lorraine Warren, 92, who inspired her 'Conjuring' character\n\nSagittarius\n\nPeople born under this fire sign are independent-minded explorers who march to the beat of their own drum. According to Knight, however, Sagittarius' affinity for travel makes them susceptible to particular frights.\n\nSagittarius \"love to hate\" films that give trips a dark twist, like 2005's \"Wolf Creek\" and 2003's \"Wrong Turn,\" she says.\n\nAlso try: 1977's \"The Hills Have Eyes\" and 2006's \"Hostel.\"\n\nCapricorn\n\nKnown for their efficiency and drive, people born under this earth sign take great pride in their work.\n\nFor Capricorns, Knight recommends horror \"connected to work or career\" – where your \"colleague could be a serial killer\" or when \"a work away day goes hideously wrong.\" Think 2000's \"American Psycho\" and 2007's \"Severance.\"\n\nAlso try: 2015's \"The Voices\" starring Ryan Reynolds.\n\nAquarius\n\nPeople born under this intellectual air sign go for the intelligent slasher pic or thriller, according to Knight.\n\n\"Scary psychological thrillers and science-fiction horror grab these air signs,\" says Knight, suggesting 2003's \"Gothika,\" 1992's \"The Lawnmower Man\" and 2002's \"Resident Evil.\"\n\nAlso try: Movies with cunning psychological twists like 1999's \"The Sixth Sense\" and 1987's \"Fatal Attraction.\"\n\nMovie trivia:Donnie Wahlberg starved for Vincent Gray in 'Sixth Sense,' wanted to play him naked\n\nPisces\n\nHonestly, the sensitive Pisces probably shouldn't be watching horror films at all.\n\n\"They don't like horror,\" Knight says of the creative water sign. \"They cannot do it. They should not.\"\n\nHowever, if a Pisces does decide to endure a scary movie, one should opt for \"gentle horror\" where the thrills are more emotional. These movies include 2016's \"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\" and recent best-picture Oscar winner \"The Shape of Water.\"\n\n\"You can talk to any Pisces,\" Knight says. \"They don't want to watch scary horror, because it traumatizes them. They like nice, romantic horror.\"\n\nAlso try:\"Twilight.\" (It may not technically be a horror film, but a supernatural romance with high stakes feels plenty scary for a Pisces.)\n\n'Twilight' turns 10:How Bella and Edward's girl-meets-vampire love story changed Hollywood", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/09/05/creepy-horror-movie-rooms-disappointments/89722886/", "title": "Floor plan of terror: Horror's creepiest rooms", "text": "Brian Truitt\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCertain rooms have had killer views in horror movies over the years — in the goriest, most frightening sense possible.\n\nFrom malevolent spooks providing chilling atmosphere in haunted houses to slashers run amok in suburban residences, the cinema has been home to a variety of creepy spaces in domiciles. The latest: The Disappointments Room (in theaters Friday), which stars Kate Beckinsale as a mom who discovers the attic in her new Southern mansion hides an old tragedy.\n\n'Purge: Election Year' is proof positive of political horror\n\nHorror is scariest when it filters into the familiarity of home life and invades people's personal safe bubble, says Steve Barton, editor in chief of horror news site DreadCentral.com. \"You're just in chill mode. Everything’s OK, it’s all good, nothing’s happening here, and then the next thing you know, gremlins.\"\n\nIt may be a real estate agent's worst dream, but here's a floor plan of terror featuring some of Hollywood's most dreadful spaces:\n\nMASTER BEDROOM: 'Paranormal Activity' (2007)\n\nThe found-footage hit's freakiest moments — weird bumps, odd shadows appearing at the door — happen during the night for the central couple (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat). \"That’s one of those few movies where every time it went to the bedroom, you could feel a collective hush fall over the crowd,\" Barton says. \"That really tapped into a lot of people’s fears. You’re your most helpless when you’re asleep: Anything could be happening around you, and you just don’t know about it.\"\n\nCHILD'S BEDROOM: 'The Exorcist' (1973)\n\nThe innocence of a kid's living quarters being defiled has been a favorite over the years, from the demonic doll watching over a baby in Annabelle (2014) all the way back to that creepy clown doll ruining a youngster's sleep habits in Poltergeist (1982). Arguably the most chilling of all, though, is The Exorcist, where priests try to tie possessed Regan (Linda Blair) down to her bed. \"The way they transform it with the cold and the fog and her floating, it becomes a room of total atrocity,\" says Sam Zimmerman, curator for streaming horror site Shudder.\n\nBATHROOM: 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' (1984)\n\nNancy (Heather Langenkamp) can't even relax in the tub without being pursued by iconic '80s slasher Freddy Krueger and his intimidating clawed glove. Not only is a victim just resting and at a complete state of ease in the bathroom, Barton says, \"but you’re also at your most vulnerable. You’re completely nude.\"\n\nKITCHEN: 'The Blob' (1988)\n\nBarton says it's now commonplace but the first use of death by garbage disposal was in this remake, which featured a dude getting offed after sticking his hand in the sink and finding that a deadly goo is in the plumbing. \"It’s like reaching into the unknown, not knowing what’s there and then the guy gets sucked into the drain. That’s brilliant.\"\n\nCLOSET: 'Carrie' (1976)\n\nAfter embarrassingly getting her first period at school, Carrie (Sissy Spacek) comes home and gets the fear of God put in her by her abusive mother (Piper Laurie), who drags her daughter into the closet so she can pray for forgiveness. \"A closet can be such a duplicitous thing: You can either hide in it as a kid from things like Halloween, or you get sent in there as a punishment,\" says Zimmerman.\n\nDINING ROOM: 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974)\n\nMask-wearing, chainsaw-wielding villain Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) is enough of a problem, but poor Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) finds herself in a real bad way tied up to a chair and \"invited\" to dinner with a whole family of cannibals. The scene turns \"the most harmless, seemingly innocuous of situations into the most deadly scenario in the world,\" Barton says. \"It’s her worst nightmare come true (but) this is just like Wednesday to them.\"\n\nLIVING ROOM: 'The Ring' (2002)\n\nTV sets are an object of supernatural kookiness in films such as 1983's Videodrome (with cancer-causing broadcast signals) and Poltergeist (the boob tube becomes a gateway to the other side). But it's a videotape that's a nasty piece of work in The Ring, which stars Naomi Watts as a journalist investigating why people are dying a week after watching the thing on their VCR. \"Nothing is safe anymore,\" Barton says. \"The most common of household appliances can be horrifying.\"\n\nBASEMENT: 'The Blair Witch Project' (1999)\n\nThe finale is a mélange of eeriness for the characters looking into the existence of the Blair Witch: a decrepit basement, filmed in lo-fi black-and-white, with a man standing oddly in the corner in a way that taps into the horrifying legend of the house. \"That ending made such an impression on me as a kid that it still makes me feel sort of dreadful,\" says Zimmerman.\n\nSECRET ROOM: 'The Amityville Horror' (1979)\n\nFrom black ooze coming out of the walls to the windows having blood-red eyes, pretty much everything about the infamous New York City house at the center of the classic chiller was pure nuttiness. But it all centers on the hidden room in the basement that's actually a passageway to hell, Barton says. \"They opened up this door to this little area that no one knew was there and unleashed all manner of craziness.\"\n\nWORKSHED: 'Evil Dead II' (1987)\n\nThe retro Netflix hit Stranger Things brought back the trope of the horror-movie shed. \"You’re in close quarters but just like any other bigger room, (messed-up stuff) can happen there,\" Barton says. Yet none is quite as infamous or groovy as the outside storage area in Evil Dead II, where hero Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) is attacked with a chainsaw by his girlfriend's headless body. (The shed is also where Ash later readies to take on the undead by pairing a shotgun — his trusty \"boomstick\" — with the aforementioned chainsaw he has attached to his arm where his right hand used to be.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/10/20/milwaukee-movie-guide-playing-oct/92475320/", "title": "Milwaukee movie guide: What's playing where Oct. 21-27", "text": "Chris Foran\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nHere’s a guide to what’s on the big screen in the Milwaukee area.

The Facebook Live video includes both on air comments and conversations between Tiller and the host, Adrienne Berry, during commercial breaks.\n\nTiller appeared on Berry's Feb. 6 radio show \"REALationship Talk,\" and in their near two-hour-long conversation, Tiller talked about student mental health, applying for the superintendent job, re-energizing clubs for students and staff of color, the need to hire more teachers of color and his vision to make the Green Bay School District known for its education.\n\nDuring one of the commercial breaks, Tiller called a district principal a \"wicked witch,\" describing how she was treating an employee of color at the school.\n\nTiller emphasized the need for more teachers of color in the district.\n\nThe reason Tiller was in Atlanta was to recruit teaching students from historically Black colleges and universities. It was the first of four planned trips to recruit teachers of color, he said.\n\nOver 60% of Green Bay students are students of color, and its teaching staff is over 90% white. That's a disparity that needs to be addressed, according to Tiller.\n\n\"Because I have good teachers that strive to learn the culture of different populations, but you're not in that culture,\" he said.\n\nBerry asked Tiller how important it is to him that his students see teachers that look like them.\n\n\"It's very, very important to me because when kids look up when they're having challenges, I want them to see somebody in front of them that looks like them,\" he said.\n\nResearch shows test scores, attendance and suspension rates are all affected by how well the demographics of teachers match those of students. The Press-Gazette has previously reported on barriers to pursuing higher education and a lack of peers who are of the same background that can create additional hurdles for students of color to earn a teaching degree.\n\nTeachers of color and from other minority backgrounds also leave the profession sooner than their white counterparts, due in part to what they perceive as a lack of support and a sense of belonging in their school communities.\n\nDuring a commercial break, Tiller talked about how teachers of color leave the district because there is no sense of community for them.\n\n\"Shame on us for not embracing them and formulating a community,\" he said.\n\nSchools with majority white teaching staffs further exacerbate the problem since students of color lack role models to show them that they, too, could be teachers. A key part of closing achievement gaps and improving educational outcomes for students of color could be increasing the diversity of the teacher workforce, according to the U.S. Institute of Education Sciences.\n\nThat's why Tiller visits multiple schools each morning before he goes to the office, he said in the interview.\n\n\"Not only does all kids see me as the first African American superintendent, but my Black and brown kids see me as well,\" he said. \"So now they can say, 'I can aspire to one in a school district.'\"\n\nDuring a commercial break, Tiller calls district principal a 'wicked witch' for treatment a staff member.\n\nDuring a commercial break, while talking about teachers of color not feeling a sense of community, Tiller referred to an employee who he said was being targeted by a district principal.\n\nTiller said he has to move the employee just to protect him.\n\n\"This wicked witch she signed, she's leaving at the end of this year,\" he said. \"She's doing everything in her possible to get him.\"\n\nThen Berry said that people don't want to have those kinds of conversations, to which Tiller agreed.\n\n\"The first thing they say, 'Who me?' Well, B-I-T-C-H of course it's you,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the video, Tiller said that he was unaware that his \"off-the-record, personal conversation was being captured.\"\n\nHowever, at the beginning of the video Berry explained to Tiller that she was filming on Facebook Live. It's not clear whether he knew that the Facebook Live video was capturing his statements between commercial breaks.\n\nAs Green Bay's first Black superintendent, Tiller was giving a 'voice to the voiceless,' he said.\n\nIt took Green Bay almost 150 years to hire a person of color as superintendent.\n\n\"What people don't understand is that not only do I have to walk a certain way and talk a certain way, I can't hang out in certain circles because if I do not make it — heavy is the head that wears the crown — and if I don't make it, then that closes doors for everybody,\" Tiller said.\n\n\"For another 147 years,\" Berry said. To which Tiller responded, \"absolutely.\"\n\nTiller said the mindset in Green Bay for Black and brown people is like stepping back in time. When he joined the district, Tiller had people coming up to him crying, telling him not to leave.\n\n\"I'm here to bring voice to the voiceless,\" he said.\n\n\"I try not to tear up when I think about this, because what has transpired prior that you have been so oppressed and so pressed down, that you cannot speak and you don't feel that you have a voice?\" he continued.\n\nTiller wanted to create teaching moments for staff on race.\n\nEarlier in the show, Tiller talked about debunking microaggressions among staff when he got to Green Bay. Microaggressions are the everyday slights, insults, putdowns, invalidations and offensive behaviors that people experience in daily interactions, according to the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.\n\nLater, Berry asked Tiller how he has conversations about race.\n\n\"When you say the microaggression, I point that out and that is a learning process,\" he said. \"So I paint it as a learning process for everybody that's involved. I'm not attacking anybody. I want you to learn better. I want you to look at life through a different lens that I'm coming from that you may not have seen.\"\n\nIn conversations with senior leadership in the district, Tiller talked with them about how to make changes, he said.\n\n\"I tell my whole cabinet there, 'You have been in the sauce for so long, that you just don't see. You have jaded lenses now. And I'm coming in from the outside in, and I'm telling you how this looks from the outside. And how do we go about changing this process?'\"\n\nBarely two months into his time as superintendent, Tiller got a report from an education consulting group reviewing the district's administration that found senior leaders had created a \"dynamic of distrust and antagonism.\"\n\nTiller talked about the district needing to understand the difference between equity and equality.\n\nTiller said that Green Bay gets equality confused with equity. Equality is when everything is equal and the same.\n\nEquity, on the other hand, recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome, according to George Washington University.\n\nAs Tiller explained it on the radio show, equality is when you give every child the same shoes, all the same size.\n\n\"They get up the next morning, they got to try to walk to school,\" he said. \"A pair of shoes is too tight, a pair of shoes fits just right and a pair of shoes is too big. So those kids with the big shoes and too tight shoes, they can't come to school because it wasn't done equitably.\"\n\nBut if each child is fit with shoes that are their size, all get what they need in order to be progressive and move forward, he said.\n\nThe Green Bay School District uses equity in one of its slogans: \"Engagement. Equity. Excellence.\"\n\nTiller had recently reactivated a staff group called Voices of Equity where district staff of color can meet and talk freely about anything and everything, he said.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the video's release, Tiller said the dialogue delved into critical issues of equity and pronounced achievement gaps in school districts. He engaged in \"necessary, albeit uncomfortable, conversations and deep introspective analysis as a pathway to resolution,\" the statement said.\n\nHe wanted to set the bar high for students and teachers.\n\nDuring the interview, Tiller talked about setting high expectations for both students and teachers.\n\n\"Teach them and elevate them,\" he said. \"They should know something more when they cross across your threshold than they did prior.\"\n\nNever in his career has he not had students meet his expectations when he set the bar high, he said.\n\n\"I have never, ever not set the bar, and my students have leaped over the bar 100% of the time,\" he said.\n\nTiller's background is in educational transformation and improving test scores. Before coming to Green Bay, he was the assistant superintendent over high school transformation with the Detroit Public Schools Community District, a district of 53,000 students and over 100 schools.\n\nOne of his first year goals in Green Bay was to raise reading scores by 5% and math scores by 10%.\n\nTiller echoes host's comment about Green Bay being 'lily white'\n\nAt the start of the show, Berry said that Green Bay is about as lily white as she's ever seen.\n\nTiller responded, \"a lily on top of the lily.\" That comment was of concern for Ed Dorff, a former Green Bay School District principal and former board member, who spoke at a school board meeting Feb. 12 about Tiller's radio show interview.\n\nThe \"reference to 'lilly on lilly' was a reflective echo of the program host's terminology, aimed at underscoring the conversation's context and the pressing need for systemic introspection and reform,\" Tiller's statement said.\n\nGreen Bay's population is 72% white, according to 2023 data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nDanielle DuClos is a Report for America corps member who covers K-12 education for the Green Bay Press-Gazette.

The country’s lawmakers passed a bill in 2014, but they replaced the death penalty clause with a proposal for life in prison. That law was ultimately struck down, but some lawmakers have sought to reintroduce it.\n\nIn 2014, Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni, told CNN in an exclusive interview that sexual behavior is a matter of choice and gay people are “disgusting.”\n\nUganda is a socially conservative country, and in 2014 it introduced the Anti-Pornography Act which included a “mini-skirt ban.” In recent years the law has resulted in the arrest of revenge porn victims.\n\nIn May 2019, Uganda’s “ex-gay” community petitioned Uganda’s parliament to bring back the 2014 Anti-Homosexuality Bill to “create awareness on sexual orientation,” according to a statement on the parliament website.\n\nUgandan activists have in the past told CNN the LGBTQ community faces arrests, attacks and persecution.", "authors": ["Chandler Thornton"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2024/02/24/community-members-call-on-green-bay-school-board-to-reinstate-claude-tiller/72717613007/", "title": "Community members call on Green Bay School Board to reinstate ...", "text": "GREEN BAY — About 100 community members gathered Saturday in support of former Green Bay School District Superintendent Claude Tiller, calling on the School Board to reinstate him.\n\nTiller resigned a week ago amid a School Board investigation into his comments on an Atlanta radio show earlier in February.\n\nThe leaders of three cultural nonprofits — Robin Scott of We All Rise: African American Resource Center, Amanda Garcia of Casa ALBA Melanie, and Said Hassan of COMSA — led a panel discussion on what went wrong with the School Board's process leading to Tiller's resignation and what reinstating him would do for the community.\n\nThe three nonprofits created a community action group, United Front for Social Change, to demand the School Board apologize and give Tiller his position back, saying his resignation was forced. The group wants to work with the board to bring Tiller back to the district.\n\nA representative from Tiller's team told the Press-Gazette that he is open to the conversation of reconsidering his resignation.\n\nAdrienne Berry, the host of the Atlanta talk radio show, was also part of the panel.\n\nAll Green Bay School Board members were invited to the community gathering along with the Green Bay School District's Deputy Superintendent Vicki Bayer.

His seat is up for reelection April 2.\n\nTiller's comments didn't warrant resignation, advocates say\n\nTiller's comments did not warrant his resignation, according to Scott.\n\n\"Now that we have been able to see the video, I feel like everybody from our communities, we're trying to figure out where, why and what this led to,\" Scott said.\n\nTiller appeared on Berry's Feb. 6 radio show \"REALationship Talk,\" and in their near two-hour-long conversation, Tiller talked about student mental health, applying for the superintendent job, re-energizing clubs for students and staff of color, the need to hire more teachers of color and his vision to make the Green Bay School District known for its education.\n\nA Facebook Live video of the interview, obtained Wednesday by the Press-Gazette, is separate from the radio station's officially recorded interview. The Facebook Live video includes both on-air comments and conversations between Tiller and Berry during commercial breaks.\n\nMore:Radio show interview of former Green Bay School District Superintendent Claude Tiller released\n\nDuring one of the commercial breaks, Tiller called a district principal a \"wicked witch,\" describing how she was treating an employee of color at the school.\n\nEverything happened too fast, Tiller was not given due process, and the community failed him, Scott said. From the date the community learned Tiller was under investigation to his resignation, it was five days.\n\nGarcia said the district and School Board have set a very dangerous precedent with how Tiller's comments were handled, moving quickly before the video of his interview was released.\n\n\"We believe this is important because it's not just about one person of color,\" Garcia said. \"There are so many professionals in this area, and this could happen to any one of us.\"\n\nHassan said this isn't just about Tiller but is about future generations as well.\n\n\"It's about more than us,\" he said. \"It's bigger than us. It's our kids and generations to come. If we don't say anything about it, it's going to remain the same.\"\n\nAtlanta radio host Dr. Adrienne says Tiller's comments were taken out of context\n\nBerry, the host of the radio show Tiller was on, is a psychotherapist in Atlanta and has worked 27 years in education. She said his comments were taken out of context and they did not merit a resignation.\n\n\"If Dr. Tiller had been a white man, he would not be gone,\" Berry said.\n\nShe also said that just because he resigned, it doesn't mean it was not forced.\n\n\"I think that what happens is, people become uncomfortable when we start to have conversations about race, and so the immediate response is, 'We have to get rid of somebody,'\" she said. \"If you listen to the entire video, and things are not taken out of context, you can see the passion he has for this entire community.\"\n\nWhen the board hired Tiller, it was saying change is needed, Berry said.\n\n\"You have to support him and give him what he needed to be successful,\" she said.\n\nUnited Front for Social Change calling on community for support\n\nThe United Front for Social Change is calling on its allies, Scott said.\n\n\"That is what today is also about,\" she said. \"It is for our white young people, our white elders .... to come to the front lines and to go with us to the board and lead the conversation.\"\n\n\"We need y'all to come out, and we need y'all to speak up,\" she continued.\n\nA Change.org petition to reinstate Tiller has over 600 virtual signatures after only two days. Comments from community members on the petition echo many of the group's sentiments.\n\n\"This went too fast. Dr. Tiller was railroaded out on a witch hunt,\" James Rogers commented on the petition. \"Dr. Tiller IS the change Green Bay School District needs. Listen to the families voices unified in support of Dr. Tiller. It is not too late for this School Board to apologize and do the right thing.\"\n\nJolanda Sallmann commented that: \"Dr. Tiller has done remarkable work in Green Bay. His comments about needing teachers to represent the demographics of the students is accurate.\"\n\nBoard member Andrew Becker doesn't answer whether he will work to reinstate Tiller\n\nBecker was the only board member who attended Saturday's gathering, despite all of them being invited. He said he was there to listen, but a community member asked if he supports them.\n\n\"I believe I do,\" he said. \"I believe that I try to be an ally, and I believe there's a lot I don't know about how to be a good ally yet, but I believe that I do my best with everything.\"\n\nHe did not answer whether he will work to reinstate Tiller.\n\nBoard members have been largely quiet about Tiller's resignation and the investigation. No board members answered the Press-Gazette's questions about whether Tiller was granted a restorative justice opportunity for the \"wicked witch\" comment or whether his comments merited a resignation.\n\nAfter the board voted to accept Tiller's resignation Feb. 17, most board members, including President Laura McCoy, quickly left the board room. Hassan said it was disrespectful that they didn't stay to talk with the over 50 community members there.\n\n\"I was considering they would at least have the courtesy to talk to me, but that was not the case,\" he said. \"The question is, how can these people who are elected by the community represent us?\"\n\nBecker did stay behind to talk with community members at the Feb. 17 meeting.\n\nSchool Board to meet Monday, discuss interim superintendent to temporarily replace Tiller.\n\nThe School Board is meeting in closed session Monday to discuss the contract and hiring of an interim superintendent. The interim leader is likely to be Deputy Superintendent Vicki Bayer.\n\nShe has been filing in for Tiller since he was placed on administrative leave Feb. 13. Bayer also served as the interim superintendent after the unexpected mid-year retirement of former Superintendent Stephen Murley in 2022. He was the superintendent before Tiller.\n\nBut for Scott and the United Front for Social Change, there is no need for Monday's meeting.\n\n\"We've already been given our superintendent,\" Scott said. \"We want you to give him back.\"\n\nDanielle DuClos is a Report for America corps member who covers K-12 education for the Green Bay Press-Gazette.

I had to really pray about it. But once I talked to Betsy, I wanted to help as much as I could. For so many years, she was buried and couldn't tell the truth.\"\n\nBell Witch legend featured in upcoming A&E series\n\nPugh was three years old when she first started to see things that others couldn't, she said. For years, the visions terrified her, so she kept them a secret from virtually everyone she knew, except her parents.\n\n\"I would tell my mom, and she told me to pray about it,\" Pugh said. \"If people had known the truth, I wouldn't have had the life I've had. I probably wouldn't have been a cheerleader. I probably wouldn't have had friends. I had a wonderful childhood, I really did, and it was because of my parents.\"\n\nNow 29 years old, Pugh has been married for more than seven years and has two children of her own. About a year-and-a-half ago, she decided to open up about her past and join Mississippi Paranormal Investigations as a way to learn more about her abilities.\n\nHer involvement with the group led to her appearance on the A&E show, she said.\n\nFilming leads to book\n\nIn July, Pugh was introduced to Sue Clifton, a Mississippi-based author and ghost hunter. The two met while filming for the A&E series at Betsy Bell's grave in Yalobusha County, Miss. and, according to Clifton, they felt an immediate connection.\n\n\"I did not believe in mediums before I met Sara,\" said Clifton, 70, a former teacher turned author. \"Neither of us knew each other's names, let alone anything else, before then, but Sara came up with things that night, personal things about my family that no one could possibly know.\n\n\"I was totally fascinated. She's the most intriguing person I've ever known, and that night when we were having a break, I told her 'I'm going to do a book about you.'\"\n\nTwo months later, Clifton published \"Through the Eyes of Angel Leigh,\" a book she co-authored with Pugh, chronicling Pugh's life, the people she's helped and her interpretation of the Bell Witch legend. Before it was released in September, Pugh insisted on a meeting with descendant Bob Bell, of Springfield, so she could tell him the story since it was about his family, Clifton said.\n\n\"That just speaks to what kind of person Sara is,\" Clifton said. \"People can criticize all they want to, but I don't have to defend anything. I think Sara's story is the true account of what happened.\"\n\nA new take on the legend\n\nIn Clifton's book, Pugh claims that the Bells weren't cursed. The land they chose to settle in Adams was cursed, and when they disturbed the land, the curse was set in motion.\n\nAt first, strange sounds were reported in and around the Bells' cabin in 1817.\n\nOver time, the situation intensified, and the Bells reportedly talked to a spirit they later named Kate. The spirit would target Betsy Bell, pinching her, pulling and tying her hair in knots and slapping her until she was bruised, according to Adams historian Tim Henson.\n\nBell Witch legend nearly 200 years old\n\nThe abuse continued until the year after Betsy Bell's father, John, died in 1820 at about age 70. The spirit took credit for his death, stating she poisoned him, Henson said of the legend.\n\nBut, Pugh says the spirit that tortured Betsy Bell and the rest of her family, even their slaves, on that pioneer farm nearly 200 years ago wasn't responsible for John Bell's death.\n\nA slave killed John Bell, poisoning him because he could not protect his then 11-year-old daughter, Betsy, from another family member who was sexually abusing her at the time, Pugh said.\n\n\"I had to give this girl a voice,\" she said. \"We had to bring this story to light. We couldn't keep sweeping it under the rug.\"\n\nBell Family reacts\n\nFor Bob Bell, the fifth great grandson of John Bell and a lifelong Robertson County resident, Pugh's story \"makes sense.\"\n\n\"She blew me away,\" he said. \"For someone who doesn't know anything about the history or hasn't studied it at all, she pretty much nailed it.\"\n\nEarlier this summer, Bell, 52, said he and Adams Historian Tim Henson took Clifton and Pugh on a tour of places in Adams central to the Bell Witch legend. At each site, Pugh would scribble in her notebook, and, at the end of the day, she had listed the names of everyone in the Bell family and came up with facts that both men later said she couldn't have known.\n\n\"I'm thoroughly convinced she has a gift that I don't have,\" Bell said. \"She's the real deal. A lot of the family isn't going to like it because of the molestation part of it, but for me, the possession factor is central here. [The family member] wouldn't have done what he did to (Betsy) for no reason.\n\n\"It's a whole different version than the story I grew up with, but everything she wrote down had some fact to it. That story has as much right to be written as the original book. Whether it's true or not, who knows?\"\n\nAs for the A&E series, Bob Bell said last week that he wasn't sure exactly what to expect, but he could say with certainty that everyone in it is who they say they are.\n\n\"I've been warned that there are some fictionalized things in it,\" he said. \"But they tried to keep it as factual as they could while still being entertaining.\"\n\nFor Mississippian Pat Gordon, also a Bell descendant who can trace her lineage up to John Bell's oldest son Jesse, the upcoming A&E series is something she's both anxious and excited about, she said. A resident of Union, Miss., Gordon was visiting Adams for the first time last week.\n\nShe had read Clifton and Pugh's book, and like Bob Bell, found it answered some questions about her family's history.\n\n\"I agreed with that book more than any other book that I've read,\" Gordon said. \"I mean, it fits.\"\n\nFor years, Gordon, now 64, had always been curious about the legend, she said. One time when she was a young girl, her grandmother had started to tell her part of it, but her grandfather walked in and put a stop to it, she added.\n\n\"I never had the feeling like the Bell Blood was bringing me bad luck or anything,\" she said. \"I never felt that way. For me, it was always kind of fun to know your family history had a witch in it. You know that (saying) 'in the South, we don't hide crazy. We put them out on the front porch'? Well, that's kind of how I feel about it.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/happyeverafter/2012/10/30/cathy-maxwell-the-scottish-witch-curses/1670189/", "title": "'Scottish Witch' author Cathy Maxwell: Power of a curse", "text": "Joyce Lamb, USA TODAY\n\nCathy Maxwell's second Chattan Curse book is out this week, The Scottish Witch (book one was Lyon's Bride). How appropriate that it came out the week of Halloween! Cathy joins us to wonder whether the power of our thoughts can affect our everyday lives.\n\nCathy:\n\n\"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\"\n\n— Hamlet, 2.2.237\n\nI have friends who are witches. They are reasonable, modern people with families and jobs. They do not twitch their noses or traipse around in black velvet and chiffon. The only time they use a broom is to sweep the floor, and, yes, knowing them, hearing them speak about people's superstitions, helped me create and form the Chattan Curse Trilogy, including my current The Scottish Witch.\n\nHere's what they do believe: We all possess unimaginable powers and can tap into unseen forces.\n\nThis is not so strange. For example, we define ourselves through our fears, doubts and beliefs. All unseen; all not necessarily based upon fact. However, whatever we give conscious thought to will rule how we think and act.\n\nI have a friend who suffers from fibromyalgia. She is convinced that her ailment isn't from something physical but from being \"cursed.\" She fears she crossed someone in her past and they have given her this pain. I can't convince her otherwise. After all, doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia and that only proves her case.\n\nMy sister sent me a text this morning saying she's finally figured out what she thinks follows her around for the day. \"When you say things like 'I am fat' or 'I am dumb,' then that negative word follows you all day, but if you say 'I am smart' or 'I am going to exercise today,' the positive follows you.\" She calls this her Oprah moment.\n\nI call it unleashing the power of belief. It can work for our best interests, and against them, such as my friend who believes she is cursed.\n\nIn The Scottish Witch, I play with the idea of reality and fantasy. Is there such a thing as magic? Or is it because we don't believe, because we can't or won't open our minds, we do not see what is true?\n\nYes, in the first book, Lyon's Bride, and in this second, there is a curse. It is a powerful one, placed upon the Chattans by an outraged mother. I can't imagine any force more commanding than grief.\n\nBut is it possible that the Chattans have invited their own curse?\n\nI've played with this idea through all three books. The final one is titled The Devil's Heart and will be released in May. The curse is that when a Chattan male falls in love, he will die.\n\nThis is an easy curse to conquer: Just don't fall in love.\n\nBut can any of us live without love? Would we want to?\n\nAnd what does it say if we are wishing this curse upon ourselves? If our best impulse is for our own destruction?\n\nHarry Chattan is a man pursued by his own demons. Portia Maclean thought that if he was willing to pay good coin for a witch, well, she could pretend to be one. Little does she know the price Harry will extract for playing him for a fool ... and is she willing to meet his demands? Maybe even raise the ante with a few desires of her own?\n\nAnd that is not only when the fun begins, but also the magic.\n\nTo find out more about Cathy and her books, you can visit her website, CathyMaxwell.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/outdoors/2017/05/06/pere-cheney-outdoors/101283124/", "title": "You never know what you'll find hunting - even a witch town", "text": "Lydia Lohrer, Special to the Detroit Free Press\n\nYou can always find something when you go hunting. It just might not be quite what you set out for.\n\nMy on-again, off-again vegetarian daughter, Natalya Rivers, has pursued deer for three years. She tolerated bitter cold in silence and kept the faith, to no avail. Last year, an interloper set up a blind in her line of fire where the deer had been coming in. To her credit, she didn’t shoot him.\n\nThis spring, I decided she should come with me to get a turkey. She might bask in the sun a bit and her odds of success were good. I knew just the spot, too: a secret little green area where the hens sashay and toms strut tall. A bobcat once paused and stared at me crossing the road there. It would be perfect.\n\nI brought along my daughter, Nina; son, Wolfgang, who knew the area as well; Wolfgang’s friend, Jeremy; and long-time family friend, Sammy.\n\nWe set off on our adventure certain Natalya would have a bird before the Trout Unlimited gathering I planned to attend Saturday morning.\n\nBut the fates weren’t kind. I messed up Natalya’s license and got her a ZZ tag for Crawford County. Ahem. There are no such tags for Crawford County. A turkey parade was scheduled, but we weren’t on the guest list.\n\nRelated:\n\nMichigan DNR offering reward for wild turkey poachers\n\nRochester pals catch 48-inch muskie on Detroit River\n\nWe surrendered to our destiny. Sammy fortuitously brought fishing gear, so we dipped our lines in the clear northern trout waters, chased a garter snake, caught a toad, shot clay pigeons and grilled steaks.\n\nThat night, the boys went on a walk. They thought they had heard someone in the woods and wanted to find out who it was. It would be tough to get lost, as they would be walking along a rail line.\n\nThey returned hours later, happy and tired. They said they saw a two-story home along the railway with a couple of lit windows and thought they heard a baby crying. The young men skedaddled in case the owners were shoot first, ask questions later types.\n\nWolf was puzzled, though. We were pretty sure most of the length of the rail line was state land with no homes alongside. We looked at the satellite, but there was zero evidence of a dwelling within view of the rail line.\n\nWe vowed to find it the next day.\n\nWe awoke full of enthusiasm despite the hostile, windy weather. Well, I woke this way; the young adults – not so much. We donned rain gear in anticipation of a worsening forecast and took off in pursuit of the home.\n\nIt wasn’t where they thought it would be. So we searched farther south, scrutinizing for their tracks, which were sometimes visible, and for others as well. We looked everywhere, it seemed. Wolf joked that maybe they had come upon a parallel universe the previous night. We all laughed and kept looking.\n\n\"What’s that?\" Wolf asked. We saw a slight, dark figure running away, heading south until it disappeared. We followed it to its origin and found gravestones and a cemetery. Hmm. Interesting.\n\nThe graves were dilapidated, some just indentations with rocks atop. An angel statue bearing broken wings adorned one gravestone. We stood beneath an oak tree, staring. The air chilled suddenly, dramatically. Our hoods went up and we huddled together as we walked back to the car, feeling mystified and sober.\n\nJust for the heck of it I Googled \"ghost stories Crawford County.\"\n\nAs it turned out, we were smack dab in the middle of one.\n\nPere Cheney cemetery has a long history of hauntings. And we weren’t the first turkey hunters to come upon the graveyard, either. A few years ago some turkey hunters found some kids trying to dig up one of the graves.\n\nThey were looking for the Pere Cheney witch. Witch or not, the area has a bad past. Once the vibrant county seat, a Detroit Free Press article from 1878 described it as “a thriving farming community where one might 'breathe the purest atmosphere this side of the Rocky Mountains.' ”\n\nIt boasted 1,500 residents, three saw mills, a doctor, a school, and other amenities. What happened is unclear, but the legend is that the “witch” cursed the town. In those days, witchiness had less to do with a role as a spell caster and more with her responsibility as a single mom who was thus banished from a life among the more righteous townsfolk. Her child died, and she went mad and cursed the town’s children.\n\nCholera and diphtheria are both heavily mentioned in historical records around the 1890s, and within years of the purported curse, the town lost most of its children. By 1912 just a handful of residents lived among a legion of buried dead. Some say the residual dwellers tried to burn the town to the ground before they left to eradicate what was left of the disease. Whatever happened, there’s not much of the town left today.\n\nThe witch got the last laugh, but it didn’t give her peace: reports of her presence persisted through the decades. Her misty visage is apparently so well known among ghost hunters that a type of vape has been named after her haunt.\n\nI relayed this information to the kids from the car as the rain beat down upon the roof.\n\nWe jumped at the unexpected sound of maniacal laughter bursting through the silence.\n\nIt was a turkey, I reassured them. It had to be. We hopped out of the car again and searched for that bird, but couldn’t locate it. You don’t always find the things for which you hunt. Still, we pronounced it a success.\n\nMoose population explodes on Isle Royale\n\nContact the author at lydiaoutdoors@gmail.com.

Witches explain why.", "text": "Kiley Mann was 10 when she was gifted her first set of runes, a Nordic divination tool, which sparked a lifelong journey into witchcraft.\n\n\"I've been studying spirituality and religion for about a decade now,\" she says, explaining witchcraft for her is the duality of both.\n\nNow 19, Mann shares what she's learned with her 883,000 TikTok followers, from divination forms like tea leaves to working with tarot cards, runes and bone throwing.\n\nKnown by the username @oracleofthemoon, she is one of many TikTok users part of WitchTok, a niche section of the video-sharing app that revolves around magic and witchcraft. The hashtag #witchtok alone has amassed more than 19.8 billion views.\n\nWhy has it become so popular? We spoke to some of the personalities behind WitchTok to find out.\n\nHow WitchTok creators got started\n\nAdam Wethington, 33, has been doing tarot since he was 15, but after losing his job at the start of the pandemic, he turned to readings as a form of income. He joined TikTok in December as a way to share his skills and is now known as Madam Adam to his 1.5 million followers, a reclamation of the \"bully name that I got as a kid.\"\n\nWethington, whose pronouns are he/they, says their content, which has now become their full-time job, comes \"from a level of truth that I think is resonant with a lot of people.\"\n\n\"I come at it in a way that some people call brutal honesty,\" they add. \"I call it tough love.\"\n\nMann, a full-time fine arts student whose pronouns are she/they, first started a TikTok account as a way to share their Etsy business, where they sell magical tools from crystals to herbs and homemade protection salts. The more their account grew, \"the more comfortable I felt in solidarity to share more about my own practice, and it just kind of took off from there.\"\n\nHoney Rose, 23, first got into tarot three years ago and has been studying magic ever since. Rose began their TikTok account under the username @thathoneywitch about six months before COVID-19 hit, reaching around 40,000 followers by February 2021. Now more than 124,000 people follow Rose's account, which they manage while also pursuing a Masters degree in forensic science full time.\n\nWhile they sell tarot readings and ceramic cauldrons on the side, they've mostly found joy in the community by making friends they're \"going to keep for a really long time.\"\n\nWhy WitchTok is so popular\n\nWitchTok is a thriving community of creators who share a common link of magic and witchcraft.\n\nWethington describes it as a \"fabulous TikTok community of spiritualists... from all different walks of life.\" He believes part of its popularity comes from the sense of control it can provide people during uncertain times brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"WitchTok content is so relevant right now because we learned last year we can't control (things). All you can control is what you do, all you can control is what you think is truth in the world,\" Wethington explains. \"We're in this great spiritual renaissance of enlightenment... Many of us are looking inward.\"\n\nIn addition to control, turning to spiritual practices during unprecedented times can also provide a sense of purpose, says Gabriela Herstik, author of \"Inner Witch: A Modern Guide to the Ancient Craft.\"\n\n\"We live in this very intense, dark age... People want purpose, and they want connection,\" she says. \"But beyond that, they want something that helps them connect to something larger than themselves. Something that helps them feel like there's a purpose, and magic does that. Magic is a way to align with your purpose, your power.\"\n\nPeople who have been historically ostracized by religious institutions, such as those who identify as LGBTQ+, may also find community in this form of spirituality.\n\n\"I definitely think that if there's any queer people that are seeking spirituality, you don't have to call it 'witchcraft,' that's fine... But there are definitely spiritual things for you,\" says Wethington, who grew up Catholic before turning to witchcraft. \"It's really a great opportunity for you to feel like you're connected to something real and grounded.\"\n\nRose echoes the refuge that marginalized groups can find in this community, sharing their own intersection of identities.\n\n\"I am a lot of marginalized groups. I am nonbinary, I'm queer and I'm half-Black... but magic has been the voice of people that are voiceless for a very long time,\" they explain. \"Some people have a problem with traditional religions and traditional spirituality, as sometimes they go towards a more abstract form of spirituality, which can be witchcraft.\"\n\nHerstik believes WitchTok's growth is also due to the accessibility it brings to these topics.\n\n\"I've been writing about witchcraft for seven or eight years at this point, and I've seen it come up as a super powerful force in the in the Zeitgeist,\" she says, remembering when \"being witchy\" and \"looking witchy\" started to become trendy years ago, from tarot decks being sold in Urban Outfitters to \"American Horror Story: Coven.\"\n\n\"Seeing it on TikTok was not very shocking. It just feels like a natural progression of what people have been really yearning for, which is accessible information around these esoteric topics that at any other point in history, before the internet, were super guarded and super hard to access.\"\n\nMann agrees that while it's always been popular within certain communities, TikTok brings a \"certain visibility,\" making people more \"curious about what it's all about and how it can apply to their own lives.\n\n\"What makes people so curious about it is that this information was once regarded as kind of taboo, but now it's become more open to the general public,\" they add.\n\nMore:Witchy fashion is 2017's most exciting, subversive trend\n\nWitchcraft's cultural roots\n\nWhile WitchTok is rising in popularity, witchcraft itself is not a trend. Instead, it's been around for centuries and practiced by different groups around the world.\n\nFrom hoodoo spiritually rooted in traditional African religions and Latin American and Afro-Caribbean practices known in Spanish as brujería, to religions like Vodou and Wicca, having endless things to learn about is part of what kept Mann intrigued at the beginning of her journey with magic.\n\n\"It's a community that's filled with knowledge, and there's just always new things you can learn about yourself, about others, about different cultures and religions is infinite,\" Mann said.\n\nMann adds that witchcraft is also much more diverse than you may see on TikTok: \"Witchcraft by some name exists in virtually every culture, and everybody practices it differently, and most of the time what you see on the internet or on WitchTok is just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nAs a half-Black, half-Italian WitchTok creator, Rose has found comfort in connecting with their ancestors through magic.\n\nThey also agree in doing research to show appreciation and not appropriation towards certain practices.\n\n\"There's often the issue of cultural appropriation, and I've had to deal with that. Some people don't want to listen to people from those cultures, with their knowledge, they just don't want to listen, because they want to keep doing what they're doing.\" they add, pointing to issues surrounding white sage and dreamcatchers being used when the origins are rooted in indigenous cultures and practices.\n\nIt also helps to listen to witches and practitioners of color who speak to these topics. For example, in one of Rose's early videos, they explained the harm in using the term \"black magic\" to describe dark or evil magic.\n\nMann hopes WitchTok empowers people of different communities to share their stories.\n\n\"I think it's bringing more visibility to people of color, people of different religions, indigenous people, I think it's definitely allowing more worldly views to be shared and observed and respected,\" they say.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/magnolia/faith/2017/11/03/project-honey-bun-god-doesnt-want-people-go-hungry-no-matter-their-choices/823486001/", "title": "God doesn't want people to go hungry, no matter the choices they ...", "text": "Monique Harrison-Henderson\n\nGuest Columnist\n\nMost families have their rituals.\n\nOne of ours is a little something we call Project Honey Bun.\n\nIt’s not an especially elaborate project, and we have only been doing it for about six months. We buy honey buns, and whenever we have the opportunity, we give them to people who look like they could use them. Almost always, these people are in extreme crisis, living on the streets, in their cars, or otherwise barely making ends meet.\n\nAnd one of the things about Project Honey Bun – along with some of the other efforts we have made to help people who are in these sorts of economic and personal crises, is that you never quite know how people living under such intense pressure will react.\n\nMy son, Hunter, who is in seventh grade, often asks me at the end of the day if I gave any of our sugary sweet, calorie-packed packaged pastries away. (Since I work in downtown Jackson, I have more opportunities than many people to give them away. Hunter has a special interest in the Honey Buns because he uses money he earns refereeing to help us buy more goodies.)\n\nMore:A life turned around: He was once one of Jackson's homeless mentally ill\n\nMore:Homeless Angels group about second chances\n\nI never sugarcoat the responses that I get to Hunter. And the truth is, because we’ve spent a good bit of time around people who are homeless, he would probably know if I did.\n\nHere’s a sampling of the reactions we’ve gotten through Project Honey Bun in the past month:\n\n- “Honey buns! F@*&, yeah! I love some honey buns!”\n\n- “Bless you my child. Now, have a seat so I can tell you about my father. Did you know that I am Martin Luther King’s long lost daughter? Now that I have told you, can’t you just see the resemblance?”\n\n- “Thank you for this! Tell me, do you have any money that you can spare?”\n\n- One woman called me a “witch with a capital B. (Truth is, some days she’s probably right.)\n\nMany people shyly whisper thank you, or smile broadly. Often, people don’t say anything at all. They quietly accept the sugary boost, avert our gazes and walk away.\n\nA lot of the people we encounter show signs of potentially being under the influence. Others are clearly mentally ill. Often, they seem to show signs of both. (It’s hard to know, of course, which came first. Some mentally ill people understandably self-medicate in efforts to treat their psychological demons.)\n\nThere are well-intentioned people who have asked us how we feel about the impacts of some of our homeless efforts, including projects we did when we lived in Southern California, in East Texas, and now here in the Jackson area. (One of our favorite was 45 and Hope, a Houston, Texas-based program where a group of vans distributed hot meals and prayers to people all along the interstate every Saturday. Over time, program regulars had the chance to build relationships with many of the people who are homeless.)\n\nQuestions have included, “Don’t you feel like you are just enabling them to stay in an immoral lifestyle of drinking and doing drugs?” “Don’t you feel like they are just using you so they don’t have to work?” “Don’t these people really just need Jesus?”\n\nAnd I understand these concerns. There was a time in my life when I shared them, too. But here’s the thing: I don’t believe that God wants people to go hungry, no matter the choices they make. And I definitely don’t think that he is OK with me choosing – as I admit I sometimes do – to walk past people who are hungry when I have been given plenty, most importantly a steady start in this life.\n\nMany of our homeless people do not lack Jesus, either. Some of the most spiritual people I have met live on the streets. They pray more than I do, they have far more faith than I do, and they trust God in a way I have never needed.\n\nI also am not sure I agree that these folks don’t work. Many of them actually do odd jobs when those opportunities are available. They also work really hard just to stay alive. They “fly signs,” asking for money to stay alive another day. In doing that, they endure a lot of stares and harassment and abuse.\n\nWhen I see someone flying a sign, I am always reminded of the same idea: That person was once a child. And when they were a child, I am certain they didn’t dream of one day being homeless and begging others for money. That sign lets us know that somewhere along the line, life went horribly, horribly wrong.\n\nIt’s possible they made some bad decisions along the way. Addiction. Abusive relationships. Maybe they have prison records.\n\nMany were born without much of a chance to grow into adults who are able to earn a living. A few Sundays ago, we were lending a hand at a low-key lunch sponsored by Why Not Now Ministries, which feeds people on Sundays at Smith Park in Downtown Jackson.\n\nI was struck by the fact that several people shared with me that they were former foster kids, and the system did not serve them well. Even well into adulthood, they still had hurt and anger over their childhoods.\n\nIn those moments, I often share that I am adopted, and we talk about how a lot of life is a roll of the dice. I didn’t pick the people I was born to or who adopted me. None of us did. Some of us are luckier in our starts than others.\n\nThere are people who would complicate things like our meager Project Honey Bun, as well as other projects. They ask about our safety. (We don’t go out at night, we trust our instincts, and we never approach with wallets or purses or anything that might be tempting to steal. We also don’t get into situations where we are isolated. We almost never give money, and we never give significant amounts of money.)\n\nOthers say things like, “I don’t know how you can be comfortable doing that. I don’t even like going downtown.” Some say, “I just wouldn’t know what to say.”\n\nI suppose God gave us all varying temperaments and gifts for different reasons. But to me, we need to learn to be as comfortable as we can with all people, including the most disenfranchised among us. We never know when that is where we, ourselves, might be living.\n\nAnd when we don’t cultivate those experiences, it’s not necessarily the people who are homeless who miss out. The truth is, I think if we didn’t hand out our treats, someone else would likely come along and feel lead to do the same. Many of our homeless people are quite resourceful and know how to get what they truly need.\n\nBut we learn so much and we reap the benefits of our tiny project, as well as other efforts like it.\n\nA couple of years ago, we met a woman named Margaret, a beautiful, elderly African-American woman who lived on the streets of Conroe, Texas, just north of Houston. Although she was homeless and suffered many aches and pains, she always smiled broadly when she saw us. Each time, she would reach into her bulging library tote and dig out a photo she had taken from a catalog or newspaper and she would share it with one of us.\n\nShe spent hours scouring different publications, looking for photos that reminded her of people. And when she saw those people again – even months later - she would share the image, along with an encouraging word. She once gave me a photo of a shiny, black stallion taken from an out-of-date animal-themed calendar someone had given her. “You are like this stallion. You are strong and fierce and determined and loyal. You carry yourself with this same strength that I see in the picture.”\n\nAnd so I try to live my life a little like Margaret. I have things to give, and although I need to do a heck of a lot better, I do try to share. I know that in this season I am being pushed to take things to a new level – to give with more sacrificially, of my time and my money. I want to be more like Margaret.\n\nProject Honey Bun will continue – until a new need surfaces to replace it and take us in a different direction.\n\nMonique Harrison-Henderson is an educator, writer and speaker.

The students were finished with their lessons when the teachers got word there was a shooter in the building, she told CNN’s “New Day.”\n\nOne teacher went to lock the door, but Miah says the shooter was already right there — and shot out the window in the door.\n\nShe described it all happening so fast – her teacher backed into the classroom and the gunman followed. She told CNN he made eye contact with one of the teachers, said, “Goodnight,” and then shot her.\n\nHe opened fire, shooting the other teacher and many of Miah’s friends. She said bullets flew by her, and fragments hit her shoulders and head. The girl was later treated at the hospital and released with fragment wounds; she described to CNN that clumps of her hair were falling out now.\n\nMiah said after shooting students in her class, the gunman went through a door into an adjoining classroom. She heard screams, and the sound of shots in that classroom. After the shots stopped, though, she says the shooter started playing loud music – sad music, she said.\n\nThe girl and a friend managed to get her dead teacher’s phone and call 911 for help. She said she told a dispatcher, “Please come … we’re in trouble.”\n\nMiah said she was scared the gunman would return to her classroom to kill her and a few other surviving friends. So, she dipped her hands in the blood of a classmate – who lay next to her, already dead – and then smeared the blood all over herself to play dead.\n\nMiah said it felt like three hours that she lay there, covered in her classmate’s blood, with her friends.\n\nShe told CNN she assumed at that point the police hadn’t arrived on the scene yet.\n\nShe said afterward, she overheard talk of police waiting outside the school. As she recounted this part of the story to CNN, she started crying, saying she just didn’t understand why they didn’t come inside and rescue them.\n\nMiah’s mother said her daughter is traumatized and can’t sleep. The child’s parents have started a GoFundMe specifically to pay for her therapy.\n\nIn an effort to keep herself covered, Miah sat for the interview wrapped in a blanket, despite the warm temperatures.\n\nA cellphone alarm accidentally went off during the interview, and Miah was visibly unnerved by the noise. Her mother said that’s been happening a lot, and described an earlier incident where they were at a car wash and the sound of the vacuum cleaner “completely set her off.”\n\nMiah was too scared to speak on camera, or to a man, because of what she experienced, but she told CNN she wanted to share her story so people can know what it’s like to live through a school shooting. She says hopefully it can help prevent a tragedy like this from happening to other children.\n\nAlready a “miracle baby”\n\nMiah’s mother said she was born with a tumor in her abdomen and wasn’t expected to live much past her birth. She underwent extensive surgery to remove the tumor at age three; her mother already called her a “miracle baby” and said that’s even truer now.\n\nHer mother also told CNN that the morning of the shooting, Miah had an earache and she took her out of school to go to the doctor. On the way back, they stopped at Starbucks for a treat and her mother offered to let Miah skip school the rest of the day since it was one of the last days of classes before summer break and they were just watching movies.\n\nBut Miah insisted that she wanted to return to school to see her friends, so her mother dropped her back off at school – about an hour before the shooting.", "authors": ["Nora Neus Melissa Alonso Claire Colbert", "Nora Neus", "Melissa Alonso", "Claire Colbert"], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/business/dr-pepper-history/index.html", "title": "The soda market is flat, but not for Dr Pepper | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nIn the pantheon of sodas, Dr Pepper is the odd one out: It doesn’t have the popularity or sales of Coca-Cola or Pepsi, you can’t use it in a standard cocktail, and it doesn’t fall neatly into a category like cola or root beer.\n\nFor decades, the peppery soda has marketed its blend of 23 flavors as a unique choice for discerning soda drinkers. Over the years Dr Pepper has found success as a quirky alternative to Coke and Pepsi.\n\nToday, Dr Pepper is hardly a scrappy underdog — it’s the hero brand in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) which, along with Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP), make up the three largest soda companies in the $37 billion US market, as measured by NielsenIQ in retail and convenience stores.\n\nAnd recently, Dr Pepper has been gaining ground on its competitors, even as the overall soda market goes flat.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper is the third-largest soda maker in the country. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper soda grew its dollar share by 9% from 2003 to 2021, compared to a 26% drop in the carbonated soft drinks category overall, according to Keurig Dr Pepper, citing IRI and the Beverage Digest factbook. Today, Dr Pepper is the fourth most popular soda in the country after Coke, Pepsi and Mountain Dew.\n\n“Over the past 20 years, carbonated soft drinks have been declining in volume,” said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. “One of the bright spots … has been Dr Pepper.”\n\nFounded in 1885 in Waco, Texas, Dr Pepper was the first in a wave of 19th-century upstart soda companies. (It dropped the period in the 1950s for design reasons.) The little brand rose to prominence in the latter half of the 20th century and helped shape the soda industry, all while cultivating its reputation as an outsider.\n\nThe early days of Dr Pepper\n\nThe drink was invented by Charles Alderton, a pharmacist at a drug store owned by Wade Morrison, who is credited with patenting the drink and naming it.\n\nLegend has it that Morrison named the beverage after one Charles Pepper, the father of a woman he loved, hoping that the gesture would facilitate a match. That’s the tale on the Dr Pepper website. But Joy Summar-Smith, associate director of the Dr Pepper Museum in Waco, said there are several origin stories, and this one doesn’t hold up.\n\n“By the time [Morrison] came across Dr. Pepper he was married and he had a son,” said Summar-Smith.\n\nCoca-Cola was created in 1886. Pepsi was invented in the 1890s, but got its name in 1898.\n\n“The soft drink industry itself, as a whole, was still really trying to figure itself out in the late 1800s, early 1900s,” Summar-Smith said. “Each town had their own soft drink manufacturing facility.”\n\nCoca-Cola established itself most quickly, aided by its invention of the coupon, which offered free samples of its new beverage. Pepsi positioned itself as a less expensive competitor to Coke.\n\nAds for Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola on a store in North Carolina, in April 1938. John Vachon/Everett/Shutterstock\n\nWhile Coke and Pepsi were making waves, Dr Pepper “just didn’t push it that hard,” said Tristan Donovan, author of “Fizz: How Soda Shook Up the World.”\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Dr Pepper encouraged customers to drink a Dr Pepper three times a day, at around 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., to keep their energy up. While successful, the campaign never focused on the product’s unique, non-cola flavor.\n\nIn the 1950s, Dr Pepper branded itself “the friendly Pepper-Upper,” once again focusing on the rush of energy you could get from any can of soda.\n\nThen, everything changed.\n\nNot a cola\n\nIn the early 20th century, national bottlers that worked with with Coke or Pepsi shied away from Dr Pepper, fearing they would run afoul of agreements that barred them from partnering with a competitor. As a result, Dr Pepper had little national distribution, focusing primarily on Texas and nearby states.\n\nIn the 1960s, PepsiCo sued Dr Pepper for trademark infringement. Dr Pepper countered, accusing Pepsi of denying the beverage entry to its distribution platform. In 1963, a judge ruled for the bottler, opening the door to the product’s national expansion.​​\n\nDr Pepper “pulled off a legal coup that gave it the necessary leg up: It argued effectively in a US District Court that Dr Pepper was not a cola,” a 1984 article in D Magazine explained. Or as the Federal Trade Commission put it, “the suit opened up PepsiCo and Coca-Cola bottlers to Dr Pepper and its sales rose immediately.”\n\nWith new-found access to the whole country, the brand “started promoting [itself] much more heavily,” said Donovan, the author of “Fizz.”\n\nThrough the 1970s, Dr Pepper marketed itself to a national audience as a unique flavor, a shift that D Magazine said “fleshed out an identity for Dr Pepper that may be its most formidable asset.” In 1977, the company launched its “Be a Pepper” campaign, encouraging people to identify as Dr Pepper drinkers.\n\nThe \"Be a Pepper\" campaign ran from 1977 to 1983. Courtesy Keurig Dr Pepper\n\nToday, Dr Pepper advertises itself as a treat, using a pint-sized mascot called Lil’ Sweet in its commercials. Another campaign, Fanville, is set in a fictionalized world where people are obsessed with college football and also Dr Pepper, positioning the beverage as a cult favorite.\n\nAfter Dr Pepper established itself as an alternative to mainstream colas, it launched on a path that ultimately made it part of the country’s third-largest soft drink maker, Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nDr Pepper hits the scene\n\nDuring the wave of mega-mergers in the 1980s, Coca-Cola tried to scoop up Dr Pepper.\n\nIn 1986, soon after PepsiCo announced its intention to purchase 7Up, Coca-Cola said it had agreed to acquire Dr Pepper. The plans would have made Coke and Pepsi the most formidable players in the market by far, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time.\n\nBut both Coke’s and Pepsi’s deals were blocked, as the FTC decided the beverages were similar enough to pose a possible antitrust threat.\n\nA whirlwind series of mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs ensued. Dr Pepper and 7Up merged in the late 1980s. Over the years, Cadbury Schweppes took stakes in the combined company and, eventually, full ownership of the brands. In 2008 Cadbury spun off its North American beverage division to create the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. A decade later, Keurig Green Mountain merged with that company, creating Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nBottles of Dr. Pepper move down a production line at the Swire Coca-Cola bottling plant in Utah. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper, soda giant\n\nToday, KDP still trails behind Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, but it’s narrowing the gap.\n\nBy volume, Coca-Cola controlled about 40% of the US retail market in the first nine months of 2022, followed by PepsiCo with about 29% and Keurig Dr Pepper with roughly 25%, according to Beverage Digest’s data.\n\nCompared to the year before, PepsiCo’s share fell by 1%, while Keurig Dr Pepper’s ticked up. And over the years, the Dr Pepper brand has been gaining momentum while some of its competitors struggle. That might be because of consumers’ increasing interest in flavored soft drinks, said Stanford, the publication’s editor.\n\nThere are other advantages to existing outside of the cola dichotomy. Food-service providers typically have an agreement with either Coke or Pepsi for its soda fountains, and one fountain won’t feature products made by the other. But the fountains often offer Dr Pepper, making it a widely available choice.\n\n“Dr Pepper is the number one most differentiated trademark in beverage — not just soft drinks, but in beverage,” said Derek Dabrowski, general manager of juices, mixers and sauces at KDP. People reach for Dr Pepper when they want a treat, he added.

But not too far away: His friends called his New York home the Santa Fe house, because of its adobe-style design, filled with pink, yellow and turquoise colors. So he settled on “Santa Fe” for the name of the drink.\n\nIt didn’t stick.\n\n“When I put Santa Fe on the package, it didn’t look right,” Vultaggio told CNN Business. “I thought it looked like a train.”\n\nThinking of places that were close to Santa Fe that would look better on a can, Vultaggio settled on Arizona – where he’d never been. In fact, Vultaggio hadn’t even traveled west of the Mississippi.\n\n“I always associated Arizona with a healthy, clean and dry feel that was different from the Brooklyn feel,” he said. “Having a name associated with a lifestyle, which is an environment and climate that made you want to grab a refreshing iced tea. That’s why the name seemed to make sense to me.”\n\nAriZona was almost called Santa Fe. Adobe Stock\n\nAriZona Beverages, which makes the famous 99-cent iced teas, began in New York City in the early 1990s. Vultaggio, the company’s cofounder, said he was inspired by Snapple, which was founded in 1972 and became a cultural phenomenon. The “Snapple Lady” commercials turned the juice and iced tea company into a huge success, as sales boomed throughout the 90s.\n\nHaving had his own success with a malt liquor business, Vultaggio and his partners pivoted to selling iced tea in the same-sized 23-ounce cans as their malt liquor. That helped AriZona stand out against Snapple’s 16-ounce can.\n\nThey wanted to keep it the same price, too. And give the logo a stylized capital Z that he said just looks better on its cans.\n\nThe vibrant can, with its eye-catching checkerboard patterns and colors, was inspired by his Santa Fe house, because of the “continuous feedback and accolades we would receive from everyone” for his home’s design.\n\nAriZona’s design is a “great point of differentiation with its competitors,” according to Andres Nicholls, global executive creative director at consultancy and design firm Prophet. “It’s been an excellent tool and place to express their personality and quickly say to the market ‘we are not like everybody else.’”\n\nNicholls said the brand has “been pretty fearless and consistent in their approach and have created a very distinctive design.”\n\nAriZona Iced Tea made its debut in 1992 and became an immediate hit. Its product line has blossomed beyond tea and now encompasses hundreds of products that include snacks, candy, coffee and alcohol. One of its most popular drinks is the Arnold Palmer, a half-tea, half-lemonade beverage based off the golf great’s drink of choice.\n\nBut just as eye-catching as the design is the 99-cent price for its tall boy iced teas, is its cost, which should be adjusted to more than $2 according to US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ price calculator. But that1992 price is staying put.\n\n“Our customers don’t need another price increase,” he told CNN International anchor Richard Quest in June. “We maintain that price to give customers a reason to buy us.”\n\nManufacturing costs have risen everywhere, but Vultaggio credits actions “behind the scenes” that keep the tea’s profit margins robust. “We’ve been able to do it by light-weighting the can, run the cans faster on the line, have more facilities in America so we get closer to market,” he said.\n\nThe eye-catching design also helps maintain its market dominance, because AriZona doesn’t advertise as much as competitors like Snapple. Rather, the brand relies on its creativity to grab customers’ attention.\n\n“We use packaging and a value story, then a great product inside,” Vultaggio said. “The first time a person buys us is because of the package. And forever more, they’re buying it because it tastes great.”", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/12/18/youve-got-mail-turns-20-all-best-quotes-rom/2335013002/", "title": "'You've Got Mail' turns 20: All the best quotes from the rom-com", "text": "Twenty years ago on Dec. 18, sitting in a theater that likely had a buttery scent in the air, audiences took in \"You've Got Mail.\"\n\nKathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) and Joe Fox – F-O-X – (Tom Hanks) developed an online friendship and that eventually led to true love, despite being competitors in the cut-throat book business, in a world created by rom-com icon Nora Ephron and her sister Delia, with inspiration from Miklós László's play \"Parfumerie.\" At the time, the red notification of yesteryear from AOL produced just as much excitement.\n\nIt's the kind of movie that wouldn't be the same if made today.

Kohl’s is in turmoil today.\n\nThe chain’s sales are lower than before the pandemic, despite strong consumer spending and as its rivals enjoy big gains. Activist investors are circling Kohl’s and demanding leadership changes. A sale of the company could be on the horizon.\n\n“We see a company that’s lost its way,” said Jonathan Duskin, managing partner at Macellum Advisors, an activist investment firm that has become Kohl’s third largest shareholder.\n\nKohl's is under heavy pressure from investors and retail rivals. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMacellum and a group of activist investors took a stake in Kohl’s last year. The group reached a settlement with Kohl’s in April, but Macellum has recently revived its effort to overhaul Kohl’s because of continued stock price weakness and market share losses.\n\nKohl’s “should be doing better than Macy’s, not worse,” Duskin said. “We see a lot of initiatives that sound okay, but never really result in growth.”\n\nIn a statement, a Kohl’s spokesperson blasted Macellum, saying the firm was “using a misinformed, shifting and hollow narrative” to push for changes that would not improve Kohl’s and result in “poorly qualified and inexperienced” board directors.\n\nThe spokesperson said Kohl’s has made “substantial progress in transforming our business and positioning the Company for long-term success.”\n\n“We are already delivering results,” the spokesperson added, pointing to the company’s record earnings in 2021, operating profit margins reached two years ahead of schedule and an increase in the company’s quarterly dividend.\n\nKohl’s is attempting yet another makeover to turn things around, but its success is far from guaranteed.\n\nFighting the tide\n\nWith more than 1,100 US stores and around $19 billion in annual sales, Kohl’s is the largest department store chain in the United States.\n\nThe department store sector has been in structural decline for years against pressure from Amazon, growing big-box chains including Walmart (WMT)and Target (TGT), and discount clothing stores like TJMaxx. Companies such as Sears, JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, Barney’s and others have filed for bankruptcy in recent years.\n\nDepartment stores including Kohl’s have been undercut on prices by discount players from the bottom, and prestige by luxury stores at the top, said John Fisher, a senior lecturer at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management and former CEO of Saucony running shoes.\n\n“It’s hard to be unique,” Fisher said. “I think Kohl’s is caught right now by death in the middle.”\n\nKohl's CEO Michelle Gass has been considered one of the most innovative executives in retail. Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nKohl’s has lost around 17% of its market share since 2011, primarily to off-price retailers such as TJMaxx, as well as Amazon, according to UBS.\n\n“[F]orces like consumers’ migration to online and preference for value have contributed to this erosion,” UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a recent report. “This will likely continue after the pandemic.”\n\nSince Gass, a former top deputy to Howard Schultz at Starbucks (SBUX), took over as Kohl’s CEO in 2018, the company has attempted a handful of approaches to draw customers and stave off competitors.\n\nIn addition to the returns partnership with Amazon, Kohl’s expanded its athleisure clothing business with brands such as Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA). Kohl’s also shrunk the size of a handful of stores and leased out the extra space to Aldi and Planet Fitness, made a bigger play for Millennials with new brands such as PopSugar and, more recently, opened Sephora beauty stores inside Kohl’s.\n\nThese strategies have not led to major improvements. Kohl’s has improved its athleisure business and other areas, but its women’s clothing business has slumped.\n\nIn 2018, sales inched up 0.7% from the prior year. In 2019, they dropped 1.2% before plunging 20% in 2020 due to store closures and Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nLast year, after stores reopened and shoppers refreshed their wardrobes, sales bounced back 23% — but that was still below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nCompetition has become more cutthroat in the four years since Gass took over, and “a lot of Kohl’s stores feel tired,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData. “It has been very easy for customers to switch away from Kohl’s to others offering something better.”\n\nAnd brand partnerships with Amazon and Sephora do not address core issues, he added. “Kohl’s needs to look to improving its own brand rather than relying on others to lift it.”\n\nA sale looming?\n\nOver the last few months, activist investors have been pressing for changes at Kohl’s.\n\nOne firm, Engine Capital, urged Kohl’s to spin off its e-commerce business from its stores or find a buyer to take the company private. “Even the most patient long-term shareholders cannot be expected to endure the punishing underperformance and perpetual value disconnect seen at Kohl’s,” Engine Capital said in December.\n\nA month later, Macellum Advisors said it would nominate a slate of new board members at Kohl’s because Kohl’s board and leadership “spent another year materially mismanaging the business.” Private equity firms also made buyout offers for Kohl’s, which the company rejected.\n\nTo fight off pressure, Kohl’s last week laid out plans for a “complete reinvention of our business model and our brand” at an investor day.\n\nKohl’s said it would add Sephora mini-shops to roughly 75% of its 1,100 US stores, open 100 new locations at half the size of its traditional outlets in the next four years and increase its popular Kohl’s Cash rewards program to 7.5% on purchases, up from 5%. Kohl’s also unveiled new strategies to grow online, including self-service for pickup orders and returns.\n\n“We’re evolving our position from a department store to a more focused lifestyle concept centered around the active and casual lifestyle,” Gass said in a presentation.\n\nBut to Duskin at Macellum Advisors, the plan was “disappointing.”\n\nHe believes the strategy won’t meaningfully change how consumers see Kohl’s — and he says it’s time for a new board and, possibly, a new CEO. Kohl’s has not fully taken advantage of its stores being located away from traditional malls, which are losing foot traffic, he said, and he questions whether the investment in Sephora is worth the cost.\n\nKohl’s said last week that it has engaged with more than 20 potential buyers for the company, a sign of wide interest. Hudson’s Bay Co., the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, also is considering a bid, Axios reported Wednesday.\n\nKohl’s board has an “ongoing dialogue with potential bidders” and will measure any offers against its own “compelling standalone plan,” a spokesperson said.\n\nDuskin expects Kohl’s to accept a buyout offer, he said. “This company can easily be turned around.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/17/business/sell-by-dates-food-safety/index.html", "title": "The truth, and strategy, of food expiration dates | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nWhen you walk into a supermarket and pick up an item — anything from milk to cereal to a can of beans — you’ll likely see a little date on the package preceded by “enjoy by,” “sell by,” or a similar phrase.\n\nYou might think that date is the absolute last day that food is safe to eat. You’d be wrong. But you wouldn’t be alone in coming to that mistaken conclusion, because the system behind food label dates is an absolute mess.\n\nThere’s no national standard for how those dates should be determined, or how they must be described. Instead, there’s a patchwork system — a hodgepodge of state laws, best practices and general guidelines.\n\n“It is a complete Wild West,” said Dana Gunders, executive director of ReFed, a nonprofit trying to end food waste. And yet, “many consumers really believe that they are being told to throw the food out, or that even when they don’t make that choice, that they’re sort of breaking some rule,” she said.\n\nFor food makers, sell-by dates actually are more about protecting the brand than safety concerns, explained Andy Harig, vice president of sustainability, tax and trade at FMI, a food industry association.\n\nThe sell-by date, often referred to as the expiration date, is the company’s estimate of when a food item will taste best, its optimal date. “You want people to eat and enjoy the product when it’s at its peak, because that’s going to increase their enjoyment, [and] encourage them to buy it again,” he said.\n\nConfused about what food label dates mean? You're not alone. Wang Ying/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nThe main consequence of this unclear labeling? Food waste. Lots of it.\n\n“Consumer uncertainty about the meaning of the dates … is believed to contribute to about 20 percent of food waste in the home,” the Food and Drug Administration wrote in a 2019 post.\n\nWasted food often ends up in landfills, making it a major contributor to climate change. By some estimates, food loss and waste makes up 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nWasting food also means wasting money, which many consumers can’t afford, especially now as grocery prices soar. And food that is thrown out is diverted from food banks, where it is desperately needed.\n\nThough many companies put dates on their products, baby formula is the only food that is required to have use-by dates in the United States, said Meredith Carothers, a food safety expert with the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service.\n\nCompanies choose dates based on when they think an item tastes best. But FSIS has its own safety recommendations. Many canned goods can last on shelves for anywhere between one and five years, according to the agency, if properly stored. Under the right conditions, packages of rice and dried pasta can last about two years. The FDA offers food storage tips and guidelines on its website.\n\nBut the rules are wildly different for many perishables.\n\nWhile consuming shelf-stable items after a “best if used by date,” is likely fine, fresh meat and poultry could go bad even before the date on the label. That’s because store refrigerators tend to be colder than our home fridges, explained Carothers.\n\nOnce consumers take meat and poultry home, they should follow home-storage rules, she said. The FSIS instructs people to cook or freeze some meats within two days of bringing them home from the store.\n\nHow we got here\n\nManufacturers began printing sell-by information on products in the early 20th century. At first, the date was written in code: Retail employees had to match each code to a date using a key, but to customers the codes were incomprehensible.\n\nIn the 1970s, grocery shoppers clamored for more information about the quality of food on supermarket shelves. Under pressure from activists, including the distribution of pamphlets deciphering sell-by codes, food makers began to put dates on their labels.\n\nAt first, this “open dating” tactic appeared to be working.\n\nIn February 1973, The New York Times ran an article headlined “Food Dating is Found to Please Customers and Reduce Losses.” The piece pointed to a study conducted by the USDA and the Consumer Research Institute, a group backed by food manufacturers, which concluded that open dating had slashed by half the number of consumer complaints of purchasing stale or spoiled food.\n\nFood manufactures started sharing sell-by dates with consumers about 50 years ago. Bebeto Matthews/AP\n\nBut by the end of the decade, those examining the system were less convinced of its merits.\n\nA 1979 study by the now-defunct Office of Technology Assessment noted that open dating may not have been the right way to quell consumer fears.\n\n“There is little evidence to support or to negate the contention that there is a direct relationship between open shelf-life dating and the actual freshness of food,” the study found.\n\nThere’s no way to “accurately determine dates for various products, no consensus on which type of date or dates … to use for which product, or even which products to date at all, and no real guidelines as to how to display the date,” the report’s authors wrote.\n\nDecades later, we’re still in the same boat. “​​There are no uniform or universally accepted descriptions used on food labels for open dating in the United States,” according to the USDA’s current guidance.\n\nThe FDA said that manufacturers can’t place false or misleading information on labels, but that “they are not required to obtain agency approval of the voluntary quality-based date labels they use or specify how they arrived at the date they’ve applied.” Carothers, from the FSIS, reiterated that dates can be applied as long as they don’t mislead customers and comply with the service’s labeling regulations.\n\nWhere we go next: The sniff test\n\nTo avoid food waste, some advocates encourage people to rely on their senses when determining whether certain foods are safe to eat.\n\nThe British retailer Morrisons said early this year that it is removing “sell by” dates from some of its branded milk, switching instead to “best before” dates and encouraging customers to decide whether to discard the product based on how it looks and smells.\n\nMorrisons offered these guidelines to consumers: if it looks curdled or smells sour, ditch it. If it looks and smells okay, you can consume it even after the date.\n\nMorrisons said this year that it is eliminating dates from its branded milks in some markets. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“When food is decayed past the point where we’d want to eat it, our defenses work very well,” said ReFed’s Gunders. “If food doesn’t look good, if it doesn’t smell good, if it doesn’t taste good, if it’s slimy … then absolutely, we should not eat that food.”\n\nIn general, Gunders recommended that those who are concerned about food safety remain strict about consuming food before the sell-by date if it has a “higher potential to carry listeria.” One way to identify those items? They’re the foods that pregnant women are told to stay away from, she said.\n\nAnother way to prevent confusion, experts say, is to regulate the language used to describe these dates.\n\n“Best by” versus “Use by”\n\nThe Food Date Labeling Act of 2021, introduced in December of last year, wants manufacturers to use “use by,” or “best if used by” only before dates on labels. The bill is the latest in a series of legislative efforts to make a national labeling standard.\n\nHere’s the logic: Companies that decide to put a date on labels have to make clear to consumers whether the item is potentially unsafe after that date, or if it just tastes a little off. If it’s a safety issue, they have to use “use by.” If it’s about food quality, “best if used by” is the way to go.\n\nGunders and agencies like the FDA and USDA point to this label harmonization as a good solution. Many companies have already made the transition.\n\nDel Monte, which sells canned fruits and vegetables among other products, uses “best if used by.” In an email, the company explained that the dates “are a guideline.” Dole, which has dates on its packaged salads, also uses the “best if used by” label.\n\nEven if the bill becomes law and all companies make the same changes, there will still be a missing piece of the puzzle: Alerting consumers to the shift and what it means.\n\nAfter all, consumers who pick up an item today won’t necessarily know that “use by” is distinct from “best if used by,” or if either of those are different from something like “enjoy by,” or “sell by.”\n\nTo make the dates clearer to the public, there needs to be a “consistent and engaged effort to help consumers think through this,” said FMI’s Harig. “I think it’s going to take some work to figure it out.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/health/why-does-coffee-make-you-poop-wellness/index.html", "title": "Why does coffee make you poop? At least 2 reasons | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor some people, coffee jump-starts their bowel movements in addition to their energy.\n\nDespite the drink’s popularity, there isn’t a lot of research on why coffee sends many people running to the bathroom within minutes of consuming it.\n\n“In some cases, as with coffee and bowel movements, there likely just hasn’t been the medical demand to merit serious investigation,” Dr. Kyle Staller, director of the Gastrointestinal Motility Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital, said via email.\n\n“It may also be a case of obviousness, meaning it doesn’t take multiple studies to know that coffee induces bowel movements when it’s such a part of many people’s daily lives.”\n\nCoffee's effect on colon activity might have more to do with special compounds than just caffeine. Alberto Mier/CNN\n\nThere just might be something special about coffee, and the research that exists proves “that patients are right,” said Staller, also an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Some small studies have shown that drinking coffee was more effective than warm water at inducing bowel movements – that’s saying something since “water is an integral part of normal digestion with large amounts being released and reabsorbed by your digestive tract every day,” he said.\n\nThis of course doesn’t mean that adequate water intake isn’t essential for your overall health. “About 60% of your body is made of water,” Jerlyn Jones, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, said via email.\n\nAnd whether the coffee’s caffeinated or decaffeinated doesn’t seem to matter in all studies, according to other research – suggesting that, in some cases, coffee compounds besides caffeine might be responsible for sudden bowel movements.\n\nThe identities of these compounds and how they might interact with the digestive tract are still largely unknown, but here’s what researchers have discovered so far.\n\nCoffee might cause colon contractions\n\nThe colon experiences three types of contractions that work together to mix, knead and ultimately eject poop. The occurrence, timing and frequency of these contractions are influenced by muscular, neural and chemical factors.\n\nCoffee might stimulate this colonic motor activity within minutes of consuming it, based on the limited available research, Staller said. Twelve healthy people experienced this activity during a 1998 study when they agreed to have a sensor probe inserted into their colons. Over a 10-hour period the next day, the participants consumed warm coffee, decaf coffee, water or a meal in random order. Both types of coffee and a meal caused more colon contractions and pressure, compared with water. Caffeinated coffee was 60% more effective than water at stimulating colonic motor activity and 23% more impactful than decaf.\n\nMultiple participants of another study said drinking coffee gave them the urge to poop, then went through a similar test. Their colon activity increased within four minutes of drinking unsweetened black coffee, an effect that lasted at least 30 minutes.\n\nThose results likely mean that coffee isn’t directly contacting the colon’s lining but rather affecting it through a “gastrocolic mechanism,” Staller said – meaning coffee contacting “the stomach lining triggers either a nervous system or hormonal response that causes the colon to start contracting,” he said. “Colon contractions move stool in the colon toward the rectum and voila – you have the urge to have a bowel movement.”\n\nMelanoidins – compounds formed during coffee roasting – have dietary fiber, which helps digestion and prevents constipation, Jones said.\n\nIt might affect hormones and stomach acid\n\nCoffee appears to also stimulate release of the hormone gastrin, Staller said, which enables production of gastric acid (stomach acid). Gastric acid helps digest food and might urge colonic activity. Researchers discovered in 1986 that drinking caffeinated or decaf coffee affected gastrin levels quickly and significantly.\n\nAfter fasting overnight, men in a small 2009 study received either a meal and black coffee, or just a meal. Drinking coffee significantly sped up the time it took for food to leave the stomach and enter the small intestine after the mealtimes.\n\n“Some compounds in coffee may also interact with the opioid receptors in the GI tract,” which affect bowel function, Staller added.\n\nDairy and digestive health\n\nIf you’re lactose intolerant yet still enjoy dairy creamer with a side of coffee, the creamer could be the culprit behind any sudden urges to poop.\n\n“One way to find out what is making you go to the bathroom is to drink coffee without dairy creamer or milk and track your symptoms for a few days,” Jones said.\n\nWhile research does suggest some digestive benefits of drinking coffee, should your regular morning coffee be what you use to stay regular? If you’re constipated, drinking coffee to help move things along isn’t unreasonable, Staller said.\n\n“But don’t rely on it to move your bowels,” Jones said. “Speak to your medical doctor if you are having problems going to the bathroom regularly.”\n\nJones recommended slowly increasing your dietary fiber intake “with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds.” “The average American adult consumes only 12 to 14 grams of fiber a day and the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day for adults.”\n\nPeople prone to having loose or urgent bowel movements “may want to consider that coffee can be a trigger for those unpleasant events as well,” Staller said.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/14/business/outback-steakhouse-restaurant-redesign/index.html", "title": "Here's what the Outback Steakhouse of the future looks like | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nOutback Steakhouses of the future won’t be nearly as expansive as the outback itself.\n\nLike many casual dining chains, Outback is pivoting toward a post-pandemic future in which delivery and takeout orders are increasingly important to the bottom line. So the chain, known for its Bloomin’ Onions and steaks, is reducing the size of its restaurants by 17% to clock in at about 5,000 square feet.\n\nThese new and more compact locations will include smaller kitchens and expanded pickup areas for takeout and delivery.\n\n“Outback is a 34-year-old brand with a fairly large national footprint,” Brett Patterson, president of Outback Steakhouse, said in an interview with CNN Business. “The brand resonates fairly well in smaller markets, but in order to continue to grow we wanted a more approachable prototype.”\n\nThe dining room has been given a fresh design. Outback Steakhouse\n\nThe chain’s owner, Bloomin’ Brands (BLMN), said in its most recent earnings report that off-premise sales — meaning takeout and delivery — made up 29% of Outback’s revenue in the fourth quarter, nearly double the last three months of 2019. The brand’s delivery partnership with DoorDash in 2019 proved “very fortunate during the pandemic,” Patterson said, adding that delivery is here to stay: “The consumer isn’t going back to how they behaved a few years ago.”\n\nAnd that is what’s informing Outback’s rethinking of its restaurants. The new locations have a dedicated space for pickup orders, and kitchens will include “completely new equipment” capable to better handle the increase in off-premise orders, Patterson said, including clamshell grills that let kitchen staff cook steaks in half the time.\n\nAs for diners, one of the biggest aesthetic changes they’ll see is the bar: Once a horse shoe-shape in the center of the restaurant, the new bars have been pushed back against the wall. Patterson said they comprise about 70% of seats compared to the previous bar layout, but are still a “focal point” because of a freshened up design and visibility from the entrance.\n\nThe new bar at the Outback. Outback Steakhouse\n\nOutback also conducted a “table efficiency study” and discovered that it needed fewer four-top tables, so the chain swapped them out for additional two-top tables while still seating the same number of customers — 187 — as before. Smaller-format restaurants can also help Outback expand into cities where real estate is more expensive. Patterson said the brand is eying further expansion in Texas and the Southeast.\n\nSo far, four redesigned restaurants have opened in Texas, North Carolina and Ohio, and Outback aims to add between 75 to 100 new restaurants in coming years. The planned growth follows a decade of decline, as the number of its US locations has dropped 10% from 775 to 694, according to restaurant consulting firm Technomic.\n\n“In the next few years, you’ll see significantly more growth than in 2022,” Patterson said.\n\nOutback’s resurgence comes after several quarters of positive results, with sales up 9.2% in its most recent quarter. That follows the success of other big chains, which have fared a lot better than small restaurants and independents, thanks in large part to easier access to cash and the ability to lean on parent companies to lead the way on strategic shifts.\n\nIn 2021, the top 500 restaurant chains accounted for 63% of total US restaurant sales, up from 58% in 2019, Technomic said.", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food-dining/2023/01/16/is-chipotle-healthy/10435662002/", "title": "Is Chipotle healthy? A closer look at what's inside menu items.", "text": "From 2013-2016, just over 36% of adults consumed fast food on a given day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rise of \"fast casual,\" however, changed the price tag, style and meaning of “fast food.”\n\nBoasting burritos with swanky names, plant-based options and salad bars, fast casual restaurants doubled in sales and location between 2009 and 2018. Chipotle CEO Steve Ells opened his first location in 1993, a modest burrito shop, but by 2017 the chain had almost 2,300 locations.\n\nThis changing landscape also meant a new scale for “healthy” and “unhealthy” to-go food.\n\nIs Chipotle healthy?\n\nSodium is likely the biggest threat to healthy eating at Chipotle. A flour tortilla itself has about 600 milligrams of sodium, and Chipotle's meat options range from 310-560 milligrams. Your sodium intake can easily add up with just a burrito order, ticking toward the FDA's recommended maximum of 2,300 milligrams sodium per day. A McDonald's Big Mac, for comparison, contains 1,010 milligrams of sodium.\n\nBut when you look at the ingredients, Chipotle is comparatively healthier than other to-go options. While a fully loaded burrito might land you at over half of the FDA’s recommended daily 2,000 calories, there are easy ways to customize and lessen your portions.\n\nChipotle’s build-your-own operation means that any menu item can be relatively healthy if done right. Your meal can range from a fully loaded burrito bowl to the equivalent of a salad.\n\nTwo of the key parts of eating healthy are fresh ingredients and moderation. When it comes to the latter, moderation is always in style at Chipotle, and there’s plenty of room to get your veggies, protein and flavor in whatever quantities you choose.\n\nChipotle also lists the 53 ingredients used to make every item on the menu, committing to “preparing real food made with real ingredients.” They describe each ingredient and list the menu items it appears in.\n\nCultured cream, for example, is a “rather literal term that alludes to the process of fermenting cream that’s been purposely thickened and mildly soured over time.” You can find it in Chipotle’s queso and sour cream. Gypsum is used in the tofu that makes Chipotle’s sofritas, and, according to the restaurant, is one of the only ingredients that “doesn’t start on a farm or ranch.” Gypsum is a mineral added to soy milk to separate curds and whey.\n\nThey also list the oils they use in cooking, such as rice bran and canola oil, and exactly why they use them. Rice bran oil has a high smoke point and versatile, mild taste for everything from rice to vinaigrette, and canola oil is used to make tortillas. According to Healthline, rice bran oil is a good source of unsaturated fats and Vitamin E.\n\nThere are certainly items on Chipotle’s menu that aren’t as healthy as others. For example, one might argue its queso (a large helping has 980 milligrams of sodium) and guacamole is better consumed in moderation than a daily diet staple. It also depends on what you consider “healthy.” The definition of healthy eating depends on your height, weight, sex and lifestyle.\n\nWhat is the healthiest fast food?:Look out for this type of menu\n\nIs Chipotle considered fast food?\n\nWith short wait times for orders, drive-thrus and assembly-style service, the line between fast food and the newly dubbed “fast casual” has become increasingly difficult to spot.\n\nWhile fast food restaurants often include dollar deals, late night hours and drive throughs, fast casual restaurants are a bit more upscale. Your meal very well may cost you into the double digits and you can expect to see signs advertising the “realness” or “wholeness” of the food you’re about to consume. These fast casual chains, like Chipotle, Sweetgreen and Panera, are one step above McDonald’s and Dunkin’, but a bit more casual than, say, Olive Garden or Buffalo Wild Wings.\n\nChipotle fits squarely in the fast casual category. You’re not expected to sit down and eat your meal, but a curated ambiance and a front row seat into the making of your burrito bowl feels a bit more personalized than fries thrown haphazardly into a brown paper bag.\n\nWhat is the healthiest thing to eat at Chipotle?\n\nLifestyle bowls are arguably Chipotle's healthiest menu item. These bowls are catered to dietary goals and restrictions, offering options for those partaking in Whole30, keto or paleo diets by skipping out on the grains. There are also high protein, vegan and vegetarian options.\n\nBut there's a way to customize other meals to tailor them to your healthy eating desires. Let’s say your normal order is a burrito bowl with chicken, white rice, black beans, tomato salsa, fajita veggies, sour cream and cheese. According to Chipotle’s nutrition calculator, your meal is going to be approximately 785 calories and contain 30 grams of fat, 53 grams of protein and 74 grams of carbs.\n\nBut change any of the toppings or adjust your existing ones from “normal” portion sizes to “light” or “extra” and you’ll see the calculated answer change as well.\n\nChipotle’s personalized nutrition calculator makes it easy to adjust your order to whatever “healthy” looks like to you. There’s also an option for nutrition preferences, where you can filter for plant-based options, find the best options for Whole30 or keto diets or avoid dairy.\n\nWhich rice is healthier?:What to know about white rice vs. brown rice\n\nDiscover more health tips for your daily diet:\n\nJust Curious for more?

Some of their descendants are known today as the Muscogee, the Creek and the Apalachicola Band from Tulwa Thakko.\n\nWhite settlers pushed most of the Muscogees out west, and others who escaped to the south are today known as the Florida Seminole.\n\nPlanters drove Muscogees out of their home – their “Garden of Eden,” as one elder described it – to plant cotton on the fields that had been cultivated for centuries for corn and squash.\n\nFor 200 years, the Muscogee Nation has lived in Oklahoma. The federally recognized tribe is made up of the descendants of the Indigenous groups who lived in the South, including Tallahassee. Generations of Muscogee Nation members have been born in the colder climate of Oklahoma since 1824, when Tallahassee was established as the capital of the then-territory.\n\nOn March 4, Tallahassee will celebrate its bicentennial, with \"Ambitious from the Beginning\" as its theme. But a celebration of the creation of the city represents something far different to the descendants of the Indigenous people of Florida.\n\n“It’s a zero-sum game,” said Turner Hunt, the tribal historic preservation officer for the Muscogee Nation of Oklahoma. “As Tallahassee grows, we lose.”\n\nTallahassee’s history is still on the minds of those in Oklahoma who consider the Southeastern U.S. as their ancestral home, even 200 years later.\n\n“Most people grow up knowing they’re from a culture that was removed from somewhere else,” Hunt said.\n\nCurrent archaeological research shows Tallahassee has been a population center for 14,000 years, said Sam Wilford, the deputy state archaeologist for the State of Florida.\n\n\"We should celebrate the bicentennial in terms of historical context, but as a place, it's been a place a lot longer than that,\" Wilford said.\n\nCelebrations for some, solemn reminders for others: 'The messiness of history'\n\nBefore the Spanish arrived in the 1500s, Tallahassee and the surrounding areas were inhabited by the Apalachees. It was a hierarchal community with farm lands on the exterior.\n\nTallahassee at the time was considered one of the major centers of life for the Apalachees, said Andrew Frank, a professor of Native American history at Florida State University. The council house at Mission San Luis is evidence of a large number of people living in close proximity to one another.\n\nFor about 200 years, the Apalachees were exploited by the Spanish and lived in missions or in small towns throughout the Panhandle.\n\nWhen the English arrived, they partnered with other Indigenous groups and fractured communities, raiding and capturing thousands of Florida’s Indigenous people to sell them into slavery in the Caribbean and the colonies.\n\nThose communities collapsed, but they didn’t disappear. Throughout the 1700s, the remaining people created new groups that formed connections with each other as they resisted colonialism. In this region of the South, some of the Indigenous became known as Creeks.\n\nThe history gets bloodier and lonelier for the remaining Indigenous people left in the Panhandle.\n\nThe War of 1812, the First Seminole War and the Treaty of Camp Moultrie, among other watershed events, splintered the already vulnerable Creek community, which spoke Muscogee and Hitchiti. While some were forced south to make way for cotton plantations, some of the remaining Muscogee became the Apalachicola Band.\n\nIn October of 1823, in a letter to territorial Gov. Richard Keith Call, John Lee Williams called the land in Tallahassee “first rate,” and wrote “every vegitable (sic) cultivated here is luxuriant.”\n\nWilliams wrote of where to start building, a “site shall be fixed near the old fields abandoned by the Indians after (Andrew) Jackson's invasion,” and added “the Indians I know do not intend to remove until they shall be obliged; when they do, most of them, instead of going south, will return to the upper Creeks.”\n\nHistory:An hour north of Tallahassee, Native American Creeks preserve, teach their heritage\n\nBut the old fields of corn and squash weren’t “abandoned” after the First Seminole War, said Frank.\n\n“By 1820, many Indians were returning to and rebuilding their homes in the Panhandle only to have the option taken from them,” Frank said.\n\nAfter Tallahassee was established, the U.S. continued to push members of the Muscogee Apalachicola Band to move west, and by 1840, most of the Muscogee-speaking Creeks were removed from the region.\n\nAn account by Muscogee-Creek Chief Opothle Yahola describes one of the last groups of people to move to Oklahoma, who arrived “In a deplorable situation; a good many of them are naked and have no means by which they can obtain subsistence.”\n\nFrank, who has researched Native American history for almost 30 years and has taught at FSU since 2007, said historians have uncomfortable relationships with anniversaries for this reason.\n\n“They tend to become celebrations, not moments of commemoration,” Frank said. “For lots of people, the creation of Tallahassee was not a good thing. This allowed for the expansion of slavery, it meant the removal and sometimes the eradication of Indian communities. This is not a moment of uplift, for other people it was.\"\n\n\"That's the messiness of history.”\n\nIndianhead, Apalachee Parkway and local 'signs of Americanness'\n\nWhen the Creek left Florida, they brought their names with them. There’s a Tullahassee, Oklahoma, almost 900 miles away.\n\nIn Tallahassee, Florida, Indigenous words can be seen throughout the city. The area’s landmarks, like rivers and streets, are labeled with sometimes anglicized terms for Indigenous words used for centuries.\n\nThere's Apalachee Parkway, a street named through a contest in the Tallahassee Democrat, that ends at Florida's Capitol. Chattahoochee is derived from Muscogee words that mean “painted rock.” Miccosukee Road, also spelled Mikasuki, is a Hitchiti word to describe a group of people who now live as Seminoles and Miccosukees in South Florida.\n\nAnd Tallahassee means “old town,” a designation given to this area by the Apalachees, who spoke a Muscogean language: “talla” means town, and “hassee” means old.\n\nThe juxtaposition of old and new, before 1824 and after, gets muddled in the mid-20th century.\n\nIn the late 1940s and 1950s, the United States went through a trend of naming things after Indigenous people as a way to honor Native American history. In the U.S. post World War II, westerns were one of the most popular genres at the movie theater and made up one-quarter of all the films made in the U.S.\n\n“Lots of places start using Native American motifs or names as a sign of Americanness,” Frank said.\n\nIn Tallahassee, FSU chose the Seminole as the school’s mascot in 1947. That same year, developers John and Irene Stead purchased 480 acres of property formerly known as Indianhead Plantation – for a now-unbelievable $65,000, wrote Tallahassee Democrat writer Gerald Ensley.\n\nIrene Stead worked with W.T. Cash, the first state librarian, to develop street names for what is now the Indianhead Acres neighborhood. Today, the neighborhood’s website touts the names of its streets, calling them “authentic Seminole names.”\n\nBut like sports team mascots, which can turn Native Americans into “caricatures,” the FSU professor Frank said, white Americans actually accomplished the opposite of their intent to “respect” Native American history and left them out of the conversation.\n\nEli Rowland-Chang, the language revitalization project manager for the Muscogee Nation in Oklahoma, sees shades of that in Indianhead. She said there is no Seminole language, and after reviewing Indianhead Acres’ street names she said that the words for First through Ninth Streets are wrong and backward.\n\n“It gave me a good laugh, actually,” she said.\n\nFor Second Street, just like in English, the word \"two\" and the word \"second\" aren't the same thing in Muscogee. Also, numbers are placed after nouns.\n\n\"We say 'street second.' Right now, all these roads look like they are saying 'two roads, three roads, four roads' with bad grammar,\" she said.\n\nWhile the majority of Indianhead Acres’ street names are innocuous, one street name did concern Rowland-Chang. Ohbah Nene, “owl street,” is named after an animal that many tribes consider a bad omen.\n\nFor example, in the TV show “Reservation Dogs,” the eyes of the owls in the show are blurred out.\n\n“This felt like a rather disrespectful choice to choose 'owl’ over any of the other amazing creatures found naturally in those areas,” she said.\n\nNic Zateslo, 37, grew up in Indianhead Acres and now lives on Atapha Nene, down the street from his parents. Growing up, the story he heard was that the street names were chosen by the developer's wife, who was fond of Native American culture.\n\n“It wouldn’t surprise me it wasn’t a well-thought research project,” Zateslo said. “I think it’s very interesting to know the real and true history of things.\"\n\n'We still exist': How Muscogees are represented in Tallahassee bicentennial\n\nTallahassee isn’t unique in how it has reckoned with its Indigenous history. While local leaders have memorialized the city’s Native Americans through high school mascots, street names and statues, the people of the Muscogee Nation of Oklahoma, or any Native tribe, have often not been included in preserving their culture in the U.S. until recently.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1990 that federal law provided for the protection and return of Native American human remains and sacred artifacts.\n\nFrom Oklahoma, Hunt and his staff constantly monitor construction projects in their “homelands,” he said.\n\n“We try to look at it to make sure that things aren't happening to our ancestors,” he said.\n\nHurricane Michael uncovered many culturally significant sites, including human remains, in the Florida Panhandle. The best case scenario when state archaeologists identify human remains is to work with the descendant communities to return them to their original location and rebury them.\n\nIt’s a process that can take time, Hunt said.\n\nBack in Tallahassee, the state archaeologist Wilford said artifacts are being unearthed in Florida almost on a weekly basis as the state experiences a boom in development. When the remains of Indigenous people are found, \"9.5 times out of 10\" they can be reburied.\n\nIn Tallahassee, there are mounds yet to be discovered in neighborhoods, communities built on top of homes that people lived in hundreds of years ago.\n\n\"There's history underneath your feet, I mean everywhere,\" Wilford said.\n\nSometimes when artifacts are uncovered, it spurs a reconciliation, like in Oxford, Alabama. After artifacts and remains were uncovered during a development of a local park, the city of Oxford and the Muscogee Nation started a partnership, which resulted in information about the area’s Native American history and a reconstructed ceremonial mound on the park’s site.\n\nTen years later, Oxford threw a homecoming celebration for the Muscogee Nation in 2021.\n\nAnd last year in Macon, Georgia, the Muscogee Nation’s flag flew at Macon’s City Hall. The Macon-Bibb County Commission passed a resolution that recognized “the sustained oppression, land dispossession, and involuntary removals of the Muscogee (Creek) peoples from, Macon, from Georgia and from the Southeast,” the resolution reads.\n\n“The Government of Macon-Bibb County seeks to honor the Muscogee (Creek) Nation and other Indigenous caretakers of this land by humbly seeking knowledge of their histories and committing to respectful stewardship of the land.”\n\nHunt is currently working on a side project that reconstructs what ceremonial mounds look like. In Tallahassee, the Lake Jackson Mounds are now covered with clover, grass and trees, with wooden stairs that ascend on one side. But years ago, those steep sides of green were once bright walls made of red and white clay, Hunt said.\n\nIt’s been 200 years since Tallahassee was chosen to be the capital city of Florida. Since then, well-meaning assumptions and lore have sometimes replaced the real Native American history of the Apalachicola Band from Tulwa Thakko, some of the last Indigenous people to have lived here.\n\nHunt said he wishes more people learned about Native American history. It would make life easier.\n\n“Having to start at square one every single time, like explaining to somebody ‘hey, you know, we still exist and we used to live there,’ it would be helpful if that was already understood,” he said.\n\n“We can't go back and change the past,” he added. “The only thing that we can do is build on it from here.”\n\nAnd that's what some on the city and county's bicentennial committees are trying to do.\n\nFriday, the Old Capitol opens an exhibit, \"Becoming Florida's Capital,\" showcasing the Indigenous history of the region. Historians partnered with the Seminole Tribe and the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida to bring artifacts for the public to learn about the history of Tallahassee before 1824.\n\nOn Thursday night, there was a reception at the Historic Capitol for sponsors, partnering organizations, lenders and artists that included representatives from tribes descended from those who used to live in Tallahassee.\n\nA sculpture will also be installed in Cascades Park with an inscription that alludes to Tallahassee's history even before the 1500s.\n\n\"For thousands of years, the land drew people in because of its natural resources and beauty,\" said Elizabeth Emmanuel, director of the Downtown Improvement Authority and a member of the Bicentennial Steering Committee.\n\n\"It's an exciting opportunity for everyone in our community to get to learn more, because its timeline is the most significant in the state's history,\" Emmanuel said. \"As a whole, I worry we don't acknowledge our history enough as a community, and I hope the bicentennial offers opportunities for the community to educate themselves.\"\n\n'Becoming Florida’s Capital' Exhibit:\n\nThe Florida Historic Capitol Museum invites the public to meet Tallahassee's Indigenous residents and explore the historical actions and power struggles that defined early Tallahassee and led to the city 'Becoming Florida’s Capital.' On display from Friday through January 5, 2025.\n\nMuseum hours: Monday - Friday: 9 a.m-4:30 p.m.; Saturdays: 10 a.m.-4:30 p.m.; Sundays and Holidays: Noon-4:30 p.m.\n\nThis story is part of TLH 200: the Gerald Ensley Bicentennial Memorial Project.

As of Sunday, Texas, Florida and California have crossed the 2 million ballot threshold, according to data from elections officials. More than 1.6 million ballots have also been cast in Georgia, where Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Democratic nominee Stacey Abrams faced off Sunday in their second and final gubernatorial debate. Separately, a top US cybersecurity official said there are no “specific or credible” threats to disrupt election infrastructure during this year’s midterms, even as the federal government remains concerned about attempts – both online and in-person – to interfere in the vote.\n\n2. Brazil\n\nLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been elected the next president of Brazil in a stunning comeback following a tight run-off race on Sunday. The 76-year-old politician’s win represents the return of the left to power in Brazil and concludes a triumphant personal victory after a series of corruption allegations led to his imprisonment for 580 days. The former leader received more than 60 million votes, the most in Brazilian history, breaking his own record from 2006. But despite the huge turnout from his supporters, he won by a razor-thin margin. According to Brazil’s electoral authority, Lula won 50.90% of the vote and his right-wing rival, incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, received 49.10%. President Joe Biden congratulated Lula saying he looks “forward to working together to continue the cooperation between our two countries in the months and years ahead.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what Lula said after narrowly beating Bolsonaro 02:16 - Source: CNN\n\n3.

On Saturday, tens of thousands of people flooded into the narrow alleys of an area in central Seoul to celebrate Halloween, but panic erupted as the crowds swelled, with some witnesses saying it became hard to breathe and impossible to move. Authorities have launched an investigation to find out how what was supposed to be a night of celebration went so horribly wrong. Official memorial altars were set up in the city today, with photos showing crowds visiting to pay their respects. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, his wife, Kim Keon-hee, and top officials – including the prime minister and Seoul mayor – joined the mourners.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter returns to Itaewon's narrow alley one day after the Halloween disaster.

Supreme Court\n\nThe conservative Supreme Court will meet today to consider whether colleges and universities can continue to take race into consideration as a factor in admissions, a case that could diminish the number of Black and Hispanic students in higher education. Challengers in the case are targeting Harvard and the University of North Carolina, arguing that their programs violate equal protection principles, dash the promise of a colorblind society, and discriminate against Asian Americans by setting higher standards for their admission. They are urging the court to overturn a nearly 60-year precedent that has allowed institutions of higher education to give limited preference to people of color and women with admissions. Affirmative action, advocates say, has afforded marginalized people a fair chance to attend colleges and universities that may have otherwise overlooked them.\n\n5. Elon Musk\n\nElon Musk, Twitter’s new owner, tweeted a conspiracy theory Sunday about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Musk, who has 112 million followers on the platform, posted a baseless article about the attack from a website that purports to be a news outlet and wrote, “There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye.” He later deleted the tweet, but not before racking up more than 28,000 retweets and 100,000 likes. Musk’s post comes amid concerns about how the billionaire will run Twitter and if misinformation and hate will be given a bigger platform on the site. It also comes as concerns are being raised that Musk’s takeover could impact the upcoming midterm elections if he makes good on his promise to restore the accounts of users who were previously banned from the platform.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What Twitter will be like under Musk 03:00 - Source: CNN\n\nQUIZ TIME\n\nBefore pumpkins, which items were used to carve jack-o’-lanterns?\n\nA.

As the sea of orange-colored items fill the autumn air, people sometimes forget one of the most sacred pumpkin traditions: carving them.\n\nWe’ve sought out some pumpkin experts who can help shed some light onpumpkin carving. From when to purchase the orange fruit — yes, a pumpkin is a fruit, more specifically a berry — to what to do with the remains, extreme pumpkin carver Tom Nardone and pumpkin farmer John Ackerman have all the answers.\n\nPurchasing the pumpkin\n\nThe hard hitting question of when to buy a pumpkin can be puzzling for some. Most people believe purchasing a pumpkin is the equivalent of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” — the time has to be just right.\n\nBut according to our pumpkin panel, it doesn’t necessarily matter when you buy your pumpkin — it’s more a matter of how you treat the pumpkin after the purchase.\n\n“Don’t leave it out in the sun, don’t toss it around when you’re bringing it home and keep them somewhere cool,” said Ackerman, co-owner of Ackerman Farms in Morton, Ill.\n\nAnother tidbit of advice for keeping your pumpkin in pristine shape is to not carve it until two to three days out from Halloween. This will keep it from rotting.\n\n“You can buy it today, or you can buy it tomorrow,” said Nardone, who also wrote “Extreme Pumpkins I” and “Extreme Pumpins II.” “It just matters when you carve it. You don’t want it to rot.”\n\nWhile the actual day of purchase isn’t the most important variable in the equation, Nardone and Ackerman pointed out that the longer you wait, the less variety you’ll have to choose from.\n\nCarving creatively\n\nThere are hundreds of types, shapes and sizes of pumpkins. So when it comes to carving them, the options are next to endless.\n\nIf you want to go with a simpler design, the typical pumpkin carving toolkits at the store will work, Nardone said. But, if you want to get a little fancier, some heavier tools may be needed.\n\n“If you want to step up your game, you can use an electric jigsaw, sculpting tools and a drywall saw,” Nardone said.\n\nAfter you have your tools ready, it’s time to carve. Most people begin by taking off the top of the pumpkin. Ackerman, however, says sometimes it works in your favor to take off the bottom.\n\n“When you take the bottom off, not the top, it doesn’t cave in as fast,” he said. “And it will rest flat.”\n\nIf you want to think outside the box, you can use Halloween candy to add some flavor to your carving. Nardone’s used Twizzlers and Cheetos for hair, beef jerky for rotted teeth and taffy for a tongue.\n\nIf you do mess up carving your pumpkin, which will happen to a lot of us, you can always “mummify it.”\n\n“Just use hockey or athletic tape to make a mummy out of the pumpkin,” Nardone said. “That’s my go-to thing, along with toothpicks to put pieces back in place.”\n\nPreserving the pumpkin\n\nIt’s no secret a pumpkin’s life doesn’t far exceed Halloween. But there are a few tricks you can try to help preserve it.\n\nIf it’s a pumpkin on the front porch, Nardone recommends using a bathroom cleaner that contains bleach to spray over the pumpkin. The bleach kills the mold and bacteria, while keeping the majority of the bugs away.\n\nAnother trick Ackerman suggested is to use petroleum jelly on the exposed-flesh areas of the pumpkin.\n\nWhen you’re involved in a more intricate pumpkin carving routine and you need to finish the design the next day, place it in a bucket of vinegar overnight. The vinegar will help keep the pieces together and will delay the rotting process.\n\nSaying goodbye to our Jack-O-Lanterns\n\nOnce a pumpkin has seen its glory days and has rotted down to the core, there isn’t much you can do with it.\n\nAckerman did suggest one possibility, though.\n\n“You can always have a delicate pumpkin ceremony and say goodbye to them,” he said jokingly. “But, of course, you can put them in the compost bin after.”\n\nEditor’s note: Every year on the Sunday after Halloween, the Mickee Faust Club in Railroad Square holds its annual family-friendly “Punk’n Chuck’n.” Bring your pumpkin at 2 p.m. on Nov. 2 and participate in the gourd-smashing contest.\n\nA look inside the pumpkin panel\n\nExtreme pumpkin carver Tom Nardone\n\nTom Nardone, 44, has been carving pumpkins for more than 10 years. His philosophy is to carve realistic pumpkins that an everyday person could re-create. This caught the attention of Penguin publishing company and he was asked to write a book. His first book “Extreme Pumpkins,” was released in 2007 and was followed by “Extreme Pumpkins II” and “Extreme Halloween.” His website, ExtremePumpkins.com, showcases his pumpkin carving ideas.\n\nPumpkin farmer John Ackerman\n\nJohn Ackerman has been a pumpkin farmer in Morton, Ill., since the early ‘80s. Morton is known for being the “Pumpkin Capital of the World,” and Ackerman’s farm is at the center of the attention. The 105-year-old family farm typically sells around 30,000 pumpkins a year. The biggest pumpkin Ackerman’s ever seen weighed in at nearly one ton. The longest pumpkin vine he’s ever grown was 75 feet long.\n\nNeed a place to buy pumpkins?\n\nWhat: The 15th Annual Havana Pumpkin Fest\n\nWhen: 8 a.m Saturday\n\nWhere: Downtown Havana\n\nCost: $2 adults, $1 children\n\nVisit: www.havanaflevents.com/pumpkin-fest.html", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/things-to-do/2018/10/04/how-louisville-jack-o-lantern-spectacular-happens/1458760002/", "title": "How 5,000 pumpkins become Louisville Jack-O-Lantern Spectacular", "text": "Extra income for dozens of Louisville artists who are now known as professional pumpkin carvers\n\nThe annual Jack-o-Lantern Spectacular attracts 75,000 visitors to Louisville for a unique family friendly event\n\nThere's magic happening in the woods behind Iroquois Amphitheater.\n\nStanding in front of a lumpy orange canvas, Louisville artist Damon Thompson dips his paintbrush into a small clear plastic cup of black ink before adding extra shading to the eyelid of a realistic portrait of the late actor Burt Reynolds.\n\nThompson works diligently, being careful to accurately capture the iconic man he is painting. And his canvas is something of a marvel, too.\n\nIt's a pumpkin.\n\nIn a warehouse located several yards up a gravel road at the edge of the Iroquois forest, faces of other famous people like Abraham Lincoln, Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein and Willie Nelson, patiently peer out into a space filled with hundreds of enormous orange squash in various degrees of transformation.\n\nThe artists have just one week to transform thousands (and thousands) of pumpkins before the sixth annual Louisville Jack-O-Lantern Spectacular opens to the public. Last year 75,000 visitors from across the United States streamed into Louisville to wander the 1/4-mile woodland path illuminated by 5,000 jack-o'-lanterns.\n\nSpectacular guide:Your complete guide to the 2018 Jack-O-Lantern Spectacular\n\nHalloween hours:Trick or treat times in Louisville and Southern Indiana\n\n\"The pumpkins really want to become what they are,\" said Mathew Sciannameo, the artistic director behind the Jack-O-Lantern Spectacular. \"By the time the carving is complete and they are placed in position along the trail, up in the trees, back in the woods and we add music, light and moving holograms — these thousands of pumpkins will have become enchanted orbs of glowing orange light.\"\n\nIf you haven't seen it, \"you have to come out and walk through this experience. It's truly indescribable,\" said Brooke Pardue, Louisville Parks Foundation president. \"It's why people come to Louisville from all over the country during the Halloween season.\"\n\nTo pull off a display of this magnitude, the Jack-O-Lantern Spectacular requires the talent of dozens of local painters, printmakers, tattoo artists, sculptors and accomplished hobbyists. Each is handpicked and hired by Paul Codieux and Travis Reckner, owners of the event company Passion for Pumpkins, and each is trained by Sciannameo.\n\nFriends since they were in grade school in Oxford, Massachusetts, Codieux, Reckner and Sciannameo start work on the pumpkin project five months in advance of opening night, which this year is set for Oct. 9.\n\nBesides Kentucky, they also produce shows in Rhode Island and Minnesota.\n\nOctober event:Your ultimate guide to the St. James Court Art Show in Old Louisville\n\n\"We start with a theme — this year it's 'Night in the Library' — then we map out where the pumpkins are going to go, how the trail will be orchestrated, what music is going to play in each part of the trail and what props we are going to build,\" said Sciannameo. \"It's all designed to transport you into that magical realm, which this year includes huge oversized books with the titles to each section you are entering written onto the cover.\"\n\nOnce the hundreds of pumpkins start to arrive at the Iroquois warehouse in September, so do dozens of local artists.\n\n\"We look for people who have a background in art and an eye for detail,\" Sciannameo said. \"It's kind of a like a baseball team. We let people come in and push the ink around on the pumpkin and see if they like it and can adapt to working on a pumpkin and from there, it kind of weeds itself out.\"\n\nThompson, who was finishing up his Burt Reynolds pumpkin in early October, was hired by Jack-O-Lantern Spectacular four years ago.\n\n\"I have three kids so I really look forward to this work every year,\" he said.

So it’s not surprising that there are many misconceptions about its traditions, origins and meaning. Here are some of the most common.\n\n1. Beware of razor blades in candy apples.\n\nPolice in Denver this year are warning parents about the prospect of pot-infused candy. “We advise that you should thoroughly check your children’s candy,” the department posted on its Facebook page, “and not just for homemade, opened, or suspicious items, but also for any marijuana edibles that look eerily close to mainstream candies kids eat every day.”\n\nThis is just the latest iteration of a perennial concern. A 2011 Harris Interactive poll found that 24 percent of parents were fearful that their children might be poisoned by tampered-with or spoiled treats. In fact there is little, if any, evidence that this has ever happened.\n\nJoel Best, a sociology and criminal justice professor at the University of Delaware, has examined reports of “Halloween sadism” going back as far as 1958. “I have been unable to find a substantiated report of a child being killed or seriously injured by a contaminated treat picked up in the course of trick-or-treating,” Best writes. There have been examples of product tampering, but not related to Halloween. And there was one 1974 death blamed on poisoned Pixy Stix — though the 8-year-old Texas boy was actually murdered by his father, who was trying to cash in on his son’s life insurance. Other reports of Halloween sadism have turned out to be hoaxes or have had more benign explanations.\n\nWhile it should be reassuring to know that contaminated candy falls squarely into the category of urban legend, it’s a sad commentary on our society that homemade treats are considered suspicious and only mass-produced candy bars are seen as safe.\n\n2. Halloween is a quintessentially American holiday.\n\nTraditions focused on accumulation and consumption may seem very American, and certainly an American-style Halloween has evolved. But the origins of the holiday can be traced back to a pre-Christian Celtic festival called Samhain (pronounced “SAH-wen”). For the Celts, Nov. 1 marked the end of the harvest and the beginning of the new year. They believed that the souls of the dead mingled among the living at that time. And so they associated the fruits of the harvest with death, the afterlife and the supernatural.\n\nLater, after St. Patrick and other missionaries converted Ireland to Christianity, Nov. 1 became All Saints’ Day, or All Hallows Day, and the eve of All Hallows became known as Halloween. It featured feasts, the blessing of the hearth, and the lighting of candles and bonfires to welcome wandering souls. It was and remains a family celebration in Ireland.\n\nFew early American settlers observed Halloween. It was Irish immigrants in the 19th century who were responsible for bringing many Halloween customs to the United States.\n\n3. Halloween is Satanic.\n\nThis is a concern especially for some evangelical Christians. “Halloween is a festival for demonic spirits,” Pat Robertson said this month. “The whole idea of trick-or-treating is the druids would go to somebody’s house and ask for money, and if they didn’t get money, they’d kill one of their sheep. I mean, that was the trick. So it was serious stuff. And all this business about goblins and jack-o’-lanterns and all that all comes out of demonic rituals of the druids and the people who lived in England at that particular time.”\n\nActually, the devil wasn’t part of the Samhain festival celebrated by the Celts — or the druids, who made up their priestly caste. They made sacrifices in honor of the dead, but those sacrifices more often took the form of burned crops rather than animals. Contrary to some accounts, there was no human sacrifice.\n\nIt was only when the Catholic Church tried to supplant Samhain and other native holidays that the church branded practitioners of rival religions as devil-worshippers. Beliefs in the wandering dead persisted, but the supernatural beings honored by the Celts became associated with evil. And the Celtic underworld became associated with the Christian hell.\n\nYes, devils remain a symbol of Halloween — and you may see a few of them scurrying from door to door. But Halloween is a time when people project their fears in a safe and playful way. When else will you see images of death on suburban lawns?\n\n4. Trick-or-treating has long been a central feature of Halloween.\n\nWearing costumes and demanding treats can also be traced to the Celtic period and the first few centuries of the Christian era, when food and drink were left out to placate wandering souls, fairies, witches and demons. As the centuries wore on, people began dressing like these creatures, performing antics in exchange for food and drink. By the Middle Ages, masked solicitations were associated with All Souls’ Day and other holidays in countries influenced by Catholicism.\n\nBut, according to folklorist Tad Tuleja, trick-or-treating did not descend directly from those traditions. By his account, the practice as we know it in the United States is largely a product of an effort by local governments and businesses in the 1930s and ‘40s to promote an alternative to pranking and the rowdier aspects of Halloween. “Trick or treat has gradually replaced buggy stealing as the ‘appropriate’ way for children to enjoy the holiday,” he writes.\n\nIndeed, early descriptions of Halloween in the United States generally don’t reference any activities that resemble knocking on doors to ask for treats. The practice became ubiquitous, however, in the post-World War II years, after the lifting of sugar rations and as suburbanization made going from house to house easier than when people lived far from their neighbors.\n\n5. You can’t have Halloween without pumpkins.\n\nIn Ireland and Scotland, jack-o’-lanterns have traditionally been made out of large turnips. They are hollowed out, carved with a face, carried as lanterns and set in spooky places, such as graveyards. European settlers first encountered the pumpkin in the New World. Because it is already hollow, it is much easier to carve. So pumpkins replaced turnips in America.\n\nWhy have a jack-o’-lantern at all? The symbolism goes back to an old European folk tale. A blacksmith named Jack scoffed at Saint Peter and tricked the devil, and so was denied entrance to both heaven and hell. He scooped up a coal from the embers of hell in a turnip and uses it to light his way as he wanders, endlessly, between two worlds.\n\nSo the jack-o’-lantern symbolizes a marginal creature, a trickster, dangerous but fascinating, like so much else in this ancient and modern tradition of Halloween.\n\nSantino is a folklorist at Bowling Green State University. His books include “The Hallowed Eve” and “Halloween and Other Festivals of Death and Life.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/23/pumpkin-capital-world-morton-illinois/75694554007/", "title": "Pumpkins carry Morton, Illinois, to the ball", "text": "MORTON, Ill. − America loses its head over pumpkins every fall. Pies, chilis, donuts, lattes, bread, beer and more, adding to a cultural flavor that's made the pumpkin a national icon ever since the headless horseman flung one at Ichabod Crane.\n\nBut there's a good chance every bite of the nation’s orange obsession has its origins in the same spot: Morton, a sleepy hollow outside Peoria that touts itself as the pumpkin capital of the world.\n\nThere seems to be no squashing that claim. Morton was built around a pumpkin factory that caters to most of the U.S. canned pumpkin demand. The factory has processed nearly 2 million tons of pumpkins over the past 16 years alone, according to factory spokesperson Olivia Jones. That's around 250 million pounds annually.\n\n“We’re all about pumpkins here,” says Jeff Kaufman, the mayor of Morton, standing beside a carriage-size pumpkin-themed jungle gym on Main Street. “Pumpkins built the city. It all started from the pumpkins, that’s what put Morton on the map.”\n\nTowns from Texas to California make similar claims for the pumpkin crown but data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture supports the Illinois town’s claim to the title. Illinois produces the most pumpkins of any state by far, harvesting twice as many acres as any other state and significantly more pounds per acre, according to federal data.\n\nMany here are as enthusiastic about the autumnal fruit as its country pumpkin mayor. A wealth of pies and jack-o’-lanterns have made the town more than just a landmark of Americana. Pumpkins have given Morton a prosperous foundation that many struggling small towns would love to carve out for themselves.\n\nMorton embraces the pumpkin for its role in building the town. The annual Pumpkin Festival has been the event of the year since 1967; local diners and coffee shops sell pumpkin-flavored dishes year-round; and people savor the aroma of pumpkins cooking at the factory as the sweet smell of success.\n\nThe Pumpkin Festival has made the small town a destination for Midwesterners. It draws an estimated crowd of 75,000 people, over four times the population of Morton itself.\n\nBut the factory puts a slice of Morton into the homes of Americans nationwide, even if pie-eaters don’t know it.\n\n“Chances are when you have your pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving it came from right here in Morton, Illinois,” Kaufman says.\n\n‘It was a bloodbath’: How pumpkins saved Morton farmers\n\nJohn Ackerman is a beloved local farmer with a gleaming bald pate that catches the sun like a waxy gourd.\n\nHis eyes light up when talking about pumpkins, especially the endless varieties grown at his farm a mile outside downtown Morton. He picks his crop off hay bales like a sommelier pulling vintages from a wine cellar, identifying each pumpkin's traits, name and origin.\n\n“La estrella” he says, holding up a mottled green gourd. “That’s a favorite with pumpkin throwers.”\n\nHe holds up another with leathery skin. “Jarrahdale,” he says. “Not so good for carving, but great for a savory soup.”\n\nPumpkins saved the Ackerman family farm.\n\nThe 63-year-old lives in the same house his great-granddad helped build, tilling the same fields his father worked. Decades ago, the crops were mainly corn, oat, and wheat. When Ackerman picked up the family trade in the ‘80s, the local farming industry was in crisis.\n\n“It was a blood bath,” Ackerman said, recalling how many farmers sold their land or even committed suicide as drought and inflation cut down mom-and-pop farms.\n\nAckerman grew pumpkins in a desperate attempt to find some crop to carry him through hard times. He made a festive display for passing cars and drivers began stopping to ask how much for the jack-o’-lanterns. He added new varieties. One day a woman bought four of “the ugliest pumpkins” she said she'd ever seen, apparently just as novelty items of sorts.\n\nHe knew he had struck orange gold. The world wanted his pumpkins. Eat your heart out, Great Pumpkin.\n\nToday, Ackerman sells over 160 varieties of pumpkin and winter squash and sources seeds from “every continent but Antarctica,” he says.\n\n“That makes a good stacker,” he says, pointing out a round cushion-shaped white pumpkin.\n\n“Chicago Warted Hubbard,” he pronounces, holding a knotted black gourd that looks like it was blown out of a volcano into a dumpster.\n\nAckerman and his crew pick around 30,000 gourds by hand every harvest, planted over 30 acres. The farm also grows pumpkins for the canning factory.\n\nSmashing pumpkin records\n\nThe canning factory that made modern Morton sits near downtown where a sign framed by a giant pumpkin declares “Nestle welcomes you to Morton. Home of Libby’s pumpkin.”\n\nLibby’s opened the factory in 1925 and began processing pumpkin exclusively in the 1970s around when Nestle bought the company, according to Morton Public Library Director Alissa Williams.\n\nThe factory’s output grew tremendously in the intervening decades. Libby’s cans about 120,000 tons of pumpkin annually, according to Olivia Jones, a Nestle spokesperson.\n\nA constant stream of trucks carrying shipping containers full of canning pumpkins keep the intersection where the factory sits busy throughout the August through October harvest season.\n\nThe pumpkins they carry are paler and more oblong than a typical jack-o’-lantern, like faded waterlogged footballs. They come exclusively from farms within 100 miles of the factory, according to Jones. Libby’s says factory workers can the pumpkins within 24 hours of harvesting.\n\nThe factory’s success prompted Illinois Gov. Jim Thompson to declare Morton the “Pumpkin Capital of the World” in 1978.\n\nMorton's own perfect pumpkin tradition\n\nKeli Wagner, another native of pumpkin town, has an answer ready when asked what’s the perfect pumpkin, down to the exact measurements.\n\n“About 12 inches, perfectly orange, round, no lumps,” says Wagner, adding it’s the perfect size for carving. “I’ve been shopping for pumpkins for too long.”\n\nThe self-avowed pumpkin head is wearing a sweatshirt that reads “It’s Pumpkin Season” and until recently ran a vintage boutique offering specialty findings from the early years of the pumpkin festival.\n\n“You can get away with wearing a pumpkin shirt all year round in Morton,” she says.\n\nBut the gourd-hearted woman reconsiders her answer after a moment. The perfect pumpkin would have to be her first pumpkin, which in Morton speak, means her daughter, Jayci.\n\nIt’s become a tradition in the small town, Wagner says, for new parents to get baby clothes reading things like “My First Pumpkin.”\n\n“You don’t just have your first kid,” she says, “you have your first little pumpkin if you're from Morton.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/door-co/life/2023/10/23/heres-your-halloween-events-and-trick-or-treat-times-in-door-county-2023/71214114007/", "title": "Here's your Halloween events and trick-or-treat times in Door County", "text": "DOOR COUNTY - Costume up, get treats.\n\nIt's Halloween this coming week, with all the parties, special events and trick-or-treating for kids — and adults and pets — dressed as superheroes, athletes, celebrities, animals, monsters and other characters across Door County.

For next year's show, I they name Tiffany Haddish to host the show.\n\nThe breakout star from \"Girl's Trip\" was a near Oscar contender for supporting actress, and was hilarious when announcing the award nominations in January.\n\nDuring the show she did not disappoint, asking Meryl Streep to be her mom.\n\ncshoup@gannett.com\n\n419-334-1035\n\nTwitter: @CraigShoupNH", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/gopensacola/movies/2016/06/05/pick-your-flicks-saenger-theatres-summer-series/85294342/", "title": "Pick your flicks for the Saenger Theatre's Summer Series", "text": "Julio Diaz\n\njdiaz@pnj.com\n\nSummer time is movie time, and at the Saenger Theatre, that means a full slate of classic movies on Saturday nights.\n\nThe PNJ is once again teaming with the Saenger to present a survey so that YOU can choose this year's films for the Saenger Theatre Summer Classic Movie Series.\n\nThe series, which will run on Saturdays from July 16 through Sept. 17, will feature 10 classic movies chosen from the list of 28 below, with selections encompassing some of Hollywood's most treasured classics and iconic stars and characters across all genres.\n\nThe survey will be open for one week — through June 12 — and we'll announce the featured films June 18.\n\nThese inexpensive screenings — tickets are $5 per show — continue to be a big draw with viewers of all ages.

Over the years, while movies like \"Titanic,\" \"Ben-Hur\" and the original \"West Side Story\" went home with rafts of prizes, the Academy has whiffed on some heavy hitters. Maybe it was the competition or perhaps it was that year's voting bloc, but there are stone-cold classics that missed out on trophies entirely.\n\nHere are the 10 best movies of that bunch, the Oscar losers if you will, that got nominated and deserved far better:\n\n1. 'The Great Dictator' (1940)\n\nSilent-movie star and director Charlie Chaplin's first sound film was this superb political satire where Chaplin pulls double duty onscreen, as an antisemitic fascist leader and his Jewish barber lookalike. Timing might have been everything with his Hitler parody: Chaplin was beat by Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rebecca\" for best picture and Jimmy Stewart (\"The Philadelphia Story\") for best actor, in a ceremony held less than 10 months before Pearl Harbor.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n2. 'It’s a Wonderful Life' (1946)\n\nFrank Capra's Christmas movie classic is many people's favorite movie, with Jimmy Stewart as a man ready to end it all until he learns the world would be much worse if he'd never existed. But the Academy's fave? Not so much. \"Life\" lost four out of its five Oscar categories (including best picture, actor and director) to \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" – not a holiday staple, in case you're wondering.\n\n3. 'Seven Samurai' (1954)\n\nArguably the most influential movie on this list, Akira Kurosawa's action-packed Japanese epic gave way to \"The Magnificent Seven,\" \"Star Wars\" and many others in terms of themes, visuals and narrative. \"Samurai\" lost its two chances at the 1957 Oscars – for black-and-white art direction and costume design – and was left out of best foreign-language film the first year it became a competitive category. (Previously, one movie was chosen each year for an honorary award.)\n\n4. '12 Angry Men' (1957)\n\nLike with \"A Few Good Men,\" we find the Oscars guilty of dropping the ball on this essential courtroom drama, which featured Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman and E.G. Marshall as jurors deciding the fate of a teen charged with murder. \"Angry Men\" lost all three of its categories – best picture, director and adapted screenplay – to war picture \"The Bridge on the River Kwai,\" which to be fair was pretty darn good, too.\n\n5. 'Psycho' (1960)\n\nMaybe Academy voters were weirded out by the infamous shower scene, or simply sentimental about moms. Alfred Hitchcock's exquisitely crafted psychological chiller racked up a mere four nominations, including best director and supporting actress for Janet Leigh's hair-raising performance. It wouldn't be until three decades later that a horror movie would nab best picture (\"The Silence of the Lambs\").\n\n6. 'A Clockwork Orange' (1971)\n\nIn the annals of Oscar-less greats, Stanley Kubrick could have his own wing: \"Dr. Strangelove\" was also shut out and \"The Shining\" didn't even garner a nod. But considering that \"Orange\" initially received an X rating for its depiction of graphic violence and sexually explicit imagery, that it garnered a best picture nod at all is kind of a miracle and shows how much the film tapped into the times.\n\n7. 'Taxi Driver' (1976)\n\n\"You talking to me?\" Yep, we're talking about Martin Scorsese's gritty noir – and one of the most iconic movies of the '70s – with Robert De Niro as the unstable New York cabbie who's probably best to avoid at night. Unfortunately, it got knocked out in best picture by \"Rocky\" while De Niro and supporting actress Jodie Foster lost to \"Network\" stars Peter Finch and Beatrice Straight.\n\n8. 'Blade Runner' (1982)\n\nGranted, sci-fi movies have never exactly taken the Oscars by fire. But Steven Spielberg's \"E.T.\" won four Academy Awards the very same year as Ridley Scott's futuristic tale, which was up for best visual effects and art direction. While the adorable candy-loving alien bested Harrison Ford that time, \"Blade Runner\" ultimately became a cult classic and a beloved entry in the canon.\n\n9. 'Field of Dreams' (1989)\n\nA personal choice, but a favorite nonetheless for this discerning critic. A fantastical ode to baseball, fathers and sons, dreams (naturally) and famous ghosts in a cornfield, the Kevin Costner masterpiece lost out on three Oscars, including best picture – which somehow went to \"Driving Miss Daisy\" in a head-scratching year where \"Do the Right Thing\" and \"Glory\" didn't even make the cut.\n\n10. 'The Shawshank Redemption' (1994)\n\nBased on a Stephen King novella, the acclaimed prison drama starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins went 0-for-7 at the Oscars, with \"Forrest Gump\" reigning as best picture and Forrest himself, Tom Hanks, taking best actor over Freeman. That's OK, though, because \"Shawshank Redemption\" has captured many hearts and minds ever since as a cable-TV movie staple.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/03/24/every-oscar-best-picture-winner-ranked/7083229001/", "title": "Oscar best picture winners, ranked worst to best (All 96 films!)", "text": "Everybody has their own idea of what makes a best picture winner at the Oscars. Perhaps a biopic or a small art-house movie, or something huge in scale such as \"Dances With Wolves,\" \"Titanic\" or the latest to win the Academy Awards' top trophy, \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nWhat's pretty clear if you undertake watching all 96 (so far) films to take that vaunted prize – and it's not for the fainthearted, trust us – is that you come out of it changed. You love movies a little bit more.\n\nAs we wait another year for the newest entry to join this storied canon, here's a ranking of every best picture winner, from iffy stuff where a recount seems in order to the very best of the best.\n\n96. 'The Broadway Melody' (1928/29)\n\nThe second best picture winner, it's a musical dud with vaudevillian sisters and romantic malarkey that could have won worst picture, too.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n95. 'Crash' (2005)\n\nA mess of interwoven stories centered on social and xenophobic tensions in LA, it has a good cast (Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle) and little else.\n\n94. 'The Greatest Show on Earth' (1952)\n\nJimmy Stewart is a clown and Charlton Heston also signs up for this ostentatious and loathsome three-ring ode to P.T. Barnum’s circus.\n\n93. 'Cimarron' (1930/31)\n\nThe rocky drama about an 1800s Oklahoma family was the first Western to win the category, yet it has aged badly with unfortunate racist stereotypes.\n\n92. 'Cavalcade' (1932/33)\n\nThis sentimental tale of family, friends and servants experiencing ups and downs of life from 1899 to 1933 is like \"Downton Abbey\" but not good.\n\n91. 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989)\n\nMorgan Freeman plays a Black driver and Jessica Tandy is his elderly white charge in an emotionally manipulative dramedy made for random cable TV showings.\n\n90. 'Around the World in 80 Days' (1956)\n\nAn English dude (David Niven) travels the globe and meets colorful characters in a flighty three-hour affair. It's no \"Cannonball Run,\" though.\n\n89. 'The English Patient' (1996)\n\nThe pretentious World War II melodrama has Ralph Fiennes as a burned man, Juliette Binoche as his nurse and Kristin Scott Thomas as his already-married love.\n\n88. 'Out of Africa' (1985)\n\nMeryl Streep's married Danish writer falls for Robert Redford's big-game hunter over 160 snoozy minutes of Oscar-bait romance.\n\n87. 'Shakespeare in Love' (1998)\n\nThe biopic rom-com gone wrong finds Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) wooing the woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) who helps him write “Romeo and Juliet.\"\n\n86. 'The Great Ziegfeld' (1936)\n\nWilliam Powell plays the infamous title Broadway producer in an arduous and showy musical that is, suffice it to say, less than great.\n\n85. 'Million Dollar Baby' (2004)\n\nHilary Swank packed on muscle to play an up-and-coming boxer trained by an aging coach (director Clint Eastwood) in a film as depressing as \"Rocky\" is uplifting.\n\n84. 'How Green Was My Valley' (1941)\n\nOne of the Oscars' greatest unsolved mysteries is how this maudlin Welsh family coal drama upset \"Citizen Kane.\"\n\n83. 'Chariots of Fire' (1981)\n\nVangelis' catchy theme is the most memorable aspect of this emotionally deep but sluggish British sports drama that follows runners racing toward the 1924 Paris Olympics.\n\n82. 'Green Book' (2018)\n\nMahershala Ali plays a Black pianist touring the Jim Crow South and Viggo Mortensen is his uncouth driver in a feel-good film about race relations with a whitewashed perspective.\n\n81. 'Gentleman’s Agreement' (1947)\n\nGregory Peck stars as a journalist who pretends to be Jewish for a story on antisemitism, which probably sounded like a better idea in 1947.\n\n80. 'Tom Jones' (1963)\n\nThe courtly British comedy finds Albert Finney embracing saucy adventures and getting into swordfights as a squire cast out of his kingdom.\n\n79. 'Grand Hotel' (1931/32)\n\nThe episodic drama peeks at the various goings-on at a swanky Berlin hotel, like the budding relationship of a Russian ballerina (Greta Garbo) and jewelry-heisting gambler (John Barrymore).\n\n78. 'Slumdog Millionaire' (2008)\n\nDev Patel's orphan rises from the slums to win the Indian “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" but a Bollywood song-and-dance number botches the satisfying ending.\n\n77. 'The Lost Weekend' (1945)\n\nBilly Wilder's bracing, noir-ish exploration of alcoholism features Ray Milland as a writer whose life devolves into a desperate hunt for his next drink over several harrowing days.\n\n76. 'Forrest Gump' (1994)\n\nThe title character’s fanciful jaunt through American history veers schmaltzy, so thank goodness for Tom Hanks imbuing Gump with an enduring charm.\n\n75. 'Marty' (1955)\n\nOne of Hollywood’s great character actors, Ernest Borgnine is outstanding as a 30-something butcher who finally finds love and doesn’t know who to do with it.\n\n74. 'The Hurt Locker' (2009)\n\nDirector Kathryn Bigelow's Iraq War thriller makes you feel the constant stress and danger faced by a military bomb-disposal unit (including Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie).\n\n73. 'American Beauty' (1999)\n\nWho could have imagined 20-plus years later that the divisive \"dancing\" plastic bag from the suburban satire would be more respected than best actor winner Kevin Spacey?\n\n72. 'Terms of Endearment' (1983)\n\nShirley MacLaine and Debra Winger are a mother and daughter with a polarized relationship, yet Jack Nicholson stands out as a roguish astronaut.\n\n71. 'Gigi' (1958)\n\nYoung courtesan wannabe Gigi (Leslie Caron) and Parisian playboy Gaston (Louis Jourdan) see each other as just friends, until romance intercedes in the musical confection.\n\n70. 'You Can’t Take It With You' (1938)\n\nFrank Capra's folksy rom-com casts Jimmy Stewart as Tony, a grounded guy from a snobby family who falls for Alice (Jean Arthur), the most normal in a clan of oddballs.\n\n69. 'Nomadland' (2020)\n\nChloe Zhao’s look at older workers in modern America combines splendid scenery with a wondrous Frances McDormand as a woman who adores life on the road.\n\n68. 'Going My Way' (1944)\n\nBing Crosby is the singingest priest you've ever seen in the musical dramedy, a tune-filled battle of wills between Crosby's young holy man and Barry Fitzgerald's elder pastor.\n\n67. 'Argo' (2012)\n\nDirector Ben Affleck also stars in the historical thriller (and a sort of salute to the movies) about the CIA using a fake sci-fi movie as a ruse to rescue diplomats during the Iran hostage crisis.\n\n66. 'The Deer Hunter' (1978)\n\nPennsylvania friends (including Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken) go off to Vietnam and face the psychological aftermath. Well made but super-duper bleak, so maybe chase it with ...\n\n65. 'Oliver!' (1968)\n\nCharles Dickens' spunky characters from \"Oliver Twist\" get a crowd-pleasing all-ages revamp courtesy of a Victorian musical that doesn't skimp on the earworming showtunes.\n\n64. 'The Best Years of Our Lives' (1946)\n\nFredric March, Dana Andrews and Harold Russell star in the drama that deals honestly with a theme of the time: World War II veterans returning home to face personal and professional struggles.\n\n63. 'Braveheart' (1995)\n\nMel Gibson's controversial stances aside, he is pretty good at making you want to put war paint on and fight for Scottish independence.\n\n62. 'Ordinary People' (1980)\n\nMary Tyler Moore veers unlikable for a change as the hard-to-please matriarch of a family shaken to its core by the death of one son and a suicide attempt by the other (Timothy Hutton).\n\n61. 'An American in Paris' (1951)\n\nGene Kelly stars as a World War II vet crushing on the French perfume girl (Leslie Caron) who's dating his singer pal (Georges Guétary). Awkward! But this one's all about the wowing 17-minute dance finale set to Gershwin's title tune.\n\n60. 'Mrs. Miniver' (1942)\n\nGreer Garson and Walter Pidgeon star as an English couple dealing with the early days of World War II in a drama that, unlike many other films on this list, was made during said war.\n\n59. 'The King’s Speech' (2010)\n\nThe sweet and inspirational story features Colin Firth as England's King George VI working through a childhood stutter to be the steady voice his country needs.\n\n58. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' (1957)\n\n“Star Wars” fans will appreciate Alec Guinness owning the screen as a World War II British colonel leading whistling, bridge-building POWs at a Japanese prison camp in Thailand.\n\n57. 'Wings' (1927/28)\n\nThe first best picture winner holds up well almost a century later. The silent film stars Charles Rogers and Richard Arlen as rival pilots in World War I who dig the same girl (Clara Bow) back home.\n\n56. 'Dances With Wolves' (1990)\n\nKevin Costner takes a break from sports movies to direct and star in the solid Western epic as a Union soldier who befriends – and fights for – a Native American tribe.\n\n55. 'The Life of Emile Zola' (1937)\n\nMaybe not the most famous biopic but a quite effective one, with Paul Muni as the 19th-century French writer who speaks up for a Jewish captain tagged as a traitor.\n\n54. 'All the King’s Men' (1949)\n\nThe film noir tackles the corruptive tendencies of power, with Broderick Crawford as a populist politician who rises up as a Southern governor and wields dangerous influence.\n\n53. 'A Man for All Seasons' (1966)\n\nPaul Scofield brings steady nerve to his portrayal of Sir Thomas More, the British statesman who butted heads with King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw).\n\n52. 'A Beautiful Mind' (2001)\n\nA year after winning best actor for \"Gladiator,\" Russell Crowe returned to the Oscar race with his role as John Nash, a genius on an absorbing journey of math and madness.\n\n51. 'The Last Emperor' (1987)\n\nBernardo Bertolucci was the first Italian filmmaker to win best director for the immersive historical chronicle of Chinese emperor Puyi's life, from ruling as a toddler to being imprisoned as an adult.\n\n50. 'The Shape of Water' (2017)\n\nGuillermo del Toro's beautifully unconventional romance makes you believe in the love between a voiceless janitor (Sally Hawkins) and a captured fish man (Doug Jones).\n\n49. 'Rain Man' (1988)\n\nDustin Hoffman shows up on this list a few times as part of some dynamic duos. Here, he plays a savant with autism who reconnects with his brash younger brother (Tom Cruise) on the road.\n\n48. 'Gandhi' (1982)\n\nRichard Attenborough's biopic takes on the tale of the renowned Indian leader and succeeds, primarily because of the spirit Ben Kingsley gives his title character.\n\n47. 'The Sound of Music' (1965)\n\nJulie Andrews is a nun who teaches a family of kids to sing and gallivants tunefully across Austrian mountains, while Christopher Plummer rips up a Nazi flag. They understood the assignment, as the kids say.\n\n46. 'The Artist' (2011)\n\nThe (mostly) silent film is a joyous look at Hollywood’s yesteryear, finding something special with an aging star (Jean Dujardin), an infectious ingenue (Bérénice Bejo) and a ridiculously cute pooch.\n\n45. 'Mutiny on the Bounty' (1935)\n\nClark Gable looks strange without his signature mustache, yet he's a clean-shaven force of good in this watery clash as a seaman taking on Charles Laughton's cruel Captain Bligh.\n\n44. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' (2003)\n\nHobbits and Co. finally reach Mount Doom, and Peter Jackson’s massive fantasy trilogy gets its atta-boy.\n\n43. 'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' (2014)\n\nAlejandro González Iñárritu's innovative satire sets its sights on celebrity, family and movie superheroes, with a gonzo Michael Keaton in one of his greatest roles.\n\n42. 'Oppenheimer' (2024)\n\nChristopher Nolan tackles the creation of the atomic bomb in blistering fashion, and the work of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) unfolds as both scientific feat and all-time cautionary tale.\n\n41. 'Rebecca' (1940)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock's lone entry on this list is a fitting psychological head trip, with Joan Fontaine playing the new wife of an aristocrat (Laurence Olivier) who can't escape the seemingly constant presence of his dead wife.\n\n40. 'Patton' (1970)\n\nGeorge C. Scott embodies Gen. George S. Patton as a tough leader on the battlefield and a larger-than-life speaker, especially the opening monologue in front of a flag that's a classic Hollywood moment.\n\n39. 'No Country for Old Men' (2007)\n\nThe Coen brothers' Western-tinged thriller rounds up a posse with Josh Brolin as a Vietnam vet who finds a load of drug money and Javier Bardem as a chilling hitman.\n\n38. 'Midnight Cowboy' (1969)\n\nDustin Hoffman found another dude duo with Jon Voight as two hustlers – one a Texan sex worker, the other an ailing con man – navigating New York City’s seedier corners.\n\n37. 'Hamlet' (1948)\n\nLaurence Olivier is the peanut butter, Shakespeare’s Danish prince is the jelly, and they’re made for each other in a delicious treat doing expressionism way before “The Tragedy of Macbeth.”\n\n36. 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' (2022)\n\nThe one with the hot dog fingers! Michelle Yeoh paces the brain-melting sci-fi comedy with the heart of gold as a laundromat owner who goes from needing to fix her tax problems to saving the multiverse with awesome kung fu moves.\n\n35. 'Platoon' (1986)\n\nOliver Stone's Vietnam drama superbly depicts the horrors of war and the morals of the men involved, including Charlie Sheen as a soldier caught between ideologically different sergeants (Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger).\n\n34. 'CODA' (2021)\n\nIt's a big, warm inclusive hug of a movie, with a hearing girl (Emilia Jones) torn between the struggling fishing business run by her parents (Marlee Matlin and Oscar winner Troy Kotsur) and her own musical dreams. Have a box of tissues by your side at all times.\n\n33. 'Kramer vs. Kramer' (1979)\n\nDustin Hoffman's best pairing was with Meryl Streep, with their searing look at parenting, divorce and the effects on a child decades before “Marriage Story.\"\n\n32. 'Titanic' (1997)\n\nIn James Cameron’s blockbuster, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet gave us a doomed love story folks could (mostly) buy amid a historical disaster. (Jack totally could have fit on Rose's door, though.)\n\n31. 'Annie Hall' (1977)\n\nWoody Allen is polarizing, his best movie is not. The filmmaker's beloved comedy hilariously follows the relationship build and breakup of a comedian (Allen) and a singer (Diane Keaton).\n\n30. 'The Sting' (1973)\n\nSet to a rollicking ragtime score, the enjoyable crime caper lets Robert Redford and Paul Newman shine as con men who eye a powerful boss as their ultimate mark after the murder of a shared friend.\n\n29. 'Ben-Hur' (1959)\n\nThe chariot race rules and the action is on a biblical scale (literally!) in the epic featuring Charlton Heston as a Jewish prince enslaved on a galley ship who plots revenge on the Romans who betrayed him.\n\n28. 'Unforgiven' (1992)\n\nClint Eastwood rides tall in the director's chair, stakes his claim for best Western ever and stars as an aging farmer who returns to his outlaw ways for righteous retribution.\n\n27.

He thanks all the \"mommies\" in the house and his parents \"for not squashing my creativity when I was making really disturbing horror films or really perverted comedy films, or dressing in drag as a kid, which is a threat to nobody\" – a shot seemingly at anti-drag legislation popping up around the country.:\n\nAdds Kwan: \"There is greatness in every single person.

Please help us keep animation in the conversation,\" del Toro says, tearing up when thanking his parents. According to Netflix, del Toro becomes the first person to win best picture, best director and best animated feature Oscars.\n\n2023 Oscars:Why Cate Blanchett, Guillermo del Toro and more celebs wore blue ribbons\n\nJimmy Kimmel gets the 'Top Gun' treatment to begin the show\n\nJimmy Kimmel starts the show by being \"ejected\" out of a fighter jet by Tom Cruise and parachutes onto the Dolby Theatre stage. \"Give me a second to adjust my Danger Zone here. My Banshees are caught in my Inisherin,\" he jokes. Kimmel shouts out audiences returning to the theater to see movies and is also glad to see Nicole Kidman out of that \"abandoned AMC, where she has been held captive for two whole years now.\"\n\nThe host points out first-time nominees Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan, as well as Brendan Fraser: \"Two guys from 'Encino Man' are nominated for Oscar.\" Kimmel calls Steven Spielberg and Seth Rogen \"the Joe and Hunter Biden of Hollywood\" and can't believe Spielberg was sober doing \"E.T.\" \"You were high as a bike when you made that movie,\" Kimmel cracks. He also gives props to John Williams being a nominee at 91 – \"He's still scoring – if you know what I mean\" – and mentions the absence of Cruise and James Cameron: \"Two guys who insisted we go to the theater didn't come to the theater.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel:Angry actors would have to 'battle' Michelle Yeoh to slap him at Oscars\n\nFor Angela Bassett, the Oscars are all about 'the spirit of never giving up'\n\nSupporting actress contender Angela Bassett, the first actor from a Marvel superhero movie to garner a nod, told USA TODAY that her husband Courtney B. Vance has been an essential support system this Oscar season, accompanying her to awards shows and filming her acceptance speeches on his smartphone. \"He was supportive before the whirlwind,\" says the \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" star. \"He always trusted and believed that a nomination like this might one day happen for me.\"\n\nIn addition to being the subject of Ariana DeBose's viral rap, Bassett has loved going through the awards process with her fellow thespians: \"When I think of my girl Michelle Yeoh and it being her first nomination, it really is about the spirit of never giving up.\"\n\nA Brendan Fraser win would complete an epic Oscar comeback story\n\nThe best actor race seems to be down to Austin Butler, Colin Farrell and Brendan Fraser, though a win by the latter would finish one of this year's most noteworthy comebacks. After becoming a major Hollywood star in the 1990s, Fraser has been honest about his career hardships, including being sexually assaulted, and won accolades for his role in \"The Whale.\"\n\nIn an emotional Screen Actor Guild speech, Fraser shouted out to other actors who've weathered struggles: \"I know how you feel. But believe me, if you just stay in there and you put one foot in front of the other, you'll get to where you need to go.\"\n\nThe new Oscar best picture winner will join Hollywood's most hallowed hall\n\n\"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is in the pole position to win best picture over \"The Banshees of Inisherin,\" \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" \"The Fabelmans\" and \"Elvis,\" among others.\n\nThe victor will join a long list filled with some of the greatest movies ever (and a few that don't quite fit that bill). We watched all 94 so far and ranked them, from the first winner – the 1927 silent war drama \"Wings,\" which holds up well! – to the feel-good 2022 Oscar champ \"CODA.\"\n\nGet a video tour of the ultra-exclusive green room at the Oscars\n\nUSA TODAY's Ralphie Aversa has been in LA all week for events leading up to the Academy Awards, and one of them was getting a look at the ultra-exclusive, swanky green room backstage at the Oscars. He was able to do a fun video tour for our readers but come Sunday night at the Dolby Theatre, no cameras will be allowed in – only performers, presenters and winners will be able to enjoy the comfy furniture, floral arrangements and food by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck.\n\nMichelle Yeoh, Colin Farrell could be first-time Academy Award winners\n\nSixteen of the 20 acting contenders at Sunday's Oscars are first-time , including \"Everything Everywhere\" favorites Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis, as well as best actor candidates Brendan Fraser, Colin Farrell and Austin Butler. The four returnees: Two-time winner Cate Blanchett (\"Tár\"), Angela Bassett (\"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\"), Michelle Williams (\"The Fabelmans\") and Judd Hirsch (\"The Fabelmans\"), who last received an Oscar nod for 1980's \"Ordinary People.\"\n\nBut the list of thespians who've never won an Academy Award is a pretty star-studded affair overall, including Scarlett Johansson, Antonio Banderas, Glenn Close, Willem Dafoe, Amy Adams, Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr.\n\nSupporting actor is Ke Huy Quan's to lose\n\n\"Everything Everywhere\" star Ke Huy Quan has dominated the competition and rolled through awards season. But his quest for a supporting actor victory has also been a Cinderella story for the actor, who was a child star in the 1980s with roles in \"The Goonies\" and \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" and then stepped away from Hollywood because of a lack of meaty roles for Asian actors.\n\n\"I'm grateful the landscape has changed, there’s a lot more progress now,\" Quan said backstage after winning at the Golden Globes. He's also made sure to have a bunch of fun heading to Oscar night, posting tons of selfies with peers on his Instagram account.\n\nBest supporting actress is a toss-up\n\nAs far as Oscar predictions go, most of the acting categories are fairly straightforward with a favorite moving out in front. Not so much with supporting actress, which can go a few different ways. \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" star Angela Bassett – the first actor to be nominated for a Marvel movie – had the early momentum with wins out of the Golden Globes and Critics Choice, but Jamie Lee Curtis of \"Everything Everywhere\" took an important Screen Actors Guild honor while \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" actress Kerry Condon picked up the supporting trophy at the British Academy Film Awards.\n\nGiven SAG and the \"Everything\" goodwill, Curtis probably has the best chance over Bassett, though it's possible the two beloved Hollywood types cancel each other out and Condon sneaks by for a victory.\n\nGood news: Lady Gaga will be performing 'Hold My Hand' after all!\n\nA bevy of original song contenders are slated for prime-time performances. Rihanna will sing \"Lift Me Up\" from \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" Sofia Carson and songwriter Diane Warren are slated to perform \"Applause\" from \"Tell It Like A Woman,\" Talking Heads frontman David Byrne teams with \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" supporting actress nominee Stephanie Hsu and music trio Son Lux for “This Is A Life,\" and Indian singers Rahul Sipligunj and Kaala Bhairava will perform the \"RRR\" song-and-dance number – and the frontrunner in the category – \"Naatu Naatu.\"\n\nAnd while Oscar producers previously said she wouldn't perform, Lady Gaga is now slated to sing “Hold My Hand” from \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" a person familiar with the production but not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY. (Fun fact: Gaga is shooting \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" with Joaquin Phoenix, who won best actor for the first \"Joker\" movie.)\n\nGlenn Close tests positive for COVID-19, won't be among Oscar presenters\n\nGlenn Close was expected to be among the dozens of A-list stars on tap to hand out trophies and appear on the telecast Sunday but has tested positive for COVID-19. A representative for the actress told The Associated Press she is isolating and resting.\n\nAriana DeBose, Troy Kotsur, Halle Berry, Nicole Kidman and Jessica Chastain are among the previous Oscar winners scheduled to be presenters. Also on the list is a raft of other high-profile names like Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Melissa McCarthy, Janelle Monáe, Zoe Saldaña and Harrison Ford.\n\nJust don't expect an appearance from Will Smith. Smith, who won best actor last year for \"King Richard\" and would traditionally present the award for best actress this year, was banned from Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences events for 10 years after he slapped Oscar presenter Chris Rock for making a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.\n\nRed carpet coverage is coming for the fashionistas\n\nAll the big stars will be hitting the \"champagne carpet\" and wearing their Sunday best. E!'s \"Live From the Red Carpet\" kicks off at 5 p.m. EDT/2 p.m. PDT while ABC starts its pre-show coverage at 6:30 EDT/3:30 PDT.

And one day, Oliver's announcement was on the front page of Nguoi Viet daily newspaper.\n\nThe article said the Academy Award-winning director and screenwriter of \"Platoon,\" \"Wall Street\" and \"Born on the Fourth of July\" had already held open auditions in Asia and Europe and in other American cities, but the final casting call would be in Little Saigon. I knew I'd cover it for The Times, but the biggest question on my mind was: Did Oliver Stone already have a screenplay for this first ever Hollywood movie from the Vietnamese perspective? Because I wanted to help him write it.\n\nSpoiler alert: I didn't help Oliver write \"Heaven & Earth.\" But along with many other Vietnamese non-actors, I was cast for the movie. I had 15 minutes' worth of speaking scenes throughout the film, sharing lines with Debbie Reynolds and Tommy Lee Jones – and Joan Chen and Haing Ngor, who played my parents. I was Kim, a sister to the main character in this major motion picture that not only educated me about my past but also gained me a movie family for my future.\n\n30th anniversary of 'Heaven & Earth'\n\nIt was three decades ago that we were all in Thailand making Oliver's most poetic film, one with the heart of a Buddhist feminist. (Communist Vietnam was still closed back then and objected to many things in the script.) And Sunday, we reunited in Los Angeles for a rescreening of \"Heaven & Earth,\" which premiered on Christmas Day in 1993.\n\nOliver based his movie on \"When Heaven and Earth Changed Places\" and \"Child of War, Woman of Peace\" – the memoirs of Le Ly Hayslip. Le Ly was a child of Central Vietnam who, because her village was caught between communist North Vietnam and the Washington-backed South Vietnam, became a teenage Viet Cong guerilla, a reformed entrepreneur and then an immigrant to America.\n\nHer journey is not for the faint of heart: She suffered rape by fellow VC guerillas, torture in a South Vietnamese military prison and then the suicide of her U.S. military veteran husband in Southern California.\n\nNow a grandmother living in San Diego, Le Ly remains one of the strongest and most determined women I know. With no formal education, she has published two memoirs that were made into a Hollywood movie and founded the nonprofit Global Village Foundation. In fact, right before our movie reunion in L.A., she was back in Central Vietnam bringing aid and supplies to flood victims.\n\nSo no, Oliver didn't need me to help write anything; he had Le Ly. But in Little Saigon in December 1991, I covered the open casting call and brought along my best friend, a budding model and actor.\n\n‘Remembrance is vital’:On 40th anniversary of the Vietnam wall, consider its pivotal role in the cultural shift\n\nMass therapy session on Vietnam War\n\nThe event drew thousands to a huge hall, where they started lining up outside at 7 a.m. Inside, mini film crews had set up cameras to screen test the Vietnamese Americans. No script was handed out. Instead, the war refugees were asked to improvise from their own experiences: You're a mother who has to send your son to war. You're a father trying to protect your daughter. Your family is divided over Ho Chi Minh.\n\nIt turned out to be a massive therapy session for 12 hours. It's as if these Vietnamese Americans, so used to trying to bury the past to have a future, were all at once given permission to relive their nightmares, pains and secrets. Everyone just wanted to tell their stories. And cry. Everyone cried. The crews doing the screen tests sobbed behind cameras and had to take breaks between auditions.\n\nFall of Saigon:On July 4, I pledge allegiance. It took two wars to make me an American.\n\nSo many people were waiting in line, the casting directors asked my childhood friend Tran Tran and I to help audition our fellow refugees. I played a daughter, a mother, a sister to anyone who needed me. I didn't have any nightmares to relive: I was only 8 when my family escaped the fall of Saigon in 1975; the pains and secrets belonged to my parents. But those survivors auditioning for the movie were so real, their memories so alive, it was easy to help improvise their scenes.\n\nAt the end of that emotionally exhausting day, Tran got her screen test for the main role, Le Ly. I played the bitter older sister who threw her out of my house.\n\nOne thing we learned later was that Warner Bros. didn't want to make a film with subtitles, which three decades ago was still a big no for American audiences. The actors Oliver chose had to be able to be understood in English. Tran and I, both born in Vietnam but grew up in Phoenix, were confident of our American sides.\n\nSurprise: The casting directors called me back but not my friend, who, yes, remains my friend (and in fact came with me to the movie reunion last weekend, as you'll see swiping through the photo gallery below).\n\nOscar winner for screenwriting\n\nAt one of my audition callbacks, I was finally given Oliver's screenplay – and was blown away by what a lyrical writer he is and understood why he won an Oscar for writing \"Midnight Express.\"\n\nReading \"Heaven & Earth\" made me cry. At a time when Asians in general, let alone Vietnamese Americans, almost never saw our true selves represented on the Hollywood screen, Oliver was amplifying the story of a small village girl who should have remained invisible to history. But Le Ly refused to stay invisible, and Oliver recognized that kindred spirit.\n\nOpinions in your inbox:Get exclusive access to our columnists and the best of our columns every day\n\nIn the summer of 1992, the call finally came: My last audition was my first meeting with Oliver at his office, where he had me read lines with him for Kim, one of Le Ly's older sisters who grew from rice farmer to bar girl to San Diego housewife.\n\nWhatever I did worked. Oliver smiled and told me I got the part: \"You're my Kim.\"\n\nWe hugged, shook hands, maybe – I was so excited I really don't remember what happened after hearing those words.\n\nBy early October, I was on a jet to Thailand, where I worked on the movie until Christmas break.\n\nReliving terror of war, bonding as movie family\n\nAs I later wrote for The Times in an essay headlined \"Scenes From Another Lifetime\":\n\nOn leave from The Times, I spent 2 1/2 months in Thailand, where not only did I and the other non-actors in the movie learn acting on the job, but I also saw close up the realities of a conflict I never knew personally. In character, we stood knee deep in the mud of rice paddies and cowered while American helicopters barking bullets interrupted our work; ran to a neighbor’s house to witness his killing by the Viet Cong; and argued with each other about how to deal with the violence. ... All of this played havoc on my psyche. Day and night, I moved between the past and the present, war and peace, old enemies and new friends. No longer could I separate myself from the people and events I had known only intellectually.\n\nAs strangers who met only because we're supposed to portray a family on screen, you can't go through long, harrowing days on set without bonding. And we filmed in rural southwestern Thailand – Phang Nga, a 90-minute drive outside the touristy Phuket Island. Every night, the cast shared trauma and entertained each other over family meals. On the rare days we had off together, we played tourists.\n\nA vivid memory for me is an afternoon by the hotel pool: Our movie father Haing Ngor, who had won a best supporting actor Oscar for \"The Killing Fields\" in 1985, also had written a memoir about his escape from the communist Khmer Rouge, who forced the gynecologist and obstetrician underground, where he worked as a doctor at the risk of his own life. As he and other cast members chatted and relaxed, I read \"Haing Ngor: A Cambodian Odyssey\" and asked, \"How are you still alive?\"\n\nWe learned from one another yet also got bored together. Our movie mother Joan Chen, star of \"The Last Emperor\" and \"Twin Peaks\" and now a director herself, admitted once to being scared of ghosts. As easygoing as Joan was, I'm not sure she ever forgave my prank of making spirit noises outside her door with my movie brother Dustin Nguyen, who had starred in \"21 Jump Street\" and who now acts in and directs episodes of \"Warrior.\"\n\nReunion of 'Heaven & Earth' family\n\nLast weekend was about the fifth time the \"Heaven & Earth\" family reunited after three decades. Tragically, our reunions have drawn fewer of us over time because of distance and death:\n\nHaing survived Cambodia's Khmer Rouge only to die in a senseless shooting outside his Los Angeles home in 1996.\n\nCostume designer Ha Nguyen, nominated for an Oscar for \"The Mask,\" died of cancer in 2012.\n\nHiep Le, our leading actress who starred as Le Ly, passed away in 2017 from complications of stomach cancer.\n\nHiep Le:From refugee to starring in an Oliver Stone film\n\nWatching \"Heaven & Earth\" again on the big screen Sunday in Los Angeles with both my Hollywood family and my real family, I remembered how generous my movie idols were in their interactions with us non-actors: Tommy Lee Jones, playing my movie sister's husband, made sure I was comfortable in our one-on-one scene. Debbie Reynolds shared her insecurities over her Hollywood career.\n\nBut watching scenes with my movie father Haing Ngor and my movie baby sister Hiep Le, I had to close my eyes. It hurt too much. I missed them so much. No amount of wishing could bring them back.\n\nWhat comforted me and stuck with me still is how our movie family feels like a real family after all these years. We've suffered together. We've survived together. We've partied together.\n\nAnd just like in the beginning, Le Ly and Oliver have been there at each reunion.

This might finally be the ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nNetflix has accomplished a lot in Hollywood: It’s partnered with notable filmmakers, produced buzzy hit films and launched the streaming craze that revolutionized the industry.\n\nYet there’s one coveted Tinseltown accolade Netflix (NFLX) hasn’t received: the Academy Award for best picture.\n\nThat could change this weekend. Netflix’s film “The Power of the Dog” is among the frontrunners to take home the Oscars’ biggest prize on Sunday night. It would be the first streaming service to win the category.\n\nCritics have hailed “Dog,” a western starring Benedict Cumberbatch and directed by Jane Campion, as one of the year’s best films. It’s earned a 94% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes, is most nominated film at this weekend’s Academy Awards and has swept much of the awards circuit in winning major accolades at the BAFTAs, the Director’s Guild of America and the Golden Globes.\n\nThat’s good news for Netflix, which has tried — and failed — to win best picture for years.\n\nThe power of winning best picture\n\nCan \"The Power of the Dog\" finally win Best Picture for Netflix? Kirsty Griffin/Netflix\n\nNetflix scored its first best picture nomination with “Roma” in 2019. The following year it received two best picture nominations with “The Irishman” and “Marriage Story” and another for “Mank” in 2021.\n\nGetting that type of respect from the Academy typically doesn’t come cheap. The Los Angeles Times reported that Netflix spent at least $70 million in 2020 to promote its films to Academy voters. That money likely helped the company pick up a few Oscars that year, but not the coveted top prize.\n\nAnd for Netflix, it does matter. The Oscars may be losing their luster with the general public given that its ratings recently hit record lows, but the show still carries a lot of prestige in Hollywood. A best picture win could serve both as a marketing tool and as an enticement for top talent.\n\n“As the tech outsider this gives them the ultimate form of acceptance inside Hollywood,” Zak Shaikh, vice president of programming at research-based media firm Magid, told CNN Business. “To win best picture says they are a legitimate movie studio.”\n\nApple could ruin the party\n\nCould Apple's \"CODA\" take the spotlight from Netflix this weekend? Apple TV+\n\nStill, “The Power of the Dog” isn’t a shoo-in. And unfortunately for Netflix, another streaming rival could steal the spotlight this weekend: Apple (AAPL).\n\nThe Apple TV+ film “CODA,” about a girl taking care of her deaf parents, won the big prizes at the Screen Actors Guild and the Producers Guild of America awards.\n\nAt the Oscars, “Dog” received 12 nominations overall, compared to just three for “CODA.” But Gold Derby, a website that sets Oscars odds, currently has the two films in a dead heat.\n\nA best picture win would be a nice marketing story for Netflix, but it’s not a must-have. The company has already changed the industry, and while some of the old Hollywood types may never fully embrace a streaming service, it’s certainly no longer an outsider.\n\n“Their films have won Oscars, which is big progress,” Tim Gray, a senior VP and awards editor at Variety, told CNN Business. “Netflix is so gigantic… It’s not like they need a best picture.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/03/01/why-get-out-future-oscars-2018/381421002/", "title": "Why 'Get Out' is the future of the Oscars", "text": "Maeve McDermott\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThree years ago, the Academy Awards unfolded in its own kind of sunken place, with the #OscarsSoWhite movement calling foul on the awards show’s all-white acting nominees.\n\nCritics quickly placed the blame on the Academy’s older, white voting bloc, with a 2016 Los Angeles Times story reporting the demographics of Oscar voters as 91% Caucasian and 76% male.\n\nNow, following a years-long push by the Academy to add hundreds of younger, more diverse new voters to its ranks, the Oscars are beginning to adapt, continuing the positive momentum generated by Moonlight’s surprise best picture win in 2017 into this year’s awards. Alongside the predominantly white casts of best picture nominees like The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri are Daniel Kaluuya, Denzel Washington, Mary J. Blige and Octavia Spencer’s nominations for acting awards, with Guillermo del Toro the front-runner in the directing race.\n\nYet no nominee better captures the generational shift between the old and new Oscars than Get Out. Nominated for best picture, best actor, best director and best original screenplay, Jordan Peele’s revolutionary work of social satire challenges the idea of what an Oscar movie can be, a subversive treatment of America's \"post-racial era\" that takes the form of a stingingly funny horror flick.\n\nIt's a film that almost certainly would’ve been too radical for Oscar voters of years past, compared to the more traditional Oscars fare among the category’s other nominees, like the war drama Dunkirk and the Winston Churchill biopic Darkest Hour. Oscar-winning horror movies are few and far between in the awards show's history, and a Get Out win would be a historic moment for the genre. And Get Out isn't just any horror movie, but one that brilliantly illustrates the insidious racism of seemingly well-meaning white people in America.\n\nIf the Oscar's more traditionally-minded voters squirmed in their seats while watching the movie's depiction of white, liberal characters, that was the movie's intention, which doesn't necessarily do Peele any favors with the Academy's old-timers. And then, there's the fact that a Get Out sweep would be a historic first for filmmakers of color, making Peele the first black writer to win best original screenplay. (Peele also made history with just the nominations, becoming the first African American to be nominated for best director, best screenplay and best picture in one year.)\n\nOscars nominations 2018:Not so white, but Latinos and Asians are missing\n\nMore:'Get Out' star Daniel Kaluuya is on an Oscar high\n\nWhether Get Out is the kind of movie that deserves to win best picture seems to split Oscar voters along generational lines, according to Vulture’s unofficial survey of anonymous Academy members. Younger voters praise the film as a “masterpiece” while older voters pushed back. “I had multiple conversations with longtime Academy members who were like, ‘That was not an Oscar film,’ ” one new voter told the website. For all of Get Out's critical and commercial successes, scoring breathlessly positive reviews and becoming the third-biggest R-rated horror release in North American box office history, this point, about how Get Out looks and feels different than other best picture winners of the past and is therefore unworthy of the prize, may be what dooms the film's chances on Oscars night.\n\nAs the Academy continues to add more young and non-white members with a goal to double the group's diversity by 2020, the influence that more traditionally-minded Oscars voters wield over the nominations will continue to lessen, changing the nature of the winners.. Most likely, viewers won't see a history-making best picture win from Get Out on Sunday night, with Gold Derby's Oscars odds favoring Three Billboards and The Shape of Water. But Get Out's presence in the Oscars race is a promising start, proof that the Academy's diversity push is helping more unconventional films get recognized during Hollywood's biggest nights.\n\nAnd a win for Get Out, one year after Moonlight's groundbreaking triumph, would mark two years in a row in which the category's best movie, not just the most \"Oscars-y\" movie, won the night's biggest prize.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/02/28/we-were-there-how-worst-flub-oscar-history-went-down/377305002/", "title": "We were there: How the worst flub in Oscar history went down", "text": "The 2017 Academy Awards telecast was coming to an end. The best picture had just been announced, the producers of 'La La Land' were making their acceptance speeches and journalists were finishing up their stories, hoping to go home soon. Then, suddenly, producer Jordan Horowitz was at the mike, waving a white card: \"There's a mistake. 'Moonlight,' you guys won best picture. This is not a joke.\"\n\nThat's when the shrieking and expletives began. \"What?! Are you kidding me?!\" On Twitter, \"WHAT IS HAPPENING\" began trending. The stage of the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles was a shambles of confusion, correctionand contrition.\n\nUSA TODAY had reporters stationed in all key parts of the theater that night. They saw what happened and scrambled to document the unprecedented, unfolding mess-up. Here's what they reported:\n\nOscar got it wrong, wrong, soooo wrong. The presenters announced the wrong best picture; Moonlight was the winner, not La La Land.\n\nIt was the biggest, most embarrassing, most awkward mistake in the history of the Academy Awards, played out before an audience of millions watching on TV and a theater full of stunned stars, mouths agape, as a chaotic scene unfolded onstage at the Dolby Theatre just after midnight on the East Coast.\n\nONSTAGE\n\nWarren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were presenting but looked lost. When Beatty opened the envelope, he paused for a long few seconds. He looked at Dunaway, puzzled. She took the envelope, read it and said, \"La La Land.\"\n\nUp came the cast and crew of the much-heralded film. They started making their acceptance speeches.\n\nBACKSTAGE\n\nAs the La La Land filmmakers took the stage to accept best picture, the accountant from PricewaterhouseCoopers jumped up and said, \"He (Beatty) took the wrong envelope!\" and went running onstage.\n\nCraziness breaks out. No one knows how Beatty got the best-actress envelope instead of the best-picture envelope.\n\n\"Oh, my God. Moonlight won, Moonlight won,\" a stagehand says, her hands on her head.\n\nAround 3 a.m. ET, PricewaterhouseCoopers would issue a statement explaining: \"The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.\"\n\nONSTAGE\n\nAfter receiving a rousing hurrah from the crowd, Jordan Horowitz, a La La Land producer, took the mike, waving one finger in the air and saying, \"Sorry, guys, hold on. There's a mistake. Moonlight, you guys won best picture. This is not a joke.\"\n\nHe held up the card and the camera came in close: It said Moonlight and listed the producers' names.\n\nYour 2018 Oscars viewing guide:The 9 movies you must see\n\nMore:25 of the most unforgettable moments in Oscar history\n\nAfter confirming Moonlight was the rightful best-picture winner, the Oscars crowd erupted into cheers. Beatty took the mike again to explain the flub.\n\n\"I wanted to tell you what happened. I opened the envelope, and it said, 'Emma Stone, La La Land.' That’s why I took such a long look at Faye, and at you, I wasn’t trying to be funny.\"\n\nHost Jimmy Kimmel was beside himself but tried to joke. \"Warren, what did you do?!\" He said what happened was \"very unfortunate,\" but he was still joking. \"Personally, I blame Steve Harvey for this.\" (Harvey is notorious for naming the wrong Miss Universe winner in 2015.)\n\nON THE MEZZANINE\n\nAudible gasps escaped from the mezzanine, with Oscars guests turning to each other and whispering, \"What?\" Onlookers looked deflated; they were mostly La La Land die-hards. Only a handful stood and clapped when Moonlight was announced as the winner. The mood was in stark contrast to what was happening on the lower level, where the applause was strong.\n\nBACKSTAGE\n\nThe Moonlight filmmakers poured backstage, with director Barry Jenkins holding the Oscar and muttering, \"Oh, my God, oh, my God.\" Everyone looked befuddled.\n\n“I’m sure everybody saw my face. I was speechless,\" Jenkins told reporters in the press room later. \"That was awkward. It made a very special feeling even more special, but not in the way I expected. ... Please write this down: The folks from La La Land have been so gracious. I can’t imagine being in their position.\"\n\n\"I feel so weird,\" best-supporting-actor winner Mahershala Ali said. \"Now, that was awkward.\" He ran into La La Land star Ryan Gosling, who was smiling in spite of it all, and they hugged.\n\n“When (La La Land)'s name was read, I wasn’t surprised,\" Ali added. \"I’m really happy for them, a group of some extraordinary people in front of the camera and behind the camera. Then, when I did see the security people coming out on stage and their moment was being disrupted in some way, I got really worried.\"\n\nHe was really thrown when it turned out Moonlight was the winner. \"I didn’t want to go up there and take it from somebody. It’s very hard to feel joy in a moment like that. ... But I feel very fortunate for all of us to walk away with best picture. It's pretty remarkable.\"\n\nLa La Land director Damien Chazelle kept his game face. \"That was weird,\" he said.\n\nSecurity went looking for Beatty, who had both envelopes. There's much confusion because Oscar staffers carefully check presenters before they walk out, to make sure they have the right envelope in hand.\n\nMore:Jimmy Kimmel is secretly hoping for another 'Envelopegate'\n\nOscars 2018:Predicting who will win — and who should\n\n\"What just happened?” Kimmel said, walking back to his dressing room in shock.\n\n\"I think for the rest of my life, I'm going to be asked about this,\" the host said. \"And I'm trying to remember the details correctly. My guess is it's going to be: it's operator error. I don't know anything.\"\n\nLater, he adds, \"I really should go speak to Warren.\"\n\nAdam Carolla, representing the show writers, gave a speech backstage praising Kimmel's show. There are shouts of \"Best show ever! Best show ever!\"\n\nIN THE PRESS ROOM\n\nShock hit the press room backstage like a tidal wave, as roughly 100 journalists stared at the screen, their mouths open. The most common refrain was a stunned “What?” and “Am I really seeing this?” as reporters tried to discern if they were watching a planned bit or the biggest Oscar flub ever.\n\n“I was actually holding my best-actress card the whole time,\" winner Emma Stone of La La Land told reporters. \"So I’m not sure what happened, but I wanted to talk to you guys first.\"\n\nBut she was authentically happy for the actual winner. \"I love Moonlight. I love Moonlight so much. I’m so excited for Moonlight. ... We are so excited for Moonlight. I think it’s one of the best films of all time.”\n\nBut was it \"the craziest Oscar moment of all time?” Stone asked reporters. Uh, yes. “Cool! We made history tonight.”\n\nTen minutes after the broadcast ended, disbelief continued, as journalists, who had previously thought their headlines were in the bag, scrambled to rewrite.

Bong is heavily expected to pick up nods for best director and original screenplay as well, following a similar path to awards glory blazed by Alfonso Cuaron's black-and-white \"Roma,\" which won Mexico its first best foreign-language film Oscar last February.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nSo what's all the fuss about, and what do you need to know going in?

But the Kims' get-rich scheme goes violently off the rails in the film's suspenseful second half, descending into chaos that packs an emotional wallop.\n\n'Parasite' isn't a horror movie – or is it?\n\nAlthough its crawly title suggests bloodsucking body horror, the R-rated thriller is rarely scary and only occasionally gory.\n\n\"When the film begins, it feels like your typical dark comedy film, so the audience can just relax and watch it,\" Bong says. \"Halfway through, there's a turning point that leads to all these uncontrollable situations and the audience doesn't have time to wonder, 'What is the genre?' They're just dragged to the endpoint without any time to consider what's going on. So when they leave the theater, the audience just gives up on trying to define the genre, and that's what I wanted.\"\n\nThe film explores class divides in darkly funny fashion\n\nTo often literal effect, \"Parasite\" shows the upstairs-downstairs dichotomy between rich and poor, as the Kims attempt to better their hapless circumstances under the feet of the blithe Park family.\n\n\"The messages (Bong) is trying to give people about poverty differences and problems are universal,\" Choi says. \"It has a lot of meanings and metaphors, and you can actually have a conversation about it after.\"\n\nThe movie's title is even up for interpretation: \"A parasite is an entity that feeds off another thing, but if you look at the film, it's not important to designate which side is parasitic,\" Song says. \"Certain characters are parasitic, but the message of the film is that everyone in society has to live in harmony and have respect toward one another.\"\n\nYou'll never look at peaches the same again\n\nIn a movie chock-full of striking imagery, one of the most memorable is that of a peach, which Ki-jung scrapes of its fuzz. Stealthily, she sprinkles the fuzz on the Parks' unassuming maid, who is fiercely allergic and falls ill on the job. Fearing she'll infect their kids, the Parks fire the housekeeper on the spot.\n\nThe fruit has become the unofficial \"mascot\" of \"Parasite\": Strings of peach emojis frequently accompany tweets about the movie.\n\n\"Peaches are the most cinematic (food), just in terms of the visual aesthetics and the fact that the fuzz is barely visible, so it's easy to attack someone with,\" Bong says.\n\nCoincidentally, peaches were also central to another recent awards heavyweight: 2017's \"Call Me By Your Name,\" in which Timothee Chalamet's Elio pleasures himself with the fruit. Bong laughs off the connection between the two films, deadpanning, \"I hope it helps all the peach farmers across the world.\"\n\nContributing: Kim Willis", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/09"}]}

There's another fall treat people have strong opinions about: candy corn.\n\nThe triangle-shaped, tri-colored candy is either welcomed with open arms by fans every October, or vilified to the point that its haters would rather destroy candy corn in all forms before ever letting it enter their mouths.\n\nAccording to the National Confectioners Association, it is one of the top two Halloween treats, along with chocolate.\n\nA recent poll conducted by Monmouth University found among the eight top-selling candies in the U.S., candy corn tied for fourth with Hershey bars, trailing Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Snickers and M&M's.\n\n\"Candy corn even making the list may surprise some people, but it is one of the top-selling Halloween candies in the country,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.\n\nCandy corn is popular enough that it even makes appearances outside Halloween, such as Christmas or Valentine's Day.\n\nHere's everything you have ever wanted to know about candy corn, including why some of us hate it so much.\n\nHow long have we consumed candy corn?\n\nThe treat dates back to the 1800s, although no one has been able to pinpoint who specifically invented the candy corn. The National Confectioners Association says \"according to legend,\" George Renninger, an employee of the Wunderlee Candy Company, created candy corn in the 1880s.\n\nProduction of candy corn took off in 1898 by Ohio-based Goelitz Confectionary Company, which we know now as Jelly Belly (makers of jelly beans with flavors such as caramel corn and, umm, canned dog food).\n\nHow does it get made?\n\nThe NCA says manufacturers use a corn starch molding process where \"kernel-shaped depressions are made in a tray of corn starch.\" The molds are filled in three passes: first pouring the white part of the candy corn, followed by orange, then yellow. When it sets, a confectioner's glaze is added to make them look shiny.\n\nBecause there was no machinery to automate candy corn making when it was first invented, the treats were made seasonally, starting in August and ending around fall, says the NCA.\n\nHow do people eat candy corn?\n\nA survey conducted this year by the NCA found 58% of people just pop the whole candy corn in their mouth. However, 29% will start by eating the narrow white tip at the top, while 13% will eat the yellow portion at the bottom first.\n\nSo, why do some people hate it so much?\n\nIf you've noticed recent chatter about candy corn hatred, it's likely linked to a recent survey claiming candy corn was named America's least-favorite Halloween candy.\n\nJacob Lahne, a sensory scientist with the food science and technology department at Virginia Tech, said because candy corn has been around so long, it's possible critics might find it \"a little old-fashioned\" compared to modern treats with more sophisticated flavors.\n\n\"It's so intense, so sweet and so kind of one-note that I think it contrasts with current trends to add bitterness, to add salt, to add spice (or) other complexifying factors,\" he said.\n\nJoe Marcy, the head of the food science and technology department at Virginia Tech, says it could be related to the candy's texture.\n\nBrands of candy corn use varying ingredients to help with texture, Marcy said, including gelatin, egg whites, modified soy protein or carnauba wax.\n\nIn food science, while taste definitely matters, the \"mouthfeel\" — how food feels when it's in our mouths — is just as important, said Marcy. \"The flavor may not be what’s putting me off, it may be the texture.\"\n\nHow has candy corn lasted for more than 100 years?\n\nChristopher Gindlesperger, a spokesperson for the National Confectioners Association, said a lot of our love for sweets, including candy corn, comes from their connection to special events like Halloween.\n\n\"It’s very personal,\" said Gindlesperger. \"There’s an emotional well-being component to the products generally, and they’re so closely tied to our family traditions and holiday celebrations.\"\n\nThe fact that we typically only eat candy corn for a brief time also helps, too. Marcy compares it to the Christmas season and the appearance of eggnog near the end of every year.\n\n\"If you had eggnog year-round, you would probably never drink eggnog,\" said Marcy. \"But if it was something that was a special treat associated with a specific holiday, yeah, i’m going to buy some candy corn, and for the month of October, I’m going to eat it.\"\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/specialty-publications/your-news/martin-county/reader-submitted/2017/10/18/historical-vignettes-halloween-memories-date-back-early-1900-s/777881001/", "title": "HISTORICAL VIGNETTES: Halloween memories date back to the ...", "text": "Greg & Alice Luckhardt\n\nYourNews contributor\n\nHalloween may conjure thoughts of mystical, scary or even gruesome stories, events and creatures, some involving perhaps haunted houses, spooks, ghosts and other apparitions.\n\nYoung children may associate the holiday with trick-or-treat candy and costumes. Certain superstitions and beliefs eventually linked to Halloween probably have some origin from Scotland or England.\n\nIn the U.S. such quaint traditions for All Hallows' Eve were popular in the late 1800s.\n\nChildren's magazines in the 1870s, as Halloween approached, may have pictured such characters as fairies and witches while other periodicals for adults, especially ladies, suggested parties with decorating ideas, foods to serve and fun activities to promote the holiday.\n\nMany of the adult party games were intended for young couples, with stories around a bonfire or bobbing for apples. Halloween may have even created a certain ambiance, providing \"a reason for passion unleashed in the dark of night\" for some couples.\n\nPopularity of parties for adults increased during the 1880s and '90s, as carved pumpkins, decorations using cornhusks or autumn leaves with rooms having minimal lighting, almost dark being the norm, all to set a romantic mood.\n\nParty themes included 'Black Cat,' 'Cinderella,' 'Mother Goose,' and 'Haunted House' by the early 1900s. With the idea of themed parties, costumes were accepted attire for guests.\n\nTowns and small cities began having Halloween parades with everyone dressed in costumes.\n\nIt was quite common to send illustrated Halloween postcards to family, friends or sweethearts, many with greetings, printed poems or messages.\n\nIn the mid-'20s magazines promoted the idea for a kids' activity of dressing in costumes and meeting friends in the neighborhood for fun and candy treats.\n\nEventually the celebration of Halloween was primarily given over for children.\n\nThere were still adult parties, but into the '40s and by the 1950s, Halloween was almost entirely for the enjoyment of children.\n\nLocally, Halloween celebrations or parties were occasionally published in area newspapers of long ago.\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1906, a public Halloween party with entertainment was held at the Jensen Town Hall in the evening. Games and events included the telling of scary stories, bobbing for apples, music, dancing and a rather unique activity, a race which involved carrying peanuts on a spoon.\n\nIn Stuart, school Halloween carnivals date back to the early 1900s, with various activities and events, some including adults.\n\nOn Oct. 30, 1909, the Stuart Epworth Legion held a Halloween party for the public in the Chapter Room at the M.E. Church on Avenue D (Albany) where people dressed in costumes; Miss Blanche DeVault, a teacher, was described as a delightful witch.\n\nThe Methodist Church in Stuart sponsored annual Halloween parties for years. The devastating fire of 1916, however, disrupted the event, which resumed in October 1918, after the church was rebuilt.\n\nA Salerno Halloween street party and dance was held Oct. 31, 1921, sponsored by the Salerno Community Council. Residents from Palm City, Stuart, Gomez and Jensen were also in attendance, dressed in costumes.\n\nBy the 1920s and for years thereafter local advertisements for Halloween costumes, wigs, games and decorations were evident. Private parties were also popular, one being held Oct. 29, 1931, at the Charles and Lois Rue residence for young daughter Leila, while the family lived at the Matthews Apartments on Akron Avenue.\n\nStuart was a very small town and there weren’t many activities for teenagers. House parties, chaperoned by parents or older siblings provided some excitement and fun.\n\nInspired by Halloween, younger sister Leona as well as all the boys and girls in Leila's class were invited. It was a huge success and included a family friend, Vee Chambers, as a fortune teller with game playing, bobbing for apples and other activities. Robert D. Barker was among the attendees and won most of the game prizes.\n\nAs further entertainment, Lois performed a “ghost” skit in a completely dark room of the house, lit only by candle, where the guests passed around different objects, including boiled spaghetti, which, when Lois read a poem in a spooky voice, represented different parts of a human body that had been murdered in that very house, haunted by its ghost.\n\nBy coincidence, just as Charles Rue, disguised, wearing a white sheet as the “ghost” was supposed to jump in the middle of the room yelling “and here I am!” a couple of stray cats outside the window began to howl and scream, making such a horrible noise, everyone was paralyzed.\n\nNeedless to say, that was great and the Halloween party was talked about for weeks.\n\nThis column is one of a series, Interesting Stories, Forgotten Facts, by Alice and Greg Luckhardt.

Others recoil at the re-emergence of the Halloween treat.\n\nFor many, candy corn represents the reason for the season. Most of the 9 billion kernels, more than 35 million pounds, produced annually – according to past pronouncements by the National Confectioners Association – are eaten around Halloween.\n\nLike everything else, candy corn will likely cost more than in the past. For instance, Brach's Candy Corn at Walmart is priced about 4.7% higher than last year, according to consumer data financial platform Klover.\n\nHowever, the price increase is lower than that for Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars (increased by 15%) and Reese's King Size Peanut Butter Cups (up 14%), Klover found.\n\nHigher prices won't likely deter those who love candy corn. \"I will fall.on.a.sword.for my CANDY CORN!\" exclaimed business development guru Perrin Kaplan on a Facebook thread about the candy.\n\nThat sweet, waxy texture isn't for everyone though.

In addition to sugar, corn syrup, salt, sesame oil, honey, artificial flavor, and food colorings, candy corn also has gelatin and confectioner's glaze as ingredients.\n\nThose last two items have led some candy corn detractors to note that candy corn is made of animal hides and bones, like Jell-O gelatin. And confectioner's glaze, also known as shellac, is made from lac-resin, which – are you ready for this? – is a bug secretion. The lac bug – a parasite found in tropical and subtropical regions, according to news site Science Daily – secretes a waxy, waterproof coating to protect itself.\n\nWorkers scrape those secretions from plants and, as education site ThoughtCo.com notes, some of the bugs are gathered in the process. The shellac is also used in paints, cosmetics and plenty of other products, according to The Vegetarian Resource Group.\n\nWait, bug secretions in my candy? Yes. \"It's not unusual at all,\" said Paul Adams, a senior editor at Cook's Illustrated Magazine, which is published by America's Test Kitchen. \"The lac insect produces a shiny, durable resin that's used as the basis for all kinds of coatings: the words 'shellac' and 'lacquer' both come from the name of the bug.\"\n\nTypically found under the name \"confectioner's glaze\" or \"pure food glaze,\" lac coating is used in making gum and on all sorts of shiny candies including jelly beans, Milk Duds and Whoppers, Adams said. \"It's also responsible for the glossy coating on many pharmaceutical pills, as well as citrus fruits and cosmetics.\"\n\nGood news for chocolate lovers: M&M's do not use the substance.\n\nIs a beer shortage on tap?:Inflation and supply chain pressures on brewers are intensifying\n\nThe caloric breakdown: Each piece of candy corn has 4 calories, according to Jelly Belly.

This year, the NCA estimated consumers will buy 5% more chocolate and candy than in 2021.\n\nAs for candy corn, not everyone loves, or even likes, the candy. Many despise it.\n\n\"Run away. Gross. Weird consistency. Corn isn’t candy and even kids don’t like it,\" tweeted public relations executive Patrick Seybold. \"So … why does it still exist?\"\n\nAbout 22% said, \"Candy corn is the best!\" in an unscientific survey I conducted on Twitter (it got 550 votes). But 49% disagree (\"Nope. I'll pass.\"). For about 29%, \"Candy corn is just OK.\"\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?:Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nPerhaps those who dislike it do so because of its texture and humdrum flavor. \"From a sensory perspective, the hatred of candy corn can be explained because, unlike many candies, its flavor profile doesn't incorporate contrast,\" Adams told USA TODAY. \"It's just intensely sweet-tasting, which can produce palate fatigue, like eating spoonfuls of honey or sugar.\"\n\nThose who despise candy corn can cherish that it earned the title of Worst Halloween Candy last year for the second consecutive time, ahead of circus peanuts, those orange peanut-shaped marshmallow spongy candies, according to CandyStore.com. Favorite Halloween candy? Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Candy corn still ranked as No. 10 among overall favorite candies.\n\nYet, for those who love candy corn, the treat can be transportive, says Adams, who recalls his mother eating just the white tips of each piece. \"Why is it loved as much as hated? If you grew up eating it, it probably has delightful associations in your mind,\" he said.\n\nThe origins of candy corn\n\nCandy corn was first harvested in the late 19th century. Most histories have the Wunderle Candy Co. of Philadelphia inventing the kernel-shaped treat in the 1880s.\n\nThe Goelitz Confectionery Co. in Cincinnati acquired the recipe and began making candy corn about 1898, according to National Geographic. The Goelitz Confectionery Co. changed its name to the Jelly Belly Candy Co. in 2001.\n\nDecades ago, candy corn was a year-round candy called \"chicken feed,\" and aimed at agricultural and rural families, according to History.com. (You can see Jelly Belly vice chairman Bill Kelley, the great-grandson of Gustav Goelitz and a fourth generation candy maker, talk about candy corn in an CBS Sunday Morning video from 2011.)\n\n\"It wasn’t made for fall, but it became a fall thing ultimately,\" said Marie Wright, chief global flavorist at food processing company ADM, which makes corn syrup, sweeteners and natural flavorings and colorings used in candy corn.\n\nOriginally, candy corn was made by hand with candy makers pouring a sequence of passes of different colored hot edible icing called fondant into kernel-shaped molds, according to Jelly Belly, which claims to be the longest continuous maker of the candy and will make about 250,000 pounds, or 125 tons, of it this year.\n\nToday, candy corn is made the same way – using essentially the same recipe – by machines. Where some candies' flavors change over time, candy corn \"tastes exactly how I remember it. Everybody says the flavor doesn’t change,\" Wright said.\n\nReady to buy a VIP concert package?:Here's how to avoid getting ripped off\n\nUSA TODAY is starting a book club:Why we want to read Stephen King's 'Fairy Tale' with you\n\nCandy corn even gets a song this year\n\nBrach's claims to sell the most candy corn and says it makes 86% of the candy corn sold in the U.S. Each year, the candy maker says it produces enough candy corn to encircle the Earth more than five times.\n\nFounded in 1904, Brach's advertised in 1932 that it was selling eight ounces of Candy Corn for 10 cents.\n\nThis year, Brach's teamed up with singer Michelle Williams, formerly of Destiny's Child, who wrote a song to rev up #TeamCandyCorn, with lyrics including \"It is the season, today is the day, candy corn is on the way.\"\n\n\"Every year my beloved candy corn is known to stir up a debate spicier than a pumpkin spice latte 😜 and the haters are getting a little too loud for my liking,\" she said in an Instagram post.\n\nBrach's has some new candy corn flavors this year, too, in addition to Harvest Corn, which is made with cocoa butter and a brown section replacing the yellow.\n\nBack in August, Brach's brought to market Tailgate Candy Corn, a football-themed mix that includes candy corn with the flavors of hot dogs, hamburgers. fruit punch, vanilla ice cream and even popcorn-flavored candy corn. Also available for a limited time: Funfetti Candy Corn, which recalls cake frosting with sprinkles included.\n\nIf you cannot get enough candy corn, you can make your own. The Food Network's Alton Brown shows you how in a video on the channel's website.\n\nAmerica's Test Kitchen has a recipe for a candy corn cake, which uses the candy as an ingredient, that you can bake at home.\n\nWhether you go to those extremes or not, many homes make candy corn part of their Halloween festivities. \"Even the haters still want to have bowls of it at home because it signifies fall. There's this nostalgia thing. But if you ask them if they are going to eat it …\" ADM's Wright said.\n\n\"It's fun to observe this emotional reaction to this tiny little nothing candy,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/30/national-candy-corn-day-what-is-ingredients-halloween/75901462007/", "title": "What is candy corn? What is made of? Here's everything to know.", "text": "This story has been updated to correct a spelling typo of \"Chicken Feed.\"\n\nWednesday is National Candy Corn Day and there are plenty of ways to celebrate, whether it be by cracking open a fresh bag solo style or sharing a Halloween dessert adorned with the tri-colored kernels with friends.\n\nWhile National Candy Corn Day is celebrated each October 30, the sweet treat doesn't actually have Halloween origins. For years, candy corn was a cheap candy that all kids could enjoy, any time of the year.\n\nHere are some fun facts about the sweet treat, which some people love − and some people love to hate.\n\nWhat's the 'right' way to eat candy corn?\n\nThere are many ways to enjoy a piece of candy corn and fans feel strongly about their chosen methods. According to National Confectioners Association Director of Public Affairs and Communications Carly Schildhaus, 57% of participants said they eat a whole piece at once; 28% said they start with the narrow, white end; and 15% said they start with the wider, orange bottom.\n\nGen Xers claim candy corn as their favorite\n\nOf the generations, Gen X — adults born between 1965-1980 — is the most likely to eat candy corn during the Halloween season. 58% of Gen Xers told the National Confectioners Association in a 2020 survey that they'd choose candy corn other other Halloween treats.\n\nAs for the others, Boomers came in second (56%), followed by Gen Z (49%) and Millennials (46%).\n\nWhat is candy corn made of?\n\nSugar, corn syrup, salt, sesame oil, honey, artificial flavor, food coloring, gelatin and confectioner's glaze are the main ingredients in a single piece of candy corn. But looking beyond some of these households names may surprise some.\n\nGelatin is an animal-based product with high levels of protein, made up of animal bones, cartilage and skin. Manufacturers extract collagen, the fibrous protein that connects muscles, bones and skins, and then turn it into gelatin, which is without any flavor or color, according to MedicalNews Today.\n\nAnd as for confectioner's glaze, which is responsible for candy corn's shiny finish, this product is derived from bug secretion. Confectioner's glaze, also known as shellac, is made from lac-resin — a waxy, waterproof coating that the female lac bug produces for protection.\n\nAccording to Treehugger, a sustainability publication, female lac bugs suck sap from tree bark as they lay more than 1,000 eggs over a five-week period. The sap undergoes a chemical transformation in the bug's body so that when it is secreted, it hardens on contact with the air and creates a protective shell around the eggs. That hardened shell is what is harvested to make shellac.\n\nWhile the idea of bug secretion in candy may come as a surprise, it's actually quite common. Junior Mints, Whoppers, Milk Duds, Raisinets and Tootsie Rolls are just a few popular candies that contain confectioner's glaze.\n\nIs candy corn healthy?\n\nCandy corn does not provide any nutritional value, but eating a few pieces as part of a well-balanced diet won't hurt.\n\nOne serving of Jelly Belly's Candy Corn (25 pieces) is 100 calories, meaning one \"kernel\" is four calories. This serving contains 20 grams of sugar.\n\nThough the nutrition varies ever so slightly between brand to brand, the numbers are largely the same. One serving of Brach's Classic Candy Corn (15 pieces) is 110 calories, making one piece about 7 calories. This serving contains 23 grams of sugar.\n\nThe American Heart Association advises that men should consume no more than 36 grams of added sugar per day and women should not consume more than 25 grams.\n\nWhen was candy corn invented?\n\nCandy corn dates back more than 140 years.\n\nAccording to the History Channel, George Renninger, an employee at Wunderle Candy Company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, invented candy corn in the 1880s. However, it wasn't until 1898 when Goelitz Candy Company, now Jelly Belly, popularized the treat.\n\nInitially, Goelitz sold the candy as \"Chicken Feed,\" because before World War I, most Americans didn't associate corn with table food, according to the History Channel. For many of its early years, candy corn was a \"penny candy,\" a cheap treat that all kids could enjoy.\n\nIt wasn't even until the 1950s that candy corn became associated with Halloween, as up until that time, Halloween and candy weren't yet working hand in hand.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

I’m already having a sugar headache just thinking about it.\n\nCandy corn, that is -- the traditional Halloween sweet handed out by householders to the ghosts and goblins trawling the streets for gobs of goodies.\n\nProduced since the late 19th century, candy corn has long fascinated Americans. We buy so much – about 9 billion kernels, more than 35 million pounds each year – and yet it always seems to be the last candy left in the collection bag after the more tempting treats are taken. Why?\n\nPartly, it’s tradition – candy corn’s orange, yellow and white reflect the colors of fall, the harvest and Halloween. Partly, it’s because it’s relatively inexpensive.\n\nHalloween fave: 10 spookily sweet candy corn facts\n\n“It’s a nostalgic item,” said Lisa Brasher, president and CEO of the Jelly Belly Candy Company, one of the major candy corn manufacturers. “A lot of people were raised with candy corn in their childhood and they now want to share that tradition with their kids.”\n\nJelly Belly, formerly the Goelitz Confectionery Company, is the oldest existing candy corn manufacturer, having turned out the tasty treats since the turn of the century. But it was not the first.\n\n“The oral tradition that has been passed down,” said Brasher, “is that candy corn was first made by a gentleman named George Renninger from Wunderle Candy Company in Philadelphia in the 1880s.”\n\nGoelitz, which was started in 1869 by Brasher’s great-great-grandfather Gustav Goelitz, a German immigrant, began manufacturing candy corn in about 1898.\n\n“It was a revolutionary item back in those times,” said Brasher, “because it was made with three different colors.”\n\nThe ingredients are simple, based around sugar, corn syrup, food coloring, vanilla flavoring, waxes and confectioners glaze (to make it shiny) and a pinch of salt. The mixture is then heated to turn it into a liquid. Another major candy corn manufacturer, Brach’s, adds a little honey.\n\n“In the old days we would use open copper kettles over an open flame,” Brasher said. “We would make three of those open kettles, one for the white tip of the corn, one for the orange center of the corn and one for the yellow top of the corn.”\n\nIt was a very labor-intensive process, with the candy liquid being hand-poured, color by color, into the molds to be set. But in the 1930s, his muscles aching, Brasher’s grandfather invented an automated system.\n\nCandy corn party favors\n\nWith automation came huge amounts of candy corn. “We can make 28,000 pounds in an eight-hour shift,” Brasher boasts.\n\n“After the candy comes out of the molds it sets for about a day before it is shined with confectioners’ glaze and waxes,” Brasher added. “Then it sits another night before being packaged.”\n\nAnd then it goes from the company’s factory in North Chicago, Ill., into the hands of trick or treaters and tradition-loving adults. According to the National Confectioners Association, about 68% of people surveyed say that chocolate is their favorite Halloween treat, followed in second place by candy corn, at 10%.\n\nThen there is the matter of how it is eaten. Another National Confectioners Association poll found that about 47% of people eat the whole piece of candy corn at once while about 43% start by nibbling the narrow, white end. The other 10 percent? They begin by munching on the wider yellow end.\n\nAnd it’s not just at Halloween. “We sell candy corn year-round,” said Brasher, “but we definitely see a spike in our sales around the autumn season.”\n\nIn order to extend candy corn sales, Jelly Belly now has Reindeer Corn for Christmas (green, white, and red), Cupid Corn for Valentine's Day (pink, red and white) and Bunny Corn for Easter, which comes in a variety of pastel colors. Meanwhile, Brach’s makes Indian Corn for Thanksgiving, which is brown, orange, and white, as well as a variety called Autumn Mix.\n\nBoo! Halloween by the numbers\n\nSo why, I asked, is candy corn the last sweet treat left in the bowl after Halloween?\n\nBrasher did a masterful politician-like pivot. “Definitely chocolate is the most popular,” she said. “Candy corn is a nostalgia item. A lot of people were raised with candy corn in their childhood and they now want to share that tradition with their kids.”\n\nAs for Halloween, Brasher – known in her neighborhood as “the Candy Lady” -- is an equal-opportunity candy giver. “I love all candy, and I give out other brands of candy, not just mine.”\n\nLet the sugar headaches begin.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2023/10/15/halloween-candy-corn-iconic-treat/71146047007/", "title": "Candy corn: The Halloween candy that people either love or hate", "text": "Candy corn: Is it a treat or some kind of trick candy makers are playing on us?\n\nThe question arises because the candy is truly divisive. But those who love it are delighted by the arrival of Halloween.\n\nMichael Byars, a public radio host in Kansas City, Missouri describes candy corn as \"pure sugary deliciousness that reminds me of my youth – when everything was simple and easy and the worries and stresses and fears of adulthood weren’t even on the radar.\"\n\nOn the other side of the candy corn issue is Johner Riehl, a public relations executive in San Diego, California. \"As I look at a piece of candy corn, I feel bad for the sugar, corn syrup and industrial dye that were all congealed together to form a waxy, chewy and gross wedge that resembles (and tastes like) a safety cone more than it does a piece of corn,\" he said.\n\nMany of us are in the middle, like Mark Neese, a library assistant from Lansing, Michigan. \"Candy corn is something I never even think about until October, but I actually kind of enjoy it (in limited quantities),\" he shared. \"I don't think it deserves all the grief and disparagement it receives.\"\n\nCandy corn: An 'iconic Halloween treat'\n\nFor many, candy corn represents the reason for the Halloween season. Most of the 9 billion kernels, more than 35 million pounds produced annually according to past pronouncements by the National Confectioners Association, are eaten around Halloween.\n\nDuring the year, candy corn doesn't get much respect. But candy corn elbows its way onto center stage with the arrival of fall and advent of Halloween. It's the No. 3 rated Halloween treat, behind chocolate and gummy candy, the National Confectioners Association found in a July survey of 1,500 U.S. respondents (and an oversampling of parents).\n\n\"Whether you love candy corn or prefer to give yours away, there’s no denying that it’s one of the most iconic Halloween treats you can enjoy throughout the season,\" NCA spokesperson Carly Schildhaus told USA TODAY.\n\nCandy corn was the most popular Halloween candy last year on Amazon, garnering 16% of demand, followed by Gummy Bears, Sour Patch Kids and Skittles, according to ecommerce tech company Pattern. \"No other sweet captured more share of online consumer demand during the month of October 2022 than candy corn – a strong indicator of what we’re likely to see repeat this year,\" the company said in its report.\n\nAnd the love of candy corn can be seen online, too. On Instagram, there's more than 600,000 posts carrying the hashtag #candy corn displaying artwork, pictures, recipes and more about the candy.\n\nCandy corn: It's costing more this Halloween\n\nLike everything else, candy corn is costing more this Halloween season than in the past. Candy corn prices are up about 13% from a year ago, according to Platform. In comparison, Hershey's Kisses prices have risen 6.75% and Gummy Bears 5.58%, Platform found.\n\nBrach's Candy corn price were 19% higher than a year ago in transactions tracked by commerce data platform Attain, formerly named Klover. At Walmart, the candy was 11% higher, the company found. Data firm NIQ has similar findings: Candy corn prices were up 15% in the 52-week period ending Sept. 16, 2023, compared to the previous year.\n\nHalloween candy:What is the 'healthiest' option? Don't get tricked by these other treats.\n\nWhile candy corn makers say they plan to produce as much candy as in the past, sales by volume dropped about 8% in the most recent 52-week period compared to a year ago, according to NIQ, which tracks sales in U.S. supermarkets, drug stores and mass merchandise stores. But with price increases, consumers spent more on average, $2.62 per unit compared to $2.27 the previous year.\n\nCompared to chocolate, candy corn is a niche snack. While sales of chocolate topped $15.4 billion, during the 52-week period ending Sept. 16, 2023, candy corn sales hit $59.3 million. In comparison, candy canes ($127 million) and licorice ($411 million) also surpass candy corn in sales, according to NIQ.\n\nHigher prices won't likely deter those who love candy corn. But that sweet, waxy texture isn't for everyone. And investigating how the candy is made might give some pause – confectioner's glaze on the treat contains a bug secretion.\n\nWhat ingredients are in candy corn? Bones and bugs?\n\nNot technically. But maybe some disdain candy corn because it has some fairly scary ingredients. Of course, there's sugar, corn syrup, salt, sesame oil, honey, artificial flavor, and food colorings.\n\nTwo other ingredients? Gelatin and confectioner's glaze. Those two items have led some candy corn detractors to note that candy corn is made of animal hides and bones, like Jell-O gelatin. And confectioner's glaze, also known as shellac, is made from lac-resin, which – are you ready for this? – is a bug secretion.

But Brach's puts the caloric count at about 7, since 15 pieces add up to 105 calories on its packaging of Classic Candy Corn. That serving has 23 grams of sugar – experts recommend no more than 25 grams per day.\n\nHappy Halloween!:Celebrate spooky season with these 150 corny Halloween jokes\n\nThe origins of candy corn\n\nCandy corn cropped up in the late 19th century.

Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.\n\nMy own unscientific poll on X, formerly known as Twitter, found half of the 50 respondents said they loved candy corn. 40% agreed it was an \"abomination,\" while 10% \"could care less.\"\n\nPerhaps those who dislike it do so because of its texture and humdrum flavor. \"From a sensory perspective, the hatred of candy corn can be explained because, unlike many candies, its flavor profile doesn't incorporate contrast,\" Adams told USA TODAY. \"It's just intensely sweet-tasting, which can produce palate fatigue, like eating spoonfuls of honey or sugar.\"\n\nYet, for those who love candy corn, the treat can be transportive, says Adams, who recalls his mother eating just the white tips of each piece. \"Why is it loved as much as hated? If you grew up eating it, it probably has delightful associations in your mind,\" he said.\n\nAnd there's just something about candy corn. \"Even the haters still want to have bowls of it at home because it signifies fall. There's this nostalgia thing. But if you ask them if they are going to eat it …\" ADM's Wright said.\n\n\"It's fun to observe this emotional reaction to this tiny little nothing candy,\" she shared.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

The cobwebs have melded into your bushes. The skulls and skeletons have been thrown into a box until next year.\n\nAll that's left is candy. Piles and piles of candy. What are you possibly going to do with all of it?\n\nHere are five ideas for what to do with leftover Halloween candy.\n\nDonate it\n\nAllocate some favorites to keep, then gather the rest to donate to a worthy cause.\n\nYou'll find that many dentist offices work with Operation Gratitude, the Halloween Candy Buy Back program, or other organizations to gather the tooth-harming, sugar-filled candy and ship the treats to troops overseas. Check with your dentist, or find participating locations at operationgratitude.com.\n\nLook out for other organizations accepting donations, too, like the Ronald McDonald House, who can use the candy to offer sweet treats to families of children receiving medical care. The organization just asks the you contact your local House first to determine specifics for candy donations.\n\nBake with it\n\nGot a gathering coming up? In charge of dessert? No problem.\n\nThere are a gazillion recipes online for leftover Halloween candy. But let's keep it simple: Take any of your favorite recipes for cookies or brownies and stir in some chopped-up Reese's cups (you have those leftover?!), Snickers, Milky Way bars, M&M's, etc. before you bake them.\n\nYou can also freeze candy to use in recipes later.\n\nHost a pairing party\n\nYou worked hard on those costumes. You went went big for the trunk or treat. You endured trucking through the neighborhood in rain and cold weather—never missing a single house with a porch light on.\n\nYou earned that candy.\n\nHost a candy and wine pairing party or a candy and beer pairing party so see how the flavors work together. Not into booze? Who's up for a leftover candy party? Best recipe wins? Yes please!\n\nThe Growler Guys have a pairing guide for beers...like put Reese's cups with a porter or Kit Kats with brown ale.\n\nAnd Vivino has a guide for wine. M&Ms go well with a port wine and pair Skittles with a sauvignon blanc.\n\nCelebrity costumes:Kylie Jenner dresses daughter Stormi in glamorous Met Gala look for Halloween\n\nTime for Christmas movies! Here's how to watch all 40 new titles from the Hallmark Channel\n\n'Switch Witch' it\n\nKeep your kids from consuming too much sugar by having them leave their candy for the \"Switch Witch\" in an exchange for a special gift.\n\nThe Switch Witch is a twist on the Elf on the Shelf, mixed with a little Tooth Fairy magic. The idea, crafted by parents, follows the legend of the friendly \"Switch Witch,\" who visits with family the days leading up to Halloween. Then, on Halloween night, the witch takes the candy and leaves something better behind— and, you know, something a little healthier.\n\nThe Original Switch Witch kit with doll and storybook can be purchased on Amazon for $20. The Switch Witch also partners with Operation Gratitude and recommends that relinquished candy gets donated to a good cause (see idea No. 1).\n\nThis is also a good one if your kiddo has dietary restrictions or food allergies.\n\nSteal it for yourself\n\nOne recent survey of 2,000 parents revealed that two-thirds of respondents have stolen candy given to their trick-or-treating child.\n\nWe're guessing the other third is lying.\n\nThe survey also found the parents cover up their thievery by hiding it and hoping their child would forget about it, or pretending the candy vanished and saying they were inspecting it—you know, for safety reasons.\n\nWe understand this isn't the greatest idea, because parents don't really need the sugar either. But hey, steal it, then refer to ideas 1 through 3 above.\n\nFollow the latest from USA TODAY Parenting at usatoday.com/life/parenting.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2017/12/18/sydney-bogg-detroit-berkley-candy/924252001/", "title": "Former employees give historic Detroit candy store new life in Berkley", "text": "You can still see the signs for Sydney Bogg Chocolates outside a worn, idle brick building on Woodward near 7 Mile in Detroit.\n\nUnder a bright, red awning is the outline of a man stirring a kettle, with promises of \"chocolates,\" \"party candy\" and \"roasted nuts.\" A lightbulb-lined candy cane still hangs — one side faded to white — from the facade along Woodward. Inside, the aromas of melting chocolate and caramel popcorn, along with the equipment that made them, are long gone.\n\nFounded in 1936, this Detroit candy factory once had four stores across metro Detroit. It went out of business 15 years ago.\n\nThree longtime employees had started working there as teenagers. By the time Sydney Bogg closed, they were in their 40s, and they were experts: One at cooking, another in creating elaborate designs with icing, and the other at hand-dipping morsels in chocolate.\n\nRead more:\n\nFord Field top chefs leave stadium to launch premium chocolate company\n\nHistoric candy store sign uncovered in downtown Detroit\n\nDebbie Schlicker, the icing designer, received a call on her cell phone shortly after the closure. A Sydney Bogg customer had tracked her down.\n\n\"This woman begged me, 'Please, nobody does this. My daughter's getting married. ... I'll get you whatever you need — please, won't you do my daughter's wedding?'\" said Schlicker, now 58.\n\nUsing the kitchen of her Madison Heights home, she and her husband, Gary, (the cook) made barks, chocolates and her signature nonpareils — small, flat, round candies, each of which included the bride and groom's names spelled in icing. More people found out. And soon, the Schlickers were making 70-pound batches of candy on their home stove top.\n\n\"I got a big order for chocolate-covered Oreos that I couldn't do myself; it was like 1,000 Oreos,\" Schlicker said. \"So I'm trying to dip, and I call my sister (the dipper) up. ... We're sitting there and we've got bowls of chocolate right in front of us, and she's dipping these Oreos and she's going, 'Deb, this is illegal. We can't do this. We need to get a building.' \"\n\nToday, those three employees — Gary, 57, and Debbie Schlicker, and her sister, Lisa Peasley, 55 — are cranking out candy as the co-owners of Sydney Bogg's Sweet Essentials on 3233 West 12 Mile Road in Berkley. December is peak season at the growing business, and the shelves are loaded with chocolates, truffles, caramel-covered popcorn and more.\n\nSweet memories\n\nWhen she was 12, Clare Szymanski tried her first cinnamon-hot jawbreaker from Sydney Bogg's in Detroit. She remembers skipping class in high school and pooling money with friends to make runs to the candy store.\n\nNow 53, she regularly drives from Rochester Hills to Berkley so she can buy chocolates, caramels, nonpareils and chocolate-covered graham crackers.\n\n\"They're just as good,\" she said. \"They're the same.\"\n\nNot only are they made by the same people using the same recipes, but much of the same equipment is involved: When Debbie Schlicker went to collect personal items from the Detroit location, she found the door padlocked. But later, a friend saw movement in the building. Schlicker went down there and found that the Truan's Candies owner, Mark Truan, had purchased the building's contents.\n\n\"I said, 'Can I get my pictures of my kids out of here?' He said, 'Aren't you going to buy anything?' \" Schlicker said. \"I got on my phone with my sister and said, 'Get your credit card.' \"\n\nAmong the items were a fire mixer from about 1912, a cream beater from 1901 and a caramel cutter from roughly 1872, Peasley said.\n\n\"We're absolutely thrilled to be carrying on the Sydney Bogg tradition,\" she said. \"We have the job every kid dreams of, right?\"\n\nEven Sydney Bogg's daughter approves.\n\n\"I am so thankful for Debbie, Lisa and Gary for using the same recipes that I typed out on little 5-by-8 cards,\" said Joyce Thewalt, 78, adding that she remembers using a manual typewriter in the 1950s to record recipes. \"They believe in the quality of the candy.\"\n\nEnglish immigrant, chocolatier\n\nSydney Bogg was born in 1904 in England and arrived in Detroit in the 1920s. He started working at a refrigerator company. But he wanted to learn how candy was made, so he apprenticed under Howard Vair, owner of Vair-E-Best, a candy factory in Highland Park.\n\nBogg started making candy and selling it, at night, on city buses, Thewalt said in his obituary the Free Press published Feb. 11, 1988. Bogg's candy store opened during the Great Depression (1929-1939), and Debbie Schlicker said Bogg would offer candy one piece at a time, so people could afford some sweet comfort food.\n\nThewalt said that when she was a child, her family lived in a flat above the Woodward candy factory. During World War II, food rationing limited the amount of sugar and butter available, and she remembers taping up a sign that said \"Peanut brittle, 1/2 pound (per person), ready at 3 p.m.,\" and people would line up to buy it.\n\n\"In the late '40s at Halloween, if you would bring an apple to the back door of the candy store, Mr. Bogg would give you a candied one,\" Thewalt said.\n\nHer mother decorated the storefront for the seasons. Before Christmas, there would be a 50-pound, chocolate Santa Claus in the window, surrounded by hanging candy canes.\n\nThrough the years, the original Sydney Bogg factory expanded into neighboring units, taking over space previously used by a cemetery headstone maker and a hardware store.\n\nRalph Skidmore, a former employee who, like the Schlickers, met his spouse at the candy store, purchased the business in 1969. By the mid-1980s, the factory employed about 60 people. Easter was a big holiday, when they would churn out 16 tons of chocolate bunny rabbits, from three-quarter-ounce miniatures for 15 cents to a 75-pound beast for $250, the Free Press reported on March 26, 1986.\n\n\"And they will have made 4,000 Easter baskets and untold thousands of chocolate eggs, nutty butter-corn chunks, and chocolate and pecan caramel turtles,\" according to the article headlined, \"Work is sweet on the chocolate bunny trail.\"\n\nBeyond the factory in Detroit, Sydney Bogg expanded to stores at Great Oaks Mall in Rochester, Holiday Market Center in Royal Oak and Village Knoll Mall in Birmingham.\n\nFormer Free Press publisher Neal Shine listed “two 1-lb. bags (formerly three 1-lb bags) of Nutty Buttered Corn from Sydney Bogg” among his “incriminating items available to me in moments of dietary weakness” in a column Jan. 11, 1990. And former Free Press columnist Bob Talbert called Sydney Bogg’s chocolate turtlettes (a name used because \"Turtles\" is trademarked) “the best I ever had” in a piece on July 2, 1997.\n\nDebbie Schlicker said the business changed hands again in the 1990s before it went bankrupt in 2002, causing a number of orders to go unfilled. Thewalt of Grand Blanc said the Detroit location in its later years appeared to have focused more on gift cards and toys, and she thinks the candy's quality suffered, hastening the business' demise.\n\nDetroit in the mid-20th Century had numerous local chocolatiers and candy shops, such as Sanders and Henry-K Chocolates, and most no longer operate storefronts in the city. But the concept, in somewhat the same trendy vein as local craft breweries and farm-to-table restaurants, appears ripe for a comeback.\n\nBon Bon Bon opened a shop in downtown Detroit in 2015, offering artisanal treats made in Hamtramck. It was featured in Food & Wine, and founder Alexandra (Alex) Clark was featured in Forbes magazine's 30 under 30 last year. The Free Press reported this month that former Ford Field Executive Chef Joe Nader and his business partners have plans to open a chocolate bon bon storefront in Detroit. Today's Sydney Bogg\n\nThe Sydney Bogg's Sweet Essentials in Berkley, with about seven employees, is much smaller than the Detroit factory. Family members help pitch in during crunch time — such as December, when there's a surge in orders.\n\n\"When everything is handmade, and you get orders for 100 of this or 120 of that, then it's like, 'Oh boy, it's time to work,' \" Peasley said as she made dipped truffles and funneled out nonpareils the morning of Dec. 5, in a room visible through a large window facing 12 Mile.\n\nIn the next room, Gary Schlicker heated up the fire mixer to make Nutty Buttered Corn in a big, copper kettle. Light and brown sugar, and butter, were among the ingredients he stirred up before adding nuts and popcorn.\n\n\"This is a high-grade candy,\" he said, adding that he hopes to one day see the Nutty Buttered Corn sold at Detroit Tigers games.\n\nOn-site, the Berkley shop makes caramel, marshmallow, nougats, creams and more. The chocolate comes in huge, 10-pound bars from Peter's Chocolate. Peasley breaks them apart with a knife and drops into a tempering machine, which melts and smooths the chocolate into a velvety liquid.\n\nThe Detroit location also used Peter's Chocolate. That company was founded by Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter, who's credited with inventing the first successful milk chocolate by the 1880s, according to What's Cooking America and Nestlé.com.\n\nSzymanski said the \"pureness of the chocolate\" keeps her coming back.\n\n\"It's like a prescription: You need it because it makes you feel better,\" she said. \"My sister would text me and say, 'Where are you at?' and I'd say, 'I'm at Dr. Bogg's, I'm just picking up a script.' There's no Dr. Bogg, that’s just what we call him.\"\n\nPeasley said the business is growing, with about a 10% increase in orders per year. They've been there 12 years.\n\nRecently, they visited the old Detroit building to see about moving back. But Peasley said they would have had to put too much money into improvements.\n\nThewalt said that when she walks into the Berkley store, they say, \"Here comes the royalty.\"\n\nOn the walls, among stacks of chocolate boxes with gold ribbons, are pictures of Sydney Bogg and others connected to the candy maker.\n\n\"It smells just like my dad's store,\" Thewalt said. \"It smells just like chocolate and vanilla.\"\n\nContact Robert Allen on Twitter @rallenMI or rallen@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/community/2016/08/05/fair-parade-draws-crowds-despite-stormy-skies/88298926/", "title": "Fair parade draws crowds despite stormy skies", "text": "Brett Berntsen\n\nbberntsen@daily-times.com\n\nFARMINGTON — Crowds braved threatening skies this evening to watch the San Juan County Fair parade pass through downtown.\n\nMarking the start of the largest single-county fair in the state, the procession was led by the marching band from Piedra Vista High School and featured numerous groups with riders on horseback. The theme for this year was \"Blue Ribbon Selfies,\" and at least one float contained plywood cutouts of farm animals posing for cell phone photos. Commanding the most attention from the crowd, however, were the marchers passing out candy.\n\n\"It's better than Halloween for the kids,\" Farmington resident Jeannie Browne said. \"They get a whole bucket full.\"\n\nAnd while the human participants had plenty of gifts, the animals in tow left behind their own offerings on Main Street. As parade-goer Danny Zurface noted, the horses dropped several piles of \"road apples.\"\n\n\"Luckily, I don't see any kids running out after those,\" he said.\n\nThe fair is a tradition in San Juan County, with versions of the event dating to the 1880s, according to The Daily Times archives. That strong heritage contributed to the turnout today, despite comments on the fair's Facebook page warning of forecasts predicting heavy rain.\n\nAlthough Zurface and Browne brought umbrellas with them, the rain held off. But just as the two were packing up their collapsible lawn chairs near the conclusion of the event, members of the San Juan County Shrine Club zipped by on four-wheelers, spraying the crowd with water.\n\n\"We got wet anyway,\" Browne said. \"But it's OK, we love the Shriners.\"\n\nBrett Berntsen covers government for The Daily Times.
