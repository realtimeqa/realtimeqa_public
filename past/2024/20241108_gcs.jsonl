In February, pro-Russian separatist leaders issued an appeal to Putin for \"protection\" that \"echoed similar 'appeals' from inside Ukraine which set in motion the illegal Russian annexations of its territories\", said Chatham House experts.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

On one hand, the government in the capital Chisinau \"supported Ukraine and tailed Kyiv's move toward the EU. On the other hand, Moldova did little to provoke Russia, holding enormous sway over the country\".\n\nWith two crucial votes coming in the autumn, \"the country is awaiting Russian-led political turmoil\".\n\nEarlier this year, a move by the \"all-deputies congress\" in Tiraspol, Transnistria's capital, where pro-Russian separatists called on Moscow to stop the \"pressures\" coming from Chisinau, was dismissed by the Moldovan government as a \"Russian psyops\".\n\n\"What we've seen in Transnistria was a show put on so that the Kremlin has a reason to disrupt the situation in Moldova,\" lawmaker Oazu Nantoi of the pro-European ruling party PAS told the paper. \"We will see the meaning of this show later on.\"\n\nThe small eastern European country has a population of just three million and average monthly salary of less than $1,000, yet it has become \"ground zero in the battle between disinformation, much of it fuelled by AI, and elections\", said Politico.\n\nWhile other democracies fear foreign governments meddling in their affairs, for Moldova such interference has become an \"everyday reality\". Some, like national security adviser Stanislav Secrieru, fear that the ongoing interference efforts from Moscow may \"lay the groundwork among locals for a possible Russian invasion, at some point\".\n\nRussia still maintains around 1,500 troops in Transnistria, but for now has chosen to wage \"hybrid warfare\" in Moldova, \"whereby the Kremlin is using all available means of leverage and interference to impose its will – short of bombing the country\", said Josh Rogin for The Washington Post. Moscow has \"tried to orchestrate a coup, trained fake anti-government protesters, flooded the country with disinformation and funnelled illicit cash to pro-Russian opposition parties\".\n\nCould crucial votes decide Moldova's fate?\n\n\"Threatening Moldova's security, squeezing its economy and undermining its democracy\" are efforts that are \"all aimed at replacing its pro-Western leadership with a new government bought and paid for by the Kremlin\", said Rogin.\n\nThe crisis in Transnistria is expected to influence the upcoming presidential elections in October, when pro-European incumbent President Maia Sandu is set to see a run-off with one of the pro-Russian candidates. Towards the end of the year, voters are also set to pass judgement on whether they would like to join the EU in the future, after the bloc opened accession negotiations in December 2023.\n\n\"Both are opportunities for Moscow to strengthen its influence over the country and to subvert Moldova's possible integration into the EU,\" said Chatham House.\n\nThe head of Moldova's Information and Security Service said that in 2023 alone, Russia illegally channelled more than $55 million, or almost 0.4% of Moldova's nominal GDP, into influencing elections and buying votes in the country. This activity is expected to be turbocharged for elections this year, with the next few months a \"critical test for Moldova's internal resilience to Russian aggressive encroachment\", said the think tank.\n\nAround 60% of Moldovans now support such closer ties with the West. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has made Moldova – and the Harvard-educated Sandu – \"the poster children for the bloc’s march East\", said Politico, a move that \"hasn't gone unnoticed by the Kremlin and its local allies\".\n\nWhile EU accession would be difficult, it would be welcomed, as \"salvation can only come in the form of European integration and genuine strategic autonomy\", said Euronews's Claudiu Degeratu last year. \"The defence strategy of the Republic of Moldova and its armed forces have become the most critical priorities,\" he added. \"Moldova needs modern defence capabilities, assistance programmes and defence resources\", with which it \"could be one of the European success stories\".\n\nBut while Moldova tries to build ties with the West, it knows that its survival as a democracy is effectively tied to that of Ukraine.\n\n“It's not an issue of whether Russia wants to invade, it’s only an issue of if they can,\" Moldova's new Foreign Minister Mihai Popsoi told The Washington Post. \"God forbid, if the Russians would feel emboldened, clearly Moldova would be next. And after that, it's anybody’s guess.\"", "authors": ["Elliott Goat", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Richard Windsor", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/957717/what-could-we-expect-from-a-second-donald-trump-term?amp=", "title": "What could we expect from a second Donald Trump term? | The Week", "text": "There's an irony of sorts in Donald Trump retaining his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan in his third run for the presidency.

Could he be content to let his supporters fill in their own ideas of when America was ostensibly \"great,\" so long as they give him their votes, and their money? The truth is likely somewhere in the middle.\n\nFor all the nostalgic vagueness inherent in his now-infamous political mantra, there is no question Trump does indeed have concrete plans to achieve his sense of future \"greatness\" for the country. For as much as he's played fast and loose with specific policy details (to say nothing of follow-through), the once-and-potentially-future president has been clear in articulating the broad thrusts of a second Trump administration. And with just days to go before polls close on election night, the picture Trump has painted of his potential return to office is one of increasing authoritarianism and bristling isolationism.\n\nHere's what we can expect from a second Trump White House.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

He has made a point of attacking the independence of the Federal Reserve, claiming he \"understands monetary policy better than Fed Chair Jerome Powell,\" Bloomberg said. While \"impairing the Fed's credibility wouldn’t trouble Trump in the least,\" the voting public \"should indeed be troubled.\"\n\nInstalling thousands of loyalists throughout the federal government will help him \"take revenge on his enemies,\" said Rolling Stone, appointing an attorney general whose main job would be to go after anyone he feels has wronged him — from Joe Biden down.\n\nHis administration is open to letting states monitor pregnancies and prosecute women who get abortions. The New York Times reported Trump is making plans to enact mass deportations involving scouring the country for undocumented immigrants, detaining them in massive new camps, and swiftly expelling them. Rolling Stone said this would extend a \"historic power grab\" to legally enable the deployment of U.S. troops \"to carry out roles currently prohibited under federal law — including the arrest, detention, and transport of migrants at the southern border.\" Trump has also introduced the possibility of deploying military forces to target his domestic opponents — the \" enemy within \" — with alumni from his first administration affirming that he could very well do so.\n\nAxios reported that Trump's Justice Department would \"push to eliminate or upend programs in government and corporate America that are designed to counter racism that has favored whites,\" effectively reinterpreting Civil Rights-era laws and other measures aimed at promoting racial equality.\n\nMany of these policies are contained within Project 2025, a controversial document co-authored by more than 100 conservative organizations. It sets out four main aims: restore the family as the centerpiece of American life; dismantle the administrative state; defend the nation's sovereignty and borders; and secure God-given individual rights to live freely.\n\nUnpopular with the U.S. public at large, Trump has \"distanced himself\" from the proposals, despite a host of former advisers being contributors and his own vice-presidential running mate, J.D. Vance, writing the foreword.\n\nAnd abroad?\n\nFacing a \"maelstrom of woes,\" including the war in Ukraine and crisis in the Middle East, \"one prospect frightens European policymakers more than anything else: the return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency,\" said the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nThe think tank has set out a series of \"scary policy scenarios\" for a Trump second term. These include a Minsk 3.0 agreement in Ukraine making good on his promise to \"end the war in 24 hours\" by offering huge concessions to Vladimir Putin. A \"crisis in the South China Sea\" where a Trump administration ratchets up its rhetoric against Beijing, risking open conflict and a damaging trade war between the world's biggest economies. His move for \"total energy dominance\" that would link efforts to \"inspire an American economic and manufacturing renaissance with U.S. foreign policy goals.\" And he could carry through on his threat to pull the U.S. out of Nato entirely, with devastating consequences for European security, while pursuing a \"Making Israel great again\" policy in the Middle East.\n\nThese scenarios would represent the \"biggest test in transatlantic relations in postwar history,\" said Politico, and pose an \"existential risk to European unity as the tensions over how to work with the world's most powerful country pull the continent apart on issues ranging from trade policy to the fight against climate change to the defense of European territory.\"\n\nEvery election is billed as a national turning point, but this time that might genuinely be the case.\n\nTo his supporters, the prospect of Trump 2.0, \"unconstrained and backed by a disciplined movement of true believers, offers revolutionary promise.\" To the rest of the U.S. and much of the world, it represents an \"alarming risk\" which could bring about \"the birth of a new kind of authoritarian presidential order.\"", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Last Updated", "With Contributions From", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Joel Mathis", "Peter Weber", "Justin Klawans", "Chas Newkey-Burden"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/russia/956112/a-timeline-of-crimeas-annexation", "title": "A timeline of Crimea's annexation | The Week", "text": "Tomorrow marks eight years since Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, marking the biggest land-grab in Europe since the Second World War.\n\nAs the latest battle between Kyiv and the Kremlin rages on, here is a look back at how Vladimir Putin came to invade and take control of the disputed Black Sea territory.\n\nNovember 2013: Euromaidan protests\n\nIn November 2013, tens of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets of the capital Kyiv after the pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign a planned association deal with the EU, putting the brakes on Ukraine’s pro-European trajectory.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Kyiv’s city hall was occupied in the largest protests since the country’s Orange Revolution in 2004.\n\nThe wave of demonstrations continued, encompassing other cities and wider causes, including outcry against perceived government corruption and lack of accountability.\n\n18 to 20 February 2014: fatal crackdown\n\nThe continued protests were met with a brutal crackdown by the government, with an estimated 108 civilians killed, many by police snipers, peaking on 18 to 20 February. This led to the ousting of Yanukovych, who spent a week on the run before heading to Russia. Putin described the protests as a Western-backed “fascist coup” that endangered the ethnic Russians, particularly in Crimea.\n\nIndependence Square in Kyiv following the anti-government protests in February 2014 (Image credit: Vincent Mundy/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\n26 to 28 February 2014: Russian flag raised\n\nOn 26 February, Russia put 150,000 troops on high alert. The following day, armed men seized the parliament of the predominantly ethnic Russian Crimean Peninsula and raised the Russian flag. A day after that they took control of two airports in the region.\n\n1 March 2014: parliamentary approval to invade\n\nOn 1 March, Putin won parliamentary approval to invade Ukraine, responding to what he called a threat to Russian lives. “We consider the behaviour of the Russian Federation to be direct aggression against the sovereignty of Ukraine,” said Ukraine’s interim president at the time, Oleksandr Turchynov.\n\nJohn Kerry, then US secretary of state, condemned Russia’s “incredible act of aggression”. He “threatened economic sanctions by the United States and allies to isolate Moscow” but also “called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis”, reported Reuters at the time.\n\nWithin weeks, Putin had annexed the region – a move justified as a rescue operation. He also encouraged Russian separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk to fight Ukraine’s armed forces. It is estimated that more than 14,000 people have died in the civil war since.\n\nA headteacher stands in her destroyed school in the battered city of Luhansk in 2014 (Image credit: Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\n16 March 2014: disputed referendum\n\nOn 16 March, a disputed referendum found that an overwhelming number of voters in Crimea supported joining Russia – leading Putin to say that he would respect the people’s wishes.\n\nCrimea’s chief electoral official, Mikhail Malyshev, said the vote was nearly 97% in favour of joining the Russian Federation, with a turnout of 83%, reported the BBC. But Western leaders said the referendum was held in an atmosphere of intimidation after Russia had already violated Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty.\n\nThe vote was boycotted by many Crimeans loyal to Kyiv, and condemned as illegal by the EU and US. “We reject the ‘referendum’ that took place today in the Crimean region of Ukraine,” said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary at the time.\n\n17 March 2014: declaration of independence\n\nA day later, Crimea’s parliament formally declared independence from Ukraine and asked to join the Russian Federation.\n\n18 March 2014: treaty of accession\n\nThe following day, Putin signed a treaty of accession with Crimean leaders and declared that Russia was within its rights to reclaim Crimea.\n\n“In a speech to a joint session of the Russian parliament, he compared the move to the independence declaration of Kosovo in 2008 and the reunification of Germany in 1990 – but, in reality, this is the first time that one European nation has seized territory from another since the end of World War II,” reported The Washington Post at the time.\n\nUkraine’s foreign ministry said it did not “and never will recognise the so-called independence or the so-called agreement on Crimea joining the Russian Federation”.\n\n24 March 2014: rouble goes into circulation\n\nFollowing the annexation, Russia forced all Ukrainian banks in the region to close, leaving thousands of people without access to their savings, salaries and pensions.\n\nOn 24 March, the rouble was officially introduced and on 27 May it became the peninsula’s only legal currency. A year and a half later, the rouble was worth about half of what it was before the annexation.\n\n30 March 2014: new time zone\n\nOn the evening of 30 March, the peninsula skipped forward two hours to formally join Moscow’s time zone. Several hundred people gathered at the main railway station in Simferopol for the ceremonial change of time, “waving Russian national flags and chanting ‘Crimea! Russia!’”, reported Reuters.\n\nMore than anything, the clock change was “a symbol of the bigger shifts in the Crimean peninsula over the past few months”, said The Washington Post. By that time, Moscow was “already controlling Crimea’s currency and paying government salaries in Crimea” – now it controlled the time, too.\n\n11 April 2014: Kremlin-backed constitution\n\nOn 11 April, Crimean lawmakers voted to adopt a new, Kremlin-backed constitution.\n\n“All 88 deputies present in the 100-seat legislature broke into applause and stood for the Russian national anthem after approving the constitution in the vote at a session ignored by dissenting lawmakers,” said Reuters at the time.\n\nThe legislation stipulated that Crimea would “be fully integrated into Russia” by 1 January, following a short transition period.\n\n5 September 2014 and 12 February 2015: Minsk agreements\n\nFrance and Germany brokered the Minsk agreements in September 2014 and February 2015, signed by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany as a response to the annexation and fighting in Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\nThe agreements attempted to impose a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, Ukrainian control over its border with Russia, and special political status for parts of the two eastern regions. Amnesty was also given to the pro-Russia separatists involved in the fighting.\n\nSeven years later, on 22 February 2022, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreement “no longer” existed following his recognition of the independence of Luhansk and Donetsk.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Rebekah Evans", "Austin Chen", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/17"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/russia/958127/who-are-kremlin-insiders-jostling-replace-vladimir-putin?amp", "title": "Who could replace Vladimir Putin? | The Week", "text": "On June 23, 2023, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Russian private military organization the Wagner Group, headed a brief and mysterious uprising against Vladimir Putin's regime in Moscow. More than a year into Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the unsettling episode shook Putin's hold on power, and was followed by the inevitable reprisal. Prigozhin died two months later on August 23, 2003, along with six other passengers and three crew members, when his plane crashed in what most analysts believe was a deliberate act of sabotage ordered by Putin.\n\nToday, Putin remains in power, but Prigozhin's aborted coup — as well as a number of challenging developments for Russia in the Ukraine war, including an August 2024 incursion into the Kursk region of Russia by Ukrainian forces — stand as a reminder that his reign can't last forever. At 71, Putin is also entering the twilight of his life after dominating Russian politics for 24 years. A survey of more than 40 Russia experts conducted by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) in July 2024 found that 40% believe Putin will remain in power until he dies, while 23% expect a \"palace coup.\" Just 3% of experts believe that Putin will ever leave voluntarily. But regardless of how it happens, there are several alternatives who may someday replace Putin as president of the Russian Federation.\n\nMikhail Mishustin\n\nRussia's 58-year-old prime minister would be a logical choice for successor, and not just because he would become the interim president should Putin step away before his term ends. Mishuskin was also regarded as Putin's most likely successor by Russia experts in the RFE/RL survey. A trained economist, Mishustin spent a decade as head of the country's tax bureau before his appointment as prime minister in 2020. Mishustin has been muted about the Ukraine war, and focused largely on containing the fallout from Western sanctions placed on Russia since the February 2022 war began — but he was reportedly opposed to Putin's decision to invade. That might make him well-placed to keep the basic structures of the Russian authoritarian regime intact, while making a strategic retreat or settling on less favorable terms than Putin has been willing to countenance.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nSergei Sobyanin\n\nMoscow's long-time mayor, Sergei Sobyanin , has long been a rumored successor and was the second most popular choice among experts in the RFE/RL poll. The 66-year-old Sobyanin was born in Russia's Tyumen region and before embarking on a political career in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, worked in a metal pipe factory. A former regional governor who also served as Deputy Prime Minister of Russia between 2008 and 2010, Sobyanin is a close Putin ally and a member of his United Russia political party. His rise to prominence was helped by his \"ability to toe whatever lines Putin has set on key aspects of Russia's internal policies while staying mum on some of the tricky-to-navigate external policies,\" said Olga Kiyan of Russia Matters . What makes him a top-tier contender to lead Russia after Putin is his success in keeping \"Russia's capital running smoothly through mass opposition protests, the disastrous Covid pandemic and now regular Ukrainian drone attacks,\" said the Agence France Presse .\n\nDmitry Medvedev\n\nMedvedev served four years as Russia's president from 2008 to 2012 before stepping aside for Putin in what was later revealed to be a prearranged agreement. The Leningrad native and former law professor is perhaps Putin's longest-standing ally, and he accepted the subordinate role of Prime Minister from 2012 to 2020. Now the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, Medvedev has struck a belligerent tone about the war in Ukraine. \"This conflict will last for a very long time. For decades, probably,\" he recently said to Russian news agencies, per Reuters . He has also threatened a preemptive nuclear strike if Ukraine were to try to acquire its own nuclear stockpile. Questions remain, however, about whether someone who has been so subservient to Putin for so long could take or consolidate power. The Spectator 's Mark Galeotti recounted a joke purportedly making the rounds in Moscow, in which Medvedev looks for the steering wheel in a car and Putin pulls out a remote control from the passenger seat and announces he'll be the one driving.\n\nSergei Kiriyenko\n\nPutin's 62-year-old first deputy chief of staff is a jack-of-all-trades who was most recently given the job of managing the sham referenda in the regions Russia seized from Ukraine in 2022. In the 1990s, Kiriyenko was known as a liberal reformer, so much so that then-President Boris Yeltsin made him the country's youngest-ever prime minister in 1998. But Kiriyenko's tenure coincided with the country's worst post-Soviet financial crisis, and he was forced to step down after four months. During his brief turn in office, Kiriyenko made the fateful decision to appoint Putin as the head of the FSB, the successor institution to the KGB. As a Putin inner-circler, Kiriyenko would likely only get the top job if the succession process was managed by Putin or his allies.\n\nAlexei Dyumin\n\nDyumin, 52, cut his teeth as Putin's bodyguard in the 1990s before ascending to play various roles inside the Russian state, including deputy director of the military intelligence bureau GRU and governor of Tula Oblast. Dyumin was instrumental in spiriting pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych out of the country in 2014 after a pro-democracy uprising in Kyiv, and then served as a special forces commander in the successful operation to seize Crimea from Ukraine. Once a deputy to Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, extensive rumors said Dyumin would take the place of his former boss, though he did not ultimately get the position. Dyumin's rise to power is emblematic of how Putin operates, identifying allies and then shuffling them from one position of authority to another inside the sprawling Russian state. In 2016, Galeotti described \"a creeping process\" in which Putin's allies, including bodyguards, \"start getting appointed to key positions.\"\n\nNikolai Patrushev\n\nUntil May 2024, Patrushev was the secretary of Russia's Security Council. He was also a leading proponent of the idea that there is a Western conspiracy to weaken or possibly break up the Russian Federation. The 73-year-old has known Putin since they worked together in the KGB, and became a major strategist in both the 2014 and 2022 invasions of Ukraine. \"His ideas form the foundations of decisions taken by Putin. He is one of the few figures Putin listens to,\" said Tatiana Stanovaya to The Washington Post in 2022. \"Washington and London are again conniving with Nazism and fascism,\" Patrushev said in a March 2023 interview with Russian newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta. \"They have no qualms about using Ukraine to set Europe or the entire world ablaze in a belief that they can get away with anything.\" During the war, Patrushev traveled widely, seeking to shore up Russia's diplomatic position and playing a critical role in managing the alliance with China. But after he was replaced on Russia's Security Council by Sergei Shoigu, Patrushev's star seems to have dimmed. Patrushev's 46-year-old son Dmitry, currently the agriculture minister, is another rumored Putin successor.\n\nOther possibilities\n\nBefore his assassination, Prigozhin would also have been considered a potential successor; but in Putin's Russia, it is dangerous to be seen as having too much ambition. One name that has vaulted to the top of the potential successors list is Andrei Belousov , who was named Russia's new defense minister in May 2024. An economist by training, the 65-year-old Belousov had served as first deputy prime minister from 2021 until his appointment as defense minister. The change at the defense ministry likely means that Sergei Shoigu, the outgoing minister, is on the outs with Putin, particularly given the trajectory of the war he had been tasked with overseeing. Shoigu did not receive any votes in the RFE/RL survey of Putin successors. Another close Putin ally, Belousov would likely carry on with most of Putin's policies both inside and outside of Russia.\n\nThere is also Dmitry Kozak , a former deputy prime minister and now deputy Kremlin chief of staff, who reportedly worked out an agreement with Ukraine prior to the war that Putin rejected.", "authors": ["David Faris", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Nick Foulkes", "Simon Mills", "Justin Klawans", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Richard Windsor"], "publish_date": "2023/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/europe/transnistria-moldova-ukraine-russia-war-explainer-intl/index.html", "title": "How Transnistria, a Russian-backed region in Moldova, is getting ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA series of unexplained explosions have occurred in parts of Transnistria, a breakaway territory within Moldova that has housed Russian troops for decades, sparking fears that Moscow’s war could soon stretch beyond Ukraine and create a new theater of conflict in eastern Europe.\n\nTwo radio towers in the territory were damaged by explosions in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the Transnistrian Ministry of Internal Affairs said in a statement. On Monday, a series of explosions had been heard in Transnistria’s capital Tiraspol, near the Ministry of State Security building, according to Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti.\n\nUkraine described the blasts as a planned provocation by Russian security services. Ukraine has also blamed Russia for firing cruise missiles Tuesday at a bridge across the estuary of the Dniester River, suggesting Moscow is attempting to cut off the southwestern corner of Ukraine that borders Moldova.\n\nThe explosions, and a drip feed of comments by Russian officials regarding the region – including a senior Russian commander saying that the army’s plan to capture southern Ukraine would open up a land corridor stretching to Transnistria – have raised intense concern in Moldova that the disputed territory within its borders is included in Russian President Vladimir’s war strategy.\n\nTransnistria is unrecognized by the international community, which considers it a part of Moldova. But the Moldovan capital, Chisinau, essentially has no control over the territory, which declared itself a republic more than three decades ago.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the territory.\n\nA disputed land\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 resulted in the emergence of a handful of “frozen conflict” zones in eastern Europe – often-unstable regions where allegiances have been fiercely disputed since the creation of the 15 post-Soviet states.\n\nThose regions include the breakaway statelets of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, inside the territory of Georgia, and the slither of land along Moldova’s border with Ukraine known as Transnistria.\n\nThe territory – a 1,300 square mile enclave on the eastern bank of the Dniester River – was the site of a Russian military outpost during the last years of the Cold War. It declared itself a Soviet republic in 1990, opposing any attempt by Moldova to become an independent state or to merge with Romania.\n\nWhen Moldova became independent the following year, Russia quickly inserted itself as a so-called “peacekeeping force” in Transnistria, sending troops in to back pro-Moscow separatists there.\n\nWar with Moldovan forces ensued; the conflict ended in deadlock in 1992. Transnistria was not recognized internationally, even by Russia, but Moldovan forces left it a de facto breakaway state. That deadlock has left the territory and its estimated 500,000 inhabitants trapped in limbo.\n\nA Russian officer (left), a Moldavian soldier (center) and a Transnistrian solder (right) stand on guard in the security zone, separating Moldova and Transnistria along the Dniester River, in 2002. Yoray Liberman/Getty Images\n\nSince then, Transnistria has played host to thousands of Russian troops – currently estimated at 1,500 – and developed a reputation as a land lost to time, a Soviet wormhole within a young, transitional Moldovan democracy.\n\nIt has a flag, a constitution and a national bank, and celebrates its own independence day.\n\nThe major roads of its capital Tiraspol include Lenin Street, Strada Karl Marx and 25th October Street – commemorating the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. A towering statue of Vladimir Lenin stands in the middle of the city’s main square.\n\nTransnistria has long been powered by its industrial output, and its economy is heavily dependent on Russian subsidies.

A Russian-backed separatist enclave at the southwestern edge of Ukraine could now present a potential bookend to any Russian assault westwards from Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.\n\nRussia’s supposed “peacekeeping” presence in Transnistria, which has in practice seen the Kremlin prop up a puppet state that seeks to undermine Moldova’s sovereignty, has also mirrored Moscow’s pretext for invasions in Georgia and Ukraine.\n\nAlarm bells in Moldova and the West grew louder following familiar refrains from the Kremlin that the rights of ethnic Russians were being violated in Transnistria – another argument used by Putin to justify his February invasion of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, which contained two breakaway Russian-backed statelets.\n\n“Allegedly there, in Moldova, the rights of Russian-speakers are violated,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an address last Friday. “Although, to be honest, the territory in which Russia should take care of the rights of Russian-speakers is Russia itself: Where there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of choice. Where there is simply no right to dissent. Where poverty thrives and where human life is worthless.”\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine, Western nations immediately watched activity in regions beyond the country, including Transnistria.\n\nSoldiers celebrate the anniversary of their unrecognized country's indepedence.

(Armed Forces of Ukraine) know this and are working on this.”\n\nBut the most direct and unambiguous statement on the region to date came from Russia’s Central Military District Maj. Gen. Rustam Minnekaev on Friday.\n\nRussian state news agency TASS quoted the general as saying the country’s aim was to create a land corridor between Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region and Crimea, adding that control over Ukraine’s south would give Russian forces access to Transnistria – a strategy that many in Chisinau had long feared was Putin’s goal.\n\nBut the most direct and unambiguous statement on the region to date came from Russia’s Central Military District Maj.

Sergei Gapon/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Obviously, this case is one of a number of provocative measures organized by the FSB (the Russian security service) to instil panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment,” it said.\n\nTwo radio towers were subsequently damaged on Tuesday morning. The site where the explosions occurred is known as the “Transnistrian radio and television center,” which was built in the 1960s and is one of 14 Soviet-era radio transmitting centers, according to the Transnistrian Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nUkraine also blamed Russia for firing cruise missiles Tuesday at a bridge across the estuary of the Dniester River. The road and rail bridge links Odesa with the far southwest corner of Ukraine bordering Moldova; the damage essentially cuts the region off.\n\nMaksym Marchenko, head of the Odesa region military administration, said Russia had used three missiles, one of which had struck the bridge. “By his actions, the enemy is trying to cut off part of the Odesa region and create tension amid the events” in Transnistria, Marchenko said. Another attack on the bridge did further damage on Wednesday.\n\nMoldova’s President Maia Sandu on Tuesday condemned the attacks within Transnistria, calling them “provocations” aimed drawing the country into “actions that can endanger peace.”\n\n“Our analysis shows that there are tensions between forces inside that region interested in destabilizing the situation. This makes Transnistria vulnerable and creates risks for the republic of Moldova,” she said at a press briefing following an emergency meeting of the country’s Security Council.\n\nSandu listed a number of events that proceeded this week’s explosions, including several bomb alerts at schools and medical facilities.

Turkey’s government has balked, however, accusing Sweden of being too lenient on terrorist organizations such as Kurdish groups linked to a 2016 coup attempt in Turkey.\n\n“My message is that Sweden has delivered, and the time has come to ratify Sweden,” Stoltenberg said.\n\nThe summit, with Zelenskyy as the headliner, drew leaders from more than 40 European nations. Zelenskyy urged the West to continue supporting his military, saying the effort was saving lives and “literally accelerating peace.” He said all countries that border Russia should be full members of the European Union and NATO because Moscow “tries to swallow only those who are outside of the common security space.”\n\n“When there are no security guarantees, there are only war guarantees,” he said.

US and allies disagree: Live updates\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∙ Russian track cyclists Anastasiia Voinova and Mariya Novolodskaya, who won medals at the Tokyo Olympics, were ruled ineligible for International Cycling Union events starting Thursday for breaching rules monitoring their neutrality during the war on Ukraine. The world championships are set for August in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\n∙ Inflation dropped to 6.1% May in the 20 countries that use the euro currency, a continued encouraging sign after reaching double digits in October partly because of the war in Ukraine. The April figure was 7%.\n\n∙ A video of a rocket crashing straight down on a busy Kyiv street is a reflection of daily life in the Ukraine capital since Russia's invasion began more than 15 months ago. The rocket narrowly missed a direct hit on a vehicle, and other cars are seen driving around the debris as locals shrug off the assault. Kyiv and many Ukraine cities have been relentlessly hammered by Russian attacks − but life goes on.\n\n∙ Russian strikes across Ukraine over the past day have killed seven civilians and wounded 31, according to Ukrainian officials. Attacks in Kyiv alone killed at least three civilians, including a 9-year-girl and her mother as they waited to enter a locked air-raid shelter, and injured 16 people, Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said. Children's Day events in the city were canceled.\n\n∙ The ban on entry of trucks from Ukraine and 19 other European countries into Russia will be extended until the end of the year, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov said.\n\nZelenskyy's next big project: Ukrainian Sky Shield\n\nZelenskyy was already promoting his next big request, the Ukrainian Sky Shield, during Thursday’s summit. If recent history is a guide, he's highly likely to get it.\n\nIf recent history is a guide, there’s a high likelihood he’ll get it.\n\nZelenskyy was initially denied when asking for longer-range weapons like the American HIMARS rocket launcher, was turned down when pleading for advanced tanks like the German Leopard 2 and rebuffed when begging for F-16 fighter jets. The Ukrainian president eventually got them all.\n\nThe respect Zelenskyy commands is noticeable in a video sent from his Twitter account that shows him casually joining four other European leaders – Rishi Sunak of the U.K., the Netherlands’ Mark Rutte, Mette Frederiksen of Denmark and Belgium’s Alexander De Croo – in a conversation at the summit.\n\nZelenskyy’s the only one not dressed in business attire, but he’s greeted warmly and gets their attention.\n\nIn the tweet, he says, “We discussed issues related to the start of training of (Ukrainian) pilots on F-16 and other types of aircraft. We agreed to continue working on an official decision to create the Ukrainian Sky Shield coalition of combat aircraft at the next meeting in the Ramstein format after further consultations with the (U.S.) side.’’\n\nDon’t bet against him.\n\nHow Russians deport Ukrainians from their own country\n\nYour country has been invaded and your home has been destroyed. You manage to escape and survive in the basement of a nearby building. Soldiers force you out of your shelter and you are directed to a bus, destination unknown. At every stop, you are photographed, searched and questioned. Eventually, you are left to fend for yourself in the country that destroyed your home and killed your neighbors.\n\nThis is the story of Russia's deportation of Ukrainians. Read more here.\n\n− Karina Zaiets, Ariana Torrey and Ramon Padilla\n\nPutin opponents may be getting more daring\n\nThe Soviet-era-style penalties Russia has imposed for “discrediting’’ the military – code for criticizing the war in Ukraine – have silenced many a voice of dissent.\n\nStill, some opposition politicians occasionally speak up. The latest is Boris Nadezhdin, who has frequently condemned the conflict and last weekend called for President Vladimir Putin to be voted out in next March’s elections so Russia could restore its relationship with Europe.\n\nThe British Defense Ministry said this is probably the first time anyone has gone on state-approved TV and urged for Putin's replacement since the war began.\n\n“However, there is a realistic possibility that recent vitriolic rhetoric by nationalist figures such as Wagner Group owner Yevgeny Prigozhin is emboldening opposition figures to challenge taboo topics,’’ the ministry said.\n\nRussian foes of Putin conduct more raids in Russian border towns\n\nRussian anti-government armed groups said Thursday they were conducting another combat operation on Russia's Belgorod border region. The fighters of the Russian Volunteer Corps said on Telegram that its fighters hit Russian government offices with multiple-launch rocket systems. The Free Russia Legion said it was preparing to cross the Russian border near Grayvoron, a town of about 6,000 people the legion previously attacked.\n\n\"Very soon, we will advance again on the territory of Russia to bring freedom, peace and tranquility,\" the group said on Telegram. \"Grayvoron is only the beginning.\"\n\nRussian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the attacks as \"unable to have any effect on the course of the military operation.\" Russia’s Defense Ministry said groups of Ukrainian fighters attempted to enter Belgorod province but were repulsed. The largest contingent consisted of about 70 men, five tanks and four armored vehicles, the ministry said.\n\nBiden administration officials have repeatedly said the U.S. does not support strikes on Russian soil.\n\nChechen fighters filling void as Wagner mercenaries move on\n\nThe Russian military command has apparently ordered Chechen Republic head Ramzan Kadyrov’s forces to begin offensive operations in Ukraine after the withdrawal of Wagner Group forces from Bakhmut, a Washington-based think tank said in its latest assessment of the war.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said Kadyrov claimed Chechen forces received a new order and assumed responsibility over the front line in the region. Chechen forces have been largely operating in the rear in recent months after fighting in high-profile battles, including the seizure of Mariupol. The Kremlin may also be trying to sever Kadyrov’s relationship with Wagner financier Yevgeny Prigozhin and reemphasize federal authority over Chechen forces, the assessment says.\n\nBlinken supports Ukraine at NATO meeting\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at a NATO conference in Norway, said Ukraine's allies are focused on helping Ukraine strengthen its medium- and long-term security capacity so that \"if and when\" the war ends, Ukraine has the full capacity to deter future invasions. Blinken said a path toward NATO membership for Ukraine was discussed and that he anticipates it will draw more attention at the NATO summit next month in Vilnius, Lithuania.\n\n\"There will be a very strong package of support on both the politcal side and the practical side when the leaders get together in Vilnius.,\" he said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/01"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/959545/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-4-february-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 4 February 2023 | The Week", "text": "1. PM ‘wants to ban asylum appeals’\n\nRishi Sunak is “gearing up to battle with the courts” over plans to prevent migrants who have crossed the Channel in small boats from appealing their deportation, said The Times. The Home Office has shortlisted two options to achieve the PM’s goal of automatically barring people who arrive in Britain illegally from claiming asylum. One would withdraw the right of illegal arrivals to appeal against their automatic exclusion from the asylum system, the second would allow them to lodge an appeal after they had been deported.\n\n2. US angry over ‘spy balloon’\n\nThe US Secretary of State has said China’s decision to fly an apparent spy balloon over the US is “unacceptable and irresponsible”. Antony Blinken has also cancelled a trip to Beijing, which would have been the first high level US-China meeting there in years. China earlier expressed regret, saying it was a weather airship that had been blown astray into American airspace. However, said the Pentagon, another Chinese spy balloon was spotted over Latin America.\n\n3. Missing mum ‘fell into river’\n\nPolice searching for missing Nicola Bulley have vowed to “bring her home” as they called on members of the public to keep a look out for sightings of her clothes. Officers believe the 45-year-old mother-of-two “sadly” fell into the River Wyre while she was walking her dog last Friday morning. A major search for Bulley continues, but no trace of her has been found. Her partner Paul Ansell, 44, said that the family had been living in “perpetual hell”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

FTSE shuts on record high\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed at a record high yesterday after unexpectedly positive employment data from America boosted Britain’s biggest listed companies. The benchmark UK index reached its highest ever intra-day level of 7,906.58 — beating the 7,903.5 points set on May 22, 2018 — around an hour after the jobs figures were released. London’s blue chips have “enjoyed a good run so far this year”, said The Times, having gained more than 5% already.\n\n5. Labour to leverage Starmer background\n\nLabour will position itself as tough on crime, leveraging Sir Keir Starmer’s history of prosecuting the country’s worst criminals. Later this month, the party will launch a “prevent, punish, protect” message. It will spotlight policies that it has already launched but thinks have not yet cut through to voters. Party chiefs have not ruled out announcing new policies at the same time. Starmer’s background as director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013 “landed well in focus groups” said a source but “people are still learning that about him”.\n\n6. Johnson tells Sunak to cut taxes\n\nRishi Sunak should cut taxes and “get the economy growing again”, said Boris Johnson. In an interview with the Tory MP Nadine Dorries, the former PM said he had “no doubt” his successor would reduce the burden of taxes on families. Johnson also insisted that when he left office in September last year the government finances had been “pretty robust” with “scope to do all sorts of things”. He said the Tories could win the next election and described Sir Keir Starmer as “Old Sir Crasharooney Snoozefest”.\n\n7. Europe warned of fentanyl influx\n\nA “flood” of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that has killed more than 100,000 people in the US, is on its way to Europe, said The Times. Belgium is the “front line” of narcotics arriving from Latin America, and its customs chief says that fentanyl is a bigger threat than heroin or cocaine. The highly addictive opioid has caused 110,236 overdose deaths in the US in the last year.\n\n8. Jury clears Musk over tweet\n\nA US jury has ruled that Elon Musk is not liable for losses experienced by Tesla shareholders following his “funding secured” tweet from 2018. Musk faced a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Tesla shareholders who argued he misled them with his posts in August 2018. The unanimous verdict by a California jury ends a three-week long trial. Writing on Twitter, Musk posted: “Thank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed!”\n\nA German football coach has been unmasked as a Russian double agent, said Der Spiegel. Carsten Linke, a 52-year-old father of two, is the alleged double agent in BND, Germany’s foreign intelligence service, arrested for treason last December. He is suspected of passing on top-secret intelligence to Moscow, some of which is believed to be related to Ukraine, but in his home town of Weilheim in Bavaria, he coached several youth teams and told anyone who asked that he was a soldier.\n\n10. Women ‘snub Clarkson quiz’\n\nA celebrity special episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? has been scrapped after female stars refused to work with host Jeremy Clarkson. At least three female stars made it “very loud and very clear” that they did not want to be on TV with the host after his recent comments about Meghan Markle, said The Mirror. Writing in The Sun, the broadcaster had said that he wanted Meghan to be “paraded naked through the streets” and “dreams of people throwing excrement at her”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Us", "Harold Maass", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/956874/why-viktor-orban-declared-state-of-emergency-ukraine", "title": "Why has Viktor Orbán declared a state of emergency over Ukraine ...", "text": "Viktor Orbán has declared a state of emergency in Hungary, introducing a wide-ranging windfall tax to combat a cost-of-living crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe newly re-elected prime minister told MPs that the measures would give him the power to respond with “real guts” to the looming crisis.

This requires room for manoeuvre and immediate action.”\n\nEra of the strongman\n\nOn the surface, the new measures are intended to ensure that Orbán and his government can “respond more quickly to challenges created by the war in neighboring Ukraine”, Politico reported.\n\nThey hand the prime minister direct power to “approve measures by decree”, a lever he described to MPs as being necessary to tackle the oncoming “economic crisis”.\n\nHe later announced a “windfall tax on all banks, insurers, telecoms, airlines and energy trading companies”, The Times reported, which will be used to create two “defence” funds to avoid “drastic price increases” and to strengthen the army “immediately”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nBut critics said “the move will only serve to tighten Orbán’s grip on power”, Politico added, “threatening fundamental rights and diminishing the importance of parliament”.\n\nThe prime minister has sought to downplay these fears, telling MPs yesterday: “We have seen that the war and sanctions from Brussels have brought about a great economic upheaval and drastic price rises. The world is on the brink of an economic crisis.\n\n“Hungary has to stay out of this war and has to protect the financial security of families,” he said, adding that the increased powers “will allow the government to react immediately and protect Hungary and Hungarian families by all possible means”.\n\nHaving governed Hungary since 2010, Orbán “enjoys almost complete control of his country’s political system”, The Economist reported.\n\nIn the April election in which he retained power, his party “held on to its two-thirds share of the seats in parliament, a super-majority that allows it to change the constitution at will”.\n\nHis warnings over “inflation and economic upheaval” as a result of the war in Ukraine are not necessarily misplaced, the paper added. But he “likes a crisis, so long as it lets him rule by decree”.\n\nUncertain territory\n\nMissing from the crisis declaration was any recognition of “Russia’s guilt in launching the war”, The Economist said. But Orbán “is, by a long chalk, the most Russia-friendly leader in the EU”.\n\nThis close relationship has been borne out in Orbán’s refusal to discuss the EU’s proposal for an embargo on Russian oil at a summit of member states next week.\n\nIn what came as a “fresh blow to the union’s efforts to win backing for its landmark sanctions package”, the Financial Times reported that the Hungarian strongman wrote to European Council President Charles Michel outlining how his country “could not support the sanctions without more detail on the EU financing available to help Budapest”.\n\n“Discussing the sanctions package at the level of leaders in the absence of a consensus would be counterproductive,” Orbán wrote in the letter seen by the paper. “It would only highlight our internal divisions without offering a realistic chance to resolve differences. Therefore, I propose not to address this issue at the next European Council.”\n\nOrbán’s historically close relationship with Putin forced him to rethink his election messaging in the run-up to April’s vote.\n\nHis popularity has since been buoyed “by price caps and controls on food and energy”, The Times said. But the looming danger is that “these look increasingly unrealistic as costs soar due to supply disruption and the rising costs of energy”.\n\nHome front\n\nOrbán’s critics have been quick to hit back at the new state of emergency measures.\n\nThe Hungarian Helsinki Committee (HHC), a rights organisation, said in a statement that it provides “yet another carte blanche mandate” to override the parliament.\n\nThe Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (TASZ) warned the state of emergency in Hungary “has become permanent”, a reference to emergency measures imposed during the Covid-19 crisis that were due to expire on 1 June.\n\nOrbán is being handed “more leeway than usual” by the new measures, the group said, adding: “The government has already used the special legal order to achieve its own goals of power, and it was not driven by the desire to protect citizens.”\n\nHaving served as prime minister for more than a decade, Orbán’s government has “already been under EU scrutiny for democratic backsliding”, EU Observer said.\n\nHe “hardly seems to need more power”, The Economist added. But he has laid all of the groundwork to constantly “bypass parliamentary scrutiny” and “rule by decree”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Justin Klawans", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Richard Windsor", "Peter Weber"], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/15/soviet-unions-collapse-15-nations/6719137001/", "title": "Soviet Union's collapse formed 15 nations: A guide to Eastern Europe", "text": "In launching an attack on Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the United States and its Western allies of ignoring the Kremlin's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO.\n\nUkraine has a long and complicated history in relation to Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin crafted its own narrative about Ukrainian identity to justify its interference in the country.

However, it would be a “long and bumpy ride – through indyref2, a divorce deal with London and an application to Brussels”.\n\nDespite calls to fast track accession for Scotland, the legal process for joining the EU as set out in Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), also known as the Copenhagen criteria, “does make it clear that Scotland would not be able to formally submit an application for membership to the council until it had become an independent European state, meaning that the process could start only once Scotland had finalised its secession from the UK”, said Kelly Shuttleworth on the constitutional website Verfassungsblog.\n\nIf the UK’s Brexit divorce from the EU is any guide, an optimistic estimate would be for Scotland’s separation from the UK to be settled within two to three years, with an application to join the EU taking four to five years after that.\n\nDr Kirsty Hughes, director of the Scottish Centre on European Relations (SCER), said a successful bid for EU membership in four to five years is realistic, although this would represent a “best case scenario”, said The Independent.\n\nOnce it had successfully applied, Scotland would then have to decide whether to hold a final referendum on membership.\n\nCurrently, there are mixed messages from leading SNP figures, with Sturgeon stating she does not think a vote on EU membership would be necessary, given that 62% of Scots voted against Brexit in 2016. However, it has become accepted practice for accession states to hold a referendum so there would be pressure to carry on this tradition, which would also provide added legitimacy.\n\nThe obstacles\n\nThe EU’s Copenhagen criteria demand that prospective members have a stable democracy, a functioning market economy and are willing to sign up to the basic aims of the EU.\n\nHowever, “despite its unique history, it would have to follow the normal path to EU accession”, said Anthony Salamone in a blog for LSE, citing opposition to the euro and fisheries as potential flashpoints in any negotiations with Brussels.\n\nLeaving the UK\n\nFirst up, is the very large obstacle of actually leaving the United Kingdom. The Westminster government is against a referendum taking place and polls suggest there is not overwhelming support for independence north of the border.\n\nEuro\n\nShould the SNP get its way, the currency question in particular, “which caused the Yes side such big problems during the 2014 referendum, seems to freak people out”, said The Independent. It cited a 2020 YouGov poll that found most Scots want to keep using the pound, with only 18% in favour of switching to the euro.\n\n“An awful lot of persuasion will be required to soften Scots up on the idea,” said the news site.\n\nDeficit reduction\n\n“Another area which might be of major concern though is public finances,” said Euronews.\n\nNew EU members are expected to work towards cutting budget deficits to 3% or less so “an independent Scotland could risk beginning its new life with a much higher deficit than EU rules normally allow”, said the site.\n\nFree movement\n\nAnother contentious area would be free movement of people from the rest of the EU. Salamone said the Scottish government “would probably seek a special arrangement on the Schengen Area in order to maintain the Common Travel Area between Ireland, Scotland and [the rest of the] UK.\n\n“In the post-Brexit context, it is difficult to imagine the EU granting a treaty-level opt-out, but perhaps a model of deferred participation could be agreed,” he added.\n\nBorder with England\n\nOne major difference between the last independence referendum and a future one would be the thorny issue of a hard border between Scotland and England, with one country inside the EU and the other outside.\n\nAs the recent experience over the Northern Ireland Protocol has shown, the EU sees maintaining the integrity of its single market as a red line it will not cross, even if it means dividing communities and putting up barriers to trade between member and non-member states.\n\n“Regarding the Scottish context then, the EU would most likely look to apply similar border arrangements seen on the Slovenian – Croatian border,” said Darryn Nyatanga, in another LSE blog. “This would entail the need for new infrastructures on the land border between Scotland and the rest of the UK, to ensure that checks are carried out on goods and to protect against illegal activities such as smuggling.”\n\nOpposition from other EU member states\n\nEuronews said on the European side, “any agreement between Edinburgh and Brussels would require the blessing of all member states, with some countries, particularly Spain, having their own separatist problems to consider”.\n\nHowever, Hughes told the news site that “Spain would be fine about [a] membership application as long as the independence process had been legal and constitutional”.\n\n“If London isn’t internationally recognised in Scotland and if Scotland is somehow leaving the UK without a negotiated divorce, then that will be very messy indeed,” she said.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Richard Windsor", "Peter Weber", "Sorcha Bradley"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}]}

Hours after Trump's victory, advocacy groups were setting their sights on the president-elect, who will take office Jan. 20.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which fought many controversial Trump policies during his first administration, said Wednesday that it already has a battle plan and would take action \"the minute he takes the oath of office.\"\n\nKris Brown, president of the gun-safety group Brady, called Trump's election \"troubling\" but pledged to continue the fight to prevent gun violence: \"Even though we won’t have a friend in the White House, Brady isn’t giving up an inch.\"\n\nSierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous called Trump's first term a \"disaster for climate progress\" and pledged to \"challenge Trump’s dangerous proposals in court (and) keep the pressure on banks and big corporations to clean up their act.\"\n\nThose advocacy groups will be facing a president whose party could emerge with majorities in the the House and Senate. GOP candidates picked up several pivotal Senate seats, including in West Virginia and Ohio, to seize control of the Senate. Results were still coming in for dozens of tightly contested House seats, but Speaker Mike Johnson issued a statement saying the \"latest data and trends indicate that when all the votes are tabulated, Republicans will have held our majority.\"\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage of the presidential election and downballot fights.\n\nBiden congratulates Trump, invites him to White House\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday called President-elect Donald Trump to congratulate him on his election victory and invited him to a meeting at the White House during the presidential transition period – an invitation which Trump did not extend to him just four years ago.\n\nBiden’s outreach to Trump isn’t necessarily unusual – outgoing presidents traditionally meet with their successors before the formal inauguration. But it comes after Trump refused to extend a similar invitation to Biden during the 2020 presidential election. Trump also promoted fraudulent claims that the election was stolen and skipped Biden’s inauguration.\n\n“President Biden expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together,\" the White House said in a statement about the phone call.\n\nTrump Campaign Spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed the call, saying in a statement that “President Trump looks forward to the meeting, which will take place shortly, and very much appreciated the call.”\n\nThe White House has yet to be set a date for Trump and Biden’s encounter. Biden plans to address the country on Thursday to discuss the presidential transition efforts.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump, Zelenskyy speak for first time after election with Ukraine's future in doubt\n\nWASHINGTON − Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday he spoke with President-elect Donald Trump and congratulated him on his decisive election win as the Ukrainian leader seeks continued U.S. support for his country's war against Russia.\n\nZelenskyy, in a post on X, said he had an \"excellent call\" with Trump and \"congratulated him on his historic landslide victory,\" adding that \"his tremendous campaign made this result possible.\"\n\n\"I praised his family and team for their great work,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation. Strong and unwavering U.S. leadership is vital for the world and for a just peace.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has pumped billions of dollars in military support into Ukraine two and a half years after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of the neighboring country. But future U.S. aid for Ukraine is in doubt after the election of Trump, who has a history of flattering statements about Putin and would not say during a September presidential debate whether he wants Ukraine to win the war.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nPelosi: 'We all pray for America's success'\n\nFormer House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., issued a statement Wednesday acknowledging Trump's victory and committing to a peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"We all pray for America's success under the next Administration,\" she said. \"The peaceful transfer of power is the cornerstone of our democracy. After every election, we all have a responsibility to come together and find common ground.\"\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nBernie Sanders blames Democrats for their losses\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-V.T., blasted the Democratic Party for its presidential and Senate election losses on Tuesday night, arguing that it had moved away from its roots supporting America’s middle and lower class.\n\n“It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” said Sanders, the most prominent progressive lawmaker in Congress. He mentioned concerns about access to healthcare, automation eliminating blue-collar jobs and the war in Israel.\n\nThe strong rebuke comes after Sanders endorsed President Joe Biden, and then Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s nominee earlier this year. When Harris unveiled her economic plan earlier this year, Sanders said he was “impressed,” and called it “an excellent start.”\n\nSanders did not mention either Harris or Biden in his statement, instead targeting it at the party’s infrastructure.\n\n“Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign?” Sanders questioned. “Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not.”\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris: 'When we lose an election, we accept the results'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday conceded the 2024 election, promising a peaceful transfer of power.\n\n“The outcome is not what we hoped for, worked for or voted for, but the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting,” Harris said during a concession speech at Howard University, her alma mater, in Washington, D.C. \"The fight for our country is always worth it.\"\n\n\"I am so proud of the campaign we ran,\" Harris told the crowd, to enthusiastic applause.\n\nHarris called on young people to continue to fight to make the “world a better place” while vowing to continue her fight for the freedoms she laid out during her campaign, including abortion rights and gun control.\n\n“While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,” she said. “We will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square, and we will also wage it in quieter ways, in how we live our lives, by treating one another with kindness and respect.\"\n\n\"Do not despair,\" she added. \"This is a time to mobilize.\"\n\nWhen Harris said the country may be entering a dark period, a smattering of attendees responded, \"We are.\"\n\nTrump was announced the winner of the 2024 presidential election in the early hours of Wednesday morning, sweeping many of the key swing states and widening his support among young men, Black men and Hispanic voters to prevail.\n\nAs attendees filtered out, younger Harris supporters and staffers shed tears as her time as a candidate came to a close.\n\n— Rebecca Morin and Francesca Chambers\n\nBiden invited Trump to White House in phone call\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Trump earlier in the day to congratulate the former president on his victory in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nHe also invited Trump to meet with him in the White House. The staff will coordinate a specific date in the near future, the White House said.\n\nIn a stunning political comeback, the former president won all seven battleground states on the road to 270 electoral votes, capturing a decisive victory against Harris.\n\nThe vice president will be delivering remarks at Howard University at 4 p.m., the White House said. Harris also called Trump to congratulate him, according to a senior Harris aide.\n\n-Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTop Harris adviser says VP faced ‘deep hole’ in race against Trump\n\nHarris campaign senior adviser David Plouffe called the vice president’s loss to Donald Trump “devastating\" and pointed to a “deep hole” Harris faced after she replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\n“It was a privilege to spend the last 100 days with Kamala Harris,” Plouffe said in a post on X, commending the “amazing staff” led by campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon “who left it on the field for their country.”\n\n“We dug out of a deep hole but not enough. A devastating loss. Thanks for being in the arena, all of you,” Plouffe said.\n\nPlouffe, who worked as President Barack Obama’s campaign manager in 2008, was among a group of former Obama staffers tapped for top campaign leadership positions after Harris secured the Democratic nomination. Harris mounted a condensed 108-day campaign that ultimately fell well short of victory.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nGeorge W. Bush congratulates Trump\n\nFormer President George W. Bush congratulated Donald Trump and JD Vance on their win and thanked Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their service to the country in a statement Wednesday morning.\n\n“The strong turnout in this election is a sign of the health of our republic and the strength of our democratic institutions,” Bush said. “We join our fellow citizens in praying for the success of our new leaders at all levels of government.\n\nThe former Republican president did not endorse either Trump or Harris in the election. His daughter, Barbara Bush, knocked doors for the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania and his vice president, Dick Cheney, endorsed the Democratic candidate.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nWho will serve in a second Trump administration?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday’s election marked the end of a long, divisive campaign that will see the Republican return to the White House just four years after voters ejected him from the job.\n\nWith the campaign behind him, Trump can now turn his attention to putting together a cabinet and a staff to carry out his agenda.\n\nA familiar cast of characters – some of whom had jobs in his first administration – stand ready to serve. Others − like the many who officials from his first administration who subsequently questioned his fitness for office − not so much.\n\nHere’s a look at who’s in and who isn't.\n\n-Michael Collins\n\nWhat is Project 2025 that outlines extreme positions?\n\nThe controversial conservative playbook Project 2025, a highly criticized \"presidential transition project\" created by the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, could draw intense interest when the Trump administration takes power in January. Harris attempted to tie the former president to the 900-page document that outlines extreme policy positions, such as limiting abortion access and mass deportation, that project supporters hope Trump will implement.\n\nTrump has repeatedly distanced himself from the project, claiming in a July Truth Social post to \"know nothing about Project 2025\" despite many of the project's creators having close ties to the previous Trump administration.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Sam Woodward\n\nWhen will Kamala Harris speak to supporters?\n\nHarris will address supporters at Howard University in Washington, tentatively at 4 p.m. ET, a source familiar with the plans confirmed. She is expected to formally concede the race.\n\nHarris had been set to publicly address her followers at an election night party at Howard, her alma mater, but the vice president stayed at her residence as her path to victory narrowed. Trump secured the 270 electoral votes needed to become the next president after he was projected the winner of Wisconsin around 5:40 a.m. ET.\n\nSpeaker Johnson: Border, inflation issues helped keep House in GOP hands\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday that the narrowly divided House appears set to remain in Republican control, which he credited to widespread support for secure borders and reducing inflation. The House will participate in a unified GOP government with the Senate and White House after victories in critical swing districts in Michigan and Pennsylvania, Johnson said.\n\n“The latest data and trends indicate that when all the votes are tabulated, Republicans will have held our majority, even though we faced a map with 18 Biden-won seats,” Johnson said in a statement. “I look forward to working with President Trump and a Republican Senate to deliver as speaker of the House on the mandate entrusted to us by the American people.\"\n\nRFK Jr. says he wants to clear out FDA departments\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said Wednesday that he plans to clear out \"entire departments\" at the Food and Drug Administration if he has the capacity to do so in the next Trump administration.\n\n\"I can get the corruption out of the agencies,\" Kennedy said in an interview with MSNBC. \"That's what I've been doing for 40 years. I've sued all those agencies. I have a Ph.D. in corporate corruption.\"\n\nThe president-elect thanked Kennedy, who suspended his independent presidential campaign to endorse Trump, during his victory speech. Last week, Kennedy said Trump \"promised\" him control of U.S. health agencies, but a member of the Trump transition team refuted that.\n\n\"He's going to help make America healthy again,\" Trump said about Kennedy early Wednesday morning. \"He wants to do some things, and we're gonna let him go to it.\"\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nWashington Post owner Jeff Bezos congratulates Trump\n\nJeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, congratulated president-elect Trump on his victory over Harris on Wednesday.\n\n“Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities” Bezos wrote in a post on X Wednesday morning. “Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love.”\n\nThe good wishes come a week after Bezos defended the Post’s decision not to issue an endorsement of either presidential candidate – a move that broke with decades of tradition and led to resignations of multiple members of the editorial board as well as the cancellation of over 200,000 digital subscriptions, NPR reported. The editorial board had intended to endorse Harris before Bezos made the decision to nix presidential endorsements, according to the Post.\n\nIn an opinion article, Bezos defended the move, arguing it would help restore public trust by ending a practice he says creates a “perception of non-independence” and bias.\n\n− Chris Cann\n\nMitch McConnell congratulates Trump, grateful filibuster is 'secure'\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell congratulated Trump on his victory in the presidential race on Wednesday, telling reporters at the Capitol that he commended the former president for “running a sharper operation this time.”\n\nMcConnell, who’s been the minority leader of the Senate since 2021 and will be stepping down from his leadership role this month, also said that he “had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor, the majority.”\n\n\"Based on the fact that we haven't got all the results, and we certainly already know we're going to be in the majority, we're hopeful that that might actually grow some,\" he said.\n\nOne of the most gratifying parts of Republicans having Senate control, McConnell said, is that the filibuster “will stand.”\n\n“There won’t be any new states admitted to give a partisan advantage to the other side, and we’ll quit beating up the Supreme Court every time we don’t like a decision they make,” he said. So I think this shifting to a Republican Senate majority helps control the guardrails to keep people who want to change the rules in order to achieve something they think is worthwhile, not successful. And so I think the filibuster is very secure.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNetanyahu, Zelenskyy speak with Trump\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had a \"warm and cordial\" conversation with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday and was among the first world leaders to speak with him after his election victory. Netanyahu said they spoke about Israel's security and \"the Iranian threat.\"\n\nTrump has long been close to Netanyahu and in his first term was widely viewed as one of the most pro-Israel U.S. presidents of modern times. Trump broke with years of U.S. policy when he moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which Palestinians also claim as their future capital. It's not immediately clear how Trump will deal the war in Gaza.\n\nDozens of leaders and U.S. allies released statements expressing well wishes and congratulations after Trump won the election. Among them was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is trying to determine whether Trump's White House will cut back on U.S. military aid for Ukraine or nudge it toward a peace deal with Russia.\n\n\"I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,\" Zelenskyy said. \"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer.\"\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nHistoric comeback for Trump, a once and future president\n\nFour years ago, Trump by most measures was a political pariah. Now he’s a president in waiting. Rising from the ashes after a bonfire of scandal fueled by four criminal prosecutions, two impeachments and a failed insurrection, Trump swept aside dire warnings that he could bring American democracy to an end and instead used the democratic system as the ultimate vindication.\n\nNow he will become the second president in history − the first since Grover Cleveland more than century ago − to serve nonconsecutive terms.\n\nA politician rejected by voters in 2020 and abandoned by many in his party after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump is poised to again become the most powerful man in the world. The convicted felon is now the incoming commander in chief.\n\nWeeks of polling had showed the candidates competing in a razor-close election, but in the end Trump won over enough pivotal states with his focus on inflation and immigration. Harris won much of the West Coast and Northeast and Trump clinched victories in the South. But Trump also picked up North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, pushing him over the threshold of 270 electoral votes to win the race. Read more here on how Trump's historic comeback happened.\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nWhat happens with Donald Trump's criminal cases?\n\nThe election victory will delay and possibly wipe out Trump’s four pending criminal cases, according to legal experts. Trump has made clear he would derail the efforts of Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith in his two federal cases. And action in two state cases in New York and Georgia are likely to be postponed until he is done serving in the White House.\n\n“I think we are in uncharted territory,” said Alexander Reinert, a Cardozo School of Law professor, said of the state cases.\n\nTrump has said he could fire Smith or pardon himself. “It’s so easy − I would fire him within two seconds,” Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Oct. 24.\n\nWhat the election results mean for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for updates and exclusive analysis.\n\nACLU ready to challenge Trump’s `mass deportation’ plan\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which fought many of Donald Trump’s controversial policies during his first administration, said Wednesday that it already has a plan for Trump’s next term. The ACLU was the first group in 2017 to challenge Trump’s ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries, one of 434 legal actions it took against the first Trump administration.\n\nThis time, Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said the ACLU is ready to fight Trump’s vow to seek retribution against his enemies, to launch a “mass deportation” of at least 11 million immigrants living in the United States without authorization and other promises.\n\n“We are ready to take action the minute Trump takes the oath of office,” Romero said in a statement. “When President-elect Trump targets immigrants, dissidents and his political opponents we will challenge him in the courts, in state legislatures and in the streets.”\n\nVance, mom all smiles after victory\n\nVice president-elect JD Vance thanked supporters after he and Trump claimed victory early Wednesday morning. And his mother, Beverly Aikins, returned to Facebook on Wednesday to celebrate her son's win. Aikins took a break from social media in July after seeing \"vitriol and hate\" toward her son, including from critics in Vance's hometown of Middletown, where she still lives.\n\n\"Too big to rig,\" she wrote. \"Popular vote by more than five million. Two hundred seventy seven electoral votes and still counting. Trump Vance 2024.\"\n\n− Victoria Moorwood, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nBomb threats linked to Russia did not alter election, official says\n\nBomb threats believed to be emanating from Russia interrupted voting Tuesday across numerous battleground states, but a top U.S. cybersecurity official said they didn’t have a material impact on the election or voters’ ability to cast their ballots. Jen Easterly, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a midnight press briefing that Tuesday's election did see some \"minor\" disruptive activities, including polling station evacuations and delays.\n\nEasterly and other officials said the hoax bomb threats were sent to at least four states and were all deemed to be \"non-credible.\"\n\n“The point is this did not impact the ability of voters to cast their ballots or for their votes to be counted as cast,” Easterly said, commending the election officials on the ground in the states. “Ultimately they were able to demonstrate extensive resilience based on their preparations for it. … Overall I would call this a good news story for democracy.”\n\nEight states vote to prohibit noncitizen voting\n\nEight states approved constitutional amendments or ballot initiatives Tuesday to prohibit noncitizens from voting, a key Republican priority even though state and federal laws already prohibit it and despite studies showing it almost never happens. All the states adopted the measures by 2-1 margins or better. The constitutional amendments typically approved a very simple change of phrasing about citizens voting to add “only” citizens may vote.\n\nNorth Carolina and Wisconsin were key swing states that each adopted constitutional amendments. Other states were Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina.\n\n“It is illegal for non-citizens to vote in our elections,” Michael Whatley, co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, said when filing lawsuits against states to prevent noncitizen voting. “Yet time and again, we have seen Democrat officials oppose basic safeguards and dismantle election integrity provisions, intentionally opening the door to non-citizen voting in our elections.”\n\nStudies by the Brennan Center for Justice and the libertarian Cato Institute have found noncitizen voting is essentially nonexistent. A Georgia audit of voter rolls this year found 20 noncitizens among 8.2 million registered voters.\n\nCenter for American Women and Politics: `Progress is not inevitable’\n\nHarris’ candidacy demonstrated much of the advantages women have when they run for office, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. She was a formidable fundraiser. She connected with voters on issues important to her and to them. Her identify gave her a unique perspective on overlooked issues, the research center said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nBut the race also exemplified research that shows obstacles female candidates face, primarily unequal expectations. That’s particularly true for women of color, the center said. While women have held nearly every political office in America, they still hold fewer than a third of all political seats at every level of office – and still haven’t reached the highest office in the land.\n\n“Progress is not inevitable,” the center said. “We have made great strides, yes, but there are many steps left on the path to parity.”\n\nCan Trump run again in 2028?\n\nTrump has run for president three times, winning the office in 2016 and now in 2024. So, can he run again in 2028? The 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits one person from serving more than two terms as president.\n\nAll presidents served no more than two terms until Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected president four times from 1932 to 1944. In 1947, two years after Roosevelt's death, a push began in the House of Representative to limit presidents to two terms. After some revisions by the Senate, the proposed amendment was approved and sent out to states, It was rtified on Feb. 27, 1951.\n\n− Chad Murphy, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nFrom pariah to president:From pariah to president: Donald Trump rises from the ashes to reclaim the White House\n\nHow Kamala Harris lost the election\n\nAn appearance on ABC's \"The View\" last month provided a friendly forum for Harris to introduce herself to Americans unfamiliar with her story. But Harris struggled to explain what she would do differently than President Joe Biden. “Not a thing that comes to mind,” the incumbent vice president told the hosts.\n\nFollowing Trump’s victory over Harris, that television moment underscored a fatal flaw of Harris’ campaign that doomed her election bid – an inability to separate herself from an unpopular president whose approval ratings have hovered around 40% for most of his four years in the White House.

Despite this, Hollywood has produced some of the most expensive films ever made over the last two decades.\n\nThese mega-budget films generally pay off from the studio’s perspective. Many of the most expensive movies of all time are also the top-grossing movies of all time. Even when an extravagant film fails to recoup costs in the United States, it generally makes a profit in the global market.\n\n24/7 Wall St. has identified the most expensive movies ever made, adjusting each film’s production budget for inflation.\n\nAll but four of the most expensive movies were produced after the year 2000. Further still, 29 of the 50 were produced in the last eight years. Since the rise of the “blockbuster\" Hollywood has trended towards producing a small number of movies that are extremely costly rather than many movies with smaller budgets. Not only do these big-ticket films frequently perform extremely well at the box office, but also they are more likely to produce other successful streams of revenue, such as merchandise.\n\nThe majority of the most expensive films are also part of a film franchise. There are four films from the Pirates of the Caribbean series, three Hobbit movies, and three installments of Transformers. Once a franchise has developed a devoted following, it becomes less risky for the studio to put money into a new installment because the fans will likely show up.\n\nThe growing importance of international markets also certainly has influenced Hollywood’s economic model. Some 23 of the 50 most expensive movies actually lost money in the domestic market. However, only one film failed to fully earn its production budget back at the worldwide box office: Walt Disney Pictures’ 2013 “The Lone Ranger.”\n\n50. Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014)\n\nProduction budget: $216,733,421\n\nWorldwide gross: $1,139,438,883\n\n“Transformers: Age of Extinction,” the second most expensive movie made in 2014, ended up making the most money that year.\n\n49.

The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)\n\nProduction budget: $219,792,328\n\nWorldwide gross: $879,828,168\n\n\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” was a successful attempt by Disney to target Christian audiences, following the largely unexpected success of “Passion of the Christ” the year before.\n\n46.

Toy Story 3 (2010)\n\nProduction budget: $221,650,123\n\nWorldwide gross: $1,185,458,009\n\n“Toy Story 3” cost an exceptional amount due in large part to the animated film’s massive crew, many of whom are the best in their field, as well as expensive voice actors.\n\n43. Prince of Persia: Sands of Time (2010)\n\nProduction budget: $221,650,123\n\nWorldwide gross: $348,649,656\n\nWhile the film did well overseas, “Prince of Persia: Sands of Time” performed poorly in the United States.\n\n42. Alice in Wonderland (2010)\n\nProduction budget: $221,650,123\n\nWorldwide gross: $1,136,501,15“Alice in Wonderland” actually went over its original budget, yet did well at the box office thanks in part to the higher cost of tickets for 3D films — .Alice in Wonderland” actually went over its original budget, yet did well at the box office thanks in part to the higher cost of tickets for 3D films.—\n\n41. Battleship (2012)\n\nProduction budget: $221,872,325\n\nWorldwide gross: $324,016,641\n\nNearly half — about $100 million — of the film's budget went towards special effects. “Battleship,” though, is widely considered to be a major flop when the rest of the film’s costs, including marketing, are considered.\n\n40. 2012 (2009)\n\nProduction budget: $225,314,000\n\nWorldwide gross: $888,197,408\n\n“2012” is the first movie to ever gross $700 million worldwide without passing $200 million at the domestic box office.\n\n39.

Robin Hood (2010)\n\nProduction budget: $232,732,630\n\nWorldwide gross: $357,365,392\n\nOf the near $233 million budget for “Robin Hood,” $36 million went to pay for the cast, which included Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett.\n\n35. The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)\n\nProduction budget: $233,549,816\n\nWorldwide gross: $804,568,783\n\n“The Amazing Spider-Man” is one of three Spider-Man films to appear on our list.

Wild Wild West (1999)\n\nProduction budget: $243,064,665\n\nWorldwide gross: $307,274,481\n\nWhile “Wild Wild West” made money, it was near universally panned by critics.\n\n29. X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)\n\nProduction budget: $249,743,690\n\nWorldwide gross: $546,178,682\n\nAn estimated one-sixth of the budget for \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" was spent solely on set construction and graphics for the film’s Golden Gate Bridge sequence.\n\n28.

Disney almost stopped production of the movie because of costs, which initially were $215 million but steadily rose. Westerns do not play well overseas, so the movie never recouped its production costs.\n\n11.

All three films are playing exclusively in theaters.\n\nThe weekend after Thanksgiving is usually pretty quiet at the box office and this year was no exception considering new offerings like “Flee” and “Benedetta” were playing only in limited release. Disney’s “Encanto,” an animated tale with original music from Lin-Manuel Miranda, earned $12.7 million to take the top spot, down 53% from its opening last weekend. Globally, it’s earned $116.1 million to date.\n\nReview: Disney’s ‘Encanto’ enchants with awkward teen heroine, catchy Lin-Manuel Miranda songs\n\n“Ghostbusters: Afterlife” took second place in its third weekend with $10.4 million, pushing it just past the $100 million threshold.

Over the weekend, it grossed $4.1 million from 1,700 screens. Since Wednesday, it’s earned $9 million and has become the highest grossing event in Fathom history.\n\n“It just shows how powerful event cinema is and how movie theaters can benefit from non-traditional releases,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.\n\nIn other notable showings, Warner Bros.’ brought “Dune” back to IMAX screens this weekend. The premium screens accounted for over half of its $1.8 million domestic earnings.\n\nIn specialty releases, Paul Verhoeven’s “Benedetta,” released by IFC Films, grossed $145,000 from 202 theaters and Focus Features’ “Wolf” opened on 308 screens to $80,000. Neon’s animated documentary “Flee” also opened on four screens, earning $25,033.

But Dergarabedian thinks that $4 billion is still in reach for 2021, should a certain superhero swing in to help on Dec. 17.\n\n“I think the industry has the potential to generate $300 million over the next few weeks,” Dergarabedian added. ”‘Spider-Man’ could be the lynchpin to catapult us past the $4 billion mark.”\n\nMore:'Encanto': Lin-Manuel Miranda ushers Stephanie Beatriz into the Disney 'princess club'\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.

And remember: you can always submit a question for next week below.\n\nJohn Elliot: Welcome to the USA TODAY Movie Forum!\n\n...where we promise no Pain, but plenty of Gain each and every week!\n\nI'm John Elliot, online producer for USA TODAY Movies and I will serve as your moderator. Joining me today are my West Coast compatriots - USA TODAY movies reporter Scott Bowles and film critic Claudia Puig\n\nHow this works - Each week we solicit questions, online, from our readers on the latest news from the world of film.\n\nThis Week? Best of CinemaCon, the art of opening date selection, the reinvention of Michael Bay, and the rough week of Reese Witherspoon.\n\nRemember: you can submit questions right here and now and we will tackle them later in the chat.\n\nSo let's get started!\n\nScott, you return to us from CinemaCon! How was it and what were the big reveals of the conference?\n\nScott Bowles: Hi John, Claudia and moviegoers!\n\nCinemacon got off to a great start but really started to wobble.\n\nOne of the highlights has to be World War Z. It's not a sequel, not a franchise, but it had theater owners buzzing. And it was amazing to see what Brad Pitt does to a theater full of theater owners. Answer: they act like teeny boppers at a Justin Bieber concert.\n\nOther big winners: Man of Steel and Pacific Rim.\n\nWhat we didn't see was anything that could be as big as last year's Avengers.\n\nAny summer movie look good to you, Claudia?\n\nClaudia Puig: I'm really excited about Monsters University and also Man of Steel....REALLY curious about Gatsby. They've never managed to nail it yet\n\nOh, and the comedies like The Internship\n\nAnd What Maisie Knew is another one I'm really dying to see!\n\nScott Bowles:Man of Steel, though, has possibilities. Zack Snyder is shooting the movie on film, of all things. Perhaps the only movie this summer that isn't digital. And the film looks fantastic.\n\nBut you're right. Since Christopher Reeve hung up the S, the film versions have been lacking.\n\nAs for comedy, Internship and Hangover got good receptions.\n\nBut the film I'm really looking forward to is Great Gatsby. That, in 3D, could be special.\n\nJohn Elliot: Any surprises from CinemaCon? Or films our readers should keep an eye out for?\n\nScott Bowles: Aside from Gatsby, the movie that no one expected to be impressed by was Ben Stiller's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. It's not a well known brand for Hollywood, but Fox announced they will give it the awards backing they gave Life of Pi, which worked out great.\n\nOH, and the movie I can't wait for above all others: Peanuts. Charlie Brown rules.\n\nClaudia Puig: I've heard from advance sources that What Maisie Knew is really great...stars Julianne Moore, Steve Coogan and Alexander Skarsgard and is told from the perspective of a 6 year old girl whose parents are divorcing. Also a movie I saw at Sundance with Steve Carrell is coming out this summer and it's really great: The Way Way Back. I predict it will be the Little Miss Sunshine of this summer\n\nJohn Elliot: Let's move on to studio strategy now!\n\nThis weekend we have Pain & Gain opening alongside The Big Wedding and Mud and not much else. You'd probably be hard pressed to find three more dissimilar films.\n\nCertainly that selection of an opening date is more of an art than a science, but Claudia, could you tell us what factors a studio considers when picking the opening day for a film?\n\nClaudia Puig: It can seem like a blood sport at times—the whole summer blockbuster madness. And deciding when to fight the behemoth and when to run and hide can be key to a movie's success. Sometimes it seems a studio just looks at it as simply as down gender or age lines. This week we have perfect examples. Pain and Gain and The Big Wedding come out on the same weekend. Michael Bay's Pain and Gain aimed at guys from teenage to what, 40s? And Big Wedding starring De Niro, Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton aimed at women maybe 30s and up? And then there's the indie coming of age tale Mud….Which is the artier choice. There is probably not much overlap between those audiences.\n\nWhen you look at the past you had movies like Dark Knight up against Mamma Mia and Transformers up against My Sister's Keeper, GI Joe vs. Julie and Julia, so studios certainly look to stay as different from what's out there…movies for guys and movies for women seems like a simplistic way to draw the lines but it may start out as simple as that. Drama vs. comedy is another strategy. Action vs. rom-com.\n\nI don't know if focus groups are involved, but it sure doesn't seem to be an exact science, though millions are riding on it\n\nScott, what's your take on it?\n\nScott Bowles: Very true, Claudia.\n\nI also find that studios often time their films based on the school calendar. One of the biggest gripes of theater owners at Cinemacon is that studios hold all of their best films for the summer and holiday season, leaving the rest of the calendar a wasteland.\n\nAnd they have a point. Certain movies that have gotten unusual release date, like Hunger Games in spring last year, had huge returns. Theater owners are trying to pressure studios into making the movie season a 12-month affair.\n\nOther than that, it's strategy. Finding your niche audience.\n\nJohn Elliot: What is the value of picking a date where your film will be up against a wide variety of other film genres?\n\nClaudia Puig: You can stake out your claim on the genre, at least for that opening weekend--which is key, as you know. If Iron Man 3 stakes the action/super-hero slot, and is first coming out of the pack and its only competition is adult dramas, its spot as one of the summer's top 10 seems pretty secure\n\nScott Bowles: Absolutely right.\n\nIt can be an interesting poker match. Studios often bring their strongest teen material and square off on a weekend, but not often.\n\nThe loser in that showdown is always older moviegoers. They are the least likely to show up on opening weekend, because they read reviews. So studios are going to give the better adult-themed films obscure opening dates, while the kids claim the big summer weekends and holidays.\n\nJohn Elliot: Do studios ever work hand-in-hand (if not publicly) to pick mutually beneficial opening dates? Or is there always a bit of rivalry and one-upsmanship in date selection?\n\nScott Bowles: I wouldn't say the studios work hand in hand as they do sword to sword.\n\nIf anything, opening dates are about egos. Which studio thinks they have the biggest kid on the block. And there's a certain amount of uniformity there. No studio, for instance, was going to take on Iron Man, which we are expecting to open to at least $160 million.\n\nSo a studio won't cooperate with another studio, but will give it enough respect to clear a wide berth.\n\nYou know studios, Claudia. Every seen one give a modicum of respect to another movie house?\n\nClaudia Puig: Yes, I think there's respect there, even if grudging. They know to stay away from Iron Man and other major behemoths. It's not exactly gentlemanly, but they know better than to go head to head\n\nScott Bowles: One of the most fascinating weekends of summer will be May 24. We've got Epic, Fast & Furious 6 and Hangover Part III, all on the same weekend.\n\nThat's a film that will appeal to teens across the board. But studios will be trying to carve out their own niches: Epic aims for kids 13-14., Furious 14--16, and Hangover 17 and above.\n\nJohn Elliot: Speaking of Pain & Gain…this is a different movie movie than we've seen from director Michael Bay in the past? The master of mechanized mayhem and elicitor of explosions makes an attempt at something of a more cerebral crime dramedy. Claudia was he successful?\n\nClaudia Puig: Not in my book. He was trying to be Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino and he doesn't have the skill to pull that off. He really should stay in the realm of explosions and vehicle chases. The blend of brutality and dark comedy is hard to pull of deftly. Some like the Coens and Martin McDonagh who did Seven Psychopaths have done it fantastically. Bay's frenetic chaotic style is like bludgeoning the wit with a hammer. And the gore factor is extreme. But I did like Dwayne Johnson's slightly more complicated characgter of an ex-con, ex-addict who's found Jesus. Bay really squandered a great cast--Johnson, Anthony Mackie, Rebel Wilson, Tony Shalhoub, Rob Corddry--inspired casting, bad movie.\n\nScott Bowles: One of my favorite moments of Cinemacon was when Bay took the stage to talk to theater owners and introduce his movies.\n\nHe started by saying \"I've made a lot of money for you over the years,\" which is pretty telling about Bay. He's brash and big.\n\nWhich makes this film a tough sell. Even in Vegas, he described P&G as, at $25 million,\" his little film.\" But I'm not sure he can do little. He isn't quite adept enough at character sketches. He does pyrotechnics, which is why he spent five times more time talking about the next Transformers than P&G.\n\nClaudia Puig: Brash, big...braggardly...At the premiere I went to he talked about using his own house for this Miami mansion in the movie and was worried about getting his lawn trampled. It's funny to think of anything Bay does as \"little film\"!\n\nScott Bowles: Wait, he didn't blow it up?\n\nClaudia Puig: He blew it up then wanted to fix his lawn.\n\nJohn Elliot: Finally…it's been a rough week for Mud star Reese Witherspoon who found herself arrested after quarreling with a police officer during the DUI arrest of her husband James Toth. During the encounter, which was caught on tape, Witherspoon uttered the infamous phrase \"Do you know my name?\"\n\nSO…a few questions here, and let's start with Scott…How bad of a hit do you think Witherspoon's reputation will take? She certainly has been an America's Sweetheart candidate for years now...\n\nScott Bowles: I think it all depends on how she handles the next few weeks. We've watched some celebs (Hi Mel Gibson) utterly detonate in the press scrutiny that follows.\n\nBut Mel faces deeper issues that Reese, presumably. While Mel has a reputation for being erratic in his behavior, Reese has a reputation as a thoughtful, eloquent woman. If that's true, she'll acquit herself well.\n\nI'm really curious, though, about how this will affect Mud. You've seen it, Claudia. What do you think of Reese and her work of late?\n\nClaudia Puig: I think you're completely right, Scott. She has already issued a mea culpa and apologized for having too much to drink and said the officer was only doing his job, etc. She's certainly no Mel, who had repeated run-ins with law enforcement and has the whole anti-Semitic stuff to contend with. She has a good reputation and will likely weather this one. As for Mud, it might slightly increase the box office .That old adage: there's no bad publicity might factor in. But she's good in the movie and it's overall a kind of departure for her. A darker character part that she does well.\n\nJohn Elliot: What is it about the \"Do you know my name?\"/Do you know who I am? phrasing from celebs that rankles people so deeply?\n\nScott Bowles: Hey, it's better than calling the arresting officer \"sugar $%#!\"\n\nYou have to think that was pretty standard for Hollywood, and along the line of celeb offenses, pretty tame. She makes Lindsay Lohan and Amanda Bynes look like serial killers.\n\nShe's probably going to have to suffer a few one liners. But the first hit, and she's fine.\n\nMs. Puig?\n\nClaudia Puig: It's that entitlement that really rankles people. They already get preferential treatment and have lives with so many perks and luxuries. Then they go for the ultimate \"Don't you know who I am\" cliche and it kind of re-inforces what most people resent about privilege.\n\nScott Bowles: That's a good point.\n\nAnd this is when the audience, with their box office dollars, gets to say \"don't you know who WE are?\"\n\nClaudia Puig: But it's certainly better than expletives or Amanda Bynes style stuff.\n\nJohn Elliot: Meanwhile, Witherspoon's Mud castmate, Matthew McConaughey is having his moment as a critical darling! His last string of performances (4 deep now I believe; Mud, Magic Mike, The Paperboy, Killer Joe) have drawn deep critical praise. Is it time to consider Matthew McConaughey a *gasp* serious, awards worthy actor?\n\nClaudia Puig: MM's definitely on a roll! And you forgot Bernie! He's definitely making some far wiser choices than those godawful rom-coms with the likes of Kate Hudson. I think he is proving himself an awards worthy actor. It happens. Though don't know if I'll ever be able to look at him without thinking naked bongo playing\n\nScott Bowles: McConaughey is actually a good actor, often undone by his abs. Take a look at Lone Star, a great 1996 drama.\n\nBut Matt may suffer the same \"affliction\" as Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. They may be too pretty to be taken seriously by the academy. A lot of Oscar darlings, at least among actors, tend to look like toads.\n\nFor all three, I think, they may need to find some wrinkles, some paunch (at least a fat suit) and some deep flaws in their character. The academy likes people it can relate to.\n\nClaudia Puig: He was fantastic in Lone Star. And even Dazed and Confused--he nailed it. And yes he does suffer from the pretty surfer boy syndrome. I'd throw Johnny Depp in that same Pitt/Cruise category. But Depp has transcended it, so maybe MM can too.\n\nScott Bowles: Yes, Johnny. Poor gorgeous guys. All they have is fame, power and women.\n\nClaudia Puig: And don't you know who I am moments...\n\nJohn Elliot: Now let's move on to some questions from our lovely readers!\n\nGuy From Texas asks:\n\nWell, Iron Man 3 is officially coming upon us. And I am super-psyched! So let's talk superhero. I expect 3 to gain about $800 million at the box office. I am even more psyched over Man of Steel, which should get $900 million. I'm not going for The Wolverine having not seen most of the X-Men films, and I expect it to get about $400 million. I also lack Kick-A++, I will see Thor: The Dark World which should get $500 million. I'll also go for Captain America 2, which should get $500 million. I definitely wanna see Amazing Spider-Man 2, which should get $800-900 million. Same for Guardians of the Galaxy, which should go for $400 million. Again, I won't see Days of Future Past because of my X-Men lack, but it should get $400 million. I will go see Ant-Man, which should get $300 million. Finally, I will definitely see Avengers 2 and Justice League, which obviously will crack the billion mark. So what do you guys think?\n\nScott Bowles: Hi Guy! (Don't you love getting that? That's my first name, don't tell anyone)\n\nI think you must work for a studio. Very impressive. I think you're right that all of these are going to be big: superhero films haven't lost their punch in ticket sales yet.\n\nBut what this season is lacking is anything that's going to challenge Avengers, and nothing that will approach $600 domestically. Already, Wall Street is forecasting a box office dip of about 7% this year -- unless a hero comes through.\n\nYou a fan of the heroes in Spandex, Claudia?\n\nClaudia Puig: Sure, I like a good super-hero as much as the next person...But I'll go for the underdog there--Kick Ass. Loved how it turned the super-hero genre on its ear. Clever, fun, and really established Chloe Moretz and gave Nicolas Cage some cred back. Looking forward to the sequel. Which is not something I say much these days....\n\nComment From Guest\n\nRead the Pixar story in today's paper. What is the secret to their success?!?!\n\nScott Bowles: Hi Guest,\n\nBesides talent? Pixar has patience. The studio puts out one film per year, and has never had a film not open at No. 1.\n\nMonsters U. will be big, thanks to the recipe Pixar employs on every film: rewrite. Billy Crystal says he did 10 different takes of the opening to Monsters U., and the director still re-wrote it.\n\nAre you listening, the rest of Hollywood?\n\nClaudia Puig: Pixar has the magic touch. I think John Lasseter knows how to pick the best projects (with the possible exception of Cars 2) andt he best people for them. He's a guy with a lot of heart and it shows in his movies. It's an amazing winning formula\n\nJulian from Burbank asks:\n\nWhich major movie studio presents the best premiere of its movies?\n\nClaudia Puig: I think it has more to do with the high hopes they have for the specific movies, rather than the studio itself. Some of the best premieres have been for the Ocean's 11/12/13 movies, which Warners knows will net them big bucks. I've heard that the directors and stars dictate how much a studio will invest as well. If you want to keep George Clooney happy, say, throw a really good premiere....What do you think Scott?\n\nScott Bowles: Ah, premieres. Where we get to pretend we do work when we go.\n\nI find the studios have all toned down their premieres in a flagging economy and a world aware of terror.\n\nWhat studios used to do was decadent. The best studio used to be Sony, which would hire dancers, djs and bands to ring in its films. Universal, too, used to be big. I remember the premiere of Fast and Furious, when the studio hired models with chainsaws to gyrate on poles.\n\nAh, the art of film.\n\nJohn Elliot: Unfortunately, it's time for us to wrap up\n\nThank you Scott and Claudia! And a VERY big thank you to all our readers who participated and submitted questions.\n\nScott Bowles: Thanks everyone! Save us an aisle seat.\n\nClaudia Puig: Thanks everyone! Think gain, no pain!\n\nJohn Elliot: Remember: you can submit your burning movie questions all week long, right here.\n\nThank you all for joining us for the USA TODAY Movie Forum!

It’s part of a brief campaign trip to the West that included a rally Thursday in Tucson, Arizona. Two more rallies are scheduled next week in Flint, Michigan, and Uniondale, New York.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is Nov. 5 – just 52 days away.\n\nTrump paints dire picture of an America without him in the White House\n\nFormer President Donald Trump spoke for almost 90 minutes Friday night in Las Vegas to a crowd of 6,000.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nHe concluded his remarks with tales of a failing nation where a woman at a grocery store couldn't afford three apples and had to put one back, something he said he’d seen on TV.\n\n“That should never happen in our country, and so we're not going to let it happen in our country while other people get rich,” Trump said.\n\nHe then painted a picture of veterans sleeping on the streets outside luxury hotels filled with immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nOne of the evening’s bigger cheers came when he vowed to keep men out of women’s sports.\n\nThe enthusiastic response perhaps inspired him to recount the blow-by-blow details of a controversial boxing match in the Olympics involving a female Italian boxer who dropped out of a match with another boxer who’d been labeled ineligible to compete as a female by an international boxing association.\n\nTrump repeated his claims that Vice President Kamala Harris is a radical lefist.\n\n“If we're not able to turn this country around, it's going to be Venezuela,” he said. “So get everyone you know to vote. We want a landslide.”\n\nPresident Trump takes the stage at The Expo in Las Vegas\n\nDonald Trump came out swinging against Kamala Harris, alternately attacking her for speaking in \"word salad\" and being “a threat to democracy.”\n\nTrump interrupted his remarks to call out “roll the tape” with clips of Harris giving different opinions on guns and Medicare.\n\nHe called her farther left than “crazy Bernie Sanders” and then mocked a video of Harris repeatedly saying “Thank you.”\n\nHe moved on to replay each part of his debate this week with Harris, criticizing moderators for not fact-checking his opponent.\n\n“Do you see the lies that she was making? Project 2025 -- I've said 100 times, I know nothing about it,” he said. “I had nothing to do with it.”\n\nTrump said he thinks Joe Biden would be a better president than Harris.\n\n“You know that she wanted to have transgender surgery on illegal aliens that came into our country that were in jail,” he said.\n\nThen, he paused like a standup comic and added, “I would say that's quite a liberal thing to do.”\n\nTrump turned over part of his remarks to U.S. Senate candidate Sam Brown.\n\nBrown used the moment to say Trump will be the border president and he will be the border senator, before leading the crowd in a fist-shaking chant of fight, fight, fight -- the phrase Trump shouted after the recent attempt on his life.\n\nTrump falsely claimed Harris’ running mate Tim Walz says babies should be executed after birth and that this has happened numerous times in Nevada and many other states.\n\nKilling infants is illegal in all states.\n\n“Nobody wants to talk about it,” Trump insisted, “but they allow execution after birth.”\n\nTrump promised numerous tax cuts at Friday’s rally.\n\nHe said that he would institute no tax on tips, an idea he first floated at a rally in Las Vegas in June - and Kamala Harris also supports it.\n\nTrump went further, saying he would end taxes on Social Security benefits.\n\nAnd, he added, “there will be no taxes on overtime.”\n\nMore:Harris repeats claim that Project 2025 is Trump's plan. That's still not right.\n\nTrump running late about 20 minutes so far\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is about 20 minutes late at this point from his scheduled starting time of 7 p.m. at his Las Vegas rally Friday.\n\nThe crowd is in good spirits, bobbing along to a new soundtrack that differs from previous Trump rallies in Nevada. One song that’s been played a couple of times is the Clash, “Should I Stay or Should I Go?”\n\nKid Rock’s “American Bad Ass“ just started so Trump’s appearance should be getting closer.\n\nGov.

Joe Lombardo.\n\n“Governor Lombardo has sent 3 letters to the Biden-Harris administration asking them to open up some of this land to help alleviate the crisis—but Kamala and Crooked Joe did not even have the decency to reply,\" the statement says.\n\n“By opening even a small portion of these lands, we will create special new zones with ultra-low taxes and low-regulations to allow the development of extraordinary new housing at a proper price, while also bringing jobs and industries to Nevada – like the movie industry, the technology industry, and massive manufacturing plants from foreign nations.\n\n“If I pull this off with the help of your Governor, a lot of Hollywood will be moving from California, because right now you don’t have the land for the studio lots and everything else.\n\n“Millions of Americans will be able to take part in building these clean, safe, and beautiful new communities – reviving the frontier spirit and the American Dream, right here in the great state of Nevada.”\n\nThe Reno Gazette Journal is reaching out to the governor's office for comment.\n\nIn June, Trump chose Las Vegas to roll out his idea to end federal taxes on tips.\n\nSenate candidate Sam Brown ‘confident’ Trump will win Nevada\n\nRepublican candidate for U.S. Senate Sam Brown posed for photos with supporters outside the Las Vegas convention hall where former President Donald Trump was scheduled to hold a rally Friday.\n\n“I'm confident at the end of the day President Trump is going to win Nevada,” he told gathered news media.\n\n“I'm going to win this Senate race, President Trump will be in the White House as a champion for America, and I’ll be there as a part of a new Republican majority in the Senate to work to the benefit of all Americans.”\n\nThe latest polling average from Real Clear Politics shows Brown trailing incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen by 10.7 points in the U.S. Senate race.\n\nWhen asked if he will support the results of the presidential election if Trump loses, Brown said, “Whatever happens at the end of the day is something that America will have to accept – but it will be President Trump in the White House.”\n\nWhat do the latest Nevada polls say about Trump-Harris race?\n\nWith Nevada considered one of seven battleground states that could go either way in the presidential race, polls of registered voters have tightened since President Joe Biden dropped out last month.\n\nBiden trailed Trump by 13 points in Nevada polling in July.\n\nThe latest average of Nevada polls shows a dead heat between Trump and Harris.\n\nThe New York Times shows Trump and Harris tied at 48% each while Real Clear Politics gives Harris a tiny edge of 0.6 percentage points.\n\nThe music in the Las Vegas convention hall where Trump is set to speak soon briefly cut out for a video message from Trump urging supporters to vote however they can.\n\n“If we swamp them, they can’t cheat,” he said.\n\nAbout 6,000 expected at Trump’s Las Vegas rally\n\nThe rally is being held in The Expo at World Market Center, a convention center where the two main halls can hold 13,500 people each.\n\nWhere Trump will speak, curtains are deployed that make the space smaller. About 6,000 are expected, according to the campaign.\n\nOn Aug. 13, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke before about 15,000 at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, home of UNLV Rebels basketball.\n\nLoud rock by Guns ’N Roses, The Clash and Boston booms over speakers as people file in, mixed with newer songs such as “Feels” by Katy Perry and \"Timber\" by Pitbull and Kesha.\n\n‘Trump Girl’ thinks debate with Harris was rigged\n\nWearing a bedazzled “Trump Girl” ballcap, Nada Gillette took a half-day off work to attend Donald Trump’s Las Vegas rally Friday. This is the first Trump rally she’s attended, but she said she’s watched every single one online.\n\nGillette was disappointed in Tuesday’s debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on ABC News.\n\n“It’s a shame what they did,” she said, referring to debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis and calling the debate rigged. “What they did basically is bully him. It was three on one, and I think it was unfair.”\n\nShe complained that Trump’s comments -- including unfounded claims of immigrants eating pets and Democrats being in favor of \"executing\" babies after birth -- were fact-checked by moderators four times and Harris none.\n\n“They were trying to get under his skin, and they did,” Gillette said. “That’s one thing I’m disappointed in is that he let them get to him.”\n\nLas Vegas rapper’s songs praise Donald Trump and MAGA\n\nSean Moon, who raps under the name King Bullethead, blasted his music praising Donald Trump from a pickup truck outside The Expo where the former president was holding a rally.\n\nHis song titles include “Too Big to Rig” – “about the big landslide that’s coming,” he said – and “MAGA Drum Roll.\"\n\nMoon said he was inspired by his grandfather who escaped a North Korean death camp in the 1950s.\n\n“We got free from communism, my whole family,” he said. “President Trump is the bulwark, he’s the one standing up against centralized government, centralized power, like we see in the communist countries.”\n\nIn his view, the candidates on the left of the political spectrum represent socialism and communism.\n\n“They represent the slide toward that very dangerous pathway of total censorship, total control by the government,” Moon said. “President Trump is the one standing to stop that and weaken the deep state.”\n\nRally draws conservative Christian groups from Japan\n\nYasuyo Urabe came to the United States in July with her conservative Christian church from Fukuoka, Japan, to support Trump.\n\n“We support Trump because we have been fighting against communism a long time and we want to stop the invasion of communism,” she said outside The Expo a few hours before the rally was scheduled to begin.\n\n“We go around the United States to the rallies of Trump,” she said.\n\nSo far, she’s been to Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\nAnother group of Japanese Trump supporters had a table with free books making the case that “God chose Trump.”\n\nBook titles included “The Laws of the Messiah” and “Trump Shall Never Die.”\n\n“Under Biden-Harris, ‘Hell on Earth’ expanded,” one of their fliers says.\n\nIt says America is in the midst of spiritual warfare, adding, “Did you know that Trump’s past life was George Washington?”\n\nTrump campaign says rally will focus on economy\n\nIn a news release announcing the Vegas rally, Trump’s campaign focused on the economy.\n\n“Nevadans cannot afford four more years of dangerously liberal policies from Kamala Harris,” it says.\n\n“Hispanic Americans especially have been hurt hard by the failed Kamalanomics agenda. The economy and shrinking paychecks are the top concerns faced by Hispanic American voters, and President Trump is the only candidate that will defeat inflation and undo the damage caused by Harris' economic nightmare.”\n\nNevada State Democratic Party Chair Daniele Monroe-Moreno posted to social media, “In Vegas this week, Trump will be just as incoherent, angry, and unhinged as he was on the debate state,” adding, “Nevadans won't stand for it. It's time for a New Way Forward with @KamalaHarris.”\n\nTrump’s last appearance in Nevada came in August at an invitation-only event for about 50 people at a Las Vegas restaurant. It happened soon after independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump.\n\nMore:Kamala Harris wraps up Las Vegas rally - 'We will govern on behalf of all Americans'\n\nCrowd size:How many people attended the Kamala Harris rally in Las Vegas?

Mild profanity, comic violence, bathroom humor, vomit.\n\nEd Oxenbould, Jennifer Garner. One calamity follows another when an 11-year-old boy and his family encounter everything from a science-lab fire at school to a catastrophic driver’s exam to one ornery kangaroo in this dopey, fast-moving Disney comedy.

At the dawn of the ’70s, an antique doll with Satanic powers makes life miserable, murderous and messy for an expectant mom and her husband in this disappointing horror flick. This gimmicky collection of gotcha jolts is a spin-off/prequel for “The Conjuring” (2013), which was much scarier. Directed by cinematographer John R. Leonetti (“The Butterfly Effect 2”) who squanders his chance to make a genuinely creepy movie about an antique demonic Barbie. (C-)\n\nMovies 8: 12:20, 2:40, 5, 7:20, 9:50\n\nBeyond the Lights\n\nPG-13, 116 minutes. Profanity, violence, sexual content, drug use.\n\nGugu Mbatha-Raw, Nate Parker. The pressures of being a gorgeous pop star are overwhelming for one young woman until the singer meets a handsome police officer, who comes to her rescue in an hour of need, in this backstage melodrama. Minnie Driver plays the stage mom from hell. Written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood “Love & Basketball”).\n\nGovernors Square: 4:40\n\nTallahassee Mall: 11:15 a.m., 2:15, 5, 8, 10:45\n\nBig Hero 6\n\nPG, 108 minutes. Violence, scary images, intense action sequences.\n\nVoices of Ryan Potter, Maya Rudolph. After his brother is killed in a fiery explosion at college, a brilliant teenager who is an expert in robotics tries to find out what really happened with the help of a gigantic, inflatable, well-meaning automaton in this Disney-made animated adventure. Yes, it is smart, pro-education and packed with dazzling visuals (check out the flying sequences over a virtual San Francisco) but it loses its originality when it devolves into yet another superhero comic-book story in the third act.

Violence, bathroom humor, scary stuff.\n\nVoices of Hempstead Wright, Ben Kingsley. An orphaned boy who was raised by tiny, harmless, subterranean scavengers in a cheese-happy English town fights to save his friends from an obsessed and sinister exterminator. Comically grotesque, stop-motion animated film from the same studio that produced the memorable one-two punch of “Coraline” (2009) and “ParaNorman“ (2012). It may be too scary for the little guys but older kids will love this gleefully dark tale.

Bloody violence, graphic gore, scary special effects, CGI gone mad, flocks of bats.\n\nLuke Evans, Charles Dance. During a big tiff with a testy Turkish sultan, a 15th-century Transylvanian prince makes a deal with an ancient vampire-monster to give him superpowers in this origin story about bad Vlad the Impaler. This warmed-over mishmash of \"Hercules,\" \"300\" and \"Game of Thrones\" is only interesting when the cave-dwelling, blood-sucking beast is onscreen. Directed by newcomer Gary Shore, who should stick to making plot-free TV commercials. (C-)\n\nMovies 8: 12:40, 2:45, 4:50, 7:25, 9:30\n\nDumb and Dumber To\n\nPG-13, 110 minutes. Profanity, bathroom humor, violence, sexual content, nudity, drug jokes.\n\nJim Carrey, Jeff Daniels. Two morons are reunited after 20 years apart on a mission to find a long-lost daughter, who may be a potential kidney donor, and deliver a mysterious package that is worth billions. Most of the bits are mean-spirited (Kathleen Turner taking the brunt of fat jokes) or just gross (a preoccupation with flatulence). Yet, there is one gut-busting gag involving a giant firecracker being ignited in a hearse that is worthy of Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards’ best “Pink Panther” insanity. With Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Riggle and Laurie Holden. Co-written and directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly (“Dumb and Dumber,” “There’s Something About Mary”).

Rough language, extreme violence, sexual content, corkscrew abuse.\n\nDenzel Washington, Chloë Grace Moretz. Although he appears to be a mellow, middle-aged clerk in a Home Mart mega-store, a former black-op commando goes after Slavic gangsters with guns blazing to rescue a young girl from the sex trade. With Martin Csokas, Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman. Directed by Antoine Fuqua (“Training Day”), whose star’s calm, commanding demeanor carries this rather predictable, blunt-edged shoot-em-up. (B-)\n\nIMAX: 7\n\nMovies 8: 6:55, 9:45\n\nExodus: Gods and Kings\n\nPG-13, 150 minutes. Violence, bloody gore, special effects.\n\nChristian Bale, Joel Edgerton. It’s about to get Old Testament up in here when two stepbrothers who grew up together in Ancient Egypt become bitter rivals when they grow up to become Moses and Pharaoh Ramses. Even God gets involved in the family squabble by unleashing plagues, killing babies and parting the Red Sea. With Aaron Paul, Ben Kingsley, Sigourney Weaver and John Turturro.

Rough language, extreme violence, war gore, sexual content, non-stop smoking.\n\nBrad Pitt, Logan Lerman. During the final days of World War II in Germany, a baby-faced typist who has never seen combat is suddenly ordered into the driver’s seat of a Sherman tank with a cynical crew of fierce warriors. With Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal and Michael Pena. Directed by David Ayer (“End of Watch,” “Street Kings”), who has crafted a raw, uber-macho and powerful war film that is at once very traditional and very contemporary. It plows right through, too, with solid acting and a strong religious subtext. Even the usually sullen and constipated LaBeouf is good in his role as a Bible-thumping gunner. (B+)\n\nTallahassee Mall: 6, 9\n\nGone Girl\n\nR, 149 minutes. Profanity, bloody violence, strong sexual content, nudity.\n\nBen Affleck, Rosamund Pike. In this extremely dark crime drama, the cable news channels have a feeding frenzy when a handsome, glib husband becomes the prime suspect after his gorgeous, semi-famous wife vanishes from their Midwestern home on the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary. Top notch cast includes Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Missi Pyle, who hands in searing send-up of cable-news harpy Nancy Grace. Directed by David Fincher screen (“Fight Club,” “Zodiac,” “The Social Network”). (B+)\n\nTallahassee Mall: 2, 5:15, 8:30\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy\n\nPG-13, 121 minutes. Profanity, jarring violence, scary special effects, sexual content.\n\nChris Pratt, Zoe Saldana. Space bandits and bounty hunters — including an abducted Earthling, a monosyllabic tree named Groot and a irritable talking raccoon — are hunted by a sinister villain after they steal a mysterious orb that contains some powerful mojo. This rip-snortin’, genuinely enjoyable origin story is done with more wit and zip than the usual ponderous Marvel superhero beatdowns. Even though it’s too long, it’s straight-up fun. With Vin Diesel, Benicio Del Toro, Glenn Close, Djimon Hounsou and John C. Reilly. Directed by James Gunn (“Slither,” “Thor: The Dark World”).

Three hapless business partners get ripped off by a shifty CEO during a start-up deal, so the stooges plot to kidnap his spoiled, rich, arrogant son (Chris Pine) in this vulgar sequel. If your idea of humor is hearing Jennifer Aniston talk in pornographic language, then this alleged comedy is aimed at you. With Jason Sudeikis, Christoph Waltz, Chris Pine, Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey. Directed by Sean Anders (“That’s My Boy,” another Adam Sandler atrocity).

Violence, scary special effects, grim subject matter, speechifying.\n\nJennifer Lawrence, Donald Sutherland. The arrow-flinging Girl On Fire, aka Katniss Everdeen, has a case of major burnout as she is used as a propaganda tool by rebel forces in a lop-sided battle against the tyrannical despot President Coriolanus Snow. With Julianne Moore, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Jeffrey Wright and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Directed by Frances Lawrence (“I Am Legend,” “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), who is dragging out the franchise’s finale as long as he can for the sake of box office. This chapter does not move as swiftly and bogs down in places. Still, Lawrence is terrific in her star-making turn as the kick-butt teenage heroine.

As the environment falls apart and crops are dying across the world, an astronaut and small crew fly through a wormhole near Saturn in search for planets that can sustain human life. Crazy-ambitious, overly long and cornball sentimental sci-fi tale co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan (“Inception,” “The Dark Knight”). It tackles everything from time travel to space madness to history revisionism. With Anne Hathaway, Ellen Burstyn, John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, Topher Grace and Matt Damon.

Destructive humans with matches.\n\nAcademy Award-winning actor Morgan Freeman narrates this story about the lemurs’ ancient past (they arrived on their island home more than 60 million years ago when the last of the dinosaurs were still around) and their uncertain future (the folks who live on Madagascar keep burning down the rain forests for farm land). But who can resist the wide-eyed, bouncy primates who look like they are dancing when they are running? Younger kids will eat it up. (B+)\n\nIMAX: 1, 6\n\nJerusalem 3D\n\nG, 45 minutes. Nothing objectionable.\n\nThree teenage girls from different religions (Muslim, Christian, Jewish) offer a guided tour of their hometown neighborhoods and customs in the ancient city where Jesus and Muhammed once tread. This politics-free travelogue from the National Geographic has gaping holes (why show a remote monastery but not give its name?) but it does capture the claustrophobic vibrancy of one of the world's most fought-over cities. Recommended for younger audiences or pilgrims who don't like the heat or dust. (B)\n\nIMAX: noon, 3\n\nJohn Wick\n\nR, 101 minutes. Profanity, extreme violence, gore, pet death.\n\nKeanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist. Blood will spill and bullets will fly when a former hitman comes out of retirement with a vengeance to track down the Russian thug who killed his dog and stole his vintage car. With Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane and Bridget Moynahan. Directed by Chad Stahelski, the stuntman who stepped into Brandon Lee’s role on “The Crow” (1994).\n\nIMAX: 4\n\nThe Judge\n\nR, 141 minutes. Profanity, violence, bathroom humor, sexual content.\n\nRobert Downey Jr., Robert Duvall. An arrogant, showy, defense attorney from Chicago returns to rural Indiana for his mother's funeral and clashes with his overbearing, legal-eagle father, who just happens to be charged with a deadly hit-and-run accident. With Billy Bob Thornton, Dax Shepard, Vera Farmiga and Vincent D'Onofrio. Overly long courtroom drama directed by David Dobkin (\"Wedding Crashers\") is just an excuse to let the two leads rip the scenery apart. And, holy Matlock, do they tear it up. (C+)\n\nMovies 8: 12:15, 3:15, 6:45, 9:40\n\nThe Maze Runner\n\nPG-13, 113 minutes. Profanity, violence, scary special effects.\n\nDylan O’Brien, Patricia Clarkson. After a captive teen, whose memory has been semi-erased, is thrown into an ever-shifting maze-like prison with other kidnapped kids, he tries to figure out a way to escape without getting killed. Sci-fi action pic based on James Dashner’s bestselling, futuristic series of dystopian novels for young adults. Directed by Wes Ball, an alum from Florida State’s film school.\n\nMovies 8: 11:55 a.m., 2:20, 4:45, 7:10, 9:35\n\nNightcrawler\n\nR, 117 minutes. Profanity, gruesome violence, gore, sexual content.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo. A thief becomes an unscrupulous freelance cameraman who trolls the the streets of Los Angeles at night shooting grisly footage of carjacking casualties, crash victims and crime scenes to sell to an insatiable TV producer, who happens to have no ethics, either. Written and directed by Dan Gilroy, the screenwriter of “The Bourne Legacy” (2012). Gyllenhaal hands in a terrific performance as the creepily over-achieving, immoral sociopath but the third act comes across as far-fetched, even if the film is a grand satire of the news biz.

Birds mating, smelly fish heads.\n\nSan Francisco filmmaker Judy Irving, who made the popular nature doc “The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill” (2003), turns her attention to the brown pelicans, an ancient species threatened by everything from oil spills to pesticides to fishing hooks. Even though Irving’s narration is sleepy, this is an engrossing documentary about fascinating birds that most Floridians take for granted. Opens Friday.

The evil octopus named Dr. Octavius Brine (voice of John Malkovich) hatches a plan to corral the world’s penguin population and turn the cute birds into deformed beasts until a squad of avian spies arrives to save the day in this animated comedy-adventure. Not as clever as the TV series but there are enough goofball jokes to keep adults and kids amused throughout. With the voices of Werner Herzog, Benedict Cumberbatch, Ben Stiller and Chris Rock.

Profanity, violence, sexual humor, smoking.\n\nBill Murray, Jaeden Lieberher. An overworked, single mom in Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn leaves her 12-year-old son in the care of the boozy, cranky gambler living next door in this coming-of-age comedy. With Melissa McCarthy, Naomi Watts and Terrence Howard. Written and directed by Theodore Melfi (“Roshambo”), who is making his feature-length debut. This completely predictable, ultimately sentimental comedy would be worthless if not for Murray’s scruffy performance. (B-)\n\nTallahassee Mall: 1, 3:30\n\nTop Five\n\nR, 101 minutes.

Profanity, sexual content, smoking.\n\nEddie Redmayne, Felicity Jones. During college days in Cambridge during the early ‘60s, the English astrophysicist Stephen Hawking is handed a grim medical prognosis just as his brilliant career and new marriage are taking off in this spotty bio-pic. Redmayne’s performance is impressive but the story is rather forced, especially when it comes to the topic of science vs. religion. With Emily Watson, David Thewlis and Anastasia Harrold. Directed by James Marsh (“Man on Wire”), who is not very keen on keeping his audience clued in about which decade the characters are inhabiting as the tale moves forward.

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2024/05/23/100-milwaukee-objects-for-culture-history-sports-food-drink-more/73307718007/", "title": "100 Milwaukee objects for culture, history, sports, food & drink, more", "text": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nSome of us used to say we were from Milwaukee with a hint of shame.\n\nBut there are signs everywhere we look that Cream City is rising. Businesses are relocating here. Top Chef launched its latest season in the city, complete with footage of the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Hoan Bridge and other landmarks. And while Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much these days, they both decided to hold their conventions in Milwaukee in recent years – or at least try to.\n\nWe wanted to celebrate our great city by honoring some of the things we love about it. The trouble is, there’s so much to love about Milwaukee that it was tough to decide which objects to highlight. (We settled on 100 objects; a push to do 414 was quickly shot down by editors.)\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nWe also know Milwaukee isn’t perfect and has long faced deep problems like racism, segregation and inequality. So we also wanted to focus on the struggle for a better future by including key locations in the city, such as the 16th Street Viaduct, in an effort to honor the fair housing marches of the 1960s.\n\nNext time somebody starts trashing Milwaukee, please tell them the city’s brightest days are still ahead. And maybe send them this list of 100 objects as a reminder that Milwaukee is indeed “the good land” full of promise – and some pretty great things.\n\n—Mary Spicuzza\n\n100 objects that make Milwaukee\n\nArchitecture\n\nCulture\n\nEntertainment\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood & drink\n\nHistory\n\nSports\n\nHow did we come up with these 100 objects? Here's an explanation.\n\nWhat did we miss? What doesn’t belong? Let us know here: bit.ly/MKE100More.\n\nThe Polish immigrants who poured into Milwaukee in the late 19th century wanted a beautiful church that telegraphed their strong Catholic faith and ethnic heritage. And they were willing to do anything for it.\n\nThey mortgaged their homes to raise money. They volunteered their labor. Fr. Wilhelm Grutza, the blacksmith-turned-pastor, shipped 500 rail cars of salvaged materials from a shuttered Chicago post office. He died five weeks after the church's dedication in 1901, exhausted from overwork.\n\nIn a city dotted with steeples and infused with Catholic tradition, the Basilica of St. Josaphat stood out. Modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, its 220-foot-high copper dome was only second in size to the U.S. Capitol at the time.\n\nToday, 123 years later, the ornate basilica is still larger-than-life. It’s a tourist destination as well as a hallowed space. The faithful who gather understand they’re among tens of thousands who have knelt in the pews for prayer, and heard the acoustics echo, and craned their necks to take in the intricately decorated cupola.\n\nIt’s Milwaukee’s largest church. It’s always been an anchor of the south side. But its dome – first illuminated at night in 2019 – cemented the basilica’s place in Milwaukee’s skyline for years to come.\n\nEven as church attendance and religious belief decline, the dome is a reminder of Catholics’ indelible impact on the city.\n\nIt calls to drivers passing on Interstate 43: I’ve been here over a century, and I’m here to stay.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nMilwaukee has a contentious history with public art (Google “Blue Shirt” if you need a reminder). Ensconced in O’Donnell Park at the lakefront, Mark di Suvero’s steel-beam sculpture “The Calling” has survived several rounds of controversy with the staying power of the sun that it abstractly mimics.\n\nFunded by an anonymous donor, it is made of steel I-beams painted orange and stands 40 feet tall. After 11 argumentative public hearings and much political grandstanding, the Common Council approved the artwork, which was dedicated in April 1982.\n\n“Di Suvero certainly was aware that many people would see his work from great distances and from the windows of rushing cars, buses and trucks,” Milwaukee Sentinel art critic Dean Jensen wrote in 1982. “Through its great size, its garish color and the grammar of its simple forms, it asserts its essence quickly and directly.”\n\n“The Calling” enjoyed a bonus kerfuffle in 2001 when architect Santiago Calatrava’s gleaming white addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum opened. Killjoys wanted the di Suvero away from the Calatrava sightline. The artist responded bluntly: “If you don’t want it, take it apart and ship it to me.”\n\nAs for the architect, he told Journal critic Whitney Gould that he designed the MAM addition with “The Calling” in mind. And if you stand along Wisconsin Avenue in the right spots, you’ll see that “The Calling” and the Calatrava addition line up perfectly.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of spring, when warmer weather finally thaws the winter roads. It’s the sound of the wind blowing across your face and through your hair. It’s the sound of speed, freedom, the open road. It’s the sound of summer, long rides cross-country or a short trip to the beach.\n\nIt’s the sound of friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson’s turn-of-the-20th-century ingenuity that grew from tinkering in a backyard shed to the construction of a two-wheeled, motor-powered bike and the desire to make it go fast, then faster. It’s the sound of a business born in 1903 and raised in Milwaukee, then taking off to become an internationally known brand. It’s the sound linked to leather, and the smell of gasoline. It’s the sound of putting the pedal to the metal.\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of a Harley.\n\n-Jessica Van Egeren\n\nJune 19, 1865, is the most crucial day in African American history. On that day, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared that the Civil War was over and all 250,000 enslaved people in the state — the last remaining slaves in the South — were now free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 1997, a flag was designed to commemorate Juneteenth and was later revised.\n\nThe flag features red, white, and blue colors — from the American flag — with a white bursting star of freedom in the middle. An arc runs through the flag’s center to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for African Americans. The blue is above the red because the red represents the ground soaked with blood from all those who came before us and fought for freedom.\n\nMilwaukee’s annual Juneteenth celebration is one of the country’s oldest — the city was one of the first in the northern states to began officially celebrating Juneteenth, in 1971.\n\nJuneteenth and its flag are significant for me as an African American. My grandparents, who lived in Mississippi, referred to it as “Jubilee Day,” and they celebrated it by enjoying strawberry soda and red velvet cake that symbolized the blood shed by enslaved West African ancestors.\n\nThis flag should be flown on Juneteenth and every day in our country.\n\n-James E. Causey\n\nIf you live anywhere in the Milwaukee area, you’ve almost definitely seen an Oak Leaf Trail sign. The over 135-mile multi-use trail traverses throughout Milwaukee County and is beloved by cyclists, runners, walkers, birders, skateboarders, rollerbladers and more. It’s a mainstay in numerous local running races throughout the year.\n\nThe Oak Leaf can take you pretty much anywhere in Milwaukee and offers beautiful views; nearly a quarter travels along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The trail’s nine branch lines connect users to dozens of county parks, beer gardens and attractions in the area.\n\nThe Oak Leaf also intersects with various other municipal trails, allowing for travel beyond the county. The northern terminus connects to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which users can take all the way to Sheboygan County.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine the Oak Leaf without its variety of users today, it was not open for non-cycling use (or given its current name) until 1996. The trail’s origins date back to the late 1930s, when local cycling enthusiasts established an about-65-mile bike route around Milwaukee County.\n\nThree decades later, the trail was officially recognized by the county parks department. In 1976, it was christened the “76 Bike Trail” in honor of the national bicentennial.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nFor more than 150 years, few objects have represented the city of Milwaukee better than a mug of beer – the key component of gemütlichkeit, which Milwaukeeans have pursued since long before prohibition.\n\nBeer steins clutched in the hands of dozens of strangers crowded together at long wooden tables under tree canopies represents the city’s long devotion to the craft of beer brewing and community, and pays tribute to the city’s sturdy Germanic roots.\n\nGerman immigrants inspired the creation of the city’s breweries and made beer gardens the quintessential gathering spot of Milwaukee. According to the Milwaukee County Parks Department, more than two dozen breweries were in operation by 1856, making way for beer gardens along the Milwaukee River.\n\nProhibition in the 1920s curtailed such gatherings, but the idea has experienced a revival in recent years.\n\nThe city has several permanent beer gardens, including the popular Estabrook Beer Garden along the river greenway in the city’s northeast side, between Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. And the county’s Traveling Beer Garden tours bring the beer garden experience to neighborhood parks around the city throughout the summer.\n\nHere, you can fill your beer stein with Hofbrau, wash down bratwurst or a soft pretzel, and watch your neighbors polka – just like Milwaukeeans did generations before.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nMusic can bring a community together.\n\nWant proof? Just visit Washington Park’s bandshell on a Wednesday evening in the summer.\n\nYou’ll see families and friends spreading out blankets and popping open lawn chairs on the grassy amphitheater.\n\nYou’ll smell barbecue, wood-fired pizza and popcorn wafting from local vendors’ food trucks.\n\nAnd depending on the night, you’ll hear classical, jazz, reggae, opera, folk, rock, punk or a fusion of genres.\n\nThe stunning art deco bandshell is formally known as the Emil Blatz Temple of Music, named for the man who came from a brewing dynasty and donated $100,000 for its construction in the city’s largest park.\n\nAt its dedication in 1938, a crowd of 40,000 – “a mass of mothers, fathers, maidens, swains and wide-eyed children” – heard a performance from the Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra and singer Jessica Dragonette, The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n“If this temple of music gives you as much pleasure as it has given me in donating it, I am fully repaid,” Blatz told those who gathered on the lawn.\n\nIn the 86 years since, the bandshell has hosted musical legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Lily Pons, often as part of its “Music Under the Stars” program, which ran for 55 years.\n\nToday, Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on the tradition, providing a welcoming space for neighbors of all ages to sing, dance and listen.\n\n-Ashley Luthern\n\nWhen it comes to Frank Lloyd Wright, most Wisconsinites think of Taliesin, the architect’s home and workshop in Spring Green, the S.C. Johnson headquarters building in Racine or Monona Terrace in Madison.\n\nBut did you know there’s an entire block on the city’s south side that’s a showcase for Wright’s more modest designs?\n\nThe Burnham Block is a one-of-a-kind collection of six buildings constructed in 1916 as models for affordable housing for working-class people. The collection of single-family homes and duplexes on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street have the typical Wright touches of rich woodwork, tall vertical windows and natural construction materials, but they’re substantially smaller than the homes Wright had previously designed.\n\n“These are Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision to house every person, every American in a beautiful, artistic place to call home,” said Mike Lilek, curator for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block, Inc., the nonprofit that owns five of the six buildings.\n\nThe organization has restored two buildings, which now function as a museum that is open for public tours. Plans are being developed for restoring the home on the northwest corner of South Layton Boulevard and West Burnham Street.\n\nYou can make reservations for a guided tour at wrightinmilwaukee.org.\n\n-Karl Ebert\n\nGreeting visitors by water from the east, the Hoan Bridge is both Milwaukee’s iconic and ironic symbol for the city’s socialist history.\n\nFormer Mayor Daniel Hoan, the city’s longest serving socialist mayor, had much of Milwaukee onboard with his policies, but when the bridge for part of Interstate 794 was erected in his honor, many were dismayed.\n\n“Where transportation was concerned, Dan Hoan was no fan of car culture,” said Phil Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University. “Quite the opposite. He often bitterly complained that cars locked the city into a dynamic of ever-greater spending on ever-widening streets and that greater traffic jeopardized public safety.”\n\nThe public gets an up close and personal view of the Hoan, which opened for traffic in 1977, during the highlight of Milwaukee’s warm months — Summerfest.\n\nIt crosses over the Milwaukee Harbor, welcoming shipping, and connects downtown to Bay View and other parts of southern Milwaukee County. It’s in the foreground of many photographers’ shots of the city skyline, and is lit every night, often to honor an event or person.\n\nCoined the “bridge to nowhere” during construction, the Hoan has very much become part of Milwaukee’s image.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nYou don’t have to be the commissioner of Major League Baseball or owner of the Milwaukee Bucks to eat like them.\n\nAt Jake’s Delicatessen, 1634 W. North Ave., patrons can walk and eat in the shadow of former MLB Commissioner Allan H. “Bud” Selig and late Bucks owner Herb Kohl, who frequented the deli.\n\nJake’s Deli opened in 1955 and catered to the many Jewish families who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Haymarket and Sherman Park neighborhoods. In 1969, Selig bought an ownership stake in the business and held it until Wajeeh Alturkman bought it in 2021.\n\nJake’s has a modest appearance with a vertical street sign that reads “Jake’s.” Those in search of a good sandwich don’t need any further description.\n\nJake’s is known for its corned beef, but it’s the pastrami sandwich that gets people talking. Patrons have a choice to get the rye bread toasted or keep it plain, with yellow or brown mustard and their choice of cheese.\n\nIf they take a seat on the bench by the counter, the meat is cut slowly right in front of them. And a pickle spear is served on the side.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nLike its subject, downtown’s mural of Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is larger than life — covering the three-story back wall of a historic office building at 600-606 E. Wisconsin Ave. It was painted there in spring 2022 by local artist Mauricio Ramirez. The building is owned by Dan Nelson Jr., a Bucks season ticket holder and president and chief executive officer of Nelson Schmidt Inc., a marketing communications agency that operates at the building.\n\nFor Giannis fans, it’s a must-stop photo op, and perhaps Milwaukee’s best-known mural.\n\nHis legacy is still being written, but already includes being named Most Valuable Player in the 2021 NBA championship series and two regular season MVP awards in 2019 and 2020. And it will always include Milwaukee, where we’ve watched him grow from a teenager to a dominant player, an involved father and a noted fan of chicken nuggets.\n\nBucks in six!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nHow do you decide on an iconic symbol to symbolize a place that is so iconic?\n\nI’m speaking of the Milwaukee Public Museum. And, if you’re in a roomful of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, the answer is, not without a fight.\n\nThe museum has been around (in various iterations and locations) since 1851. And it’s become a go-to place for field trips and weekend excursions.\n\nSo this reporter (having been on many such field trips and excursions) suggested the rattlesnake button for MPM’s symbol. Because how could you possibly end a trip to the museum without sitting on the ledge surrounding the bison hunt exhibit, reaching your hand underneath and flicking the switch? The answer is, you cannot.\n\nAnother reporter proposed the T-Rex, which for decades has been famously munching on the remains of his fallen prey in the museum’s strikingly realistic (and scary) dinosaur diorama.\n\nAfter vigorous debate, we were outvoted by proponents of Granny, who calmly rocks in her chair on the porch of her house in the Streets of Old Milwaukee. Granted, she does live in possibly the most popular exhibit ever at the museum. And (especially impressive for someone her age), she has her own social media accounts. So who is this reporter to argue?\n\nBut MPM apparently agrees the rattlesnake button and T-Rex are iconic since they’ll be making the trek to the new museum, slated to open in 2027. Granny will be there, too.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nMost will agree that a trip (or two or several) to the Milwaukee County Zoo is necessary if you want to call yourself a true Milwaukeean.\n\nAnd many Milwaukee children (or grownups waxing nostalgic about their childhoods) will agree that a trip to the zoo is not complete without a ride on the train and a Mold-a-Rama souvenir of their favorite animal. This is universal.\n\nLess universal is choosing your favorite zoo animal. Milwaukee has had some famous ones over the years, from Gordy the groundhog to Chandar the Bengal tiger to Onassis the geriatric Giant South American River turtle.\n\nPerhaps the most famous is an animal that members of the Millennial generation and afterward never even met. But he lives in the memories of middle-age and older Milwaukeeans.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Public Library, Samson the gorilla arrived as a baby in Milwaukee in 1950 (back when the zoo was located in Washington Park). He moved to the zoo’s current location in 1959, and would for years grab the attention of delighted, fascinated and (sometimes) terrified zoo visitors when he pounded on the glass of his enclosure.\n\nSamson died of a heart attack in 1981, but Milwaukeeans can pay homage to him with a visit to the Milwaukee Public Museum, where there is a lifelike re-creation of the famous gorilla.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nIf you’ve never lived outside Milwaukee, you may be wondering why a clearly universal celebration like St. Nick’s Day — that perfectly timed mini-holiday to tide you over till Christmas with a few little treats in your stocking or shoes — is being honored in a dedication to Milwaukee things.\n\nBut Milwaukee is one of relatively few places that have been lucky enough to hold on to the tradition, along with other cities with large German or Dutch influence, such as Cincinnati; Holland, Michigan; and St. Louis.\n\nThe feast of 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas is celebrated Dec. 6. Traditionally, St. Nick is thought to go from house to house on the night of Dec. 5, leaving treats in the shoes of children.\n\nIn most places, St. Nick has become synonymous with Santa Claus, and everybody knows he brings treats and gifts just once a year — on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor kids new to the city (and their parents), now you know: Milwaukee kids get two mornings in December to wake up to find gifts.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nThe Milwaukee County War Memorial is one of the most recognizable buildings on the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nSituated just north of the Milwaukee Art Museum, the War Memorial overlooks the lake from the east side of downtown on East Mason Street, and its plaza is a popular spot for gathering to see lakefront fireworks.\n\nIts mission comes down to six words: “Honor the Dead. Serve the Living.”\n\nThe building was dedicated on Veterans Day 1957, the work of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, according to the War Memorial’s website.\n\nThe building’s design was “influenced by the abstract geometry of modern French architect Le Corbusier,” according to the Milwaukee Art Museum website.\n\nThe building is not only a memorial but a “hub for veteran activities,” the War Memorial website states.\n\nAn eternal flame memorial sits in a small pool, illuminating a black granite honor roll that includes names of Milwaukee County residents who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nOn your way to a fancy night out in the Third Ward, take the right path and you’ll come across a permanent trio of massive ladybugs that look like they could be headed the same direction as you.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how massive they are, exactly: They’re perched way up on the side of the Milwaukee Building on North Water Street.\n\nAt least, it’s a hard calculation looking up at them from the sidewalk or from a car whizzing by.\n\nThe fiberglass bugs are each about 6 feet long and 3 feet deep and have been hanging there since July 1999.\n\nThey were thought up by John J. Burke to decorate the building that houses the company he started, Burke Properties, according to his obituary.\n\nNot much has been written about them, which is a testament to how many interesting things Milwaukee offers — we take even giant beetles for granted.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nThe most quintessentially Milwaukee treat, especially on a hot summer day. (But, let’s be honest: We Midwesterners enjoy a cold cone even when it’s below zero.)\n\nFrozen custard is a step up from your average ice cream because it includes egg yolks that make for a richer texture.\n\nTravel Wisconsin lists Milwaukee as the unofficial “frozen custard capital of the world,” a kind way of saying no visitor should leave the city without trying frozen custard from at least one, if not multiple, locations.\n\nMight we suggest a formal custard tasting?\n\nThree places to start: Gilles, Leon’s and Kopp’s. Each serves a couple of basic flavors every day, plus a Flavor of the Day that’s often more unique.\n\nGilles Frozen Custard opened in 1938, making it the oldest operating stand in the city, according to Travel Wisconsin. Find it at 7515 W. Bluemound Road, and don’t be shy about taking a look at the full menu of non-frozen treats.\n\nLeon’s Frozen Custard popped up just a few years later, in 1942, and is still operated by the original family, according to its website. The year-round business at 3131 S. 27th St. bills itself as a “classic 1950s-style family owned drive-in, specializing in frozen custard.”\n\nKopp’s Frozen Custard: Come for dessert, stay for dinner. With locations in Glendale, Brookfield and Greenfield, you’re never too far from the custard shop that’s also known for its massive burgers.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nYou might know it from the 1970s and 80s sitcom Laverne & Shirley, in which “Welcome Milwaukee visitors” is displayed in all-caps across the bell tower in the opening credits.Or, you might just be familiar from passing the iconic building that sits on a triangular slice of land with its north end at the intersection of East Kilbourn Avenue and North Water Street.\n\nThe Flemish Renaissance-inspired structure in the heart of downtown Milwaukee was completed in 1895, becoming a fixture of the city’s skyline. It cost about $1 million to construct, according to the city.\n\nIts atrium in the building’s center rises eight stories and serves as the site of city functions and news conferences by officials and those challenging their actions.\n\nOn the floors that ascend from the atrium are various city offices, including the Mayor’s Office and the Common Council Chambers where the 15-member council conducts its public meetings. Others include the Assessor’s Office and City Attorney’s Offices.\n\nFrom the base of the bell tower to the top of the flagpole, the building ascends 393 feet in the air. For a few years after City Hall opened in 1895, it was one of the tallest habitable buildings – if not the tallest – in the nation and world.\n\nThe tower holds the bell known as “Solomon Juneau” after Milwaukee’s first mayor, according to the city. The bell was made from church and firehouse bells from around the city and first rang on New Year’s Eve 1896.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nIn the heart of Marquette University’s bustling campus, a medieval remnant offers respite for the soul.\n\nJoan of Arc Chapel began its life as a place of worship circa 1420 in the village of Chasse, southeast of Lyon, France. Named then after St. Martin de Seysseul, it served the people of Chasse-sur-Rhône for hundreds of years before falling into disrepair.\n\nJoan of Arc, the legendary warrior and patron saint of France, is said to have prayed at the chapel in 1429. That was part of its attraction to Gertrude Hill Gavin, who bought it in 1927 and had it moved to her estate in Long Island, N.Y.\n\nMarc Rotjman, a former president of Racine’s J.I. Case Co., and his wife, Lillian, bought the chapel in 1962 and later donated it to Marquette. Over nine months, its 30 tons of stone and 18,000 terracotta roof tiles were carefully disassembled, labeled and shipped to Milwaukee. The reassembled and renamed chapel opened here in 1966. Its nave was lengthened to allow seating up to 60 people; radiant floor heating and electricity were also added.\n\nThe Gothic chapel is a striking landmark amid so many buildings centuries younger. But it continues to be an active worship site, with as many as seven Masses a week when classes are in session, including a Sunday afternoon liturgy in Spanish.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nFor many people, just balancing on ice skates is hard ... now imagine maintaining control while skating at 30 miles per hour and racing fellow skaters. That’s the sport of speedskating.\n\nMilwaukee is home to one of the top speedskating facilities in the world: the Pettit National Ice Center. The Pettit is one of only two 400-meter indoor speedskating ovals in the country and is an official U.S. Speedskating training facility. It opened in 1992 and replaced the outdoor Wisconsin Olympic Ice Rink, which occupied the site from 1967 to 1991.\n\nAll of the U.S. speedskaters to compete in the past six Winter Olympics have raced or trained at the Pettit Center. The facility has hosted the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Trials and other elite competitions. Over the years, the Pettit has been the home training facility of numerous speedskating greats, including five-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, 1994 gold medalist Dan Jansen and four-time Olympic medalist Shani Davis.\n\nThe Pettit also boasts two international-size hockey rinks and a 443-meter walking and running track. It is the home of multiple local hockey and skating clubs and offers figure skating, speedskating and hockey lessons for children and adults.\n\nThe track is a popular winter training spot for high school, college and adult runners. It hosts track practices, meets and even a 95-lap indoor marathon.\n\nBut, if you’re looking for something a little less athletically intense, the Pettit also has ample public skate hours with skate rentals ... perfect for date night or a fun family activity.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nPecan fingers, snickerdoodles, butterscotch bars and more.\n\nWisconsin residents have been making Christmas treats published in the annual We Energies Cookie Book for nearly a hundred years.\n\nEvery year, the company compiles recipes submitted by residents in a book celebrating themes like military service and hometown favorites.\n\nPicking up a copy of the book has become a Christmas tradition in many Wisconsin households. Some longtime Wisconsinites collect copies for years, passing them down through generations.\n\nThe We Energies Cookie Book was introduced in 1928, back when the company was known as the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.\n\nThe book was sent to customers to promote the company’s appliances. Through the 1930s, the book grew in popularity and was distributed at the Public Service Building in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nThe book has gone through temporary changes over the years. During World War II, the 1942 edition had 14 recipes for wartime cookies, featuring cookie low in shortening and sugar to accommodate for rationing ingredients during the war.\n\nAfter the 1973 book, the company stopped publishing the book until 1984 due to rising energy costs. The book was published in 1991, 1998, 2002 and restored to its annual printing tradition in 2006. You can find each cookie book digitally archived at we-energies.com/recipes/archive.\n\n-Alex Groth\n\nIf you’ve dined at a Wisconsin supper club or visited a traditional cocktail lounge, chances are you’ve heard of (or enjoyed) the Pink Squirrel. In the family of ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, the Pink Squirrel has a special Milwaukee connection: it was, as far as anyone can tell, invented at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, 1579 S. 9th St., in the 1940s.\n\nWith just three ingredients — vanilla ice cream, creme de cacao (chocolate liqueur) and creme de noyaux (almond-flavored liqueur) — the Pink Squirrel is a sweet, nutty, creamy way to drink your dessert.\n\nBoth the rosy hue and nutty flavor can be attributed to the creme de noyaux, a liqueur made from apricot, peach or cherry kernels and originally colored with cochineal.\n\nAs the story goes, Bryant and Edna Sharp opened Bryant’s as a Miller Brewing tied house in 1936. Within a few years, Bryant abandoned the beer hall approach and transformed the business into the first cocktail lounge in Milwaukee and, quite likely, Wisconsin.\n\n“People who knew him described him as quiet and serious, with a talent and passion for mixology,” a history of the bar says of Bryant Sharp. “He also was known for putting together unique flavors, which he sold to cordial companies.”\n\nIt’s only fitting that this classic ice cream cocktail can trace its roots to one of the Dairy State’s favorite drinking establishments.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nSince 1994, drivers traveling north on I-43 have seen the giant eagle and only slightly smaller dove on the wall of a National Avenue building. Back then, Esperanza Unida director Richard Oulahan commissioned artist Reynaldo Hernandez to create a mural to reflect the heritage and aspirations of the south-side community. “The Mural of Peace,” about 80 feet by 150 feet, shows both birds with an olive branch, with a bolt of lightning between them and a background of colored stripes representing flags of different lands.\n\nThe mural is painted not on the building’s cream city brick, but on nearly 300 panels affixed to it. After a few years, weather damaged some panels. Contributors to a fund drive to restore the mural included Tippecanoe Elementary students, who raised more than $566 in a penny drive.\n\nThe Walker’s Point building at 611 W. National Ave. is now the Mercantile Lofts Apartments. During its conversion to living spaces, modifications were made that created windows on that wall for inhabitants but still kept the bold colors of Hernandez’s design visible.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nThe Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, located on South 2nd Street and just north of Greenfield Avenue, has been a staple of Milwaukee’s skyline and for decades was the largest four-sided clock tower in the world.\n\nSitting atop what is now Rockwell Automation, the 283-foot-tall clock was revealed on Halloween 1962. The clockworks were built by the Allen-Bradley company, which specialized in electrical controls.\n\nThe tower is four separate clocks running on individual motors. About once a month its gears require greasing, but it’s lit by LED bulbs that rarely need to be replaced.\n\nTwice a year everyone moves their clocks forward or back an hour, usually by pushing a button. Changing the Allen-Bradley clock requires a security guard on the outside with a radio looking up at each face while someone with a special key turns four switches inside a room on the first floor.\n\nIn its early years it was referred to as the “Polish moon” because of the bright display in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. But over time more Mexican immigrants and families moved to the south side and the nickname was changed to the “Mexican moon” to recognize how the neighborhood has changed.\n\nThe clock also illuminated the fight against discrimination in labor in 1968, when the Latino and Black communities joined efforts to fight discriminatory hiring practices at the Allen-Bradley Company.\n\nThe protest was started by Father James E. Groppi. Younger Latino residents took up the cause and more activism against the company continued for another year. The march on Allen-Bradley is considered a success, given the consciousness it created and the progress Latinos in Milwaukee have made in the half-century since.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nFirst things first: The correct pronunciation is poonch-ka, says Joe Parajecki, a chef at the Polish Center in Franklin.\n\nAnd yes, they are similar to jelly-filled donuts, but they’re much richer. Ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs and yeast are put into the dough before giving them up for Lent.\n\nPaczki is traditionally eaten on Fat Tuesday in Milwaukee, though in Poland, it’s actually celebrated on the Thursday before Lent.\n\n“You can’t believe the lines in Poland to get paczki on Fat Thursday. People eat a dozen or more each,” Parajecki said.\n\nMilwaukee is one of the “capital cities of Polish America,” according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Two decades after the city was founded, 30 families organized the first Polish Catholic congregation in urban America.\n\nA traditional paczki is the size of a walnut and doesn’t look like a donut at all, Parajecki said. It’s sweet dough wrapped around a prune or filled with rose jam, which is “a very acquired taste. It’s like eating a jar of perfume.”\n\nPrune and raspberry are the most common fillings in America, but there are newer flavors like Nutella and lemon. Parajecki is amazed by how many people who celebrate paczki, even those who aren’t Polish.\n\nHe doesn’t care about the paczki vs. donut discussion — more important is tying it to a memory, like sitting around grandma’s table.\n\n“We’re not eating it to debate those things. We’re eating it to remember, we’re eating it to have a good time.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nYou just got through TSA at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. You’re missing a shoe, toiletries are bursting from your carry-on, and where is that boarding pass again?\n\nA sign past the security checkpoint: Recombobulation Area. An invitation and a space to put your things back in order.\n\nIt all started in 2008, when former airport director Barry Bateman told the sign shop he had a great idea.\n\nHe was told “recombobulation” wasn’t an actual word, the airport’s director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said. Bateman knew that.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s try to make this a little bit more fun during this stressful experience. If someone gets a chuckle when they go through the checkpoint, then we’ve done our job.’”\n\nAs far as Mester is aware, Milwaukee is the only airport to use the “recombobulation” phrase. “Recomposure” is the more technical term, but as Mester pointed out, “that’s an actual word.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society once declared “recombobulation” the most creative word of the year. And the term has inspired other branding efforts in Milwaukee, from billboards to beer.\n\nIt’s also the namesake of a blog by Dan Shafer. As he put it, recombobulation is the “opposite of discombobulation.” He is often tagged in the many selfies taken in front of the sign.\n\nThe sign represents Milwaukee’s sense of humor about itself, Shafer said.\n\n“It’s just one of those quintessentially Milwaukee types of things. It’s just quirky and weird enough and resonates with people.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nWalk into a Milwaukee supper club or bar on a Friday night and you’ll likely see bartenders lining up rocks glasses and filling each with maraschino cherries, orange slices and a dash of sugar. Next comes a shot of soda water and a muddler. Then, the brandy.\n\nThe Old Fashioned cocktail isn’t supposed to be made with brandy, but like anything in Wisconsin, we’ve taken an idea and made it our own. And boy, do we own it.\n\nDuring an average weekend at the Five O’ Clock Steakhouse on West State Street, bartenders serve more than 100 brandy Old Fashioneds, general manager Hegel Terron told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDuring the week, the daily average probably tops at 75, he said.\n\nAt the Packing House supper club on East Layton Avenue, general manager Chris Wiken said he’s ordering two cases of Korbel brandy per week.\n\nThe vast majority of customers are asking for brandy Old Fashioneds sweet, Wiken said. But in recent years, customers are getting a bit more picky about which brandy they want – ordering Milwaukee’s Central Standard or even comedian Charlie Berens’ spirit.\n\nOn a good Friday night, the Packing House is filling a couple hundred rocks glasses with Wisconsin’s favorite cocktail. In a year’s time, that’s tens of thousands, Wiken said.\n\n“I cannot keep Korbel on hand. It just flies out the door,” he said. “Friday night is probably when we sell the most because the pairing with the fish fry is a really good pairing.”\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, there are a few ways to give yourself away. First: Order a bourbon Old Fashioned instead of brandy sweet. Second: Wear a Cardinals hat. Third: Ask for directions to the nearest water fountain.\n\nInexplicably, public water fountains here are called bubblers and pretty much only here. There are some in Rhode Island, for some reason, but the vast, vast majority of the nation adopted “drinking fountains” and “water fountains.”\n\nMilwaukee appears to be ground zero for the use of bubbler, according to UW-Madison’s Dictionary of American Regional English. Its origins are fuzzy but may be tied to its use by Kohler Co., one of Wisconsin’s most famous brands – a manufacturer of faucets among other water-related products.\n\nThe company in 1914 promoted a water fountain created by Kohler as being fitted with a “continuous flow bubbler,” according to the UW-Madison dictionary.\n\nA former dictionary editor in 2015 told Wisconsin Public Radio that “bubbler” was used especially in the southeastern area of the state starting in the mid 1910s. More than a century later, we’re still using bubblers.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nSundays in Milwaukee have a smell: buttery, fresh-baked rolls.\n\nAfter church, it’s tradition to pick up what’s known as hot ham and rolls – an end-of-weekend feast with origins in the cream city’s German or Polish roots, depending on which bakery owner you speak to.\n\nFor less than $30 at Grebe Bakery, for example, you can get three pounds of ham, 18 rolls and two pounds of potato salad.\n\nThe meal is part of Milwaukee’s identity, so much so that former Gov. Scott Walker made it part of his politico persona along with other attributes Walker promoted to assure voters he was as Wisconsin as they were.\n\nHe tweeted nearly 20 times about procuring hot ham and rolls from now-shuttered Fattoni’s deli after church in Wauwatosa during his first term as governor.\n\nBrian Schwellinger, president of Badger Ham, which provides the hams for many bakeries’ meal deals, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2021 the hot ham and rolls tradition is likely rooted in religion.\n\n“There were so many churches that the church tradition was a strong part of the community, and after service is when you had your first meal of the day,” Schwellinger said.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nThe Great Lakes may seem like an limitless resource, but the world’s largest surface freshwater system faces major threats from pollution, climate change, invasive species and overexploitation.\n\nAnd to understand and protect it, scientists need to be out on the water.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences has made its mark on Great Lakes research. It’s the only graduate school of freshwater sciences in the country and one of only three in the world.\n\nUW-Milwaukee’s main research vessel, the Neeskay, is the only research vessel out on the lakes year-round.\n\nBefore the Neeskay started powering scientific expeditions in 1970, it was an Army T-boat used during the Korean War. Its name comes from the Ho-Chunk word for “pure, clean water.”\n\nScientists use the Neeskay to study algae blooms, invasive quagga and zebra mussels, and microbes that live out in the lakes. It’s also used to deploy buoys that monitor weather and lake characteristics, like temperature and nutrients.\n\nBut the Neeskay, along with a fleet of small boats, are only just the start. The university has been raising money since 2016 to build the Maggi Sue, which will become the most technologically advanced freshwater research ship in the country.\n\nThe Maggi Sue is expected to open many doors in understanding what’s going on out in the Great Lakes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe Bucks’ mascot has delighted crowds with dunks and stunts, from the Milwaukee Arena to the Bradley Center to Fiserv Forum, for almost 50 years.\n\nBango made his debut in the team’s 1977-78 home opener — which pitted the Bucks against the Los Angeles Lakers two years after NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for L.A.\n\nNamed for the call the team’s original radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, made when players made a long-range basket, Bango was the moniker chosen by fans in a contest.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s gone through several makeovers and celebrated many milestones.\n\nIn 1984, he got his first car (it’s unclear whether he was old enough to drive; we’re not sure how deer aging equates here). He got married in 2002, and welcomed Bango Jr. in 2005. Two years later, Bango and Bango Jr. first appeared in their inflatable forms. 2010 was a big year for Bango: he nailed a few new dunks and was honored as the NBA Mascot of the Year.\n\nThe next few years brought more cervid celebrations: Cartoon Network’s “Most Awesome Mascot,” a human hamster ball dunk and a featured role on the Hulu “Behind the Mask” documentary. There were also a few mishaps along the way — a torn ACL and a broken rim during a Badgers halftime show.\n\nWhether he’s wearing a sweater or a full uniform with the number 68 (for the team’s first season), doing acrobatics on the court or making appearances in the community, Bango is Milwaukee’s most dominant deer.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nOne call, that’s all.\n\nIt’s not a particularly unusual slogan. Milwaukee isn’t home to the only law firm that has used it. But say those words around Milwaukee, and you’ll get immediate recognition, and probably a smile. Is it weird that simply saying the slogan or name of a personal injury lawyer, albeit a locally famous one, can cultivate ... joy?\n\nDavid Gruber, the lawyer in question, has been using the slogan in TV advertisements since the late 1990s, born from a collaboration with a Dallas media company.\n\nHe looks into the camera and punctuates every ad with those famous four words, a catchphrase that has become the dictum around which his entire brand has been constructed.\n\nThe celebrity lawyer can be found in the first few rows of Milwaukee sporting events and has partnered with just about every major sports operation in the city, a nod to his lengthy interest in athletics.\n\nAnd it’s not hard to score a “Gruber Law Office” T-shirt at a sporting event or at street fairs around the city, the perfect giveaway to spread the Gruber gospel and let everyone around you know how Milwaukee you are.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIn Milwaukee, the herald of winter’s thaw is not that growing patch of green on a lawn or the first magnolia blossom peeling open or that last crusty pile of parking lot snow.\n\nNo: It’s the first aroma of match meeting propane, that sizzle of cold meat on hot grates, the collective tower of smoke rising above the interchange at American Family Field.\n\nIt’s spring. It’s grilling season.\n\nYou don’t have to be the one grilling to enjoy its benefits. The first sunny day in March when it’s light past 5 p.m. — that’s when it happens. The first smells of a neighbor lighting charcoal and laying down some hamburger patties.\n\n“Someone’s grilling,” you say, and you smile.\n\nGrill smells permeate the air in Milwaukee from spring to fall. On a summer day, you can drive around with the windows down and you know when the neighbors are gathering. You can be sure there’s a cold beer in a koozy and the charcoal is heating up.\n\nAnd then there’s the tailgate, that communal grilling session. Many urban ballparks have parking garages or no parking at all, thus no opportunity to truly enjoy the baseball experience. But the tailgate endures in Milwaukee. On a sunny day (or rainy or snowy, we’re hardy people), the American Family Field parking lots are packed with canopies, games of corn hole and folding chairs all huddled around one thing: the grill.\n\n-Lainey Seyler\n\nAre you a “call an ace” player or a “picker and jack of diamond” player when you sit down at the sheepshead table? And if you don’t know what those phrases mean, you probably aren’t familiar with “leaster,” “re-crack” or “schmear.” To know the card game is to speak a certain kind of Milwaukee dialect.\n\nThe trick-taking game often features five players but has its share of variants, with different rules and terminology for different parts of the state. But this isn’t a pastime that’s achieved a high level of popularity outside the state’s borders.\n\nLike Milwaukee, sheepshead’s roots are deeply German — the game is Schakopf in its native country, and the unofficial history involves disgruntled peasants inventing the game that gave kings a lower ranking. Sheepshead arrived in Milwaukee with a large population of German immigrants, many of whom worked in brewing.\n\nThe card game’s patron saint, Bob Strupp, published “How To Play ‘Winning’ 5 Handed Sheepshead” in 1983. The lifelong Milwaukeean attended Common Council meetings to advocate that the game should be declared Milwaukee’s official card game, a campaign that proved successful.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Glendale has claimed to serve as home to the largest sheepshead tournament in the world; a nurse from Kewaskum won in 2024.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere was a time when Milwaukee had earned the title as “The Bowling Capital of America.”\n\nEvolving from German “kegling,” German-Americans helped raise the game’s popularity in the states, and a city like Milwaukee with a deep German heritage was quick to adopt. But as nationwide popularity fell, Milwaukee’s bowling culture wasn’t ... well, uh, spared.\n\nThe United States Bowling Congress, which once called Greendale home, moved to Texas in 2008. The PBA Tour, once sponsored by Miller Brewing, stopped making the city a regular tour stop after 1990, bowling centers closed and WTMJ’s wildly popular “Bowling With the Champs” TV series, which made local celebrities out of top bowlers and served as a precursor to reality competition television, ended after 41 years in 1995.\n\nBut bowling’s history remains visible around the city and state. Milwaukee tavern The Holler House houses the oldest sanctioned bowling alley in the United States, and the miniature version of the sport still has a place at legendary Koz’s Mini Bowl, home to “the last duckpin bowling in the U.S.” The Vulcan Corporation in northern Wisconsin became a major manufacturer of bowling pins.\n\nAnd the PBA even returned for a stop in Wauwatosa in 2023.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIt’s the floor that made Milwaukee famous.\n\nDesigned for $27,500 by New York pop artist Robert Indiana — a man with the perfect name to match the flamboyance of the masterpiece — the MECCA floor was a controversial addition in 1977. The Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center (known today as the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, but then abbreviated as the MECCA) served as home to the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette men’s basketball team. Marquette basketball, known for its eclectic uniforms and the fiery personality of recently retired head coach Al McGuire, was the perfect match for the look.\n\nThe floor featured two giant Ms consuming either half of the court, somewhat hidden in the two-toned yellow paint scheme, a red bull’s eye at center court and blue lettering for “MECCA” wrapped twice around the center circle. Dark red for the lanes, dark blue for the sideline and dark green for the perimeter.\n\nThe gaudy floor didn’t quite fit everyone’s aesthetic tastes immediately (including new MU head coach Hank Raymonds), but it was a hit with plenty of fans (and Bucks coach Don Nelson). It became part of the Milwaukee color palette until the Bucks moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks re-created the floor for a “Return to the MECCA” game in 2017, a return to the building that harbored the 1971 NBA champion and 1977 NCAA champion.\n\nIndiana rose to fame because of his “LOVE” sculpture, but the MECCA floor remains a distinctly Milwaukee concept.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere are many places around Milwaukee where you can take a drink of history, including many brewery tours.\n\nBut there is also a non-alcoholic option nestled between Wentworth Avenue and Superior Street in Bay View:\n\nThe Pryor Avenue Iron Well, a source of drinking water since 1882.\n\nOriginally drilled to provide drinking water and fire protection, it’s the last surviving public well in the city, according to the Historical Preservation Committee. The city named it a historic structure in 1987.\n\nWhile the well is just a short walk from Lake Michigan, the water actually comes from an aquifer nearly 120 feet underground.\n\nThe iron-rich water tastes a bit different than city water. The water is clear with a distinct metallic taste. Sometimes there might be a faint smell of sulfur.\n\nElevated levels of strontium, a natural element found in bedrock, were detected in 2015. But according to the EPA, the levels are only an issue for sensitive populations after drinking the water over the course of a lifetime.\n\nOverall the water is safe to drink, according to Milwaukee Water Works and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn fact, the well was a lifeline for many during the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak that ravaged the municipal water supply.\n\nSo fill a jug or take a sip from the bubbler. Just ignore the penny-like metallic notes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe drive along the Hoan Bridge offers some of the best views of the Milwaukee skyline and Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd if the wind blows in the right direction, it’s also where you can get a good whiff of Milwaukee’s signature funky scent.\n\nNo, Eau de Milwaukee isn’t hops, brats or cheese curds. It’s Milorganite, a lawn and garden fertilizer made from our very own wastewater.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District started making Milorganite – named after Milwaukee organic nitrogen – at the city’s sewage treatment plant on Jones Island in 1926.\n\nThe city used a new method to treat wastewater, called the activated sludge method, which mixed microbes with sewage and air to remove 95% of the bacteria from the city’s sewage and 90% of the solids.\n\nAfter wastewater enters the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility, microbes are added that feast on the organic material. When the microbes die they settle to the bottom, leaving clean water above that is returned to Lake Michigan.\n\nWater is squeezed out of the microbes before they are dried and turned into pellets that become the nitrogen-rich fertilizer sold around the country.\n\nTurning this waste into fertilizer has kept 10 billion pounds of waste out of landfills since 1926, according to the sewerage district.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nA mark of Milwaukee’s annual celebration of Bastille Day, the 43-foot Eiffel Tower that appears each year in Cathedral Square Park is a testament to the city’s determination.\n\nThe tower has had to go through several rounds of repairs and reinforcement to keep up its yearly appearances. There have been a few years that an inflatable Eiffel Tower took the real one’s place, but it always returns, as it did in 2023 after a year of repairs.\n\nThe tower was initially built as part of an indoor department store display in the late 1980s, possibly in Minneapolis, according to a 2022 OnMilwaukee report.\n\nThe tower was never supposed to be permanent, and it definitely wasn’t meant to be assembled and disassembled each year for its appearance at the festival. But that won’t stop the tower, nor the organizers of the Bastille Day celebration, who are asking for donations to complete more repairs and restoration.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is far from the only French-themed activity of the weekend. There’s also the Storm the Bastille 5K run and walk, in addition to can-can dancers and plenty of French fare. The celebration is meant to honor the storming of the Bastille, the 19th-century French prison, an event that helped to start the French Revolution.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nGo into about any Milwaukee restaurant, tavern or even the corner bar on a Friday after work, and you’re likely to see diners enjoying fish alongside a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned.\n\nThe crisp crunch of walleye, perch, cod or maybe even bluegill, paired with some type of potato, coleslaw, tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and perhaps a slice of rye bread.\n\nFish fries are actually so popular in Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers declared Feb. 16, 2024, as Friday Fish Fry Day, honoring the history of the meal. According to his proclamation, the fish fry became popular when a large population of Catholic European immigrants settled in Wisconsin in the 1800s and needed something meat-free to eat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nThen, during Prohibition, the meal helped to keep Wisconsin’s breweries and taverns alive, too, further cementing the tradition.\n\nToday, fish fries in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin serve as a weekly opportunity to gather with friends and family at your favorite establishment, catch up and swap stories over a plate of deep-fried fish.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nA piece of Milwaukee’s baseball history, Bernie Brewer’s Chalet was once one of the crowning jewels at County Stadium. Bernie Brewer would slide out of the chalet and into a giant stein of beer after every home run or if the Brewers won the game, setting the stage for celebration.\n\nNow, the chalet is a part of another popular Milwaukee stop: Lakefront Brewery. It’s a stop on the brewery’s tour through the facility, and now it can even be booked for a romantic dinner for two, overlooking the kettles of the brewery.\n\nLakefront Brewery was born in 1987 out of something distinctly Wisconsin: some 55-gallon stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. Jim and Russ Klisch, the founders, sold one barrel of beer to a tavern within rolling distance of the brewery.\n\nLakefront has come a long way. Now housed at 1872 N. Commerce St., the brewery has produced as many as 46,848 barrels in one year (2017) and offers 20 different beers across 30 states, and even some other countries, according to the brewery’s website. The brewery also offers tours for over 80,000 people a year, and was the first to offer beer before, during and after the tour.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, this food item may repulse you – or at least make you do a double take.\n\nBut here in Milwaukee, it’s a delicacy.\n\nWe’re talking about the cannibal sandwich: a base of rye bread topped with fresh raw beef, chopped onion and a little salt and pepper. It’s deeply rooted in the state’s history and still enjoyed today.\n\nVersions of the sandwich also exist in Germany, where it’s called mett or hackepeter. The idea is thought to have been brought over by German immigrants to Wisconsin when they arrived and began to establish cattle farms, giving them easy access to fresh meat.\n\nToday, it’s still a popular tradition served during holidays and family gatherings — though not without a little scrutiny. Eating raw meat, after all, is a health risk. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reminded residents of as much in a 2020 tweet that went viral as those unfamiliar with the sandwich gawked.\n\nBut those who enjoy it are likely to keep paying homage to their heritage. Some Milwaukee delis and butcher shops sell thousands of pounds of high-grade raw beef around the holidays to eager customers.\n\nTasty or mildly terrifying, it’s one of the city’s cultural staples.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nIf you’re looking for a home away from home, look no further than Mr. Perkins Family Restaurant.\n\nWhile the fried chicken and collard greens are rave-worthy, the real showstopper at this 55-year-old establishment is the customer service.\n\nWhen the restaurant, located on the corner of West Atkinson Avenue and North 20th Street, opened in 1969, owners Willie Sr. and Hilda Perkins created a family feeling that brings in regulars and even politicians and celebrities like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.\n\nA staple for the Black community in Milwaukee, the restaurant serves comforting southern flavors that can be hard to find here in the Midwest.\n\nWhen Willie Perkins Jr. took over in 1999, he continued creating that feeling, filling customers in on the latest news about the Green Bay Packers and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWhen Willie died in 2010, his wife, Cherry, took over. Now, Cherry and a small team — her sister, her son and one other worker who might as well be family — continue the legacy, remembering regulars’ names and orders and creating community in addition to delicious food.\n\n-Zoe Takaki\n\nIt’s synonymous with Green Bay Packers fandom today, but the Cheesehead made its first appearance at a 1987 Milwaukee Brewers game — a completely, ahem, organic creation.\n\nThe legend is well-known now: Ralph Bruno went to his mother’s south-side Milwaukee home to help her reupholster a couch. When he took it apart, he thought the foam inside looked like cheese — so, naturally, he cut a piece into a triangle, burned some holes into it and spray-painted it yellow. It was a self-deprecating homage to an insult Wisconsin sports fans received from their neighbors in Illinois.\n\nTo Bruno’s friends’ surprise, the hats were a hit. So he made more, and sold them from a garbage bag at the next game he attended. That led to neighborhood retail sales and, eventually, the creation of Foamation Inc. — and a robust variety of Cheesehead variations including cowboy hats, baseball caps and koozies. The Packers acquired Foamation in 2023, solidifying the relationship just like a good curd.\n\nOver time, the Cheesehead has inspired song parodies and been featured in a Lil’ Wayne tribute to the Green & Gold (er, Yellow). It’s been worn or displayed by famous figures including George W. Bush, Jodie Foster, Phoebe Bridgers and John F. Kennedy Jr. And despite Chicago Bears fans’ efforts to shred them with their answer — the Graterhead — Cheeseheads are here to stay.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo parallel metal tracks stretch across the roads in downtown Milwaukee, soaking up the heat of the summer and the frost of the winter. You wait a bit, a streetcar the length of two buses slides slowly toward you.\n\nYou wonder if it’s automatic, running robotically and beeping like that, until you see a conductor in the front seat and you let out the breath you’d been holding — it will stop at traffic lights and behind cars. On the side of the car golden letters read in all caps: “THE HOP.”\n\nThe Hop is a fixed-transit network that gives a ride to more than 1,000 people a day, going to various destinations in downtown Milwaukee. Its route stretches from Veterans Park to Milwaukee Public Market and expanded to the lakefront in spring 2024.\n\nThe Hop is a relatively new addition to the city, having started running in 2018. But it’s a continuation of a long history of streetcars in the city — the first electric streetcar started giving rides in 1890 and for decades was the primary form of transportation.\n\nToday, The Hop has become a staple of downtown life, whether or not you ride it.\n\n-Eva Wen\n\nIf Milwaukee was going to have a mountain, it’s fitting that that mountain would be made of the thing that keeps the city moving during its cold, icy winters: road salt.\n\nAlong with the pungent aroma of Milorganite, the gigantic salt piles are likely what most Milwaukeeans associate with the city’s Jones Island, once home to a commercial fishing village of Polish immigrants.\n\nToday, the island holds tens of thousands of tons of road salt delivered to the Port of Milwaukee for use in melting icy streets, highways and interstates across Wisconsin.\n\nIn recent years, concern has grown about excess road salt washing off of streets and into nearby bodies of water, including Lake Michigan.\n\nRoughly 2.2 billion pounds of chloride (a component of road salt) flush into the lake each year, according to a December 2021 study. And while the size of the lake helps dilute the salty pollutant, smaller tributaries aren’t so lucky. In the Milwaukee River basin alone, for example, over 100 miles of waterway are impaired by chloride, some with levels several times that which can be toxic to fish and aquatic life.\n\nMany municipalities and private businesses, including some in the Milwaukee area, have made adjustments to reduce their salt use in the name of protecting freshwater, including brining, where salt is mixed with water before being applied to roads.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nA Milwaukee sub sandwich staple, Cousins Subs began in 1972 when cousins Bill Specht and Jim Sheppard opened their first shop at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive to “bring their favorite style of sub sandwich from the East Coast to their new hometown of Milwaukee,” the company’s official story reads.\n\nCousins offers classics like the Italian Special, Pepperoni Melt and Tuna, plus specialties like Wisconsin Cheese Steak. And in Milwaukee, Cousins stands apart from national sandwich chains — not only for its local roots but its very-us offerings like Wisconsin mac and cheese, shakes and fried cheese curds.\n\nThe Cousins sandwich — carrying the slogan “Better bread. Better subs” — is so popular the company had to cancel a free sub promotion in early 2024 when restaurants couldn’t keep up with the overwhelming response.\n\n-Erik S. Hanley\n\nWouldn’t you like to go to Orlando in mid-February? Not for Disney, but for the greenery, the smell, the sense that things are alive.\n\nThat’s what you’ll find in the Tropical Dome — where you can sit in the sun with a book in hand, no matter the season. Roll up your sleeves, find a bench and relax.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re always too hot, the Desert Dome stays 50 degrees through the winter. If you have kids with you, think Show Dome and occasional choo-choos.\n\nThe three beehive-shaped Domes, aka Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory, sometimes seem the forgotten child of Milwaukee attractions. They’re fighting for their future. Yet even the common name – Domes – has a Milwaukee humility about it.\n\nWith more than 1,800 plant species, cleverly described with signage, the Domes are worth a walk.\n\nSince Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the Domes in the fall of 1965, other accolades have followed. In 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave “National Treasure” status to the Domes.\n\nAnd the Domes have a characteristic that Milwaukeeans love: They’re cheap.\n\nThe priciest admission costs $9, and parking is free, unlike at the stadium, the zoo, or almost the entire downtown.\n\n-Pete Sullivan\n\nBratwurst. Polish. Italian. Hot Dog. Chorizo.\n\nBrewers fans have been cheering for one sausage or another during their race at the bottom of the sixth inning for more than 30 years. What started as a cartoon competition on a County Stadium scoreboard made its way to Miller Park (now American Family Field) as a treasured Milwaukee tradition.\n\nThe real-life Racing Sausages debuted June 27, 1993, and gave rise to live-action mascot races throughout Major League Baseball, such as racing presidents and pierogis. The idea to take the links from the scoreboard to the field came from Michael Dillon, who worked as a graphic designer with McDill Design at the time, and their first appearance was a surprise to almost everyone in the ballpark.\n\nThe matchup of 7-foot-tall encased meats was sponsored by Klement’s until 2018, when Johnsonville took the reins.\n\nThe sausages have had their ups and downs over time. Among the wurst: In 2003, then-Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon whacked the Italian Sausage with a bat, causing the Hot Dog to tumble as well. Both finished the race, thanks to an assist from the Polish (the Bratwurst won). There was also the time in 2013 that the Italian Sausage’s casing (er, costume) was stolen (and ultimately returned) in Cedarburg. A few years later, Hot Dog took a tumble and brought Chorizo and Bratwurst along with him. And as recently as the team’s 2024 season opener, Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton narrowly missed being taken out by Bratwurst.\n\nNo matter the wiener, Milwaukee will always love its Racing Sausages.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nLegend has it George Webb first predicted Milwaukee’s baseball team would win 12 games in a row back in the 1940s – and maybe even hinted that his namesake restaurant would give out free hamburgers to celebrate the winning streak.\n\nDecades passed before his prophecy came true, but in April 1987, the Milwaukee Brewers finally pulled off the feat – and some 168,194 people lined up outside George Webb Restaurants for free burgers. It’s hard to describe how big of a deal it was to those who didn’t experience it firsthand, but trust us, there are few things us frugal Wisconsinites love more than free stuff. Combine that with baseball and burgers, and it basically felt like a street festival.\n\nWhile most people ate their free burgers, some decided to save the historic freebies for posterity. One man even had his bronzed for his father. Others threw theirs in basement freezers, only to find them decades later. (This reporter would like to apologize to her older brother, Paul, for throwing out his 20-year-old frozen burger instead of bronzing it.)\n\nThe Brewers did it again in 2018, and for only the second time in Milwaukee history people lined up to celebrate and claim their free burgers.\n\nEven when it’s not promising free burgers, George Webb is a beloved burger joint open 24 hours a day. Still, any long Brewers winning streak definitely starts to feel like a free-burger watch party.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nBob Uecker didn’t sign a broadcasting contract with the Milwaukee Brewers until 2021.\n\nBefore then, it was handshake agreements with owners Bud Selig and Mark Attanasio.\n\nUeck tries not to take himself too seriously. It’s part of the reason why he is such a revered figure among Americans, specifically Milwaukee natives and Brewers fans.\n\n“Mr. Baseball” being the butt of the joke is why the “Uecker seats” named in his honor are considered the best worst seats in baseball. “I must be in the front row,” Uecker said to a stadium usher in a mid-’80s Miller Lite commercial who told him to move to where his ticket was located — way up high.\n\nUecker seats used to be sold for as little as $1, but there was a catch: Fans would need to wait hours before first pitch at the box office to get their hands on the tickets, and the seats were less than desired — up in the nosebleeds with an obstructed view, but near Uecker’s statue.\n\nUecker, 91, has been speaking into his microphone for the Brewers radio broadcast since 1971. He wouldn’t want to hear it, but his mic serves as a symbolic gold standard for not only sportscasters but also the entertainment figures we allow into our living rooms.\n\nHe’s been a regular guest on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1984 and had roles in Hollywood films — his delivery of “Juuust a bit outside” in the 1989 cult classic film “Major League” (filmed at County Stadium) endures today.\n\nUltimately, the reason he finally signed a contract with the Brewers was because he lost benefits from the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nWhen she was a teenager, UW-Milwaukee professor Chia Youyee Vang remembers how her mother and aunt wrapped a long, purple cloth into a turban around her head. Then decorated with a black-and-white striped ribbon, it was one piece of the elaborate traditional clothing Vang would wear to celebrate the Hmong New Year.\n\nToday, the phuam txoo suab is more hat than headwrap. It’s often sold pre-wrapped, and it might be embroidered with silver coins or shiny beads. At annual New Year celebrations at Wisconsin State Fair Park, it’s a common headpiece for girls and women.\n\nThe headwrap’s evolution parallels Milwaukee’s Hmong community in some ways. Today’s young generation fuses American culture with the traditions of their parents and grandparents, who fled Laos as refugees in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nOlder immigrants worry about language and culture fading. But they also see their descendants blossoming: earning degrees, running businesses and buying homes in neighborhoods across the area.\n\nMilwaukee County is home to about 13,000 Hmong, census data shows. That’s nearly one-third of all Asian residents in the county.\n\nLike the Germans, Poles and Italians before them, the Hmong have made their mark on Milwaukee. The ways they’ll express and share their traditions with the city will only become more intricate as their roots deepen.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nOpening a box of Italian cookies from Peter Sciortino Bakery has an undeniable sweetness – like a mix of happy family memories and buttery goodness.\n\nSince Peter Sciortino and his wife, Grace, opened the bakery in 1947, it has grown into a beloved fixture on Brady Street. It opened just one year after Glorioso’s Italian Market, another legendary business that still calls Brady Street home. Both first became institutions as Italians began moving north from the Third Ward to the east side neighborhood decades ago, and have since become a tradition for families throughout Milwaukee.\n\nThe aroma of fresh-baked bread and cookies typically surrounds Peter Sciortino Bakery, and inside, cannoli is made fresh with each order.\n\nLuckily the cookies are sold by the pound, so there’s no need to choose between cimino, biscotti, amaretti, chocolate mezza luna, or any of the other varieties – just make sure you get a big enough box to try as many as possible.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nWhere Russell Avenue meets Superior Street in Bay View, an understated brown sign pays homage to one of the most significant sites in Milwaukee’s history: a 19th-century iron mill where a march for an eight-hour work day turned deadly.\n\nThe historical marker recalls the events of May 5, 1886: the Bay View Massacre.\n\nThat year, labor organizations nationwide were demanding an eight-hour work day, and they wanted it by May 1. Many Milwaukeeans were working 10-hour days, six days a week for paltry wages, Milwaukee historian John Gurda noted in his book “The Making of Milwaukee.”\n\nAs companies balked at the demand, strikes grew. By May 3, about half of Milwaukee’s men were on strike, Gurda found. They marched through the city, urging more workers to join them. Panicked officials called in militia from across the state after police were unable to “quell the disturbance,” the Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\nOn May 4, tension mounted at the Bay View mill where executives refused the eight-hour demand. Militia forcefully dispersed a crowd of protesters.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, about 1,500 marchers returned to the mill. When they were about 200 yards out, the militia fired. Among the seven dead was a 12-year-old boy.\n\nThe next day, streets were deserted. Local officials conferred about how to prevent “socialistic agitation,” deciding to arrest as many demonstrators as they could, the Journal reported.\n\nLabor leaders, meanwhile, had public opinion on their side. They turned their focus to winning elections.\n\nThat year, the labor-backed People’s Party of Wisconsin won elections up and down the ballot, with priorities including progressive taxes, child labor restrictions, and arbitration of labor disputes, Gurda wrote. While socialist leaders initially supported that party, they later split and ran their own candidates, launching Milwaukee’s socialist era in 1910.\n\n-Rory Linnane\n\nYou just moved to Milwaukee. You are sitting in your bungalow in Bay View and staring at the blank walls. You are a full-fledged grown-up, so those leftover posters from your college dorm don’t cut it anymore.\n\nFor generations, the Milwaukee neighborhood posters have provided an easy and classy way to decorate your new space. They were unveiled in 1983 by the City of Milwaukee’s Discover Milwaukee program, with colorful, eye-catching artwork by Jan Kotowicz of local landmarks, like the lower east side’s Oriental Theatre and Washington Park’s bandshell. Wait, what is Pigsville? Thankfully, local historian John Gurda provided illuminating text on the back of the posters about each neighborhood. The posters even popped up in “Wayne’s World” to lend authenticity to Alice Cooper’s Milwaukee-centric cameo.\n\nBest of all, the posters follow the egalitarian spirit of the city. The original run of 21 neighborhoods initially cost just $2 apiece. Now there are 39 options available from Historic Milwaukee, Inc., including one with all the neighborhoods, for only $10. There’s no excuse for those blank walls.\n\n-Ben Steele\n\nAmerica’s Black Holocaust Museum is the first and only museum of its kind in the U.S. It’s an unflinching look at more than 400 years of slavery, dehumanization, lynching and mass incarceration of Black Americans.\n\nThe dream for the museum began as a small collection in Dr. James Cameron’s basement. In 1930, when he was 16, Cameron narrowly survived a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He spent the rest of his life in Milwaukee collecting photos, artifacts and books that shed light on the histories of African Americans. He regularly welcomed guests into his home to learn this history.\n\nThe museum moved to its first official location in the Sultan Muhammad Islamic Center. Its grand opening was Juneteenth Day in 1988.\n\nCameron passed away in 2006. The museum subsequently moved buildings and briefly closed, and now resides at 401 W. North Ave., part of a redevelopment project in the heart of Bronzeville called the Griot — a West African term for “storyteller” — in honor of Cameron.\n\nThe museum starts in Africa in 300 CE, long before Europeans arrived, and ends with issues impacting Black people today, like police brutality and mass incarceration — covering the 16 generations of slavery in the U.S., reconstruction, 100 years of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA tree with branches stretching along the ceiling pays homage to the powerful song “Strange Fruit,” made popular by artist Billie Holiday, that fearlessly protested the widespread lynchings of Black Americans.\n\n-Gina Castro\n\nPabst Brewing Co. shut down its Milwaukee operations in 1996. But the huge “Pabst” sign that’s stretched far above West Juneau Avenue for several decades has remained a constant — even as the former brewery was redeveloped over the past decade or so into offices, housing, a craft brewery and other new uses.\n\nThe sign is attached to an iron footbridge that is anchored by Pabst’s former malt house, now The Malt House apartments, and the old brew house, now the Brewhouse Inn & Suites. The glowing red sign has undergone repairs in recent years, with the iron bridge’s restoration being completed this spring, according to Erin Stenum, manager of the neighborhood improvement district at the former Pabst complex, now known as The Brewery. Ein Prosit!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nThe soundtrack to most city parks includes the ping of a bouncing basketball, the tinny reverb of a faraway stereo or the sizzle of a grill fired up for sausages.\n\nYou’ll hear those at Burnham Park, too, but there’s another layer to the score: the soothing hum of a handful of taco trucks parked just outside, and the chatter from hungry hoards waiting in the wings for a carne asada taco, a lengua huarache or a cooling horchata on a hot summer night.\n\nThese food trucks are part of the fabric of Burnham Park. Beyond the neighborhood, the south side is dotted with family-owned fleets carrying specialties all their own, parked on Historic Mitchell Street, West Lincoln Avenue, West Becher Street and across the neighborhoods tucked in between.\n\nYou could stop at one to satisfy a craving or you could go on a full expedition, grabbing an al pastor taco shaved straight off the spit at La Guelaguetza (go on Wednesdays to nab ’em for a dollar each), head to Marta’s Tamales Food Truck for a juicy pambazo dipped in red pepper sauce, and finish at Isa’s Ice Cream for a creamy scoop of mango or passionfruit nieve de garrafa to round out the night.\n\nThey’re the tastes of the neighborhood and the passion from a piece of Milwaukee with undeniable flavor all its own.\n\n-Rachel Bernhard\n\nThey only surface for one week.\n\nBut for that one week, they’re everywhere.\n\nThey are the ribbons worn by Northwestern Mutual agents during the company’s annual gathering in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nEach summer, the Milwaukee insurance and financial services company brings more than 12,000 employees and agents together for a week of meetings and events; ground zero is usually the Baird Center and Fiserv Forum, but they can be seen all over downtown.\n\nAnd every agent wears a nametag lanyard with attached ribbons denoting sales goals achieved, landmarks passed, accomplishments reached.\n\nSome agents have two or three ribbons. A few sport a ribbon that goes down to the floor.\n\nTo outsiders, the ribbons might look like scout badges or sashes from a secret society — swag from a party they weren’t invited to.\n\nTo the agents, the ribbons are an expression of how far they’ve come in the business — and where they rank among their colleagues. After the week’s meetings are over, they’re put away.\n\nIn a way, they’re like cicadas: They swarm the city for a brief period, and then they’re gone.\n\nBut we know they’ll be back.\n\n-Chris Foran\n\nJust over a year after moving to Milwaukee, I arrived at Wolski’s Tavern with a singular goal: Get that damn sticker. You know the one. The ubiquitous capital-letter “I CLOSED WOLSKI’S” sticker plastered on dive bar bathroom walls and 20-somethings’ water bottles.\n\nEven if you don’t know what Wolski’s is, exactly, it’s still likely you know about the stickers. The fantastic marketing strategy has worked wonders for the more-than-a-century-old bar.\n\nWhen we arrive that night, we sit outside despite the evening’s light rain. I find myself tiring long before 1 a.m. But the lure of the sticker provides energy as the night goes on.\n\nAs 2 a.m. passes, a man urinates off a tree-shielded wall and an employee yells it’s time to go. A sloppy early-20s crowd, a few stray middle-age folks and I begin to filter inside. The crowd lingers, holding glass beer mugs and Miller High Lifes.\n\nTen minutes later, another call to leave rings out. This time, people form a line to a door guarded by a young doorman holding a stack of stickers. One in front of me doesn’t take it, but later reverses her decision. The doorman teases she can’t have one, and receives a kiss on the cheek when he concedes.\n\nI give him a nod and thank-you, taking my prize.\n\nI closed Wolski’s — now I just need to find where to put the sticker. Any ideas?\n\n-David Clarey\n\nIn Milwaukee, seemingly every component of the gooey globules known as cheese curds — pieces of young cheese that during the cheesemaking process become separated from the whey — is as malleable as the cheddar itself.\n\nA simple scan of the city’s pubs, bars and even fine-dining restaurants is evidence of an oft-repeated Wisconsin stereotype: It’s the cheese curd capital of the world. And per usual, Milwaukee isn’t going to skimp on the party.\n\nRestaurants generally buy fresh curds of white or yellow cheddar — in rarer cases, mozzarella or pepper jack — before adding their own personality via batters, sauces and names. Milwaukeeans take pride in experimenting with curd coatings: they might be buttermilk-battered, pancake-battered, beer-battered, honey lager-battered, Lakefront Riverwest Stein-battered, or slathered in an ambiguous “house-made batter.”\n\nThose curds are then “fried up squeaky clean” (at the Wicked Hop), turned into “mini explosives” disguised as curds (at Safehouse Milwaukee), or transfigured into “little pillows of cheesy heaven” (at Joe Mama’s Bar). Many restaurants serve up half-pound portions; some, like Steny’s, offer a full pound of cheese.\n\nNotably, the Journal Sentinel didn’t come across any menus advertising curds served with ketchup. But various varieties of tomato, like marinara sauce and tomato jam, made appearances. Many menus experiment with ranch varieties like buttermilk, garlic, chipotle or jalapeño, or specialty sauces like buffalo blue cheese aioli, maple syrup, Bloody Mary buffalo, or sweet and spicy pineapple.\n\nAs Brothers Bar and Grill puts it, the final step is up to you: transporting the morsels “from the cheese curd capital of the world to your mouth!”\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nRyan Putskey isn’t fazed by calls to the Oriental Theatre asking if “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is “appropriate.” Or, calls telling him it’s not.\n\n“To be fair, it can be kind of graphic. But, I mentioned this to the cast — it’s been like this for probaby 40 years,” said Putskey, the theater’s longtime caretaker.\n\nA quick Google search confirms the historic East Side theater gets national kudos for its longstanding commitment to Rocky Horror. In some tellings, the Oriental takes the crown for the longest single run of the movie since its release in 1975.\n\nPutskey humbly said that’s a point of contention: the Oriental’s tradition dates back to January 1978 — before its rival for Rocky Horror longevity, the Clinton Street Theater in Oregon — but has logged fewer individual shows.\n\nRegardless, Rocky Horror devotees consistently show up for the movie and live stage performance at midnight on the second Saturday of each month to call out virgins in the audience and throw toast at the stage. They never tire of watching the transformation of an under-sexualized engaged couple, Brad and Janet, as they wander into a castle and are soon seduced by a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual and his Frankenstein-esque creation, Rocky.\n\nThose details aren’t unique to Milwaukee. But the Oriental’s minaret towers and lioness statutes add an otherworldly, in-person touch to the celebration of madness, weirdness and sexuality that demands to be taken seriously.\n\n“You’ll consistently be there with — and I say this will all due respect to all of them — a bunch of weirdos,” Putskey said.\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nNobody has to be from Cleveland to know that the city has been the subject of more than a few one-liners over the years.\n\n“Attention Cleveland, your river is on fire!”\n\nOr ...\n\n“In Cleveland, Velveeta cheese can be found in the gourmet section of the supermarket.”\n\nBut here’s a burning question, why did Cleveland become the butt of a zinger of a gag in Milwaukee’s Bay View, of all places?\n\nIn 1978, while having lunch with his assistant, now retired photographer and artist Mark Gubin decided to have some fun with air travelers flying into Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.\n\nRealizing that low-level planes coasted over his studio and home (the former Bay Theater) in the path of a runway, he painted “Welcome to Cleveland”on his roof.\n\nWas there any specific reason behind the Cleveland tomfoolery, these 6-foot high letters that have given more than a few air travelers an uneasy, eerie (or Erie) feeling?\n\nNope, it was just Gubin’s wicked sense of humor, the right time to welcome visitors to the wrong place.\n\n“I never did it as any kind of thing to help my business or anything like that. It was just plain madness. You need that in the world,” Gubin told former Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl in 2015.\n\nThe internet, cyberspace and social media have helped Gubin’s prank reach a sort of rock star quality.\n\nNow 46 years later, the gag certainly hasn’t gotten old … it’s still flying.\n\n-Emmett Prosser\n\nIn the 1980s, many members of the Forest County Potawatomi tribe lived in poverty.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, members of the tribe receive tens of thousands of dollars in dividends.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Potawatomi Casino in the Menomonee River Valley happened.\n\nWhen it first opened around 1990 at 1720 W. Canal St., the facility was a large bingo hall with a few hundred slot machines of questionable legality and little outside regulation.\n\nThe tribe’s reservation is in northern Wisconsin, making the Milwaukee casino the nation’s first off-reservation tribal casino. The land where the casino is located is believed to have once been a Potawatomi village, according to a Milwaukee Public Museum history of the tribe.\n\nIn its initial years, the tribe shared its gaming revenue with the Indian Community School and a non-Indian management company. Those deals have since expired.\n\nToday, the casino is a major Milwaukee tourist attraction and an unmissable part of the city’s skyline. It rakes in more than $400 million in gambling winnings a year. A chunk of those winnings goes to members of the tribe in the form of per-capita payments estimated to be more than $70,000 per member.\n\nThe gambling hall draws nearly 6 million visitors a year and the 784,000-square-foot casino offers a range of ways to win or lose money, including about 3,000 slot machines, sports book, craps and a variety of table games including poker and blackjack.\n\nAnd since 1999, The Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has donated about $75 million to Milwaukee-area nonprofits, according to a spokesperson for the tribe.\n\n-Cary Spivak\n\nDo you know where you were in 1880?\n\nThat’s a trick question — you were surely not born, but if you were, you could’ve been among the first to munch on some of the finest sausage to come out of Milwaukee at that time.\n\nLuckily, you still can enjoy it. That’s because Usinger’s Famous Sausage has stood the test of time since founder Fred Usinger moved to Milwaukee from Germany and started his own successful sausage shop in 1880.\n\nIn the nearly century and a half since, the company has grown to have a wide shipping network while retaining its beloved place in Milwaukee, with its vintage-style building, tasty and bountiful meats and a rather helpful staff. Don’t forget about the storied elves — prominent in local advertisements and in the deli’s window displays, the company touts them as the invisible makers of its beloved sausage.\n\nUsinger’s sausage earned a spot in the Milwaukee Public Museum’s Streets of Milwaukee exhibit and in an episode of “Top Chef.” There’s even an annual Fred Usinger Day on Feb. 23.\n\nPerhaps a 1980 ad in the Milwaukee Journal put it best: “In 1880, Milwaukee got its first electric street lights, its first native mayor, and its first taste of Usinger’s sausage. It was a very good year.”\n\nIt was a very good year, indeed. And, thankfully, those tastes have continued for 144 years.\n\n-David Clarey\n\nWisconsin’s oldest continually operating gay bar wasn’t always easy to spot. When June Brehm opened This Is It! at 418 E. Wells St. in 1968, Milwaukee’s LGBTQ+ scene operated under the radar, and closeted patrons made use of the bar’s rear entrance to avoid being identified.\n\nToday, This Is It! welcomes patrons with a concrete facade adorned with a diamond pattern in the colors of the rainbow.\n\nDrag superstar and Wisconsin native Trixie Mattel became a co-owner with George Schneider in 2021.\n\nNot only is This Is It! a Milwaukee institution — it’s one of the country’s oldest LGBTQ+ bars. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin recognized Brehm and her son Joseph for their contributions to Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ community, and the bar became the site of the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display in 2019.\n\n“This Is It! is not Milwaukee’s favorite gay bar, it is Milwaukee’s favorite bar,” Mattel said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Everyone in town has a personal story or anecdote, or sometimes even a night they can barely remember. The exterior has rainbow accents that invite all walks of life into the space, and remind people to come in and act right. It reminds people that even if you’re homophobic, not in this (expletive) building you’re not.”\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nA symbol of Milwaukee’s proud brewing history, bottles of Miller Lite can be seen in the hands of drinkers at dive bars and tailgates across Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s probably the most ubiquitous of the Miller beers — Miller Chill, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life and Miller 64 Extra Light — in a town where the Miller name still looms large (literally — the large red Miller sign can be seen by anyone driving into downtown from the west on Interstate 94).\n\nIn 1973, Miller Brewing bought a low-calorie “Lite” brand of beer from Chicago-based Meister Brau Inc. and turned it into what’s now known as Miller Lite. From there, the company advertised the beer with the help of sports stars like Mickey Mantle, John Madden and Bob Uecker with the popular line “Tastes great … less filling.”\n\nToday, Miller Lite and other Miller beers are under the MolsonCoors’ list of brands.\n\nIn 1996, Miller acquired the naming rights to the Milwaukee Brewers’ yet-to-be-built stadium, which opened in 2001. It was called Miller Park until the naming rights agreement expired in 2020 and American Family Insurance took over, renaming the stadium American Family Field.\n\nBut naturally, Miller Lite can still be found for sale at the stadium during Brewers’ games.\n\n-Alec Johnson\n\nCathedral Square is home to many summer festivals.\n\nThere’s Jazz in the Park, Bastille Days and the dazzling Christmas tree display that wash Cathedral Square in lights at night.\n\nBut on the corner of Kilbourn and Jackson stands a metal plaque that marks a little-known event that occurred more than a century and a half ago. Passersby rarely stop to note the significance of that historical marker, erected in 2001 by the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nIt tells the story of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave from Missouri. Glover found refuge and freedom in Wisconsin until he was captured and jailed under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. His imprisonment stirred nearly 5,000 anti-slavery demonstrators who stormed the Milwaukee County Jail — which stood on present-day Cathedral Square — to break Glover out on March 10, 1854.\n\nBut Glover was still a wanted man.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act called for the recapture of freedom seekers or escaped slaves like Glover to be returned to their owners. Glover was on the run for years fearing recapture by his slave owner, a man named Benammi Stone Garland.\n\nWith the help of Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses manned by abolitionists who offered safety and shelter to runaway slaves, Glover eventually made his way to Canada and to freedom.\n\nGlover’s story is also depicted on a mural on the I-43 overpass on Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\n-LaRisa R. Lynch\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Milwaukee at least twice. Now, Milwaukee honors King’s legacy with a statue in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nKing’s first recorded speech in Milwaukee was in August 1957 at the Grand Avenue Congressional Church, now the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center on West Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nHe returned during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement in January 1964, where he spoke to over 6,000 at the Milwaukee Auditorium (now the Miller High Life Theatre).\n\nIn the biggest showing of support for King, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people marched on Milwaukee just a few days removed from his assassination. The march was considered the largest civil rights demonstration in the city’s history.\n\nKing’s Milwaukee sculpture is located at North King Drive and West Vine Street. The sculptor, Erik Blome, once said he hoped to capture King animated as if he was giving a speech.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nMarquette won the NCAA basketball trophy on March 28, 1977, with a 67-59 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels, which sent students streaming down Wisconsin Avenue in an impromptu party-parade to the lake.\n\nUnder the brash, colorful (and quotable) Coach Al McGuire, the team – which famously took its team photo in tuxedos while sitting in a classic car – had captured the attention of the city, and the nation.\n\nThe teams were unseeded — it was the last year before teams came into the tournament with a ranking. And the term “March Madness” — describing the unpredictability of upsets and bracket busters — was not widely used until the ’80s.\n\nIt was legendary coach Al McGuire’s last game leading Marquette. He came into the game with a 25-7 record, after sneaking into the tournament, to the Tar Heels’ 28-5 record.\n\nOne of McGuire’s key strategies was to not give North Carolina any lead. If they led, the Tar Heels were sure to do the dreaded Four Corners Offense, a “stall offense” where the players would pass the ball to kill time.\n\nThe teams could take 10 minutes for one possession — there was no 30-second shot clock to keep the game moving. There was no 3-point line.\n\nDespite the fact basketball was played so much differently then, it is still remembered each year when Marquette plays in the NCAA tourney — as the only time Marquette men’s basketball won it all.\n\nIf anyone needs any reminding, the original trophy is in the Walk of Champions display at Marquette’s Al McGuire Center.\n\n-Cathy Kozlowicz\n\nCue the “Happy Days” theme song. The Bronze Fonz, a life-size statue that pays tribute to Arthur Fonzarelli, is a pillar of the city’s downtown RiverWalk.\n\nThe set-in-Milwaukee sitcom ran in the ’70s and ‘80s, but Fonzie — played by Henry Winkler — remains a beloved Brew City icon.\n\nVisit Milwaukee had spearheaded an effort that raised $75,000 for the statue, and artist Gerald Sawyer brought it to life. The statue arrived in 2008 with a lot of fanfare, including a parade, the king of cool himself, other castmates and the stars of “Happy Days” spinoff “Laverne & Shirley.”\n\n“It is a great honor,” Winkler said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview. “You cannot be blase about that, no matter how much time goes by.”\n\nWhen the statue disappeared to undergo routine maintenance a couple years back, it caused quite the stir. About 40 people attended a ceremony marking its return.\n\nWant to see the Bronze Fonz for yourself? It’s located on the east side of the RiverWalk just south of Wells Street. And while you’re there, you might want to snap a pic. The statue is one of the city’s most selfied landmarks.\n\n-Hannah Kirby\n\nTomatoes are just one of the many vegetables you’ll find planted at Alice’s Garden, one of the city’s best-known community gardens, on the city’s north side at North 21st Street and West Garfield Avenue.\n\nBorn out of an abandoned highway project, the 2-acre garden is located along a larger, 3-mile corridor where entire blocks of houses were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Park West Freeway. The project cut through the city’s west and north sides, displacing several thousand residents and disrupting the community’s economy. Ultimately, the highway was never built, largely because of sustained neighborhood opposition. In its wake, large swaths of empty land were left.\n\nOut of that empty land sprang Alice’s Garden, now a thriving community garden and gathering place. The garden is there to reconnect city residents to the land and to oft-lost traditions of growing fresh, healthy food.\n\nGardeners come from all ethnicities and cultures, and their plots often speak to their heritage. In a Native American’s garden might be corn, beans and squash, known as “the three sisters” for how they are planted close together, for mutual benefit. A Black gardener might grow black-eyed peas, collard greens and okra in homage to past ancestors.\n\nNot only is the garden a place to cultivate food, but also relationships. Walking paths lined with herbs invite visitors for a stroll. Kids race across the grass or sit on picnic blankets for monthly storytimes. The pavilion shelters people sharing fellowship and a meal.\n\n-Sarah Volpenhein\n\nOne sign that summer is here in Milwaukee is the volleyball nets going up at Bradford Beach. Once the weather gets nice, it’s common to see people of all skill levels bumping, setting and spiking at the city’s largest beach during the afternoons and evenings pretty much any day of the week.\n\nFrom late May until September, the beach is home to more than 30 volleyball nets. The nets are currently managed by Volley Life, a local company that organizes beach volleyball clinics, tournaments and leagues.\n\nIn 2016, the beach hosted the USA Volleyball Junior Beach National Championships, and, at the end of this summer, it will host the Badger Region Beach Championships.\n\nBut, you don’t need to be a former high school volleyball star to join in on the summer fun.\n\nVolley Life has multiple leagues nearly every day of the week encompassing skill levels from those just learning the game to experienced players competing for prize money. When leagues are not playing, nets are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nThe nickname “Cream City” might make some think of milk.\n\nBut Milwaukee’s popular moniker does not stem from the dairy or beer typically associated with Wisconsin. It has to do with brick.\n\nLook around and you’ll see them. The light-colored, yellowish bricks are the main material in a number of old buildings across the city: the former Schlitz brewery, Holy Trinity Church (now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church), the Woman’s Club of Wisconsin and other industrial buildings and row houses.\n\nThe so-called cream city bricks were first used in the Milwaukee area in the 1830s. The material came from a clay found in the Menomonee River Valley filled with magnesium and lime. When put to fire, the clay produced a yellowy, cream-colored brick.\n\nThe bricks were widely exported and made it to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York. But they remain a distinctly Milwaukee look and give the state’s largest city its name: Cream City.\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nA hidden gem in Milwaukee’s premier lakefront property, Lake Park, is a 2,000-year-old ancient Indigenous burial mound.\n\nIt is a large conical mound about 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet high overlooking Lake Michigan near Lake Drive and Locust Street.\n\nThe mound was built by Indigenous people during what archaeologists call the Middle Woodland Culture between 300 B.C. and 400 A.D.\n\nMilwaukee was once home to hundreds, or even thousands, of these ancient mounds, but they were destroyed by development. The Lake Park mound is the last one left in the city.\n\n-Frank Vaisvilas\n\nFew signs bring as much joy as the one that reads “MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MARKET.”\n\nThe large red neon sign hovers above the market’s west entrance, beckoning to passersby and serving as a de facto billboard for downtown and the Third Ward. It glows at night, and casts a shimmering reflection even on the rainiest of days. Get off that concrete freeway, it tells visitors. (Who among us hasn’t driven past the sign and wondered why they’re still on I-794 instead of walking through the public market, stopping by the lakefront, or visiting one of the city’s many festivals?)\n\nThe sign alone has basically become a local landmark. And the market itself, which opened in 2005, is a sleek space full of natural light and packed with local vendors selling an impressive range of goods – including cheese, spices, wine, fresh fish on ice, flowers, chocolate and Milwaukee merch.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Market sits at the corner of what was once known as Commission Row, a stretch of Broadway that was once packed with Italian fruit and v", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/22/lion-man-garden-state-bud-amelia-earhart-news-around-states/50125535/", "title": "Lion Man, Garden State bud: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nCORRECTION: This article originally misstated details about a museum in the works in Atchison, Kansas, the birthplace of famed aviator Amelia Earhart.

Named after Earhart's younger sister, Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey, Muriel is identical to the plane Earhart flew on her final flight around the world.\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: An organization that has staged dozens of protests against a Confederate monument in north Alabama filed suit contending the city is trying to limit the demonstrations in violation of free-speech guarantees. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Project Say Something and its founder, Camille Bennett, claims the city and Police Chief Ron Tyler are trying to clamp down on the protests by telling the group when, where and how it can demonstrate against the monument, located at the Lauderdale County Courthouse. Bennett said the organization, a nonprofit she founded about eight years ago, has tried to work with the city, the TimesDaily reports. “Alabama has a long history of confronting racial injustice through peaceful demonstration, and it is imperative that we not lose that ability to speak truth to power when the situation demands it,” Bennett said in a statement. The city has not responded to the federal lawsuit in court, and city officials declined comment. Project Say Something held as many as 175 demonstrations at the monument in 2020 but cut back the following year because the city used its noise and parade permit ordinances to discourage them, the lawsuit said. The chief relocated the demonstrations to a “protest zone” away from the courthouse to shrink the potential audience, it claimed, and he threatened to issue citations.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is in the midst of her first visit to the state in the role, including a visit to a community at the center of a long-running dispute over a proposed land exchange aimed at building a road through a national wildlife refuge. Residents of King Cove have seen a road as a life and safety issue. Haaland was in King Cove on Wednesday with Gov. Mike Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Dunleavy’s office said. King Cove residents have long sought a land connection through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to Cold Bay, which is about 18 miles away and has an all-weather airport. The refuge is near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula and contains internationally recognized habitat for migrating waterfowl. “The federal government needs to consider human safety and quality of life factors for residents in King Cove. The locals deserve to be heard by the federal government,” Dunleavy said in a statement. A U.S. Justice Department attorney last summer said Haaland had not decided what position she would take on a proposed land exchange, saying Haaland planned to review the record and visit King Cove before making a decision. A planned trip to Alaska last year didn’t materialize.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s Republican House speaker on Thursday was named one of five recipients of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage award for his refusal to consider overturning the 2020 election results despite massive pressure from ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters. Speaker Rusty Bowers rebuffed repeated direct efforts by Trump, his attorney Rudy Giuliani and others to overturn results that saw President Joe Biden narrowly defeat Trump in Arizona. Trump and Giuliani urged Bowers in a phone call to retroactively change Arizona law to allow the Legislature to chose a different slate of presidential electors than those picked by the voters. “I am very grateful for this honor yet cannot help but feel undeserving of it,” Bowers said in a statement. “Honoring my oath and the people’s choices at the ballot box are not heroic acts – they are the least that Arizonans should expect from the people elected to serve them.” The award created by Kennedy’s family in 1989 is designed “to recognize and celebrate the quality of political courage that he admired most” and is given each year to one or more political figures. This year’s award honors those who showed “courage to protect and defend democracy in the United States and abroad.” The awards will be presented at a May 22 ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: A local agency says it’s seeing an uptick in calls for help after the end of a statewide rent relief program. The Arkansas Department of Human Services closed its program April 1, leaving many renters struggling to find additional avenues to keep their families housed. The Arkansas Rent Relief Program provided up to 15 months of relief for unpaid rent and utilities due on or after April 1, 2020. As of the beginning of this month, about 30,000 applications had been paid at the close of the program, totaling $92.5 million in funding distributed. Some households are still waiting for assistance as their applications are being processed. As of April 7, about 3,700 applications were still being processed across the state. In the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey taken from Jan. 26 to Feb. 7, 41.4% of Arkansas households surveyed said they were not current on rent or mortgage, making eviction or foreclosure either very likely or somewhat likely in the next two months. Dana Crawford, family services manager at the Crawford-Sebastian Community Development Council, said she has seen an uptick in calls looking for help following the closure of the state’s rental assistance program. “We did have the Arkansas Fresh Start, but we have since depleted those funds,” Crawford said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Parents of middle and high school students in the state would be warned about the dangers of firearms every year under a measure that advanced Wednesday. But they would no longer be required to tell school officials if they keep guns in the house, under the revised legislation. The state Senate Education Committee three weeks ago rejected the firearms reporting requirement as an invasion of privacy. So Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino reworked his bill, eliminating the parental reporting. The narrower version cleared the same committee Wednesday on a 5-1 vote. His revised bill requires schools to include information on the safe storage of firearms in the annual notifications they send home to parents of students in middle and high schools, starting in the 2023-24 school year. Legislation with a similar requirement has already passed the California Assembly. More than two-thirds of school shootings involve weapons taken from the students’ home, friends or relatives, Portantino said. “This is an attempt to try to empower school districts to do everything they can to make the school environment safe,” he said. “This errs on the side of caution.” If there are threats or perceived threats of school shootings, the proposal requires investigators to check the state’s firearm database to see if the suspect’s family has registered firearms.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: The police chief who led the force in the Denver suburb when a gunman killed 12 people in a movie theater a decade ago is returning to temporarily lead the embattled department following the firing of its last chief. Daniel J. Oates, who served as police chief in Aurora from 2005 to 2014 before retiring as police chief in Miami Beach, Florida, will serve as interim chief and help in the selection of the next police chief, the city announced Wednesday. City manager Jim Twombly said he hired Oates “because he has established trust within our community and many of our officers.” Earlier this month Twombly fired Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who was hired in 2020 as the city faced scrutiny over the death of Elijah McClain – a case that received widespread attention in the wake of protests of racial injustice and police brutality. McClain died after being stopped by police, put in a chokehold and injected with the powerful sedative ketamine in 2019. Three police officers and two paramedics were indicted in McClain’s death last year. Wilson acted quickly to fire officers for misconduct, including officers who took and shared photos appearing to mock McClain’s death. Twombly praised Wilson’s community outreach but said he fired her because of concerns about her leadership and management of the department, without getting into specifics. Wilson disputed Twombly’s assessment and alleged she was forced out for political reasons.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: Emergency responders rescued 50 dogs and cats from a fire at a pet boarding facility after three people had escaped the flames by jumping from a second-floor window, authorities said Thursday. The fire was reported shortly before midnight Wednesday in a two-story building on Post Road East, Assistant Chief Jeff Gootman of the Westport Fire Department said in a news release. Firefighters responded and found heavy fire on the second floor of the building, which housed a pet boarding facility on the first floor and basement and an apartment on the second floor, Gootman said. After firefighters extinguished the flames, they searched the building and determined that the three people on the second floor had jumped to safety from a window, Gootman said. None required hospitalization. Westport firefighters and police officers removed approximately 50 dogs and cats from the boarding facility, Gootman said. The cause of the fire was under investigation Thursday.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After decades of criticism over use of force and a strained relationship with the community, the Wilmington Police Department’s policies and procedures are coming under legal scrutiny. A federal lawsuit filed against Wilmington officers involved in the 2020 shooting of a man found sleeping in an SUV lists years of departmental procedures claiming city police are unable to handle many situations, including making contact with unarmed individuals. The civil lawsuit touches on documented accounts of how Wilmington officers have not been taught to give proper verbal warning prior to using deadly force or to take cover when officers believe someone is armed. The lawsuit also claims department supervisors, among others, fail to check that officers use their standard-issue equipment and fail to prohibit officers from making false statements. These failures create unwritten policies, allowing Wilmington officers to engage in acts of excessive force without accountability, which in turn result in injury to civilians, according to the lawsuit filed on behalf of Jabri K. Hunter, who was shot by a Wilmington officer April 12, 2020. “These inadequate training policies existed prior to the date of this incident and continue to this day,” said the lawsuit targeting the officers involved in the shooting, Chief Robert Tracy and the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser and other community leaders announced Thursday that the city’s annual census of individuals experiencing homelessness showed a decline for the sixth straight year, WUSA-TV reports. Over the past year, the overall number of people experiencing homelessness has dropped 13.7%. Since 2016, when the Bowser administration began its Homeward DC plan, homelessness has declined by 47% total, data show. For the 2016 Point in Time count, 8,350 people were experiencing homelessness. In 2022, that number was 4,410. That’s the lowest recorded number going back to at least 2005, the mayor’s office said. The 2022 results also show declines in family homelessness (down 14%), homelessness among single adults (down 12%), and chronic homelessness for families (down 26%) and single adults (down 22%). “These results are a culmination of years of working together – across government, with our community partners and providers, and with residents in all eight wards – to implement Homeward DC and build systems and resources that meet the needs of D.C. residents,” Bowser said in a statement. “While we are proud of these results, we know there’s more work to do.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Black lawmakers staged a sit-in on the Florida House floor Thursday to protest a congressional map pushed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that they say will diminish the state’s Black representation in the U.S. House. The DeSantis map would increase Florida’s GOP presence and dismantle two districts now represented by Black members of Congress. As debate on the maps was nearing an end, Reps. Angie Nixon and Tray McCurdy opened up their suit jackets to display “Stop the Black Attack” T-shirts and shouted the same phrase. They sat on the state seal in front of the House speaker’s rostrum and were soon joined by other other Black Democrats and other supporters. The Republican-led chamber called a recess, all GOP lawmakers left the floor, and the state Florida Channel stopped broadcasting the proceedings. “This is good trouble! Necessary trouble!” Nixon shouted, echoing a phrase used by the late civil rights activist and congressman John Lewis. The group sang “We Shall Overcome” and prayed. Some members went on Facebook to stream live feeds of the protest. Nixon said in a text message to the Associated Press that the lawmakers would not leave the floor unless they were physically removed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Democrat Stacey Abrams’ gubernatorial campaign asked a federal judge Wednesday to shut down unlimited contributions to a committee controlled by Republican incumbent Brian Kemp. The filing is yet more litigation over the constitutionality of a 2021 Georgia law that allows certain top elected officials and party nominees to create “leadership committees” that can raise campaign funds without limits and coordinate spending with campaigns. The judge earlier denied a request by Abrams to start taking unlimited amounts before she clinches the Democratic nomination May 24. Kemp narrowly beat Abrams in the 2018 general election, and they would match up again if Kemp survives a Republican primary challenge from former U.S. Sen. David Perdue and others. The law allows the governor and lieutenant governor, opposing major party nominees, and both party caucuses in the state House and Senate to form leadership committees. Donors can give as much as they want, while they can’t directly give candidates for statewide office more than $7,600 for a primary or general election and $4,500 for a runoff election. Opponents say the law unconstitutionally favors incumbents over challengers because they can raise limitless sums for years ahead of an election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Public school students must continue wearing masks in classrooms despite state officials lifting the same rules for airports and public transportation following Monday’s federal judge decision to remove mask requirements on U.S. flights. Masks are no longer required in Hawaii airports, on city buses or in handicapped vans, but all public students will be required to wear masks through the end of the school year, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “I understand that there are different perspectives regarding the Hawaii State Department of Education’s indoor masking in schools,” interim Superintendent Keith Hayashi said in a letter to parents. “We will continue to implement universal indoor masking in schools.” Federal transportation officials announced Monday that they would no longer enforce mask rules after a U.S. judge’s decision to strike down the mandate on domestic flights. The four largest U.S. airlines almost immediately dropped their mask requirements, and Hawaiian Airlines announced late Monday that it would follow suit. “We ask for our guests’ patience and understanding as we update all our communications and announcements,” the airline said. “We advise travelers to stay informed and follow mask requirements that may remain in effect at their origin or arrival airports.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two men have been sentenced to jail time and banned from hunting for years after pleading guilty to poaching a grizzly bear near Yellowstone National Park. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game said in a press release that Rex Baum, 79, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with the female grizzly’s death last year. He was ordered to serve 3 days in jail and was banned from hunting for a decade. Baum’s son, Jared Baum, of Ashton, was sentenced to 30 days in jail and banned from hunting for life after pleading guilty to a felony in connection with the incident. Fish and Game officers discovered the grizzly’s carcass April 9, 2021, after the bear’s radio tracking collar signaled it had died, the Idaho Statesman reports. X-rays of the bear showed she had been shot more than a dozen times. Conservation officers visited the bear’s den, discovering a dead male cub. The agency contacted the two men after sending a warrant to Google for records of electronic devices that had been in the area around the time of the grizzly’s death. Idaho grizzlies are federally protected. Last month, Gov. Brad Little joined Montana and Wyoming governors in petitioning for the bears to be removed from Endangered Species Act protections.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The city will have a starring role in the state’s latest marketing campaign, with the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Cozy Dog Drive-In, and other sites featured in the new promotion. Gov. J.B. Pritzker officially announced the new campaign, “Middle of Everything,” at a ceremony Monday at Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium. While the Windy City is spotlighted heavily, Springfield gets plenty of love as well, with sites related to the 16th president, such as Lincoln’s Home and Lincoln’s Tomb, promoted in addition to the museum and a statue of Lincoln sitting on a park bench outside the museum. Pritzker said the $30 million campaign would help to recover tourism dollars lost during the COVID-19 pandemic and put the state in a position to grow in the years to come. A series of TV ads will run with the campaign, directed by Illinois native Jane Lynch, famous for roles such as in the TV series “Glee” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” The Dolton-raised actor, a graduate of Illinois State University, narrates a quartet of 30-second ads that showcase a Lincoln impersonator at the Lincoln Home, a muscle car at the Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices downtown, Lynch interviewing a family at the Cozy Dog and speaking with a ghost of Lincoln at “Ghosts of the Library” in the ALPLM, among others.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Thomas McDermott Jr. released a new video ad Wednesday of him smoking marijuana in honor of 4/20, a cannabis-related celebration. McDermott, who will face Republican Sen. Todd Young on Nov. 8, has been vocal about his support for the legalization of marijuana, but the video of him lighting it up is a first. In the video the Hammond mayor posted on Twitter, McDermott lights a joint and smokes it in an Illinois backyard, where marijuana consumption has been legalized. He talks to an attorney, a physician, a criminal defense attorney, a professional distiller and another elected official about the benefits of legalizing weed. “Here’s the bottom line,” McDermott says in the video. “We need to legalize marijuana on the federal level. We need to also legalize cannabis in Indiana as well, so Hoosiers can get the health and economic benefits of cannabis.” The mayor admitted last year on his “Left of Center” podcast that he smoked marijuana at a recent Grateful Dead show at Wrigley Field. McDermott unveiled the ad the same day the Indiana Democratic Party launched a tour to push marijuana legalization. It started publicly advocating for the policy change in November, but with Republicans in control at the Statehouse, it went nowhere in the 2022 legislative session.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: This year’s Major League Baseball Field of Dreams game between the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs will have an opening act. The Cedar Rapids Kernels and Quad Cities River Bandits will play a regular season minor league baseball game in the stadium located near the iconic diamond from the movie Aug. 9. That showdown is set to take place just two days before MLB’s second-straight visit to the famous farmland and in the same ballpark used last season by the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees. The Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds will play on the same field Aug. 11. “I think it just adds to an entire week now up there,” said Kernels general manager Scott Wilson. “Instead of just one night even with the major league game, you’ve got Tuesday night with us. It gives the Field of Dreams some opportunity to do some things on Wednesday between us and have that game on Thursday.” It’s a marquee matchup of minor league teams have been rivals in the Midwest League for years. The River Bandits are the High-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals. The Kernels are the High-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. The two teams, who are are located in Eastern Iowa, will become the first two minor league teams to play on the field.\n\nKansas\n\nAtchison: Aviator Amelia Earhart vanished as she tried to fly around the world in 1937, along with navigator Fred Noonan and their Lockheed Electra 10-E airplane. The centerpiece of the new Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum is Muriel – the world’s last remaining Lockheed Electra 10-E. Named after Earhart's younger sister, Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey, Muriel is identical to the plane Earhart flew on her final flight around the world. That museum is in the works in Atchison, Earhart’s birthplace. Museum founder and president Karen Seaberg announced last week that supporters had already donated $10 million of the estimated $15 million needed to create the museum, including corporate powerhouses FedEx, Garmin and Lockheed Martin. The museum is expected to open next year, according to its website. Earhart, born in 1897 in Atchison, was a social worker in Boston in 1923 when she became the 16th woman in the U.S. to be issued a pilot’s license. She subsequently became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic and the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. She was also the first woman to fly nonstop across the U.S. She became a celebrity and drew attention by rejecting traditional women’s roles and speaking in support of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. Earhart also created her own line of women’s clothing, featuring comfortable outfits designed for “active living.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday that he will form an advisory team amid a broad review as he weighs whether to take executive action to legalize access to medical marijuana. Beshear said he instructed his legal team to analyze potential options for executive action to create a framework to make medical cannabis available for people suffering from specified ailments. The Democratic governor also made a direct appeal to Kentuckians to offer their views on the issue. “I want to be clear: I am for medical cannabis,” Beshear said at his weekly news conference. “I want it done in the right way. And we’re going to be looking at our legal options very closely. And at the same time, we want to hear from you.” The advisory team will travel the state to gather public input, and Kentuckians will be able to express their views directly to the governor’s office, he said. The expanded review reflects the governor’s growing frustration after the latest bill to legalize medical marijuana died in the state Senate during the legislative session that ended last week. Lawmakers failed to “get the job done,” with Kentucky falling behind the majority of states that make medical cannabis available as an alternative to opioid medications, the governor said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A federal judge and court-appointed monitors hired to oversee reform of the New Orleans Police Department said Wednesday that the long-troubled agency could reach full compliance this year after a nearly decade-old court-backed overhaul of its policies and practices. “I’m proud of how far NOPD has come,” U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan, who approved the agreement in 2013 a highly critical 2011 investigation and report by the U.S. Justice Department. Morgan tempered her praise with acknowledgment of continuing problems, including the short-handed department’s slowdown in recruiting and allegations of wrongdoing by officers who work private duty details arranged through the department. But the department has shown transparency in dealing with such setbacks, Morgan said. The reform agreement, embodied in a court document called a consent decree, was welcomed by department critics when it was negotiated during former Mayor Mitch Landrieu’s administration. They said it was needed for a department that had been plagued by recurring scandals involving corruption or questionable use of force for decades. But the consent decree had its critics as well, including police officer representatives who said it hampered police work.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed off on a $1.2 billion supplemental budget Wednesday that sends more than half the money to residents in the form of $850 relief checks. Backed by dozens of lawmakers and Cabinet members, the governor signed the bill into law in the State House Hall of Flags. “What this budget shows once again – through hard work and good faith negotiation – Democrats, Republicans and independents can come together to do what is right for Maine people. And that we can do so without rancor or bitter partisanship that has sometimes divided Augusta in the past,” she told the assembly. The swift action means the checks will be mailed to more than 850,000 Mainers as early as June. Lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the budget proposal in a show of bipartisanship. Mills proposed returning much of the money to Mainers, taking a suggestion from Republicans as a historic surplus ballooned thanks to federal spending and rosier-than-expected revenue forecasts. It was originally touted as pandemic relief but is now called inflationary relief. Mills’ opponent in the upcoming election, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, derided the relief checks as a “gimmick.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan signed measures into law Thursday aimed at increasing public safety, jobs, environmental stewardship and mental health resources. The Republican governor, who prioritized initiatives to support the police and fight crime this legislative session, signed legislation to increase transparency in the criminal justice system and to create a state gun analytics center to coordinate resources to screen and vet gun cases to improve the prosecution of gun crimes. “Violent crime continues to be Marylanders’ top priority, and today we’re signing our Judicial Transparency Act so that the public knows more about the sentences that are being handed down for violent criminals,” Hogan said. “We’re further expanding our warrant apprehension efforts and strengthening prosecutions on gun crimes.” Hogan opened his remarks before signing 103 bills with House Speaker Adrienne Jones and Senate President Pro Tem Melony Griffith by noting it was the first time two Black women were the presiding officers representing the Maryland House and Senate together at a bill signing. The criminal justice measures marked a compromise between the Republican governor and the General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMartha’s Vineyard: A local family will go to court Friday over its continuing fight over a piece of land in Aquinnah that the Kennedy family donated to the Vineyard Conservation Society in 2013. Tanisha Gomes and her family say they are the rightful owners of that 5.7-acre property and are challenging the society’s motion for summary judgment, which asks a judge to throw out the case. In 2017, Gomes received a letter from Fidelity National Law Group, a firm that represents Vineyard Conservation Society Inc., to inform her and 19 members of her family about title problems with the land. The letter informed Gomes and her relatives that a lawsuit was filed with Dukes County Superior Court against the family, who are considered heirs of Louisa Pocknett. Pocknett, described in the complaint as the former owner of the property, died Aug. 29, 1874, and was a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. The family members were asked to sign an agreement to verify they had no right, title or interest in Lot 240, which was indicated on a plan entitled “Plan of Gay Head.” After further research, Gomes and her family found that Lot 240 remains in Pocknett’s name on the town of Aquinnah’s assessor’s website and objected to the lawsuit due to discrepancies surrounding incomplete deeds.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republican state Sen. Lana Theis opened a session with an invocation by claiming children are being attacked by “forces” that want to indoctrinate them with ideas their parents do not support. Three Democrats walked out of last week’s meeting to protest her apparent reference to how schools address sexual orientation and gender identity and critical race theory. Within days, one who tweeted criticism of the prayer was targeted by Theis in a fundraising email, calling Sen. Mallory McMorrow a liberal social media “troll” and accusing her of wanting to “groom” and “sexualize” kindergartners and teach “that 8-year-olds are responsible for slavery.” McMorrow responded Tuesday with a forceful, impassioned floor speech that resonated nationwide. “I am a straight, white, Christian, married, suburban mom” who wants “every kid to feel seen, heard and supported – not marginalized and targeted because they are not straight, white and Christian,” she said. Theis, who declined to speak after the session, released a statement in which she did not apologize but again accused Democrats of trying to undermine parents as the primary decision-makers in their children’s education. McMorrow’s 5-minute speech found an engaged audience on social media, racking up millions of views across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Mike Dando, a St. Cloud State University English professor, has helped to create a new superhero comic and is aiming to teach students in grades 5-12 literacy skills, critical thinking and self-reflection this summer through an often overlooked medium. Exploring concepts like Afrofuturism and the African diaspora, students can imagine new worlds by reading and analyzing the story of the first Black superhero, Lion Man. In 2018, after the highly successful “Black Panther” movie debuted, Dando worked with a group of artists and professors around the world to revisit Lion Man, the first Black superhero comic, written in 1947 by Black Philadelphia journalist Orrin Cromwell Evans. The original story follows Lion Man, a scientist turned superhero tasked by the United Nations to watch over a magical mountain full of uranium in Africa to prevent war. When All-Negro Comics Inc.’s paper supplier refused to help the company produce another book because its founders were Black, only one Lion Man issue was ever published – until now. Dando’s new, much longer Lion Man comic book follows the character’s journey of self-discovery and heroism as he works to save a group of other heroes trapped in monstrous bodies. He served as editor and project manager for the work written by John Jennings and illustrated by David Brame. Thanks to a grant from St. Cloud State, the team was able to make copies of the comic book – one of which is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York – and Dando will work with a variety of after-school clubs this summer to talk about the narrative structure and themes of the book, as well as teach students how to make their own comics.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Volunteers on Thursday planted several types of grasses along a stretch of Mississippi Gulf Coast beach to help restore habitat for newly hatched Least Tern chicks. Audubon Delta, along with Harrison County Sand Beach Authority and Gulfport High School, partnered to install several species of beach grasses into a globally recognized conservation zone in Gulfport in order to stabilize the beach, encourage dune formation and provide coverage for the endangered birds. The area was destroyed after hurricanes Ida and Zeta and several tropical storms over the past two years, officials said. The project was made possible by a Caring for Our Coasts grant issued by Citgo and Restore America’s Estuaries.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: City leaders on Thursday announced plans for a new institute designed to make the region a major player in geospatial technology. Andy Taylor, executive chairman of the rental car company Enterprise Holdings, is providing financing for the Taylor Geospatial Institute, along with eight St. Louis-area research institutions. The institute will provide funding for research and program development and expects to attract leading scientists to St. Louis, organizers said. Taylor said in a statement that he hopes the institute “will cement St. Louis as the world’s true center for geospatial excellence.” A news release says research and training will focus on topics such as food security, improving health care systems, and national security. Officials did not disclose how much money the Taylor family is investing, but the family has funded more than $1 billion in St. Louis civic initiatives and cultural institutions through the years.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Lawmakers have rejected an attempt to call a special legislative session to investigate the state’s election processes amid continued false claims by ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters that the 2020 election was stolen. A poll of 149 lawmakers found just 44 approving a special session by Tuesday’s deadline, short of the 75 needed. The secretary of state’s tally showed 60 lawmakers rejected the special session, and another 45 didn’t return their ballots, which counts as a “no” vote. One legislative seat is vacant. Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers tried to reach an agreement to ask Gov. Greg Gianforte to call a special session to create new voting districts for the Public Service Commission before three federal judges had to decide how to even out the populations in the five districts. However, GOP leaders were unable to get a commitment from all Republicans to limit the special session to addressing just the voting districts. Gianforte said he would not call a special session without such an agreement. After the court set the PSC districts for the 2022 elections, 10 lawmakers asked for the poll on whether lawmakers wanted to hold a special session on election integrity.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Former U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson endorsed state Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks on Thursday in her campaign for the state’s 1st Congressional District. Pansing Brooks, a Democrat, is looking to replace former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who resigned after he was convicted on charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal campaign contribution. Nelson, a Democrat, said Pansing Brooks has worked with both parties while in the Nebraska Legislature and passed more than 60 bills. Pansing Brooks will face state Sen. Mike Flood, a Republican, in a June 28 special election to determine who will serve the remainder of Fortenberry’s term in Congress. She’s also expected to face Flood again in November, assuming that they both win their parties’ May 10 primary nomination as expected. Nelson is the most recent Democrat to have served as Nebraska’s governor, with a tenure from 1991 to 1999. He was a U.S. senator from 2001 to 2013. Pansing Brooks has served in the Legislature since 2015 and is leaving office in January due to term limits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Most of the five leading Republican candidates for governor who gathered Wednesday for a campaign forum offered dire assessments of the state’s tourism-dependent economy, rising crime and struggling schools – and asked for votes for their visions to fix them. Several also blamed Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, the consensus GOP front-runner, for skipping the event. “We want to have the best, well-run, state in the country,” said Guy Nohra, a Reno venture capitalist, drawing applause from among about 100 people at a Republican women’s club luncheon in Las Vegas. “But we don’t. We’re 50th in everything,” said Nora, who called his foray into politics the culmination of an American dream after his own teenage experience fighting a war in his home country, Lebanon, and his business ventures in the U.S. The event also featured North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, Gardnerville surgeon Fred Simon, former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller and firebrand northern Nevada lawyer Joey Gilbert.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House approved a resolution Thursday in support of New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary before advancing a bill opponents said would threaten it. The nonbinding resolution came a week after the Democratic National Committee approved a plan to revoke the guaranteed first-place spots in the presidential nominating calendar long held by the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. Noting New Hampshire has withstood previous challenges, lawmakers affirmed their commitment to the tradition and said candidates are well-served by campaigning in a state with an engaged citizenry and “well-run, free and fair elections.” But a supporter of a bill to create a provisional ballot system later called the current system “laughable,” claiming it allows people to cast fraudulent ballots with virtually no consequences. Under current law, voters who arrive at the polls without the necessary identification fill out affidavits promising to provide documentation within 10 days; those who don’t can be investigated and charged with fraud. The votes themselves remain valid, but under a bill sent to the House Finance Committee on Thursday, the state would create a new type of “affidavit ballots” that would be thrown out if voters fail to follow up. Opponents called it an expensive and complicated solution to a problem that doesn’t exist and said creating a system that would delay the final results for more than a week would threaten the state’s ability to hold the first primary.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBloomfield: The flowers were finally on full display Thurday as recreational marijuana sales began in the Garden State. Michael Barrows wore his Grateful Dead T-shirt and Jerry Garcia face mask for opening day of legal cannabis sales and was one of dozens of people who lined up before dawn to join the celebratory scene. “It’s pretty amazing, exciting, and if I get pulled over on the way home, and I’m ever asked if I have any drugs in the car, now I’m allowed to say ‘only this,’ ” Barrows said, holding up the canister of marijuana flower he had just purchased. Possession of cannabis is legal now in New Jersey, though driving under the influence is still prohibited. Barrows, 60, joined a steady stream of other novelty-seekers, longtime marijuana users and medical patients at RISE in Bloomfield, near the state’s biggest city, Newark, and not far from New York City. With soul music blaring, free doughnuts in the parking lot, a steel drum and a balloon arch at the entrance, New Jersey’s cannabis kickoff for people 21 and older had the feel of a fair more than a store opening. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who has long backed recreational marijuana legalization and signed the bill that set up the new marketplace kicking off at 13 existing medical marijuana facilities across the state, appeared at ZenLeaf in Elizabeth for its first day of recreational sales. The governor said he wouldn’t be trying any pot; earlier this week he said it’s not his “thing,” and he prefers scotch.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: Habitat for about a million bats will be protected from human impacts through a deal between a nonprofit and the federal government. About 315,000 acres of southern New Mexico land owned by billionaire media tycoon Ted Turner were protected from development in a partnership between the U.S. Department of Defense and New Mexico Land Conservancy. The deal saw a conservation easement added to Armendaris Ranch, owned by Turner, due to perceived cultural significance and biological diversity on the land in Sierra and Socorro counties. The ranch land supports more than 500 vertebrate species, according to a report from the Land Conservancy, including multiple listed for federal and state protections. It also contains the Fra Cristobal Mountain Range, home to 230 desert bighorn sheep, and lava fields that include the Jornada cave system that houses bats of multiple species. “This land is laden with important and unique natural and cultural resources, and the opportunity to permanently protect a property with conservation values of this magnitude was at the heart of our organization’s decision to tackle this landscape-scale project,” said Ron Troy, southern New Mexico program manager with the Land Conservancy.\n\nNew York\n\nOlive: As western regions contend with drier conditions, New York City is under fire for sometimes releasing hundreds of millions of gallons of water a day from a key reservoir in the Catskill Mountains. The occasional releases, often around storms, have been used to manage water levels in the Ashokan Reservoir and to keep the water clear. But residents downstream say the periodic surges cause ecological harm along the lower Esopus Creek. They say the high flows churn up the water so much it turns the scenic Hudson River tributary the color of chocolate milk. “These people can afford to offer New York City cheap, clean, beautiful water by destroying ours,” said Michael Vallarella, who lives on the creek in Saugerties. Standing on his back deck recently, he swiped through pictures on his phone of the water looking like “Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory river.” The tensions between upstate residents and the city of 8.8 million people to the south touch on how the largest unfiltered water supply in the country will operate in an expected stormier future. Opponents pushing for changes to the water releases got a boost recently when state regulators told the city to take a deeper look at their effects. City officials say they’re trying to strike the difficult balance of responding to downstream concerns while delivering quality water.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The fight over a downtown Confederate marker is not over, according to the attorney challenging the city’s removal of Vance Monument, and documents filed Wednesday attempt to take the issue to North Carolina’s highest court. Despite an April 5 ruling from the N.C. Court of Appeals in favor of the city, affirming a lower court judgment to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing removal of the monument, the city finds itself again in limbo. Nearing midnight Wednesday, Edward Phillips, lawyer for the Society for the Historical Preservation of the 26th North Carolina Troops, which brought the challenge against the city, filed a petition for discretionary review with the N.C. Supreme Court. This document is a request for the Supreme Court to review the decision by the Court of Appeals. It does not ensure the high court will hear an appeal, said City Attorney Brad Branham. “I am not going to cede the point until I’m told there’s just no path forward,” Phillips said. The filings add to an already lengthy process to determine the fate of the obelisk that was built to honor racist Civil War-era Gov. Zebulon Vance. The 75-foot-tall granite Vance Monument stood in Pack Square Plaza in the heart of downtown Asheville. All but its base was taken down as of June 2021 after the City Council voted to remove it. The historical preservation group is seeking to stop and potentially reconstruct the monument to Vance.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that dismisses a lawsuit brought by the state and several western counties that could have resulted in the construction of additional roads in parts of the Badlands. The Badlands Conservation Alliance says the ruling protects some of the most pristine areas of the Badlands from traffic and potential oil development. “I think it’s a really serious win for the Badlands, for the long-term integrity of those areas that are still roadless and considered suitable for wilderness,” said Connie Triplett, president of the alliance. A three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals found the state’s and counties’ claim is barred by a 12-year statute of limitations that was passed years ago. Their ruling upholds an earlier decision by U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Hovland, who dismissed the matter in 2017, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The case began a decade ago when Billings, Golden Valley, McKenzie and Slope counties sued the federal government. The state followed with its own lawsuit, and the court consolidated the two cases. The plaintiffs sought to claim rights to section lines used in land surveying and mapping in the Little Missouri National Grassland and other areas that make up the Dakota Prairie Grasslands.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A lawsuit has been filed targeting legal protections granted to health care providers that allow them to deny treatment they oppose on the basis of their conscience or religious beliefs. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein on Wednesday sued the state over the measure known as the “conscience clause.” According to the law, a medical provider can be “excused from participating” whenever a treatment conflicts with a provider’s “moral, ethical, or religious beliefs or convictions.” Opponents of the law say it could limit abortions or other medical care. The city also argues the measure violates Ohio’s Constitution and the federal Affordable Care Act. If nurses employed by the city are opposed to a medical procedure, “they can refuse it, and we as a city can’t do anything about it,” Klein said. He also said insurance companies could refuse to pay for certain procedures, and “that obviously causes significant problems for our employees.” Republican Gov. Mike DeWine kept the language of the law in place when he signed the 2021 budget. DeWine said the provision merely sets into state law what’s already being practiced. In a statement, Attorney General Dave Yost called the lawsuit “meritless, anti-democracy and authoritarian.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Plans to fully legalize marijuana can proceed to the signature-gathering stage, the state Supreme Court ruled, paving the way for two more cannabis plans seeking voter approval. The high court’s ruling late Tuesday comes amid a marijuana boom in the Sooner State after voters in 2018 approved the most liberal medical marijuana program in the nation. Nearly 10% of Oklahoma’s 4 million residents have qualified for a medical-use card – by far the highest percentage in the country. Supporters of the two separate proposals still need to gather enough signatures to put the plans on the ballot for voters. The plans approved Tuesday, State Question 819 and a companion State Question 818, would amend the Oklahoma Constitution to protect the right of residents age 21 and older to use marijuana. It’s part of a nationwide push to legalize the recreational use of cannabis for adults, which 18 states and the District of Columbia have already approved. Because the two proposals seek to amend the constitution, supporters will have to gather more signatures, about 178,000 in 90 days, for them to qualify for the ballot. “Whether we’ll get on the November ballot this year remains to be seen,” said Jed Green, a longtime Oklahoma cannabis activist behind the plans. “We’re going to push, push and push to get it done.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A Native American tribe in the state said it is assessing its legal options after learning the U.S. government plans to release water from a federally operated reservoir to downstream farmers along the Oregon-California border amid a historic drought. Even limited irrigation for the farmers who use Klamath River water on about 300 square miles of crops puts two critically endangered fish species in peril of extinction because the water withdrawals come at the height of spawning season, the Klamath Tribes said. Last year, critically endangered sucker fish central to the Klamath Tribes culture and religion didn’t have enough water to spawn, and thousands of downstream juvenile salmon died without reservoir releases to support the Klamath River’s health. The tribes said in a statement that the decision to release any water to about 1,000 farmers in the massive, federal agricultural project was “perhaps the saddest chapter yet in a long history of treaty violations” and placed the blame for the current water crisis on “120 years of ecosystem mismanagement at the hands of settler society.” The fish are important to the inland tribes’ cultural and religious practices and were once a dietary staple. The Klamath stopped fishing for the sucker fish in the 1980s as numbers dwindled. They now run a captive breeding program to ensure the species’ survival and note that no juvenile sucker fish have survived in the wild in recent years. “We have nothing left with which to ‘compromise,’ ” the Klamath Tribes said in a statement. “Global warming is certainly a global problem, but thus far its local consequences appear to be exacerbating existing and systematic inequalities between ourselves and the larger society.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Prosecutors said Thursday that they will not re-try a Philadelphia man whose 2012 murder conviction was overturned earlier this month, citing weak evidence and the involvement of a disgraced former detective now charged with sexually assaulting witnesses in other cases. Rafiq Dixon, 40, had been serving a life sentence in the 2011 fatal shooting of Joseph Pinkney. The 40-year-old was expected to be released from prison Thursday afternoon, hours after a Common Pleas Court judge granted the motion to withdraw charges, his attorney said. The initial case relied heavily on testimony from three witnesses who gave inconsistent accounts. All three were interviewed by former homicide detective Philip Nordo, who has been charged with various crimes including stalking, intimidating, and sexually assaulting male suspects and witnesses during his career. In June, a judge reversed the 2015 conviction of Arkel Garcia, who confessed to murder during an interrogation in which, his lawyer said, Nordo asked the teenager to view pornography with him. The ruling came after both sides presented evidence that Nordo had sexually groomed witnesses in the case and trial prosecutors had suppressed his misconduct. Garcia was also serving a life sentence.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic former state lawmaker David Segal has joined the race to succeed U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, a fellow Democrat who’s retiring after more than two decades in office. Segal announced his decision Wednesday, saying that many voters are fed up with federal politics and that “government should be able to do more to address the concerns of our neighbors.” Segal served on the Providence City Council before winning a seat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He served for two terms, from 2007 to 2011. In 2010 he lost a bid for Congress and founded a national liberal advocacy organization known as Demand Progress. He’s the latest entry in a crowded Democratic field that also includes state Treasurer Seth Magaziner; Joy Fox, a former top aide to Langevin; Biden administration official Sarah Morgenthau; Omar Bah, executive director of the Refugee Dream Center in Providence; and former political strategist Michael Neary. “We have the people power to reach the voters, we have the money to compete, and we have the urgent case to make that we deserve leaders who can bring people together and ensure their voices are heard,” Segal said in his campaign announcement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s highest court on Wednesday issued a temporary stay blocking the state from carrying out what was set to be its first-ever firing squad execution. The order by the state Supreme Court puts on hold at least temporarily the planned April 29 execution of Richard Bernard Moore, who drew the death sentence for the 1999 killing of convenience store clerk James Mahoney in Spartanburg. The court said in issuing the temporary stay that it would release a more detailed order later. Attorneys for the 57-year-old inmate had sought a stay, citing pending litigation in another court challenging the constitutionality of South Carolina’s execution methods, which also include the electric chair. Moore’s lawyers also wanted time to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether Moore’s sentence was proportionate to his crime. It has been more than a decade since the last firing squad execution in the U.S. The state of Utah carried out all three such executions in the nation since 1976, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. The most recent was in 2010. The South Carolina Supreme Court on Wednesday also set a May 13 execution date for Brad Sigmon, 64, convicted in 2002 of the double murder of his ex-girlfriend’s parents in Greenville County.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A leadership shake-up and shorter wait times for service are welcomed changes for disgruntled military veterans who say the federal health care system is failing them, but that’s still not enough to appease the dozens of former soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, as well as a handful of elected officials, who showed up at the South Dakota Veterans Council’s quarterly meeting Wednesday. Praises of this week’s removal of the now-former Sioux Falls Veterans Affairs director were tempered by caution for a need for more systematic improvements. “If you walked the halls on Tuesday, there were more smiles in the Sioux Falls VA Hospital than there have been in 14 months,” said Hawk Mayor, a Vietnam combat veteran, referring to the departure of now former Sioux Falls VA director Lisa Simoneau. “But we’ve been shut out.” Simoneau was removed from the position as of Monday after growing pressure for a regime change from both veterans, VA employees and South Dakota’s congressional delegation. Since at least October, members of the South Dakota Veterans Council have voiced concerns about a lack of responsiveness from Simoneau regarding what’s described as an inadequate level of care being provided to veterans entitled to medical services through the veterans’ health care system. Some employees at the VA have also blown the whistle in recent weeks on poor management practices and a hostile work environment under Simoneau.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state would become the latest to impose harsh penalties on doctors who violate new, strict regulations dictating the dispensing of abortion pills under a proposal headed to Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s desk. It’s part of a coordinated nationwide effort spearheaded by anti-abortion groups upset over the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recent decision to remove a rule that required women to pick up the abortion medication in person. After Tennessee’s GOP-controlled House approved the measure last week, Senate Republicans on Thursday signed off on sending the proposal to the governor. Lee hasn’t publicly weighed in on the measure, but he has yet to veto a bill while in office and frequently stresses his opposition to abortion. According to the bill, delivery of abortion pills by mail would be outlawed, and anyone who wanted to use abortion pills would be required to visit a doctor in advance and then return to pick up the pills. The drugs may be dispensed only by qualified physicians – effectively barring pharmacists from doing so. Violators would face a Class E felony and up to a $50,000 fine. The in-person requirement had long been opposed by medical societies, including the American Medical Association, which said the restriction offers no clear benefit to patients.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A prominent conservative activist has been charged with unlawful restraint and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon over an October incident involving a contractor the activist hired, his attorneys said Wednesday. Jared Woodfill and Gary Polland, attorneys for Dr. Steven Hotze, said the Harris County District Attorney’s Office told them Wednesday that Hotze was indicted over allegations against a former police officer, Mark Aguirre, who worked for Hotze. Aguirre had been retained to pursue a voter fraud investigation on behalf of Houston-based Liberty Center for God and Country, a nonprofit organization Hotze runs. Aguirre was charged Dec. 14 with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after a man accused him of running him off the road and holding him at gunpoint in an effort to prove what authorities have called a bogus voter fraud scheme. Aguirre claimed an air conditioner repairman was the mastermind. He said the man’s truck was filled with fraudulent ballots when he ran his SUV into it Oct. 19, according to authorities. Aguirre told police he and some friends set up a “command post” at a Marriott hotel in suburban Houston that conducted 24-hour surveillance on the repairman for four days, according to a police affidavit.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Faced with continuing drought and one of the fastest-growing populations in the U.S., the Washington County Commission voted unanimously Tuesday to apply new water restrictions to every new residential and commercial development. The new rules won’t apply to any existing homes or commercial buildings, but they could hopefully provide a better balance between what water is available and the continued demand for new construction, said Adam Snow, a member of the three-member commission, which regulates buildings requirements for all of the unincorporated areas of the county. “We want to have beautiful communities and a beautiful place to live and maintain our quality of life,” Snow said. “We’re doing it as effectively and efficiently as possible with our water, which is a very sacred resource right now.” The changes will be written into Title 10, Chapter 27 of the county code. They will only apply to projects on unincorporated county land that still need approval from the county to go forward, although they resemble similar measures being passed by cities and towns in the area. Snow said about 5% of the county’s population lives on unincorporated land.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Property owned by Vermont-recognized Native American tribes will be exempt from property taxes under a new law that takes effect in July. The legislation, signed by Gov. Phil Scott on Wednesday, recognizes that Vermont lands “are the historic and current territories of the Western Abenaki people.” “I sign it out of respect for the heritage of our Native American communities and traditions,” Scott wrote in a letter to the Legislature. “Further, the associated costs to the Education Fund and the General Fund borne by all Vermonters are forecast to be negligible.” To be exempt from the state and municipal property taxes, the property must be used for the purposes of the tribe and not leased or rented. Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki Nation, has said the tax exemption allows the tribes, which rely on grants and donations, to be able to use those resources “to help uplift our people” with food security and other needs. The legislation states that “stewardship of these lands was removed from the Abenaki by European governments and settlers” and acknowledges “the Abenaki people as the traditional land caretakers of Ndakinna, which includes parts of Vermont, New England, and Quebec.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWestlake: Officials at Booker T. Washington National Monument are asking the public for help in unraveling one of its biggest mysteries. Hidden away in a section of the park just off its Jack O’ Lantern Trail rests a cemetery that predates much of the known history of the former plantation where Booker T. Washington was born a slave and later freed. The cemetery has few markings to provide context to who was buried there or when they were buried. “It’s definitely one of the biggest mysteries at the park,” said Tim Sims, senior park ranger. Archaeologist with New South Associates recently began taking a deeper look into the cemetery, commonly referred to as the Sparks Cemetery named after a person who once lived nearby. Some of the Black families who have lived near the cemetery include the Brown, Holland, Divers, Burroughs, Ferguson, Taylor, Green, Harris, English, Edwards, Starkey, Swain, Saunders, Childress and Dudley families. Sims said the names of the families were found looking through property deeds, slave records and federal census records. People with information on those possibly buried in the Sparks Cemetery are asked to contact Velma Fann, historian, at New South Associates at 770-498-4155, x126 or vfann@newsouthassoc.com.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously ruled that an Edmonds city ordinance requiring that guns be locked up and kept out of unauthorized hands is preempted by state law. The ruling affirmed a three-judge state of appeals ruling last year in the case sparked by a lawsuit filed by three residents against the city of Edmonds after it approved an ordinance in July 2018 requiring residents to lock up their guns or else face fines. “Under our system of divided government, many elected bodies hold legislative power, including elected city councils. These councils, however, must legislate within constitutional constraints,” Chief Justice Steven González wrote, joined by the eight other justices on the high court. “One of those constraints is that city ordinances must not ‘conflict with general laws’ that have been enacted by the people of our state by initiative or by our state legislature.” A statewide ballot measure that passed later that same year on gun safety doesn’t mandate that a firearm be stored in a particular way or place, but it created criminal penalties for when a gun isn’t properly stored and accessed by someone who is prohibited from possessing a firearm – such as a child – and used to injure or kill, displayed in public in an intimidating manner or used during a crime.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A health care system has partnered with a junior college on a program aimed at addressing the shortage of nurses in the state. Mon Health System and West Virginia Junior College signed a letter of intent to launch a nursing education program that will put students at the school on an accelerated path to becoming nurses, officials said during a signing ceremony Monday. Mon Health nurses will serve as faculty, and the students will have digital coursework as well as learning through work at the hospital – what Mon Health System President and CEO David Goldberg called patient-side, The Dominion Post reports. The program plans to open enrollment in September and start its first class next April. The collaboration, Goldberg said, will serve “to bring not only the best nurses to patient-side through Mon Health, but keep people in this community, grow our own, take care of our own neighbors, family members and friends, so we continue to be the best health care location in north-central West Virginia and improve our health care outcomes.” West Virginia Junior College CEO Chad Callen said nursing shortages are at near crisis levels in some areas of the state. “Such challenges require bold thinking and innovative, out-of-the-box approaches,” he said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The work of an investigator looking into the 2020 presidential election generated fresh criticism Thursday after newly posted documents included a memo describing one elections worker in the state as “probably” a Democrat in part because she loves snakes and “has a weird nose ring.” Also on Thursday, a judge ordered Michael Gableman to stop deleting records, the latest legal defeat for the former state Supreme Court justice. Gableman has released two interim reports on the election won by President Joe Biden and has suggested the GOP-controlled Legislature look into decertifying his victory. Republican leaders including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who hired Gableman, have repeatedly said they have no intention of trying to decertify the win. Gableman’s reports have not included evidence to back up the false claims that Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2020. A recently posted unsigned document on Gableman’s website, titled “cross pollinators,” details his probe into public employees who work in elections. That memo contends that a geographic information system analyst for Milwaukee is “probably” a Democrat because she plays video games, “has a weird nose ring,” sometimes colors her hair, “loves nature and snakes” and lives with a boyfriend but is not married to him.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s senior population grew at the nation’s second-fastest rate in the second decade of the millennium, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Citing research from online resource hub AgingInPlace.org, the newspaper points to a 40% increase in the proportion of Wyoming residents who are 65 or older between 2010 and 2020, with the level sitting at 17.8% in the latest census. Only Alaska was found to have a faster-growing senior population when comparing U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/22"}]}

The rank-and-file members of the nation’s largest rail union, which represents the industry’s conductors, rejected a tentative labor deal with freight railroads, the union announced Monday.\n\nThe nation’s second-largest rail union, which represents engineers, ratified its own contract. But the failure of the conductors to ratify their deal is another setback to efforts to avoid a strike.\n\nWith these votes, all 12 rail unions have now completed their ratification process, with members of eight of the unions voting in favor of deals and four voting against it. The four unions that have voted no will remain on the job until at least early next month while negotiations are held to try to avoid a strike that could cause widespread disruptions in the nation’s still struggling supply chain and overall economy.\n\nIf even one of the dozen railroad unions were to go on strike, the other 11 would honor the picket lines, shutting down the railroads.\n\nIf a strike goes on for an extended period, it could cause shortages and higher prices for goods including fuel and food. If the four unions that rejected the deals are unable to reach new deals before strike deadlines, Congress could order the railroad workers to remain on the job or return to work.\n\nThe two unions that released voting results Monday are the transportation division of the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, Transportation union (SMART-TD), which represents about 28,000 conductors and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), which represents about 24,000 engineers. The engineers and conductors make up the two-person train crews.\n\nBoth unions reached tentative deals in September in a marathon 20-hour negotiating session just hours before their earlier strike deadlines.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called those deals “a win for tens of thousands of rail workers and for their dignity and the dignity of their work.” He had directly intervened in the final round of talks, but his praise of the deals wasn’t enough to win approval from rank-and-file members of the conductors’ union.\n\nThe deals nearly got the support they needed to be ratified by both unions. One was ratified by the engineers, with 53.5% voting yes, while the other was a very slim defeat by the conductors with either a small majority or a near majority voting for ratification.\n\nThe conductors’ vote ultimately failed because the union’s rules require each of five classes of workers within the union to approve the deal for it to pass.\n\nAlthough 64.5% of “yardmasters,” which includes 1,300 of the union’s membership, supported the deal, 50.87% members of train and engine service members of the union voted against ratification. The union did not release the overall vote totals for SMART-TD members.\n\nThe no vote follow similar contract rejections by the rank-and-file members of three other rail unions – one representing track maintenance workers, another whose members maintain and operate the signal system, and a third who represent locomotive mechanics and welders.\n\nThe Association of American Railroads, the industry trade group, told CNN last week that the railroads are still hopeful of reaching new deals that can be ratified by membership without a strike taking place. It repeated that hope Monday after the latest vote.\n\n“While railroads remain committed to reaching agreements with these remaining unions, the timeline for those to occur is short,” said the AAR’s statement.\n\nOne of those unions which earlier rejected its deal, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division (BMWED), announced Monday it was moving its strike date back to Dec. 9, to be in sync with the strike date for the conductors and one of the other unions.\n\nAnd it suggested all four unions should negotiate together ahead of a common Dec. 9 strike date.\n\nThe one union that might go on strike before Dec. 9, the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen [BRS], could go on strike at 12:01 am ET on Dec. 5. Last week the BRS President Michael Baldwin told CNN the union did not intend to push back its strike deadline “at this time.”\n\nLucrative deals get rejected\n\nEven within many of the unions that voted in favor of the deals, there was significant opposition, as was shown in the 46.5% of engineers who voted no.\n\nThe deals being voted down are lucrative for union members. They include an immediate 14% raise with back pay dating to 2020, as well as pay raises totaling 24% during the four-year life of the contracts, which run through 2024. Union members also would receive cash bonuses of $1,000 a year.\n\nAll told, the backpay and bonuses will give union members an average payment of $11,000 per worker once the deal is ratified.\n\nBut it’s not the pay that has been the sticking point in the negotiations. It’s the work rules and quality of life issues, such as staffing levels and paid sick time, which the tentative agreements do not include.\n\nSo far railroad management has rejected proposals from union negotiators to add sick pay as a way to win ratification from the rank and file.\n\nCongressional action possible\n\nCongress is already facing calls from a wide range of business groups to act to prevent a strike. About 30% of the nation’s freight moves by rail, when measured by the weight of the freight and the distance it travels.\n\nThe AAR joined those calls for Congressional action if new deals can’t be reached.\n\n“Congress has historically intervened to prevent rail system disruptions. In the event that the four unions remain unwilling to enter agreements … Congress must be prepared to act and institute the terms supported by the majority of the unions, guaranteeing certainty for rail customers and the broader economy,” it said in its statement.\n\nLabor Secretary Marty Walsh, who was involved in the negotiations that reached the deals that averted a strike back in September, told CNN earlier this month that while he prefers to reach a new round of negotiated agreements, it would be necessary for Congress to act to prevent a strike.\n\nThe White House said Monday they are looking to labor and industry parties involved in negotiations to resolve a rail dispute on their own ahead of a critical December deadline.\n\n“As the President has said from the beginning, a shutdown is unacceptable because of the harm it would inflict on jobs, families, farms, businesses and communities across the country,” a White House official told CNN.\n\nThe official added: “A majority of unions have voted to ratify the tentative agreement, and the best option is still for the parties to resolve this themselves.”\n\nAsked Monday by CNN’s Jeremy Diamond what he was doing to avert a rail strike, President Biden responded, “We’re going to be talking about that today.”\n\nBut unlike July, when Biden was able to block the unions from going on strike by naming a panel to try to come up with a solution both sides could live with, it now rests with Congress, not Biden, to act if new labor deals can not be reached.\n\nThe unions are all opposed to Congressional intervention and want to be allowed to strike to raise pressure on the railroads to achieve their bargaining goals, though they would not be opposed to the Labor Department once again facilitating negotiations.\n\n“We don’t think it should require the influence or cajoling of any outside party to get the railroads to be reasonable on behalf of their business or workers,” said the BMWED in a statement. “But it would be helpful for these third parties to start to facilitate the discussion. It’s clear railroads won’t engaged with us meaningfully unless they are forced to.\n\nAn added challenge: it would take bipartisan cooperation in the “Lame Duck” session of congress to pass legislation that will prevent or quickly end a strike.\n\n– CNN’s Betsy Klein and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2024/09/15/air-canada-pilots-union-deal-strike/75236815007/", "title": "Air Canada, pilots reach deal, averting strike that could have ...", "text": "Gnaneshwar Rajan, Rajesh Kumar Singh, David Ljunggren, Julia Gomez\n\nReuters, USA TODAY\n\nAfter preparing to cancel flights and shut down its operation, Air Canada will operate normally after it struck a tentative agreement with its pilot union, avoiding a strike or lockout, the union said on Sunday.\n\nCanada Air (AC.TO) reached a tentative, last-minute deal with its pilots' union, the Air Line Pilots Association, ALPA, over a new four-year collective agreement, ending the stand-off over pay and benefits that started in May 2023.\n\n“While it has been an exceptionally long road to this agreement, the consistent engagement and unified determination of our pilots have been the catalyst for achieving this contract,” said First Officer Charlene Hudy, chair of the Air Canada ALPA Master Executive Council, MEC, in a statement.\n\nCanada Air, the country's largest airline, prepared to cancel flights progressively over three days and then completely shut down its operations as early as Sept. 18.\n\n\"The new agreement recognizes the contributions and professionalism of Air Canada's pilot group, while providing a framework for the future growth of the airline,\" the carrier said in a statement.\n\nNot over yet:Boeing workers reject contract, go on strike for first time in 16 years\n\nFlights continue to run as usual\n\nAs of Sunday, flights will run as usual. Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge operate nearly 670 flights per day, carrying about 110,000 daily passengers, as well as freight.\n\nAir Canada said the terms of its new agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), representing over 5,400 Air Canada pilots, will remain confidential, pending a ratification vote by members expected to be completed over the next month.\n\n\"Ratification requires approval by a majority of the voting membership, who will soon receive the Tentative Agreement for review,\" said the union in a statement.\n\nThe deal, however, would \"put an end to our outdated and stale decade-old, ten-year framework,\" said Hudy.\n\nThe ALPA said the deal would mean an additional $1.4 billion in value for members over its four-year term, representing a 46% increase over the previous contract that expired nearly a year ago on Sept. 29, 2023.\n\nIf approved by ALPA members, the deal would be backdated to run from Sept. 30, 2023 to Sept. 29, 2027.\n\nNarrow the pay gap\n\nThe two sides had been negotiating a new contract for the past 15 months, with the pilots demanding wage rates that would narrow the pay gap with their counterparts at major U.S. carriers, like United Airlines (UAL.O).\n\n\"We have initiated discussions with Air Canada to achieve a contract that closes the growing gaps in wages and quality of life between pilots in the United States and Canada,\" stated a letter from the union.\n\nAir Canada had offered a wage increase of more than 30%, as well as improved pension and health benefits. However, the union said the proposal was not good enough for their members working under pay rates and quality-of-life provisions negotiated in 2014.\n\n\"Air Canada pilots are working under a contract that was negotiated a decade ago, which means our pay rates and quality-of-life provisions are effectively frozen in time,\" according to the union's website. \"Since that time, Air Canada has grown significantly, making billions in profit, and Air Canada’s top corporate executives have seen their salaries double.\"\n\nCanadian's pilot salaries vs. U.S. counterparts\n\nPilots at U.S. airlines have negotiated hefty pay raises in new contracts in the past two years amid a travel boom and staffing shortages. United's new pilot contract, for example, included pay increases of about 42%.\n\nAs a result, some United pilots now earn 92% more than their counterparts at Air Canada, data from the pilots' association shows. In 2013, the pay gap was just 3%.\n\nThe government wouldn't intervene\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday the Canadian government would not intervene to end the dispute as it did last month within 24 hours to end a strike at the nation's two largest rail companies, Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CP.TO) and Canadian National Railway (CNR.TO).\n\nCanadian Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon, in a post on X, saluted the efforts of Air Canada and its pilots who he said had shown resolve to get a deal and prevent travel disruptions.\n\n\"Negotiated agreements are always the best way forward and yield positive results for companies and workers,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2021/11/21/what-do-uaws-gains-deere-strike-mean-iowa-national-unions/8662696002/", "title": "What do UAW's gains in Deere strike mean for Iowa, national unions?", "text": "On Wednesday night, after her union voted to ratify a new six-year contract with Deere & Co., Whitney Rose Al-hameed hung around the United Auto Workers Local 450 hall.\n\nThe strike was over after five weeks, and Al-hameed expected to resume making sprayers at John Deere Des Moines Works by the end of the week.

But less well-known is a looming high-stakes clash between one of America’s oldest unions and the world’s biggest package courier.\n\nContract negotiations are set to begin in the spring between UPS and the Teamsters Union ahead of their current contract’s expiration at the end of July, 2023. Already, before the talks have even started, labor experts are predicting that the drivers and package handlers will go on strike.\n\n“The question is how long it will be,” said Todd Vachon, professor of Labor Relations at Rutgers. “The union’s president ran and won on taking a more militant approach. Even if they’re very close [to a deal], the rank and file will be hungry to take on the company.”\n\nIf that happens, a strike at UPS would affect nearly every household in the country. An estimated 6% of the nation’s gross domestic product is moved in UPS trucks every year. The explosive growth of online retail has made the company and its drivers more crucial than ever to the nation’s struggling supply chain. Beyond the company’s home deliveries, it also delivers many of the goods found in stores, factories and offices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Starbucks employees at New York store vote to unionize (2021) 02:06 - Source: CNNBusiness\n\nAbout 350,000 Teamsters work at UPS as drivers and package sorters out of a global workforce of 534,000 permanent employees. And that’s growing fast — the company has added some 72,000 Teamster-represented jobs since the start of the pandemic.\n\nWhile there are competing services at FedEx (FDX), the US Postal Service and Amazon’s own delivery service, none of them have the capacity to handle more than a small fraction of the 21.5 million US packages that UPS moves daily.\n\n“We want a contract that provides wins for our employees and that provides UPS the flexibility to stay competitive in a rapidly changing industry,” the company said in a statement this month. “UPS and the Teamsters have worked cooperatively for almost 100 years to meet the needs of UPS employees, customers, and the communities where we live and work. We believe we’ll continue to find common ground with the Teamsters and reach an agreement that’s good for everyone involved.”\n\nThe union has not gone on strike against UPS since a nearly two-week protest in 1997. If the union does go on strike, it would be the largest strike against a single business in nation’s history.\n\nAnger over current contract\n\nThere are certainly signs of strain in relations between the company and the union — both its leadership and its rank-and-file members.\n\nA majority of members voted against ratifying the current contract in 2018, only to see the previous Teamster leadership, led by then-President James Hoffa, put it in place because not enough of the membership participated in the ratification vote to trigger a strike.\n\nThe union’s new president, Sean O’Brien, won his office earlier this year by making the UPS contract a central focus of his campaign. He has vowed to make UPS pay Teamster members far more this time and he often talks about a $300 million strike fund the union has accumulated to pay members in case they go on strike.\n\n“Do our members wake up every day wanting a strike. I’d say no. But are they fed up? Yes they’re fed up,” O’Brien told CNN Business last week. “Whether or not there is a strike, that’s totally up to the company. We’re going to utilize as much leverage as we can to get our members the contract they deserve.”\n\nUPS said the average pay for its delivery drivers is $95,000 a year, with benefits such as a traditional pension plan, worth an additional $50,000 a year. UPS’ semi-tractor drivers are paid even more. That’s far higher than most wages at FedEx and Amazon, where many drivers work for small independent contractors.\n\nThe current contract expires at 12:01 am August 1. O’Brien vows the union will not grant any kind of contract extension past that deadline.\n\nAnd he added that on top of improved pay and benefits, the union will demand better working conditions, including adding air conditioning in the panel trucks used for UPS deliveries which the union says poses a health risk for drivers.\n\n“It’s not a heavy lift for the company to install air conditioning,” he said. “There’s a lot of heat stroke going on.”\n\nRecord profits at UPS\n\nThe company often speaks about how much it values its Teamster-represented workforce.\n\nAnd in one important way – employment numbers – UPS is one of the best friends labor has in the ranks of US corporate management, despite the obvious tensions. UPS is one of the few unionized employers that is significantly adding payrolls, and to union membership. At other businesses, union membership numbers have been steadily declining or decades.\n\nThe increase in Teamsters jobs at UPS has come from the steady growth in online purchases, especially during the pandemic-era surge. Last year, it took only nine months to report what was already a record profit for a full year. UPS ended 2021 with operating income up 50% to $13.1 billion. In the first half of this year, earnings rose another 10% compared with a year ago.\n\n“Everyone keeps getting richer except for our members,” said O’Brien.\n\nUPS CEO Carol Tome, who started that job just as the pandemic began, says that the company’s union contract is a competitive advantage at a time of worker shortages.\n\nShe also is trying to assure both investors and UPS customers that the company will be prepared in case the union does go on strike. She declined to comment on what those preparations are.\n\n“Our goal with the Teamsters is win-win-win,” she told investors in July. But she added that UPS is “building contingency plans.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/business/rail-strike-threat-recedes/index.html", "title": "Rail unions decry Biden's call for Congress to block strike ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nPresident Joe Biden was in the unusual position Tuesday of being praised by business interests and attacked by his normal allies in the labor movement after calling for Congress to move immediately to block a strike by more than 100,000 union members at the nation’s freight railroads set for the end of next week.\n\nThe move was a serious setback for the unions, who say they needed the right to strike in order to get railroad management to negotiate over their major demand to give workers sick days that are not in the current contracts. They say the railroads, many of which reported record profits last year, are enjoying even stronger profits this year and can afford to meet the union’s demands.\n\nBiden said he is sympathetic to the union’s demand, but he said a rail strike would cause too much economic damage and must be avoided.\n\n“I share workers’ concern about the inability to take leave to recover from illness or care for a sick family member,” he said in his statement. “No one should have to choose between their job and their health – or the health of their children.”\n\nHe said that the tentative deals that were rejected by rank-and-file members of the unions were good deals for the workers, even in the face of those concerns. They include 24% wage increases over the four-year life of the deals, the biggest pay increases won by the unions in more than 50 years. Biden pointed out that union leadership had agreed to the tentative deals in September when they were negotiated and called them good deals for the rank-and-file members.\n\nUnion anger at deals, and at Biden\n\nBut the membership of four of the unions rejected the tentative deals. The other eight unions are prepared to honor their picket lines and go on strike as well without a deal or Congressional action, and Biden’s voiced sympathy for the demands about sick time didn’t satisfy some of the union leaders Tuesday.\n\n“It is not enough to ‘share workers’ concerns,’” said a statement from the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division, which represents about 23,000 track maintenance workers, making it the third largest rail union. “A call to Congress to act immediately to pass legislation that adopts tentative agreements that exclude paid sick leave ignores the railroad workers’ concerns.”\n\nOther union officials also were critical of Biden’s move to impose the unpopular contracts. Asked by CNN if he felt Biden had let down unions and their members, Michael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, replied, “Yes, to some extent.”\n\n“We’re trying to address the issue here of sick time. It’s very important,” Baldwin told CNN Tuesday. “This action prevents us from reaching the end of our process, takes away the strength and ability that we have to force bargaining or force the railroads to…do the right thing.”\n\nBaldwin said the unions do not want to go on strike, but it’s the only way to win deals at the negotiating table that would have the support of rank-and-file members.\n\nHe said if there is a strike it would be the fault of railroad management, not the unions.\n\n“The railroads have the ability to fix this problem If they would come to the table and do that, we could move forward without Congressional action,” he said.\n\nHe said this is an issue that the rail unions have been seeking to address for decades, but it has received more attention from membership recently.\n\n“This became a glaring issue during the pandemic when we had members who were forced by their employers, the railroads, to stay home and quarantine without pay,” he said. “But really it comes down to simple things like the flu for a day or two, or a sick child, and the ability to take a day or two paid.”\n\nWhile the leadership of the unions were unhappy with Biden, some of the rank-and-file members were far more angry.\n\n“Joe Biden blew it. He had the opportunity to prove his labor-friendly pedigree to millions of workers by simply asking Congress for legislation to end the threat of a national strike on terms more favorable to workers,” said Hugh Sawyer, treasurer of the Railroad Workers United, a caucus of union activists that had been campaigned against ratification of the tentative labor deals. “Sadly, he could not bring himself to advocate for a lousy handful of sick days. The Democrats and Republicans are both pawns of big business and the corporations.”\n\nAny legislation to stop workers from going on strike needed to be passed with bipartisan support, though, so it’s not clear that an effort to impose a more labor-friendly contract would have been able to get the Republican votes it would need to pass the Senate.\n\nBusiness groups relieved\n\nWhile union leaders were attacking Biden, business groups were praising his call for Congressional action, saying a strike would be a serious blow to the economy by bringing 30% of the nation’s freight movements grinding to a halt.\n\nA strike, set for December 9, would snarled still-struggling supply chains and caused shortages and a spike in prices gasoline, food, automobiles and other goods, causing a body blow for the economy that many fear is already at risk of tipping into a recession. A week-long strike could cost the economy $1 billion, according to an estimate from Anderson Economic Group. The White House estimated that as many as 765,000 workers could temporarily be out of work within two weeks if the rail workers went on strike.\n\nMore than 400 business groups had joined Monday to plead with Congressional leaders on Monday for quick action. Several echoed those concerns Tuesday at a press conference organized by the Association of American Railroads, the industry’s trade group. They all praised Biden’s action, calling it appropriate.\n\n“Truly the only thing standing in the way of insuring the American economy doesn’t take a major hit is the United States Congress,” said Mike Sommers, CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying group for the oil industry that depends on rail shipments, who has clashed with Biden over high gasoline prices over the course of the last year.\n\nBiden and Democrats had been unwilling to block a strike in September when negotiations were nearing a previous strike deadline. As another strike deadline approaches, they felt there was no choice but to act.\n\nRailroads poised to get what they want\n\nBiden’s statement Monday night suggested that railroad strategy had worked.\n\n“During the ratification votes, the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, and Transportation have been in regular touch with labor leaders and management. They believe that there is no path to resolve the dispute at the bargaining table and have recommended that we seek Congressional action,” he said.\n\n“As a proud pro-labor President, I am reluctant to override the ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the agreement,” he said. “But in this case – where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families – I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal.”\n\nThe fact that Congress will move to impose the rejected tentative deals could be considered a limited victory for the unions: Congress could have instead voted to impose contracts that were worse off for the workers than the ones their members rejected.\n\nRepublicans in Congress who had introduced legislation before a September strike deadline to keep workers on the job were looking to impose a contract that would have been worse for union members, one based on recommendations of a panel that had been named this summer to try to reach a deal acceptable to both sides. The unions had been able to negotiate improvements in that proposal at the negotiating table in September.\n\nThe unions meanwhile are calling for Congress to include sick days in any contract imposed on the unions. They say that will be better for both workers and rail customers who have regularly complained over poor service that even the railroads admit is inadequate.\n\n“Passing legislation to adopt tentative agreements that exclude paid sick leave for railroad workers will not address rail service issues,” said the BMWED’s statement. “Rather, it will worsen supply chain issues and further sicken, infuriate, and disenfranchise railroad workers as they continue shouldering the burdens of the railroads’ mismanagement.”\n\nBut Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the only legislation that can get through a narrowly divided Congress in time to avert a strike is one that mirrors the rejected tentative agreements.\n\n“Some in Congress want to modify the deal to either improve it for labor or for management,” said Biden’s statement. “However well-intentioned, any changes would risk delay and a debilitating shutdown. The agreement was reached in good faith by both sides.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Matt Mcfarland", "Chris Isidore", "Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/business/railway-labor-act-freight-railroad-strike/index.html", "title": "How an arcane 96-year-old law stopped the rail strike | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nMost labor disputes never end up being debated in Congress. But thanks to a nearly century-old law that regulates labor relations only when it comes to railroads and airlines, what otherwise would be strictly an economic issue became a political one.\n\nThe Railway Labor Act was passed in 1926 as one of the very first labor laws in the nation. At that point most of the railroads already had been unionized, some all the way back to the mid-19th century. The structure was therefore set up to regulate labor negotiations between unions and management, rather than oversee organizing campaigns for new unions and additional members.\n\nBecause of the law, the House was able to vote Wednesday to impose unpopular contracts on four rail unions whose members have already rejected the terms, followed by a vote by the Senate vote late Thursday that did the same.\n\nThe measure now goes to President Joe Biden, who has said he will sign it. When he does, there will no longer be a chance of a Dec. 9 strike that would have shut down about 30% of the nation’s freight shipments. A prolonged strike would have caused shortage of a wide range of items, from food to gasoline to automobiles, and likely resulted in a spike in prices.\n\nA group of steam locomotives pour steam and smoke into the air in St. Paul, Minnesota in this file photo from 1925. The Railway Labor Act, passed in 1926, is the reason Congress could intervene this week to block a strike by freight railroad unions. Minnesota Historical Society/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe House also passed a law that would give the unions paid sick days, addressing the issue they said led members to reject the deals. But the efforts to pass that same measure in the Senate fell short, even though 52 of 95 senators voted for it. The measure needed 60 votes to pass the senate.\n\nUnder the Railway Labor Act, the federal agency that oversees railroad and airline labor relations is the National Mediation Board, which tries to bring the two sides together, and it set up a series of limits and cooling off periods during which unions can not strike and management can not lock out the workers. And if all those efforts fail, then Congress can step in and impose a contract under which both sides will have to operate.\n\nIn negotiations at other businesses, the workers’ ability to strike is the most powerful option unions have to achieve their goals at the bargaining table. And even the railroads admit that the law makes strikes extremely unlikely.\n\n“The goal of the Railway Labor Act was to reduce the likelihood of a work stoppage,” said Ian Jefferies, the CEO of the Association of American Railroads, the trade group that represents the railroads. “And it’s been remarkably effective in doing that.”\n\nAs much as management likes the law and its limits on strikes, the unions hate it. They say it would be far easier to reach a deal that their members can support if they had the leverage of a possible strike. And they say that management, when weighing the cost of that possible strike, would realize that they have the resources needed to meet those demands without an actual work stoppage.\n\nThe four major railroads — Union Pacific (UNP), CSX (CSX), Norfolk Southern (NSC) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA)’s Burlington Northern Santa Fe — reported some form of record profits in 2021. Wall Street analysts expect even better profits in 2022, at least for the three railroads they cover.\n\nIf they were covered by the National Labor Relations Act, the labor law that oversees worker-management relations at most of the nation’s businesses, the unions could threaten to go on strike. But under the Railway Labor Act, management can fall back on hopes that Congress will give them the deal it wants.\n\n“This action prevents us from reaching the end of our process, takes away the strength and ability that we have to force bargaining or force the railroads to…do the right thing,” said Michael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, one of the four unions whose members voted against the tentative agreements reached last fall that Congress is now poised to impose on members.\n\nThe railroads deny they wanted this to end up with Congress, and they preferred to reach a deal with the unions that could be ratified by membership.\n\n“I don’t think it’s anyone’s goal to get Congress involved, but Congress has shown a willingness historically to intervene if necessary,” said AAR’s Jefferies.\n\nBut Biden, in his statement calling on Congress to act to impose the rejected tentative agreements on the rail workers to keep them on the job, seemed to acknowledge that there was no chance that rail management would reach a deal with the unions.\n\n“During the ratification votes, the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, and Transportation have been in regular touch with labor leaders and management,” he said. “They believe that there is no path to resolve the dispute at the bargaining table.”\n\nThe railroads refused to accept union demands for paid sick days. Jefferies also said the railroads would only agree to make changes in sick day rules if it was within the “framework” of the proposal put forth by a presidential panel this summer that was charged with trying to find a compromise agreement.\n\nThat means for the unions to get the sick pay they wanted, they’d have to give up some other pay or benefit in order to keep the overall economics of the package unchanged. The likelihood that Congress will impose a deal along the lines of the presidential panel’s recommendations, or the tentative agreements, means that management has little incentive to agree to union demands.\n\nThe decision to urge Congress to take action was politically difficult for Biden, who is often referred to as the most pro-union president in recent history. When he served in the Senate, Biden voted against an earlier effort to impose a contract on the rail unions to keep them on the job.\n\n“As a proud pro-labor President, I am reluctant to override the ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the agreement,” he said in his statement Monday night calling for Congressional action.\n\nBut he said he couldn’t ignore the economic upheaval that a rail strike could cause, and that he had no choice but to turn to Congress and the powers it has.\n\n“In this case – where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families – I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal,” he said.\n\nAnd he said the deals, while they weren’t everything the unions wanted, were good ones for the unions, with the biggest pay increases in more than 50 years, and some improvements in other contract terms.\n\n“On the day that it was announced, labor leaders, business leaders, and elected officials all hailed it as a fair resolution of the dispute between the hard-working men and women of the rail freight unions and the companies in that industry,” Biden said. “The agreement was reached in good faith by both sides.”\n\nBut the unions and their allies say that it’s wrong to force members to accept a deal they rejected because it denies the workers the basic sick days they are demanding.\n\n“During the first three quarters of this year, the rail industry made a record-breaking $21.2 billion in profits,” said a group of a dozen Democratic senators, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders. “Guaranteeing seven paid sick days to rail workers would only cost the industry $321 million a year – less than 2 percent of their total profits. Please do not tell us that the rail industry cannot afford to guarantee paid sick days to their workers.”\n\nBut only 4 of the 12 senators who issued the statement - Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - voted against imposing the unpopular contracts. The other eight who signed onto the statement - Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Alex Padilla of California, Tina Smith of Minnesota and Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island - all joined in the 80-15 vote in favor of imposing the contracts to block the strike.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/10/16/gm-strike-uaw-auto-parts-shortage-dealerships-general-motors/3995914002/", "title": "UAW GM strike: Auto parts shortage looms as strike goes into week ...", "text": "MEMPHIS — Car dealers are leaning on General Motors managers to find spare auto parts as the strike slows the output of oil filters, valves, rings and other items mechanics rely on to maintain the 30 million-plus GM vehicles on the nation's roads.\n\nThe pipeline stretching from factories to technicians working on GM's Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands is far from dry, although car dealers and service managers report they regularly phone other dealers and salaried GM personnel in search of spare parts.\n\n\"We're starting to see parts in short supply,\" said Russ Clark, general manager at Cadillac of Knoxville. \"That’s where we're going to see it hurt most if the strike goes on for a couple of more weeks.”\n\nEven with the walkout stretching intoweek five, auto dealers remember this one isn't quite as dire at that long one 21 years ago. There's a reason. This isn't General Motors of yore.\n\n75,000 non-GM workers hit by strike\n\nOnce the largest corporation on the planet with more than 600,000 workers worldwide and more than 100 major factories in the United States, GM has been pared down to 33 U.S. plants. Rather than make the bulk of the components fashioned into a vehicle, GM has followed rivals such as Chrysler, Nissan and Toyota and now buys a large share of auto parts from independent suppliers.\n\nThat has lessened the impact of a strike on motorists taking their car to the service center for repairs. Independent plants making items such as filters and valves didn't send all the workers on the shop floor home when GM closed down. As a result, the pipeline of parts flowing into dealers such as Cadillac of Knoxville in Tennessee is less full, Clark said, but hasn't had time to empty out since the strike began.\n\nHow we ditched debt:Little splurges on the path to freedom\n\nWhat should you do?:You'll only get a small increase in Social Security benefits in 2020\n\nUnited Auto Workers union leaders in Detroit ordered the walkout against GM after the four-year labor contract expired, putting about 48,000 UAW members on strike beginning Sept. 16.\n\nLate Friday night, UAW made a proposal to GM executives it said, if accepted, would constitute a “tentative agreement,” according to a letter posted to the UAW website.\n\nThe sides are divided over health care costs, use of temporary workers, production in Mexico, pension issues, wage gains, the decision to close four U.S. car assembly plants and lower anticipated employment levels in plants making future electric cars.\n\nWhen GM production ceased, hundreds of independent factories slowed down and reassigned workers to maintenance tasks. As the strike went on, these independent suppliers gradually laid off workers:\n\nUAW Local 1853 President Tim Stannard estimates independent suppliers have idled about 2,500 autoworkers in Middle Tennessee factories that make parts used in engines and vehicles assembled at GM's complex outside Nashville at Spring Hill, Tennessee.\n\nIn Tennessee, GM employs about 5,000 workers at Spring Hill, including about 1,400 independent contractors, and nearly 200 workers at the Memphis distribution center. Most of these 5,200 workers are now idle.\n\nThroughout the nation, independent factories have laid off or reduced wages for 75,000 autoworkers, estimated Anderson Economic Group of East Lansing, Michigan.\n\nService techs pinched first\n\nAuto dealers had a substantial amount of new vehicles on car lots when the strike began and many have been continuously resupplied new autos that were in storage awaiting delivery. That leaves the service center as the first place on the car lot to feel the early pinch of idled assembly plants.\n\n\"We're already seeing the effects of the strike, but it's mostly in parts,\" said Brett Gilmore, general manager of Beaman Buick GMC in Nashville, adding \"we're not being hit quite as hard as the others.\"\n\nBeaman's parts warehouse, said to be the largest GM parts inventory of any dealer in the Southeastern U.S., has supplied the dealer's service technicians with necessary items, Gilmore said.\n\nIn Knoxville, Clark's dealership regularly phones other dealers, including dealers in neighboring cities, to locate a needed part or swap items. No consumer has missed repairs or maintenance. So far the shortage is just that, a shortage rather than a complete absence of necessary products, Clark said.\n\nIn the Memphis suburb of Southaven, Mississippi, Landers Buick GMC has resorted at times to another tactic. Landers officials phone GM salaried employees and alert them to looming shortages. These employees have included district and regional sales managers and executives responsible for replacement parts, a term known as aftermarket parts in the industry.\n\n\"So far the strike has not been a real issue for us but with time it could be,'’ said Randy Paton, Landers general manager. \"The only drawback we've had is the parts availability. We've been talking to (GM's) managers, the aftermarket guys, and they're pulling parts for us.\"\n\nGM salaried employees have combed through warehouses and engine plants, located needed items such as valves and rings, and immediately put the products into the distribution channel for delivery to the dealership. These channels are run by independent contractors not represented by the striking union.\n\n'Doesn't have the same feel'\n\nIn Knoxville, Clark compares this walkout to the last long GM strike, in 1998, and remembers the shortages back then seemed more burdensome for dealers.\n\n\"This one doesn’t have the same feel,\" Clark said. \"The inventory levels are good.”\n\nThat's largely because the network of auto parts manufacturers has been changed over two decades, analysts say. GM now relies on independent suppliers. Back then the company made far more of its own auto parts.\n\nUnder the present system, many independent suppliers continued output even after the strike began on Sept. 16. They waited to see if the strike would be short. As a result, more inventory has been available in the auto parts distribution pipeline going to the car dealers than was common two decades ago.\n\nWhat happened back then\n\nThat 1998 strike is widely considered the event that opened the way for GM to rework the supply chain into its present shape reliant on independent factories.\n\nDuring the 1990s, GM and the UAW tangled in 18 major strikes as the company relentlessly streamlined in search of lower operating costs. The strategy was driven by GM's market share falling to Japanese rivals. The 1998 strike was the longest of the decade.\n\nUAW members walked out at a pair of metal stamping plants that June in Flint, Michigan. The repercussions spread swiftly. Auto parts made at the Flint stamping plants were routinely shipped to 26 of GM's 29 vehicle assembly plants.\n\nShort of the Flint parts, assembly lines shut down and in turn almost all the 59 GM parts factories in the nation sent workers home. By mid July, about 200,000 GM employees were laid off. One of the few assembly plants spared was GM Spring Hill, then a self-contained division named Saturn Corp. It continued running.\n\nWhen the strike in Flint ended after 54 days, GM had lost more than $3 billion. GM executives in Detroit had sparked the strike. They had ordered important die machines' removal from one of the Flint stamping plants.\n\nAfter the strike, the UAW was regarded as too exhausted to stop GM's broad turnaround strategy. The company, founded in Flint on Sept. 16, 1908, aimed to engineer and make vehicles and engines and buy most of the parts. GM spun off its 100,000-employee auto parts empire in 1999 as a new corporation named Delphi. It also separately retired the Oldsmobile, Hummer, Pontiac and Saturn brands. It weathered a 2009 bankruptcy that slimmed it further. And it recruited a network of independent suppliers rivaling Delphi.\n\nSince then, Delphi has moved its head office from suburban Detroit to the United Kingdom, renamed itself Aptiv and spun off its powertrain and aftermarket business as an independent company named Delphi Technologies. Flint, meanwhile, has shrunk from a city of 80,000 GM employees in the 1960s to fewer than 10,000 GM workers currently.\n\nThe shrinking of the old GM auto-parts empire, once concentrated in the industrial North, helped spur on the automotive industry in Mexico and the Southeastern United States. Currently, 336 auto parts plants in Tennessee employ about 55,000 workers. Another 20,000 people are employed at the GM, Nissan and Volkswagen assembly plants and offices in Middle and East Tennessee.\n\nLast year, GM estimates, the company paid 203 vendors in Tennessee about $722 million for supplies.\n\nElaina Sauber of The Tennessean contributed to this article.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/business/railroad-union-negotiations/index.html", "title": "With a strike looming, railroad unions and management head back ...", "text": "New York CNN Buiness —\n\nWith a crippling freight rail strike looming in two weeks, leaders of four railroad unions and management of the major US freight railroads are due back at the negotiating table Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIt will be the first joint negotiating session for the four unions whose rank-and-file members rejected the five-year labor agreements similar to deals accepted by the eight other rail unions in recent months.\n\nThe latest no vote came from the largest union, the transportation division of the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail Transportation union, or SMART-TD, which represents 28,000 conductors, brakemen and other workers. About 51% of those members voted against the deal reached in a 20-hour bargaining session in September, just hours before a previous strike deadline.\n\n“A strike could be averted. The ball is back in the carriers’ hands at this point,” SMART-TD President Jeremy Ferguson told CNN Tuesday. “It will be a difficult process. We will do our best. We want to keep America moving.”\n\nA potentially damaging strike\n\nAll four unions whose members voted no on ratification are now set to go on strike at 12:01 am ET on December 9. The Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen moved its strike date back to that date on Tuesday so that the four unions could be in sync.\n\nIf any one of the unions goes on strike, it would be honored by all 12 unions, which would bring US freight rail service to a halt. That would be a big blow to still struggling supply chains and the US economy, since 30% of the nation’s freight, measured by weight and distance traveled, moves by rail.\n\nA prolonged strike could cause shortages and higher prices for goods such as gasoline, food and automobiles.\n\nWhy some unions didn’t ratify the deal\n\nThe rejected deals would have been the biggest raises in 50 years for union members. They include an immediate 14% raise with back pay dating to 2020, as well as pay raises totaling 24% during the four-year life of the contracts, which run through 2024. Union members also would receive cash bonuses of $1,000 a year.\n\nAll told, the backpay and bonuses would give union members an average payment of $11,000 per worker once the deal is ratified.\n\nBut it’s not the pay that has been the sticking point in the negotiations. It’s the work rules involving scheduling, staffing levels and the lack of paid sick time, which the tentative agreements do not include. That prompted opposition, even within the unions whose members narrowly voted to ratify.\n\n“Some of this vote I think wasn’t necessarily a referendum vote against the contract as much as it was against their employers,” said Ferguson. “Members aren’t necessarily voting on the money issues. It’s quality of life, and how they’re treated. When big corporations cut too deep and they expect everybody else to pick up the pace, it becomes intolerable. You don’t have family time, you don’t have time to get adequate rest.”\n\nHope for a deal\n\nThe railroads have expressed hope that they will be able to reach new deals that can be accepted by rank-and-file members.\n\n“There’s absolutely opportunities if a ratification fails the first time to sit down and come to additional agreements … and get the [tentative agreements] ratified,” Ian Jefferies of the Association of American Railroads, the industry trade group, said in an interview last week.\n\nJefferies said negotiated agreements would be the “best outcome” of the revived talks, but he added that if deals can’t be reached, the industry believes it can get quick, bi-partisan action from Congress to block or end a strike.\n\nPolitical intervention\n\n“I don’t think it’s anyone’s goal to get Congress involved, but Congress has shown a willingness historically to intervene if necessary,” Jefferies said. He pointed to comments from Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, who “made clear on CNN less than two weeks ago that Congress would need to intervene, in his opinion, if voluntary agreements weren’t reached,” he said.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden doesn’t have the authority at this point in the process to unilaterally order the railroad workers to stay on the job, as he did in July, he would need to sign off on any Congressional action for it to take effect.\n\nTuesday White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeated earlier White House comments that “a shutdown is unacceptable because of the harm it would inflict on jobs, families.” But she wouldn’t answer questions as to whether or not Biden is prepared to agree to Congressional action mandating a contract that workers find unacceptable.\n\n“We are asking the parties involved, to come together in good faith and resolve this,” she said, adding that “the President is directly involved” in discussions once again.\n\nThe unions don’t want Congress to intervene, arguing that only by retaining the option of a strike can unions have the leverage they need to win improvements in the contract language that will win approval of their membership.\n\n“There’s no movement at the table,” Michael Baldwin, the president of the signalmen’s union, told CNN Business Tuesday. “I don’t know where Congress is on the issue of intervening, but I think the railroads are banking on Congress preventing a strike.”\n\nBusiness groups are already calling on Congress to block a strike, but the unions are opposed to Congressional action, arguing the best way to reach a deal is to maintain the strike threat and put pressure on management to settle.\n\nFerguson said he has not had a chance to talk to anyone from the Labor Department since his union’s no vote was announced early Monday, but he expects to do so Tuesday.\n\n“We will see where it goes,” he said. “I know the White House is watching, I know everyone is paying attention so I’m sure it’s going to pick up steam as we move into next week.”\n\n– CNN’s Betsy Klein and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}]}

Instead of using the reserves to buffer a plummeting ruble, Russia will no longer be able to access the funds it keeps in US dollars.\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiledanother set of harsh measures against Russia, saying: “Putin chose this war.”\n\nThose sanctions include export blocks on technology, a centerpiece of Biden’s approach that he said would severely limit Russia’s ability to advance its military and aerospace sector.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said “this includes Russia-wide restrictions on semiconductors, telecommunication, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics and maritime technologies.”\n\nWashington also put sanctions on people it described as “corrupt billionaires” and their families who are close to the Kremlin.\n\nIt said it would cut off 13 major state-owned companies from raising money in the United States, including energy giant Gazprom and Sberbank, Russia’s largest financial institution.\n\nThe White House also vowed to sanction two dozen Belarusian individuals and companies, which include “two significant Belarusian state-owned banks, nine defense firms, and seven regime-connected officials and elites.”\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom imposed fresh sanctions on Russian banks Monday and said it had a “hit list” of oligarchs to be sanctioned, according to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.\n\nThe country will prevent Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, from clearing payments in Sterling.

He said in interviews with Australian media that Morrison’s account on the platform had been “taken over and rebranded.”\n\n“His account’s been hacked,” Paterson told the radio network 4BC on Monday, adding that Morrison’s account on the platform now redirects to one called “Australian Chinese New Life.” Paterson and Morrison are both members of the Liberal Party.\n\nWeChat is one of the most widely used social messaging apps in China. It counted roughly 1.2 billion monthly active users in 2020. The vast majority are based in China, analysts say, but it also has users elsewhere, and is popular among the Chinese diaspora.\n\nMorrison had 76,000 followers on his WeChat account, which he used to communicate with Chinese Australians.\n\nAccording to a WeChat notice dated January 5, “all business and functions” of Morrison’s account have been transferred to Australian Chinese New Life, an account the notice linked to a technology firm based in China’s Fujian province.\n\nTencent (TCEHY), the publicly traded company that owns WeChat, said there was no evidence Morrison’s account had been hacked, adding that ownership of the account was disputed.\n\n“The account in question was originally registered by a [Chinese] individual and was subsequently transferred to its current operator, a technology services company — and will be handled in accordance with our platform rules,” a media representative for Tencent told CNN Business. “Tencent is committed to upholding the integrity of our platform and the security of all users accounts, and we will continue to look into this matter further.”\n\nDuring another interview with Sky News Australia, Paterson said the government started having difficulty posting to Morrison’s account in mid-2021.\n\n“The government has directly appealed to WeChat to ask them to restore access,” he said, adding that “no response has been given to the government.”\n\nPaterson suggested that the removal ofMorrison’saccount could be connected to tensions between China and Australia. He speculated during one local interview on Monday that the timing could have been related to the prime minister’s discussions with world leaders at last year’s G7 summit “about the dangers of becoming overexposed to China and having leverage of China over you.”\n\nAsked about the account during a regular press conference in Beijing on Monday, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry of Affairs called it an “issue between Morrison and WeChat.”\n\n“The accusation of China’s interference is nothing but unfounded denigration and smear,” said spokesperson Zhao Lijian. “We never engage in and have no interest in foreign interference.”\n\nWeChat has been criticized by other Western governments in the past because of perceived ties to the Chinese government. The Trump administration, for example, tried to ban the app in the United States in 2020, alleging that it posed a national security risk because it collects user data that could be accessed by China’s ruling Communist Party. That attempt was blocked by US courts and never took effect.\n\nAt that time, Tencent emphasized that the international version of WeChat is separate from the Chinese app, which is also known as Weixin, and its website said that Tencent uses data “in strict accordance with applicable laws and regulations.”", "authors": ["Angus Watson Jill Disis Yong Xiong", "Angus Watson", "Jill Disis", "Yong Xiong"], "publish_date": "2022/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/03/20/new-zealand-bans-military-assault-rifles-after-massacre/3230544002/", "title": "New Zealand gun laws: Assault rifles banned after mosque shootings", "text": "New Zealand is banning all assault rifles, high-capacity magazines and military-style semi-automatic rifles in response to the nation's deadliest massacre in history, the country's prime minister announced Thursday.\n\nJacinda Ardern said the ban goes into effect immediately and would be followed by legislation next month. New Zealand's citizens should make arrangements to turn in weapons banned under the new laws, Ardern told the nation in a live television announcement.\n\n\"On March 15, the nation witnessed a terrorist attack that demonstrated the weakness of New Zealand's gun laws,\" Ardern said. \"The guns used in this attack had the power to shoot continuously. The times for the easy availability of these weapons must end. And today, they will.\"\n\nShe added, \"We just want the guns back. ... It's about all of us.

She also noted that gun ownership is \"a privilege and not a right\" in New Zealand.\n\nHer words were already being put into effect across the nation: The New Zealand government immediately began asking all owners of assault weapons or now-banned attachments to report them to the government in the next two days before turning them in.\n\nSince the attacks, Ardern has led a nation trying to grieve and work through the news of the killings, which, in total, rival the annual number of murders in New Zealand.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ardern had told New Zealand's Parliament that tough gun laws were coming. She also said she would deny the man responsible for the nation's worst terror attack in modern history the one thing he likely craved: fame.\n\n\"He is a terrorist, he is a criminal, he is an extremist, but he will, when I speak, be nameless, and to others I implore you: Speak the names of those who were lost rather than the name of the man who took them. He may have sought notoriety but we in New Zealand will give him nothing – not even his name.\"\n\nArdern opened her speech to lawmakers in New Zealand by using the Arabic greeting \"As-salamu alaykum.\" In English, this translates as \"Peace be upon you.\"\n\n\"You may have chosen us,\" Ardern said, the anger rising in her voice as she condemned the suspect in the attacks. \"But we utterly reject and condemn you.\"\n\nNew Zealand has fewer restrictions on rifles or shotguns than many countries. Handguns are more tightly controlled.\n\nAbout 1.5 million firearms are owned – legally and illegally – by civilians in New Zealand, according to police data tracked by GunPolicy.org, a website run in conjunction with the University of Sydney. This equates to about 30 firearms per 100 people. In the United States, the rate is approximately 120 firearms per 100 people, according to the site.\n\nAll gun owners in New Zealand must have a license, which they can get from age 16 (age 18 for semiautomatic weapons) but the weapon itself does not need to be registered with authorities, according to the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners, a New Zealand lobby group. Ardern said the suspect in Friday's attacks had a license and owned five guns. The majority of firearms owners in New Zealand are farmers or hunters.\n\nAccording to GunPolicy.org, New Zealand is among a handful of countries where police officers are routinely unarmed when they are on patrol.

Australia banned all semi-automatic weapons and restricted certain handguns. It offered to buy back prohibited firearms.\n\nA 2016 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that Australia hadn't had a fatal mass shooting – one in which five or more people are killed – since the 1996 shooting. In the 18 years prior to the new laws, there were 13.\n\nThe turning point for Britain came in 1996, when a man used a legally owned handgun to kill 16 young children and a teacher at a school in Dunblane, Scotland. In the aftermath, all private ownership of handguns was banned.\n\nSince then, there has been one mass shooting, in 2010, in Britain.\n\nThe death toll in the attack at the Al Noor and Linwood mosques rose to 50 people Saturday; victims range in age from 2 to over 60.\n\nServices for the victims were held at churches across the country Sunday, and people laid flowers at memorial sites.

But he was also partly protecting his own prospects ahead of a forthcoming federal election.\n\nThe Australian government has promoted vaccination as a way out of the pandemic – and more than 92% of people over the age of 16 are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\nAfter Sunday’s hearing the government cast Djokovic’s ejection as a triumph for ordinary Australians over non-citizens who try to flout the rules.\n\n“The idea that someone could come and not follow those rules was just not on,” Morrison told local radio Monday.\n\nBut some lawyers say the government’s decision to bar entry to someone who they fear might pose a risk sets a “dangerous precedent” by banning people because of their past comments or an assumption that they plan to cause trouble.\n\nMeanwhile, refugee advocates fear Djokovic’s departure will take the attention away from the people still living with consequences of the government’s immigration policies – the refugees inside the detention facility where he stayed.\n\nA superstar in detention\n\nAustralia was among the first countries to shut its borders in March 2020 as Covid spread.\n\nMany Australian citizens were locked out by flight caps on passengers, as a procession of celebrities somehow found a way in. As the countrystarted reopening in December, new rules were imposed requiring all new arrivals to be double vaccinated – unless they had a valid medical exemption.\n\nSo when Djokovic landed in Melbourne on January 5 and claimed he couldn’t be vaccinated due to a past Covid-19 infection, Australian Border Force officers were quick to act. Perhaps too quick, because days later a judge ruled the Serb hadn’t been given enough time to consult his lawyers and ordered his visa to be reinstated.\n\nUnder Australian law, medical exemptions are only given to people who can prove they’ve suffered anaphylaxis after a previous dose, or any component of a vaccine, or are significantly immunocompromised. Djovokic didn’t fit either category.\n\nOn Monday, after being freed from immigration detention, Djokovic started training for a shot at his 21st grand slam title. But his freedom was curtailed four days later when Immigration Minister Alex Hawke revoked his visa, putting the player back in detention.\n\nNovak Djokovic during a practice session ahead of the 2022 Australian Open at Melbourne Park on January 14. Daniel Pockett/Getty Images\n\nUltimately Djokovic’s case had nothing to do with whether he satisfied Australia’s Covid-19 entry requirements. Nor did it seem to be a problem that his travel declaration misstated his movements in the 14 days before his arrival in Australia.\n\nInstead the minister found he posed a risk to public health and order because, as a celebrity sportsman who had previously expressed opposition to vaccination, he could be seen as an “icon” for anti-vaxxers.\n\nAustralia is home to a small but determined anti-vaccine movement, which last year held protests across the country to demonstrate against the government’s vaccine program and pandemic measures.\n\nBut Greg Barns, a barrister and spokesperson for the Australian Lawyers Alliance, said the decision sets a “dangerous precedent” because the purpose of Djokovic’s visit was to play tennis – not to spread his views on Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n“Effectively, what the government is saying is that if you’re a high-profile person, and you have particular views with which the government disagrees … then the government reserves the right to either cancel your visa while you’re in the country or not grant a visa.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch judge rule against Novak Djokovic over visa appeal 02:46 - Source: CNN\n\nTough on borders\n\nWhen Djokovic’s visa was canceled on January 6 he found himself in unfamiliar surrounds – the first floor of Park Hotel, an immigration detention facility in central Melbourne.\n\nUntil the arrival of the world No.1 at the hotel, the plight of the men inside had generated little debate in the wider Australian public.\n\nBut Djokovic’s visa issue focused attention on Australia’s immigration policy – the same policy that’s kept some refugees and asylum seekers detained indefinitely.\n\n“I am worried that the spotlight will fade on the refugees and asylum seekers now that Djokovic has gone,” said Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch (HRW).\n\nPro-refugee protestors rally outside the Park Hotel, where Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic stayed. Sandra Sanders/Reuters\n\nThe men in Park Hotel didn’t have their visas canceled – they were never given a right to stay in Australia under the country’s policy of not allowing refugees who arrived by boat after July 2013 to ever settle in the country. Most were found to be refugees in need of protection.\n\nBut in a radio interview on Monday morning, it seemed the Prime Minister had already forgotten, or didn’t know why they were there.\n\n“I mean, it’s not clear that to my information that someone in that case is actually a refugee,” Morrison said, when asked about the men in Park Hotel. “They may have sought asylum and been found not to be a refugee and have chosen not to return.”\n\nPearson said Morrison’s comments were a “blatant lie.”\n\n“(He) should know better than anyone,” she said. “He’s a former immigration minister.”\n\nThe Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC) meanwhile said Morrison’s statement was “misleading and false.”\n\nFor more than a week, refugees detained inside the building have been speaking to international media about their plight, particularly Mehdi, an Iranian refugee held for more than eight years who turned 24 during Djokovic’s stay.\n\n“If I’m not a refugee, why would I endure such a difficult time as a child if I have the option to go back to where I came from? Even then, I’m not safe in detention either,” he tweeted Monday.\n\nThe Australian government says its policies are designed to save lives at sea by stopping traffickers from undertaking the dangerous journey with desperate human cargo.\n\nBut it’s not just refugees who lawyers worry are at risk. Other permanent and temporary visa holders can have their visa canceled and are subject to mandatory detention before being removed. For stateless people with nowhere to go, it can mean indefinite detention.\n\nAccording to government figures, 946 visas were canceled in the 2020-21 financial year, under provisions that allow the government to cancel visas on character grounds – namely if the visa holder has committed a crime.\n\nMost people removed during that period were from New Zealand and the United Kingdom after convictions for drug offenses.\n\nBut visas can also be canceled if the government suspects that a person could engage in criminal conduct if allowed to enter. In Djokovic’s case, the government thought his mere presence could encourage anti-vax protests.\n\nThe ASRC, the Visa Cancellation Working Group, and the Refugee Advice and Casework Service are calling for an urgent inquiry into visa cancellations – saying the laws make it too easy for government ministers to intervene and don’t give people enough power to challenge the decision in court.\n\n“There are a whole range of different powers under which the government can cancel people’s visas,” said Graydon. “And the lack of consistency in exercising those powers is against the public interest that these powers are supposed to be about serving.”\n\n“Even if people are successful in having their visas reinstated, it can then be undone through ministerial discretion,” she said. “The laws have been structured to amplify executive power at the expense of parliamentary scrutiny and judicial scrutiny of decision making.”", "authors": ["Hilary Whiteman"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/957026/the-pros-and-cons-of-a-total-smoking-ban", "title": "The pros and cons of a total smoking ban | The Week", "text": "Rishi Sunak's plans to phase out the sale of cigarettes appears to have gained cross-party backing, making a total smoking ban in the UK a real possibility.\n\nThe prime minister used his Conservative Party conference speech to announce plans to raise the age at which people can buy tobacco in England year by year until it applies to the whole population.

Tobacco smoke can cause cancer, stroke and heart disease, with smoking-related illnesses costing the NHS £17 billion a year, according to campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (ASH).\n\nAn independent government-commissioned review, which last year recommended proposals similar to those announced by Sunak, argued that tackling tobacco use and supporting smokers to quit would help prevent 15 types of cancer – including lung cancer, throat cancer and acute myeloid leukaemia. Recent data showed that one in four deaths from all cancers were estimated to be from smoking.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's \"Today\" programme, the prime minister said his proposals represented the \"biggest public health intervention in a generation\", a claim backed up by England's chief medical officer, Sir Chris Whitty, who stressed how beneficial the health improvements would be.\n\nCon: black markets\n\nSimon Clark, of smokers' lobby group Forest, told the BBC that \"creeping prohibition won't stop young adults smoking\" but it will \"simply drive the sale of tobacco underground and consumers will buy cigarettes on the black market where no-one pays tax and products are completely unregulated\".\n\nThe illicit trade in tobacco products \"poses major health, economic and security concerns around the world\", according to the World Health Organization, which estimates 1 in every 10 cigarettes and tobacco products consumed globally is illicit.\n\nWriting for The Conversation, Dr Brendan Gogarty, of the University of Tasmania, argued that \"laws that rely on prohibition to reduce the prevalence and harm from drugs generally fail to achieve their aims\".\n\nPro: avoiding poverty\n\nSmoking causes a disproportionate burden on the most disadvantaged families and communities, last year's independent review found. The average smoker in the North East of England spends over 10% of their income on tobacco, compared to just over 6% in the South East.\n\nThis mirrors research from 2015 conducted by University of Nottingham, which found parents who smoke were \"plunging nearly half a million children into poverty\", The Independent reported.\n\nAs smokers quit, said Sudyumna Dahal for The Conversation, household budgets \"become easier, facilitating what a study in the British Medical Journal describes as an income transfer from male smokers to females and other family members\".\n\nTherefore, argue anti-smoking campaigners, banning smoking would bring greater benefits to the less well-off.\n\nCon: risk to civil liberties\n\nSmokers and the groups who advocate on their behalf argue that their habit is a civil right, even if it kills the smoker. In a report published in 2019, the smokers’ group Forest argued that \"smokers are the canaries for civil liberties\".\n\nIt added that the call for a ban \"directly violates the harm principle that assumes a person has autonomy over their own life and body as long as they do not hurt other people\".\n\nAs The Spectator editor Fraser Nelson pointed out on Twitter, plans to phase out the sale of cigarettes could lead to the absurd situation where pensioners will have to produce ID to prove which side of the ever-moving line of legality they are on.\n\n\"I'd love to live in a smoke-free world,\" wrote Rachael Bletchly in the Daily Mirror. \"I wish people would stop wrecking their health with cigarettes. But I don't think it's the job of politicians to police other grown-ups' filthy habits. And I fear that Rishi Sunak's new smoking ban is just well-meaning, populist puff.\"\n\nPro: environmental protection\n\nCigarette smoking has several negative environmental impacts and banning smoking would bring these to an end. Smokers release pollution into the atmosphere, cigarette butts litter the environment, and the toxic chemicals in the residues cause soil and water pollution.\n\nTobacco is commonly planted in rainforest areas and has contributed to major deforestation, said Conserve Energy Future.\n\nA 2013 report in the journal Tobacco Control found that cigarette manufacturing “consumes scarce resources in growing, curing, rolling, flavouring, packaging, transport, advertising and legal defence” and “also causes harms from massive pesticide use”.\n\nCon: losing tax revenue\n\nTaxation on smoking raises more than £8.8 billion per year for the Treasury, noted Politics.co.uk. The TaxPayers’ Alliance rejected the argument that smokers also cost the taxman more due to their health burden, arguing that smokers who suffer major health problems are more likely to die prematurely, reducing expenditure on state pensions and other age-related benefits.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Nick Foulkes", "Simon Mills", "Bill Prince", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Former President Donald Trump announces a White House bid for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign.

Australia’s federal court is a higher body than the court Kelly presided over.\n\n“Today I exercised my power under section 133C(3) of the Migration Act to cancel the visa held by Mr Novak Djokovic on health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so,” said Hawke in a statement earlier on Friday.\n\n“In making this decision, I carefully considered information provided to me by the Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Border Force (ABF) and Mr Djokovic. The Morrison Government is firmly committed to protecting Australia’s borders, particularly in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic.”\n\nThe decision comes four days after judge Kelly ruled that Australian Border Force (ABF) officers had been “unreasonable” when they canceled his initial visa to enter Australia on his arrival in the country on January 5. The judge ordered Djokovic be freed from immigration detention within 30 minutes.\n\nThe second cancellation is the latest twist in a saga that has garnered global headlines and put Australia’s Covid and immigration policies under scrutiny.\n\nUnder current Australian laws, all international arrivals are required to be vaccinated against Covid-19 – which Djokovic is not – unless they have a medical exemption.\n\nDjokovic said he was under the impression he could enter because two independent panels associated with Tennis Australia and the Victorian state government had granted him an exemption on the grounds that he had been infected with Covid-19 in December.\n\nThe federal government argued that, under its rules, previous infection with Covid-19 is not a valid reason for an exemption.\n\nDespite Monday’s ruling, the immigration minister retained ministerial power to personally intervene in the case and ultimately had the final say as to whether Djokovic would be allowed to stay, though his decision can be appealed.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge noted that if Djokovic had been deported, he would have been banned from Australia for three years. However this can be waived in special circumstances.\n\nMinister for Immigration Alex Hawke used his executive powers to cancel Djokovic's visa. Mick Tsikas/AP\n\nAustralia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the minister’s decision to cancel Djokovic’s visa protected “sacrifices” Australian had made throughout the pandemic.\n\nIn a statement, Morrison said the “pandemic has been incredibly difficult for every Australian but we have stuck together and saved lives and livelihoods.”\n\n“Australians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected,” he said. “This is what the minister is doing in taking this action today.”\n\nDjokovic to be detained\n\nDjokovic will be interviewed by the ABF at 8 a.m. local time on Saturday (Friday 4 p.m. ET) at an undisclosed location “agreed between the parties” in the case.\n\nAt that point, Djokovic will be officially detained by two border force officials and escorted to his lawyers’ office while his case is heard in the federal court.\n\nThe location where Djokovic will be met by border officials will remain secret in order to keep the tennis star safe and prevent “a media circus.”\n\n“We have a genuine concern about security and a potential media circus,” Djokovic’s barrister Nick Wood told the court when imploring Judge Kelly to allow Djokovic to be handed over to border officials in private.\n\nDjokovic practices ahead of the Australian Open on January 14. Daniel Pockett/Getty Images\n\nNovak Djokovic v Minister for Immigration, as the case file is known, was officially transferred from the Federal Circuit Court to the Federal Court of Australia on Friday.\n\nWood told the federal circuit court that Hawke had used his personal power to cancel Djokovic’s visa based on grounds he would “excite anti-vax sentiment” should he remain in Australia, describing it as a “radically different approach” in the government’s argument.\n\nHow it came to this\n\nDjokovic arrived in Melbourne on January 5 and promptly had his visa canceled for entering the country without a valid reason why he couldn’t be vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\nHe spent several nights in a detention hotel in Melbourne, which also houses dozens of refugees – some of whom have been held in immigration detention for more than eight years.\n\nHis lawyers challenged the decision and won the legal battle on Monday, but since then questions have emerged over Djokovic’s behavior after testing positive for Covid-19 on December 16.\n\nIn a statement published to social media on Wednesday, Djokovic acknowledged he did not immediately isolate after receiving a positive diagnosis – but denied knowing he had the virus when attending several public events.\n\nHe also apologized for apparently false information on his Australia visa declaration, specifically that he hadn’t traveled in the 14 days before his arrival in the country. Photos taken during that period appear to show him in both Spain and Serbia.\n\nDjokovic said a member of his support staff submitted the information and the omission had been “human error.”\n\nIn the statement, Djokovic also admitted doing an interview and photo shoot with a French sports newspaper while Covid positive, which he conceded was an “error of judgment.”\n\nThe visa dispute and decision whether to allow Djokovic – who has previously voiced opposition to Covid-19 vaccines and vaccine mandates – into the country comes at a time when Covid-19 case numbers are soaring.\n\nOn Friday, the state of Victoria – home to Melbourne where the Australian Open is being held – reported 34,836 cases, with a record 976 people hospitalized with Covid-19. This week the country surpassed one million cases over the entire pandemic.\n\nWhat could come next\n\nMaria Jockel, legal principal of BDO Migration Services, said Djokovic’s lawyers will have 28 days to make representations to the minister, stating why he should reverse his decision.\n\nDespite his visa being canceled once again, experts say it is still possible Djokovic could be released on another visa to contest the Australian Open.\n\n“If there’s an incredible outcry about having the world’s No. 1 tennis player in detention whilst the Australian Open is on, maybe the government would relent and let him out on a bridging visa,” said Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary with the immigration department.\n\nA bridging visa would allow Djokovic to work – or, in this case, play – but the political repercussions of that decision are unclear as it would seem to contradict the message that Djokovic poses a health risk to the Australian people.\n\nVictorian Premier Daniel Andrews said earlier Friday the issue had a simple solution: “Just get vaccinated.”\n\n“That is the key … That’s what I say to every single Victorian. That’s what I’ve done. That’s what my kids have done,” he said, adding the Australian Open was bigger than one player and the issue far bigger than one person.", "authors": ["Helen Regan Hilary Whiteman Hannah Ritchie", "Helen Regan", "Hilary Whiteman", "Hannah Ritchie"], "publish_date": "2022/01/14"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/957910/what-will-king-charles-mean-for-the-commonwealth", "title": "What will King Charles mean for the future of the Commonwealth ...", "text": "Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has changed his mind and said there will not be a referendum on whether his country should become a republic and replace King Charles III as head of state.\n\nAlbanese, a staunch republican, said he would not “pursue questions” of constitutional change unless he was re-elected, out of “deep respect and admiration” for the Queen.

It has been hailed as the Queen’s defining legacy but others argue it is a remnant and reminder of Britain’s colonial past.\n\nWhat did the papers say?\n\n“If it hadn’t been for the personal efforts of Her Majesty the Queen, it seems inconceivable that the Commonwealth of Nations would exist today,” said The Telegraph.\n\n“She sat at the heart of the organisation, and its disparate and far-flung members united around her,” argued the paper, and now she is gone it will “face a reckoning”, said The Guardian.\n\nSpeaking on CNN, royal historian Kate Williams said she expected the Commonwealth to “fragment” under King Charles as many countries vote to become republics and others look to form new alliances away from Britain’s orbit.\n\nMaintaining the widely disparate group of countries that make up the Commonwealth is perhaps Charles’ biggest challenge as monarch.\n\nOn Saturday, he met Commonwealth leaders at Buckingham Palace, “signalling the start of his own relationship with the organisation ‘cherished’ by the Queen but which could see major challenges during his reign”, said the i news site.\n\nPhilip Murphy, professor of British and Commonwealth history at the University of London, told the site: “I think it’s very important for the Palace to signal that King Charles is King of the Commonwealth Realm and separately head of the Commonwealth.”\n\nIt should be stressed that “despite its ties to the British Empire, any country can join the modern Commonwealth, and other countries without any links from the colonial past have recently been admitted, such as Rwanda and Mozambique”, said ABC News.Gabon and Togo have joined the Commonwealth this year.\n\nAs ABC News pointed out, 36 member countries are republics, while five – Brunei, Lesotho, Malaysia, Eswatini and Tonga – have their own monarchs.\n\n“Republicanism comes and goes,” noted historian Andrew Roberts in the Daily Mail. “It became an issue in Canada during the 1960s and 1970s, in Australia in the 1990s, and as a result of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Windrush scandal and the slavery reparations issue, it is presently one in the Caribbean.”\n\nYet, he said, “I see nothing inevitable about the demise of the Crown Commonwealth”, describing it as “a bulwark of freedom in an increasingly dangerous world”.\n\nWhat next?\n\nMost agree the biggest threat to the future of the Commonwealth comes from the Caribbean, which accounts for more than half the countries in the world that still have the British monarch as head of state.\n\nNewsweek reported that King Charles “could be bracing for a Commonwealth crisis” in the region after the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Gaston Browne, announced plans to hold a referendum within three years on whether to become a republic.\n\n“It does not represent any form of disrespect to the monarch,” Browne said. “This is not an act of hostility, or any difference between Antigua and Barbuda and the monarchy. It is a final step to complete the circle of independence to become a truly sovereign nation.”\n\nLast year Barbados became the first country in almost 30 years to break with the crown and become a republic. There are reports that Jamaica will look to follow suit and hold its own referendum as soon as 2025.\n\nOn Friday, the front-page story on one of Jamaica’s leading newspapers, the Gleaner, claimed the Queen’s death would “make Jamaica’s break with monarchy easier”.\n\nYet Barbados remains part of the Commonwealth and it is highly unlikely other countries that become republics would look to leave the organisation, at least in the immediate future.\n\nFor its part, the Commonwealth of Nations has attempted to modernise and make itself more democratic, for example by declaring that its head is not a hereditary role. However, Charles was still chosen as its leader in 2018, “which has made some countries uncomfortable”, said The Guardian.\n\nDespite this, Professor Murphy believes the Commonwealth will carry on in its present form during King Charles’ reign.\n\n“It serves sufficient marginal purposes, it’s not worth the bother of trying to close down,” he said.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Rebekah Evans", "Austin Chen", "Sorcha Bradley"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}]}

Bookies said Yousaf is the clear favourite to win the leadership race, which was “kick-started” last month when Nicola Sturgeon “stunned the political world” by announcing her sudden resignation after more than eight years in the top job in Scottish politics, said the Daily Record.\n\nThe SNP: on the verge of collapse?\n\n2. Israel protests escalate\n\nPolice and soldiers in Jerusalem used water cannons against demonstrators as tens of thousands took to the streets across Israel after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defence minister Yoav Gallant. Demonstrators blocked Tel Aviv’s main road, “transforming the Ayalon highway into a sea of blue-and-white Israeli flags”, said The Guardian. Gallant had spoken out against controversial plans to overhaul the justice system. A Haaretz columnist said Netanyahu is “now pyromaniac-in-chief” of a “government of arsonists”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Braverman accusations\n\nSuella Braverman is a “sock puppet” under the influence of Tory right-wingers who believe that Rishi Sunak has not gone far enough to clamp down on Channel crossings, senior government sources have told The Times. The home secretary is accused of secretly backing a backbench rebellion against her own Illegal Migration Bill to force Sunak into toughening up measures to tackle the small boats crisis. The source said she wants to “spook us” to offer concessions to get them to drop their amendments because “a big rebellion would be embarrassing”.\n\nStop the boats: will immigration define the next election?\n\n4. Oil incident in Poole\n\nA major incident has been declared after around 200 barrels of reservoir fluid including oil leaked into the water at Poole Harbour, Dorset. Members of the public were urged not to swim at the site or its surrounding area until further notice. Perenco, a gas company, said a “small” amount of the fluid escaped from its pipeline and that, as of late Sunday evening, some of it had already been recovered. Poole is a Site of Special Scientific Interest which is home to a variety of wading birds, said the BBC.\n\n5. Long Covid ‘risks new inequality’\n\nTwo-thirds of workers with long Covid have faced unfair treatment in the UK, according to a new report. The government must act to ensure long Covid sufferers receive the support they need from employers, said the TUC and the charity Long Covid Support, or it will risk creating “new, long-lasting inequalities”. In the analysis based, on responses from more than 3,000 long Covid sufferers, people report harassment, not being believed about symptoms or threatened with disciplinary action. One in seven said they had lost their job.\n\nLong Covid: how to treat it and who is at risk\n\n6. Two boats sink in Tunisia\n\nOfficials say at least 29 migrants have died after at least two boats sank off Tunisia’s coast within hours of each other. The incident is the latest in a “string” of migrant boat capsizes off Tunisia’s coast in the last few days, said the BBC, with five others sinking in the past four days. The coast near the southern city of Sfax has become a “major departure point for people fleeing poverty and conflict in Africa and the Middle East in the hope of a better life in Europe”, said Al Jazeera.\n\n7. Concern over NHS shortages\n\nNHS staff shortages in England could exceed 570,000 by 2036, a leaked document has warned. The 107-page internal document says the health service needs a massive injection of homegrown doctors, nurses, GPs and dentists to avert a recruitment crisis. It is already operating with 154,000 fewer full-time staff than it needs, and that number could “balloon” to 571,000 staff by 2036 on current trends. However, Jeremy Hunt is playing a “key role” in moves to “water down” NHS England’s proposals to increase staff, claimed The Guardian.\n\n8. ‘Appalling’ sewage figures due\n\nOfficial data will show raw sewage was dumped into rivers and coastal areas across England more than 300,000 times last year, forecast The Times. Data due from the Environment Agency on Friday is expected to show that the number of times sewage pollution was spilt from storm overflows reduced by almost a fifth in 2022 from the year before but the total of 300,953 has been labelled “appalling” by campaigners. It is equivalent to 824 spills a day. Feargal Sharkey, the singer-turned- activist said there must be a “full flush” and “total restructuring of the industry”.\n\n9. Oxford rower taken to hospital\n\nCambridge’s men won the Boat Race, holding off a “late charge” from Oxford on “choppy waters” to win by just over a length for their fourth victory in the past five races, said the BBC. Oxford rower Felix Drinkall was taken to hospital in an ambulance after collapsing at the end of the race. Cambridge’s celebrations were “understandably subdued” as a result of the incident, with spectators concerned over Drinkall’s condition, said the Daily Mirror.\n\n10. University Challenge ‘rigged’ for Oxbridge\n\nA professor at University College London has accused the BBC of “rigging” University Challenge in favour of Oxbridge by allowing each college to enter separately. “Each of the 70-plus Oxbridge colleges, even those with only 300 or 400 students, is allowed to compete in University Challenge, but huge civic universities like Manchester and Birmingham with upwards of 40,000 students are allowed only one entry each,” wrote Frank Coffield. A BBC spokesman said: “All education institutions that design and deliver teaching towards university-level qualifications are welcome to apply to University Challenge independently”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Peter Weber", "Harold Maass", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/960272/netanyahu-brings-israel-to-a-crossroads", "title": "Netanyahu brings Israel to a crossroads | The Week", "text": "Has Benjamin Netanyahu finally lost his touch, asked Anshel Pfeffer in Foreign Policy. For 12 weeks now, the great survivor of Israeli politics has fought an escalating battle with protesters.\n\nThis week, the prime minister admitted defeat – temporarily, at least. When he returned to power at the head of a hard-right coalition government in December, Netanyahu had immediately launched an ambitious plan to weaken the powers of Israel’s supreme court.\n\nIn response, hundreds of thousands of liberal Israelis took to the streets, protesting weekly against what they saw as a naked “power grab” – and an attempt by Netanyahu “to wriggle out of his ongoing trial for alleged bribery and fraud”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Citing the threat to national security, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant called for the legislation to be put on hold.\n\nOn Sunday, he was fired by Netanyahu. A nationwide strike followed, which shut down swathes of the economy.\n\n‘Legitimate to seek to rein it in’\n\nUltimately, Israel’s “key institutions” sided with the protesters, and Netanyahu was forced to pause the legislation: he said he’d take “a timeout for dialogue”.\n\nThe Right in Israel has had the supreme court in its sights for decades, said Haviv Rettig Gur in The Times of Israel.

And when this current coalition, not dependent on any centrist or leftist faction, came to power, the Right believed its time had come. But the government drastically overplayed its hand.\n\nThere was “no debate, engagement or negotiation”. Protests were dismissed as the griping of the “old elites”.\n\n‘Attempting to politicise the judiciary’\n\nBy the time ministers had realised their mistake, “it was too late”. Netanyahu may have retreated, said Haaretz. But the protesters must not “let up the pressure until the legislation is scrapped”.\n\nWe should recognise this law for what it is: an attempt to politicise the judiciary and scrap a crucial check on the power of government. It is designed to erode the rule of law and “destroy” Israeli democracy.\n\nThis is a dispute about a fundamental issue, said David Friedman in The Jerusalem Post – “what it means to be a Jewish state”.\n\nIt reflects the growing power of ultra-Orthodox Israelis, who have become “a major demographic and political force”, controlling about 15% of the Israeli parliament and exerting great influence in coalition negotiations.\n\nRanged against them is the secular Left, which largely built modern Israel; it no longer commands a majority, but has retained a strong influence through institutions such as the supreme court. Israel is “divided as never before”.\n\nSensible people are talking openly “about the risks of a civil war”. We must pray that the nation steps back from the brink.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "Rebekah Evans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/03/31"}]}

Before running for public office, she served as a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, the largest American LGBTQ advocacy group.\n\nState Attorney General Kathy Jennings first met McBride in 2013 when she was fresh out of school and testifying before the state senate in support of the Gender Identity Non-Discrimination Act.\n\nJennings, who was one of the first people to endorse McBride last summer, said her testimony was a major reason the legislation passed in 2013. She remembers putting her arm around McBride and telling her she was “really going places” after watching her address the state senate.\n\n“It was obvious she was a leader from the very beginning,” Jennings said. “When she became a Delaware senator, she started immediately swinging for the fences . . . but I became convinced that if anyone could do it in the entire legislature, it was Sarah McBride.”\n\nWhile in office, McBride took on big issues in the state senate, pushing successful legislation to guarantee paid family leave, expand health care affordability, and increase gun safety.\n\nDonyale Hall, one of McBride's Republican opponents who lost the primary to Whalen Tuesday, told USA TODAY she would support measures expanding school choice and blocking transgender students from participating in girls sports.\n\nJennings said McBride developed a reputation as a “peacemaker” by working across the aisle in the state senate. But Hall disputes that reputation, citing Democrats' majority in both state legislative chambers.\n\n\"Senator McBride touts how all this legislation that has been going through the General Assembly has all this bipartisan support,\" Hall said. \"These bills, quite frankly, don't have bipartisan support, because they can pass them all by themselves, and they're not representing the best interests of the people.\"\n\nPlans for bipartisanship\n\nStill, McBride says she wants to apply her skills as a unifier to a Congress currently experiencing one of the most divided and least productive sessions in history.\n\nVirginia State Sen. Danica Roem, who became the first transgender person elected to any state legislature in 2017, said she has developed a supportive friendship with McBride over the years. Roem applauded McBride's ability to introduce successful bipartisan legislation even as a freshman state senator.\n\nBut she warned McBride may face some hostility as well.\n\n\"People who go to Washington, D.C. for the objective of being on television and 'driving the conversation' without ever passing legislation of their own will hate her. They'll be terrible to her,\" Roem said. \"People who are there to legislate and pass bills — those will be the people she will gravitate toward... They're going to find out really quickly that she's a trans woman and, not but, and she's a two-term state legislator who passed a lot of bills by working across the aisle and getting things done.\"\n\nMcBride pointed to her record in Delaware as proof of her ability to listen and work with Republicans, but whether she will be able to bridge partisan divides in a deeply polarized US House of Representatives remains to be seen.\n\nMcBride continues to have a friend in Roem, who described a time when she called McBride to express her support for her campaign.\n\n\"I told her, 'I did my historic first.' I told her, 'This is your time,' \" Roem said.\n\nRachel Barber is a 2024 election fellow at USA TODAY, focusing on politics and education.

All 435 House seats are up for election this year, and a handful of close matchups could make or break which party winds up with the majority. Republicans are vying to keep control of the lower chamber, while Democrats hope to flip enough seats to take over.\n\nThere are about two dozen tossup House races, where either party could come away with the win regardless of incumbency, according to Cook Political Report. High-profile lawmakers including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have already won-reelection.\n\nPresidential election live coverage:Latest updates on Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris\n\nMeanwhile in the Senate, Election Day started with 34 seats up for grabs.

We asked\n\nDemocrats currently hold the majority with 51 seats in the upper chamber, which includes four independent senators who caucus with them. Republicans only needed to regain control of two seats to flip the Senate, and they were able to pull that off with Jim Justice's victory in West Virginia and Bernie Moreno's victory in Ohio.\n\nTwo targets where Democrats fell short on Tuesday in their bid to flip Republican-held Senate seats: Florida and Texas, where GOP Sens. Rick Scott and Ted Cruz won new terms.\n\nTuesday's election has also made history. Sarah McBride will be the first openly transgender member of Congress after winning election in Delaware’s sole congressional district. And for the first time, the Senate will have two Black women with Sen.-elect Lisa Blunt Rochester representing Delaware and Sen.-elect Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland.\n\nFollow along with USA TODAY for full coverage.\n\nTrump praises Senate wins, Speaker Mike Johnson\n\nFormer President Donald Trump praised Senate Republicans for retaking the upper chamber Tuesday night, and expressed his support for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who plans to run to retain his leadership role during an internal election next week.\n\nJohnson is expected to face leadership challenges if Republicans lose the House, and it is unclear if challengers will emerge if Republicans keep the House. But Trump has been supportive of the speaker in public.\n\n\"I think he's done a terrific job,\" Trump said of Johnson early Wednesday morning.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nTop House Republicans congratulating Trump on likely victory\n\nHouse GOP leaders are congratulating former President Donald Trump for winning the presidential election -- though leading analysts including the Associated Press have not yet called the race in his favor.\n\nFox News called the race in Trump's favor and The New York Times is projecting wins for Trump in key swing states.\n\n\"With President Trump back in the White House, there is no obstacle too great and no challenge too difficult,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement.\n\nGOP Whip Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., congratulated Trump on a \"hard-fought campaign and a well-deserved victory,\" and GOP conference chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said Americans \"are witnessing the greatest comeback of all.\"\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nRep. Gabriel Vasquez beats Republican challenger Yvette Herrell\n\nRep. Gabriel Vasquez, D-N.M., won a second consecutive term representing New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District.\n\nVasquez and Herrell’s race had been labeled a tossup by Cook Political Report heading into Election Day. It was also the second time the pair had faced off in the southwestern district.\n\nHerrell served two years in the House but lost her bid for reelection in 2022 to Vasquez by less than a point.\n\nNew Mexico’s 2nd District, a largely rural area, has frequently swung from red to blue each election. Both parties had watched the race this year as a potential victory.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nEmbattled Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar keeps seat in Congress\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, will continue his career in Congress, winning an 11th term while facing over a dozen counts of money laundering, bribery and conspiracy charges.\n\nCuellar and his wife were indicted in May, accused of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign bribes. Cuellar also faces allegations of corruption, trying to influence U.S. foreign policy in exchange for the money.\n\nDespite his legal woes, the long-serving Texas politician was successful in his bid for reelection, defeating Republican challenger and navy veteran Jay Furman.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi wins 20th term in 11th District\n\nA powerhouse figure in Congress for four decades, Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. was reelected to a 20th term.\n\nPelosi represents the 11th District, which includes most of San Francisco. She is the first and only woman to serve as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. In 2022, she announced she would step down from the leadership role to make way for a speaker from a new generation. The decision came weeks after a violent attack on her husband, Paul.\n\nPelosi easily won her district’s nonpartisan primary in March and defeated her Republican challenger, Bruce Lou, in the general election.\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\nZach Nunn wins reelection over Democrat challenger in Iowa\n\nRep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, won a second term representing Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, beating Democratic challenger Lanon Baccam.\n\nNunn’s was one of two tossup House races in the state. The Republican and sixth-generation Iowan first took office after ousting former Rep. Cindy Axne, a Democrat.\n\nWith Nunn winning the district, which includes the capital of Des Moines, Republicans add to their chances of keeping House majority for another two years.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nDemocrats win one of the nations most expensive House races\n\nDemocrat Josh Riley defeated Rep. Marc Molinaro’s, R-N.Y., bid for a second term, winning one of the nation’s most expensive House races.\n\nBetween the candidates and outside fundraising groups, Riley and Molinaro’s rematch race had cost more than $38 million as of November.\n\nTheir southern New York contest was one of a handful seen by Democrats as a potential flip opportunity.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nExpect a long wait for House results\n\nWe know the Senate will be controlled by Republicans, but don’t expect a verdict on the House any time soon.\n\nOf 22 “toss up” races (as graded by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report) only one has been called by the Associated Press as of 1:15 a.m. ET.\n\nThere has been only one upset so far in the 69 races viewed as competitive.\n\nSeveral of the most competitive races that will determine control of the House are in California and other western states where polls closed late in the evening for those following from the east coast.\n\nThe House is narrowly divided: Republicans currently control the chamber 220-212. Either party needs to get 218 seats to win the majority.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nThune, Cornyn weigh in on Republicans’ Senate win\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, touted his party’s success in taking control of the Senate, saying in a statement he is “confident our new conservative majority can restore our institution to the essential role it serves in our constitutional republic.”\n\nCornyn has said he plans to run for Senate Majority Leader, replacing Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York. He will face a tight competition with South Dakota’s John Thune, who also released a statement following the GOP’s success Tuesday.\n\n“Tonight, with Republicans reclaiming majority control of the U.S. Senate, we can begin to turn the page on this expensive and reckless chapter of American history,” Thune said. “As we wait for additional results, I am optimistic that President Trump will be successful, our majority will grow stronger, and we can continue our work together to create a safer and more secure country for every American.”\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who won his bid for reelection Tuesday and contributed to Republicans’ flip of the upper chamber, will is also vying for the top position.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nDeb Fischer wins reelection in Nebraska Senate race\n\nRepublican Deb Fischer defended her Nebraska Senate seat against a challenge from independent candidate Dan Osborn, who was backed by liberal leaning groups.\n\nPolling leading up to the race showed Osborn, a navy veteran and union leader, within striking distance of Fischer. But the upset never materialized on election day.\n\nFisher, 73, will enter her third term representing Nebraska in the Senate. She is a cattle rancher and member of the Senate Armed Services and Appropriations committees.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nGOP congressmen keep competitive seats in New York and New Jersey\n\nRepublican Rep. Tom Kean Jr. has won reelection to his seat in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District covering the western suburbs of New York City, while Rep. Nick LaLota won reelection to his seat in New York’s 1st Congressional District, covering the eastern tip of Long Island to the New York City suburbs.\n\nBoth districts leaned toward Republicans but were competitive enough to be major targets for Democrats this cycle.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Kean’s district by almost 4 percentage points in 2020 and won LaLota’s district by 0.2 percentage points.\n\nThe race for House control remains too close to call, with dozens of competitive races still up in the air.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nRepublicans flip Senate after Moreno win in Ohio\n\nRepublicans have won control of the Senate, a potential boost for a Donald Trump presidency or a roadblock for Kamala Harris if she wins.\n\nThe victory of Republican Senate candidate Bernie Moreno over incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio likely tipped the scales in favor of Republicans, though they may flip even more seats before the night is over.\n\nOdds have favored the GOP this entire election cycle, with all of the most competitive races in states represented by vulnerable Democratic senators. The retirement of Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia gave Republicans one clear pick-up in a ruby-red state.\n\nRepublicans only needed to win one more race to retake control of the chamber that is currently controlled 51-49 by Democrats, which they managed to do on Tuesday.\n\nUltimately, either Harris' or Trump's legislative ambitions on everything from taxes to health care and energy will depend on the makeup of the two chambers of Congress. The race for the House remains too close to call at this time with dozens of competitive races still uncalled.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nHal Rogers wins 23rd term\n\nRepublican Hal Rogers, the longest serving member of Congress, won reelection in District 5.\n\nRogers, 86, has was first elected to the seat in 1980, has served on the Appropriations Committee for four decades, and became Dean of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2022.

District 2 was redrawn and had been expected to lean Democratic.\n\nFigures is a lifelong resident of the area and the son of two state senators. He previously worked as a top campaign aide for former President Barack Obama in 2008, then in the Department of Justice under Obama. More recently, Figures was the deputy chief of staff and counselor to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in the Biden administration.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Victor Hagan\n\n‘Squad’ member Ilhan Omar wins fourth term\n\nProgressive Democrat and Rep. Ilhan Omar won reelection in District 5.\n\nShe is one of the remaining members of the House’s “Squad” that has been the target of millions of dollars from pro-Israel groups. Omar has been one of Congress’ strongest critics against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and its military actions in its war against Hamas.\n\nOmar narrowly defeated her Democratic challenger, Don Samuels, by just over 2,400 votes in her party’s primary. In a solidly blue state, Omar’s victory in the general election against Republican Dalia al-Aqidi was expected.\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\nNebraska Senate race narrows\n\nAs votes are still being counted in Nebraska’s competitive U.S. Senate race, independent candidate and former union leader Dan Osborn and Republican Sen. Deb Fischer, who is running for a third term, are neck and neck.\n\nOsborn currently leads Fischer by less than one point with 65% of the votes counted.\n\nAt a watch party in Papillion, Neb., a suburb of Omaha, supporters are anxiously standing by as the race tightens.\n\nOsborn has insisted that he won’t caucus with any party if elected, which could matter in a closely divided Senate.\n\nA recent New York Times/Siena College poll puts Osborn just two percentage points behind Fischer, 46% to 48%, with 5% of likely voters in Nebraska either undecided or refusing to answer. Other political tracking organizations, including the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, updated the contest to “leaning” versus “solidly” Republican.\n\n--Maya Marchell Hoff\n\nDemocrat flips seat in New York’s 22nd District\n\nDemocrat John Mannion unseated Republican incumbent Rep. Brandon Williams in New York’s 22nd Congressional District.\n\nTheir race had been labelled “lean Democrat” by Cook Political Report. Mannion’s win is a pickup for Democrats hoping to take control of the House.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nHakeem Jeffries, potential House speaker, wins reelection\n\nDemocratic leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York won reelection in his Brooklyn district.\n\nJeffries served as minority leader for House Democrats, after former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ended her 20-year leadership reign in 2022.\n\nIf Democrats manage to take back control of the lower chamber, Jeffries would be the top contender for House speaker. Jeffries has been in office since 2013.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nLauren Boebert wins reelection after Colorado districts switch\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert, a firebrand House Republican from Colorado, won reelection, after opting to run again in a different, redder district.\n\nBoebert is finishing her current term representing Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, encompassing most of the state’s western half. But for her third term in Congress, her constituents will be in eastern Colorado's 4th District.\n\nBoebert made the switch after former Rep. Ken Buck announced he would not run again in that district. Many speculated her move was to avoid an embarrassing defeat. Boebert nearly lost her bid for reelection in 2022, beating Democrat Adam Frisch by just 546 votes.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump ally Elise Stefanik wins reelection\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., will serve her sixth term representing upstate New York in the state’s 21st Congressional District.\n\nA rising star in the GOP, Stefanik has been a Trump loyalist in Congress, even floated as a potential running mate for the former president in 2024.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNN back in February, the congresswoman said if she had been in former Vice President Mike Pence’s position on January 6, 2021, she would not have certified the 2020 election results.\n\n“I don’t think that was the right approach,” Stefanik told anchor Kaitlan Collins.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTed Cruz wins third Senate term in Texas\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, beat his Democratic challenger, Rep. Collin Alred, D-Texas, to secure a third term representing Texas in the Senate, according to NBC News and Fox News.\n\nAlthough Cruz won, the race was closer than expected in the closing days. The Cook Political Report, a political prognostication site, shifted it from a likely Republican win to lean Republican a month before the election.\n\nThis is the second election where Cruz has campaigned in a tight race against a Democratic opponent, fanning questions about whether Texas is becoming a purple state.\n\nCruz, who has stamped out a reputation as a conservative firebrand, won his 2018 race against former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, by less than three points.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nDelaware’s Sarah McBride becomes first openly transgender member of Congress\n\nSarah McBride became the first openly transgender member of Congress after winning election in Delaware’s sole congressional district.\n\nJust over 1% of adults in the U.S., or around 3 million Americans, identify as transgender, according to the US Census Bureau.

In her run for Congress this year, she faced Republican John Whalen.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Rachel Barber\n\nTwo Black women make Senate history\n\nThe elections of Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester and Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks mark a milestone moment in American history.\n\nTwo Black women have never been elected to the Senate at the same time –until now. Only two other Black women have been elected to the Senate: Carol Moseley Braun in 1992 and Kamala Harris in 2016.\n\nLaphonza Butler was appointed to complete late California Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s term but was never chosen by voters. The pair will double the number of Black women who have been elected to serve in the Senate from two to four.\n\n- Karissa Waddick\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson wins reelection\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson won a fifth term in District 4.\n\nJohnson was first elected in 2016, along with Donald Trump. Johnson, a staunch conservative popular with the former president’s base, has refused to accept the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. He was elected Speaker in 2023 after weeks of GOP infighting and the ousting of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\nTrump allies win reelection\n\nSeveral allies of former President Donald Trump will be heading back to Congress' lower chamber, after handily winning reelection Tuesday evening.\n\nRep. Byron Donalds, a top surrogate for Trump's reelection campaign this year, was one of the first House races called, according to projections by the Associated Press.

Anna Luna.\n\nLive updates:As election results pour in, who will win control of House and Senate?\n\nJim Jordan to serve a 10th term in Congress\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, won his tenth term in the House, beating Democratic challenger Tamie Wilson in Ohio’s 4th Congressional District according to the AP.\n\nAs chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jordan helped lead a stalled impeachment inquiry into President Biden.\n\nHe was also a brief candidate for House speaker, following the ousting of former Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Despite being backed by Trump, Jordan was dropped by GOP House members after failing to get past three rounds of voting.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nEarly results show a tight US Senate race in Texas\n\nWith a smattering of counties, some big and some small, the race between Republican U.S.Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Colin Allred is about even. Keep in mind, the polls have been closed less than 20 minutes as this is being written.\n\nAllred is running comfortably ahead in incomplete and unofficial returns from his home base of Dallas County. In neighboring Tarrant County, narrowly won by President Joe Biden four years ago, Cruz has a slim lead.\n\nIn Williamson County, north of Austin, it's Allred with the slim lead. So far, all of the rural counties reporting numbers show Cruz well ahead.\n\n--John C. Moritz\n\nMatt Gaetz wins fifth term in Florida\n\nFlorida’s ultraconservative congressman Rep. Matt Gaetz won a fifth term in office, defeating Democrat Aaron Dimmock.\n\nretired naval officer Gaetz has been a controversial figure during his time in Congress so far.

Marjorie Taylor Greene will serve a third term in Congress after winning reelection in District 14, according to AP.\n\nVoters in the state’s northwest district first elected Greene in 2020. Greene has proved herself as a staunch Trump ally and controversial figure on Capitol Hill, making waves for her conspiracy theories and public fights on the House floor.\n\nThis year, she ran unopposed in her party’s primary and defeated Democrat Shawn Harris in the general election.\n\n— Savannah Kuchar and Rachel Barber\n\nSen. Rick Scott wins Florida, keeps competitive seat Republican\n\nIncumbent Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., defeated Democratic challenger former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.\n\nThe Florida Senate race was seen as one of only two seats Democrats might be able to flip in their favor this year. This election cycle is tough for Senate Democrats, who are defending seats in almost all of the competitive races.\n\nThey had hoped that Scott's lagging popularity and increased Democratic voter turnout for a state abortion rights ballot initiative might help Mucarsel-Powell topple the first-term senator and former Florida governor.\n\nNow only Texas remains potentially in play for Democrats, where incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz faces Rep. Colin Allred.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nFlorida’s Anna Luna, Trump ally, wins reelection\n\nRep. Anna Luna, R-Fla., will serve a second term, after winning reelection Tuesday night according to the Associated Press.\n\nA member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, Luna has represented her Gulf Coast district since 2020 and been a close Trump ally in the lower chamber.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nRepublicans flip Senate seat in West Virginia\n\nWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is set to become the state's next U.S. senator, defeating Democrat Glenn Elliott in Tuesday's general election.\n\nSince 2010, Independent Joe Manchin has held the seat. A former Democrat, Manchin frequently defied his party leadership while remaining at odds with former President Donald Trump. However, Manchin announced in November 2023 that he would not seek a third term.\n\nJustice's win is a crucial moment for the Republican Party as it aims to regain control of the Senate. West Virginia has shifted sharply to the right over the past two decades, making it a must-win for Republican strategists.\n\nTrump ally Byron Donalds wins reelection\n\nRep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., won a third term in Congress, according to projections from the Associated Press.\n\nThe Florida Republican is a staunch Trump supporter and has been stumping for the former president, specifically helping to appeal to undecided Black voters who could be key in deciding the presidential race.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nBernie Sanders re-elected in Vermont\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., won reelection Tuesday, defeating Republican Gerald Malloy and securing his fourth term in the U.S. Senate. At 83, Sanders will continue his decades-long career in Washington with another six-year term.\n\nKnown as a leading progressive, Sanders has championed policies like Medicare for All and a higher federal minimum wage. First elected to the U.S. House in 1991, Sanders moved to the Senate in 2007 and ran for president in 2016 and 2020.\n\nThough he is an Independent, Sanders is expected to continue caucusing with the Democratic Party.\n\nYoungest member of Congress, Rep. Maxwell Frost wins a second term in Florida District 10\n\nCongress’ youngest member, Rep. Maxwell Frost, will serve a second term, according to projections from the Associated Press.\n\nFrost became the first Gen-Z member of Congress in 2022, elected to represent the Sunshine state’s 10th Congressional District, encompassing Orlando.\n\nThe 27-year-old is part of a rising group of young leaders in the Democratic party and has been a Harris campaign surrogate out on the campaign trail this year.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWill lawmakers and congressional candidates commit to upholding the 2024 results? We asked\n\nWith nearly half of the country's Republicans and a quarter of Democrats questioning whether next month's presidential election will be fair, USA TODAY wanted to know where members of the next Congress stand on the issue.\n\nSo, we surveyed all 382 members of the House and 91 Senators who are either running for re-election or would still be in office in January, asking whether they would uphold the 2024 presidential election results, regardless of the winner. We also polled 747 candidates running for the House and Senate whose names are on the ballot this year. Those who agreed to uphold the results without conditions include:\n\n117 sitting House members, 14 of whom are Republicans and 103 are Democrats;\n\n27 sitting Senate members, 2 of whom are Republicans and 25 Democrats;\n\n236 candidates for House and Senate, including 130 Democrats, 45 Republicans and 61 third-party candidates.\n\nHere’s a full breakdown of how lawmakers responded.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSpeaker Johnson on election certification: 'Everybody needs to calm down'\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Tuesday said he would do his part to certify the 2024 election results.\n\n“Of course,” Johnson told EWTN News.\n\n“If we have a free and fair election, we're going to follow the Constitution. I mean, I've taken an oath to uphold the Constitution and always have my entire life. I’ve demonstrated over and over and over and so all this hyperbole and madness about, ‘Oh, they're going to try to unwind the election.’ None of that is true. None of it,’” Johnson added.\n\nDemocrats criticized Johnson in September after he told reporters that he would follow the Constitution and uphold the results if the election was free, fair and safe. In 2021, Johnson helped craft an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in support of a Texas lawsuit aimed at overturning the 2020 election results lost by Donald Trump in four swing states.\n\n“There's just too much emotion, too much misinformation out there,” Johnson told EWTN News. “Everybody needs to calm down.”\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSen. Deb Fischer facing tough reelection battle in Nebraska\n\nRepublican Sen. Deb Fischer is facing an unexpectedly tight reelection battle in deep red Nebraska against independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nA New York Times/Sienna College poll fielded at the end of October should Osborn within two percentage points of Fischer, 46% to 48%.\n\nThe race could sway the balance of the Senate. Republicans are counting on Fischer’s seat as a key part of their efforts to take control of the Senate. If elected, Osborn will be the first independent candidate to represent Nebraska in more than 50 years.\n\nOsborn, a U.S. Navy veteran and former union leader, has cast himself as a true independent candidate with no allegiance to Democrats or Republicans. Liberal-leaning groups have backed his campaign, but Osborn has rejected rumors from top Democrats that he plans to caucus with the party if elected.\n\n– Karissa Waddick and Maya Marchel Hoff\n\nWhich states allow Election Day voter registration?\n\nOver 60 million Americans have already voted, according to Election Hub at the University of Florida, but for some wanting to make their voice heard who aren't registered to vote yet, they can still participate.\n\nOver 20 states, and Washington D.C., allow voters to register and vote on Election Day. Look here for a full list.

In others, citizens voted for who they felt best represented the interests of their constituents, leading to several candidates making history with \"firsts.\"\n\nAfter former President Donald Trump's presidential victory was declared in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, shockwaves led some to express concern for certain communities, citing the president-elect's past policies and promises on reproductive health, same-sex marriage, LGBTQ+ rights and issues that affect other at-risk groups like immigrants, people of color and women.\n\nIn the face of these anxieties, however, voters in several states passed specific protections for abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. Others elected officials from communities traditionally unrepresented in government, including the first-ever trans person to be elected to Congress.\n\nHere are the states that passed measures for reproductive healthcare and LGBTQ+ rights, as well as those that elected individuals who represent the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nLGBTQ+ representation\n\nHistory was made time and time again on election night, as voters from several states voted LGBTQ+ individuals into office.\n\nSarah McBride, first transgender person elected to federal office\n\nSarah McBride, to serve as Delaware's next representative in Congress, is the first transgender person to be elected to a federal office in U.S. history.\n\nA Democrat and state legislator, this is not the first time McBride has made history. She first gained national attention when she was the first openly transgender person to speak at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.\n\nMore recently, McBride was the national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest LGBTQ+ advocacy group.\n\nJulie Johnson, first openly gay representative from Texas\n\nJulie Johnson made Texas history on Election Day, becoming the first openly gay Texan to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Claiming 60.3% of the votes, Johnson will serve Texas' 32nd district. She is also the first openly gay representative from a southern state, according to KUT News, Austin, Texas' NPR affiliate.\n\nJohnson has served in the Texas House of Representatives since 2019, where she co-founded the LGBTQ Caucus, a group of individuals dedicated to advocating for Texas' LGBTQ+ community.\n\nZooey Zephyr, trans woman re-elected in Montana\n\nDemocratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr was re-elected to the Montana House of Representatives in a landslide, claiming 80.2% of the votes against her Republican challenger Barbara Starmer. For two more years, Zephyr will serve Montana's 95th district.\n\nZephyr made national headlines in 2023 when the Montana House considered a bill banning gender-affirming care for minors. Zephyr, a transgender woman, told supports of the bill that they would have \"blood on your hands,\" if it were to be passed.\n\nThe House later voted to censure Zephyr, removing her from the Montana State Capitol grounds for the remainder of the 2023 legislative session. 2025 will be Zephyr's first time back on the House floor, as the legislature did not meet in 2024, per previous USA TODAY reporting.\n\nSeveral other state elections had monumental results for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nKeturah Herron will be the first out LGBTQ+ member in the Kentucky House, Rashaun Kemp will be the first queer Black man in the Georgia state legislature, Gabby Salinas will be the first out woman in the Tennessee state legislature, Molly Cook will be the first out LGBTQ+ member in the Texas State Senate, Aime Wichtendahl will be the first out trans person in the Iowa state legislature and Emily Randall will be first openly gay Latina in U.S. Congress.\n\nSame-sex marriage initiatives passed in several states\n\nVoters in California, Colorado and Hawaii passed ballot measures that amend their state’s constitutions to protect same-sex marriage.\n\nSame-sex marriage is already legal federally, following the 2015 Supreme Court ruling, Obergefell v. Hodges. However, following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, LGBTQ+ activists wished to take proactive steps, in case the 2015 ruling were to also be overturned.\n\nIn California, voters approved to repeal the state's same-sex marriage ban by 61%. In Colorado, voters approved the repeal of their ban by 64% and Hawaiian voters approved the repeal of their same-sex marriage ban by 55.9%.\n\nReproductive health and abortion protections\n\nThis year, 10 states − Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota − had abortion measures on their ballots.\n\nMost of these ballot initiatives would either have allowed for abortion up until fetal viability, which is around 24 weeks, or enshrined abortion rights in the state’s constitution, save for Nebraska, which had two dueling propositions.\n\nOf the 10, seven states passed some form of abortion or reproductive rights measure: Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada and New York.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which federally guaranteed the right to an abortion, in June 2022, states have enacted a range of laws. At least 14 implemented near-total abortion bans, while others enshrined the right to abortion access in state law or passed shield laws protecting patients from other states who travel to get the procedure.\n\nArizona Proposition 139 kicks state's 15-week abortion ban\n\nOn Tuesday, the Arizona Abortion Access Act (Proposition 139) was passed, overturning the state's current 15-week ban. It also prevents the state government from restricting abortion before the fetus is viable outside the uterus; allows abortion after viability to protect the life, physical, or mental health of the pregnant person; and prohibits laws that penalize individuals for aiding or assisting a person exercising the right to an abortion.\n\nThe measure passed with 61.4% of the vote, a win that some were wary would happen in a state that still had an 1864 law on the books prohibiting abortion in most circumstances and ordering prosecution for any person who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion \"unless it is necessary to save her life.\" After the Supreme Court ruled on Dobbs v. Jackson, the 1864 law was ruled enforceable but some legal back-and-forth resulted in the Arizona State Senate repealing it.\n\nMissouri's Amendment 3 overturns near-total abortion ban\n\nVoters in Missouri elected to overturn the state's near-total abortion ban with 51.6% of the vote.\n\nMissouri's Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative (Amendment 3) not only overturns the ban but establishes the individual right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives, without governmental interference. It also prevents the government from discriminating against persons providing or obtaining reproductive health care.\n\nCurrently, abortion is illegal in Missouri with very limited exceptions for medical emergencies. There is no exception for cases of rape or incest and those who perform or induce an abortion may face felony charges and can face a prison sentence between five and 15 years.\n\nMontana and New York enshrine reproductive rights into civil rights laws\n\nIn Montana and New York, abortion is already legal up to viability and up to 24 weeks (often considered viability), respectively. Both states also have post-viability allowances for the health of the mother and/or fetus.\n\nThis election cycle, however, both decided to take these protections further, enshrining the right to abortion and reproductive healthcare into the state constitution in broader terms.\n\nMontana's Right to Abortion Initiative (CI-128) passed by 57.67%, enshrining the \"right to make and carry out decisions about one’s own pregnancy, including the right to abortion\" into the state constitution and prohibiting the government from penalizing, prosecuting, or taking any adverse action against a person based on their pregnancy outcomes.\n\nIn New York, the Equal Protection of Law Amendment (Proposal 1) passed by 61.5% of voters amends the New York Bill of Rights to dictate that no person's rights can be denied on a variety of specified basis, including\"ethnicity, national origin, age, disability,\" as well as the person's \"sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\" Currently, the clause only specifies protections based on \"race, color, creed, or religion.\"\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

LGBTQ recorded history in Wisconsin dates to an arrest in 1894\n\nOne of the earliest records of the LGBTQ community in Wisconsin is from Black River Falls in 1894.\n\nFrank Blunt was arrested and jailed for one year after stealing $175 from a Milwaukee business. During his arrest, it was made known he had previously identified as a woman and was married to a woman named Gertrude Field.\n\nSimilar cases are recorded around Wisconsin, including Ralph Kerwinieo, who had \"lived as a man for 13 years.\" Kerwinieo was arrested for his sexual identity in 1914, and forced to wear women's clothes or face jail time.\n\nHowever, before European colonization, Indigenous tribes in Wisconsin were widely accepting of LGBTQ peoples, often referred to as \"two-spirit\" peoples. A 1953 study on Ho-Chunk sexuality found that the tribe had a longstanding culture of acceptance of queer individuals, who actually held many in positions of honor.\n\n2. Before Harvey Milk, James Yeadon was elected to public office\n\nJames Yeadon became the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in Wisconsin.\n\nIn 1976, he beat 13 other candidates in a special election for Madison's 8th Aldermanic District. Yeadon came out publicly as gay the next day, and in April 1977, he won re-election.\n\nSeven months later, famed gay-rights activist Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. While Milk was the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, Yeadon and several others made history across the nation before Milk came into office.\n\n3. Wisconsin was the first state to pass LGBTQ anti-discrimination laws\n\nWisconsin became the first state in the nation to pass a nondiscrimination law based on sexual orientation, in 1982.\n\nAB70 was originally introduced in 1971 by Milwaukee Assemblyman Lloyd Barbee. When his term ended in 1977, the fight continued with State Rep. David Clarenbach and activist Leon Rouse. They were able to garner support from religious leaders to get the bill passed, but the law did not cover discrimination regarding sexual identity.\n\nThis made Wisconsin the only state where the law explicitly prohibited discrimination based only on sexual orientation, but allowed for discrimination based on sexual identity.\n\nTransgender people are still seeking protection from discrimination in housing and employment almost 40 years later.\n\n4. Milwaukee had its own version of Stonewall, eight years earlier\n\nIn 1961, four inebriated servicemen decided to check out Milwaukee's most popular gay bar, on a dare. That was the beginning of a violent night for the Black Nite bar.\n\nAfter the four harassed patrons, the four were quickly kicked out by gender-nonconforming customer Josie Carter. The servicemen soon returned with a dozen friends, intent on seeking revenge for their humiliation. What they found instead was a bar full of 75 customers ready to defend the bar.\n\nThe brawl caused more than $2,000 in damages (about $18,000 today). Although the four servicemen were arrested, charges were later dropped.\n\nThe brawl was among the worst local police had ever seen, according to the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project, earning it the nickname \"Milwaukee's Stonewall\" — even though it happened eight years before those infamous riots.\n\nCurrently, the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project is raising donations to install a historical marker at the site of the bar. Sixty years later, the Milwaukee County executive has formally recognized that night as a historic event.\n\n5. Emmanuel UCC was the first open and affirming church in Waukesha County\n\nEmmanuel United Church of Christ in Oconomowoc was the first open and affirming church in Waukesha County.\n\nThe church publicly welcomed the LGBTQ community to join as full members in 2006. It also established a Pflag chapter, a support group for parents, families and allies of lesbians and gays.\n\nOpen and Affirming, ONA refers to a coalition of the United Church of Christ who have publicly declared to be open and supportive to LGBTQ individuals in all parts of its ministry. The coalition’s movement began in 1972 and has grown to more than 1,500 ONAchurches and ministries with over 350,000 members in the United States. There are 26 ONA churches in Wisconsin.\n\n6. This Is It, one of Milwaukee's beloved gay bars, is one of the oldest in the country\n\nThis Is It, nestled in the heart of Milwaukee's downtown on East Wells Street, is one of the top 10 oldest gay bars in the nation and the oldest LGBTQ bar in Wisconsin. Despite being surrounded by office buildings and other restaurants, it's known to customers as their \"neighborhood bar.\"\n\nFounded in 1968, original owner June Brehm wanted her LGBTQ friends to have a safe place to enjoy themselves. According to current co-owner George Schneider, she worked hard to ensure everyone in the community could feel safe and not experience discrimination.\n\nBrehm's son Joe joined the business in 1981 and took over before her death in 2010. Joe's business partner, Schneider, became sole owner after Joe's death in 2016. It was announced earlier this year that Trixie Mattel, Season 3 winner of \"RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars,\" joined Schneider as co-owner of the bar.\n\n7. Wisconsin was the first state to have three openly LGBTQ elected officials\n\nWisconsin was the first state in the nation to elect three openly gay members of the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe three members are Rep. Steve C. Gunderson, 1981-97; Rep. Tammy Baldwin, 1999-2013; and Rep. Mark Pocan 2013-present.\n\nPocan is also the first LGBTQ member of Congress to replace another LGBTQ member of Congress. He replaced Tammy Baldwin in 2013 when she became a U.S. senator.\n\n8. Steve C. Gunderson was outed on the house floor — then reelected\n\nSteve C. Gunderson was the first openly gay member of the Republican Party to be reelected to Congress after being unwillingly outed.\n\nIn 1994, while debating on the house floor, fellow Republican Bob Dornan of California outed Gunderson in an attempt to shame him in the eyes of the public. Dornan would later tell several newspapers it was his \"duty\" to \"expose ... and destroy\" queer Republicans such as Gunderson.\n\nDespite this, and the GOP's traditional opposition to gay rights, Gunderson was re-elected that same year. He served in the House of Representatives from 1980-97 representing Wisconsin’s 3rd District.\n\nWhile in Congress, Gunderson also served as the House Republican chief deputy whip from 1989-93. He is credited for his anti-discrimination work and fostering acceptance of LGBTQ individuals while in office.\n\n9. Milwaukee had infamous 'drag queen wars'\n\nDrag shows continue to be a place of expression and entertainment for the LGBTQ community, and Wisconsin is no exception.\n\nClub Two-Nineteen (now Club 219) was the top space for these shows in Milwaukee during the mid-1980s and regularly sold out. Other bars started to take notice, and Milwaukee local George Prentice decided to start his own drag show at his club LaCage.\n\nOnly six blocks separated the two venues, and competition became fierce. According to legendary drag performer B.J. Daniels, owners of Club Two-Nineteen would pay drag queens and kings to not perform at other bars.\n\nThis strategy resulted in the performers not only being exclusive but becoming more elaborate in their stage performances.\n\n10. Milwaukee has been dubbed an 'underappreciated gay Mecca'\n\nLGBTQ magazine \"The Advocate\" shone a spotlight on Milwaukee in 2016.\n\nThe magazine, established in 1967, is the oldest and largest LGBTQ-centered publication in the country. When it reviewed the book \"LGBT Milwaukee\" by historian // Michail Takach, Milwaukee got a major shoutout as \"the most underappreciated gay Mecca in the U.S.\"\n\n“People wouldn’t expect Milwaukee to have a long and colorful LGBTQ history, dating back nearly 100 years, but here’s the proof,” said Takach, referencing his book.\n\n11. Nationally acclaimed GPU started right here in Wisconsin\n\nIn 1971, students at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee founded the Gay Peoples Union (GPU). It soon rose to become the most prominent gay rights organization in Milwaukee and later published a news outlet called GPU News, which gained national recognition.\n\nThe group's purpose was to help educate the community about gays, lesbians and other members of the LGBTQ community. Some of the group's accomplishments include:\n\nProducing the first gay and lesbian scripted program in the nation called Gay Perspective.\n\nFrom 1971-81, publishing a monthly magazine centered on gay issues.\n\nEstablishing Milwaukee's first gay and lesbian community center.\n\nOpening the first gay health clinic, which later became BESTD Clinic.\n\nContact Victoria Magee at (414) 223-5368 or vmagee@gannett.com.

Sarah McBride, the country’s highest-ranking transgender elected official, announced her candidacy Monday to become Delaware’s next sole congresswoman.\n\nMcBride, if elected, would become the first openly trans person elected to federal office, catapulting the already nationally known politician to an even bigger stage. She also would be the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\n“It's clear that diversity in government is necessary for us to not just ensure we have a healthy democracy but also to truly deliver for people,” she said in an interview with Delaware Online/The News Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\n“I am certainly cognizant of the uniqueness of my candidacy, of the uniqueness that my voice would bring to the halls of Congress,” she said. “But ultimately, I'm not running to be a trans member of Congress. I'm running to be Delaware's member of Congress who's focused on making progress on all of the issues that matter to Delawareans of every background.”\n\nIt’s a callback to her state Senate campaign, in which McBride ran on the notion of serving as a “senator who happens to be transgender.” Her announcement comes at a fraught time for trans Americans as a wave of GOP state legislatures have introduced bills to ban gender-affirming care and participation in sports teams for minors. A Delaware Republican senator reintroduced a bill last week that would require students to play only on sports teams that correspond to their biological sex.\n\nBills, speeches and even playlists:Here's how some lawmakers are celebrating Pride Month\n\nWhy McBride is considered a 'once-in-a-lifetime talent'\n\nA rising star in Delaware politics, 32-year-old McBride has long been viewed as the front-runner to replace U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester. The congresswoman announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate last week.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Blunt Rochester will endorse anyone running in the House race. McBride is expected to be in a competitive primary. Eugene Young, director of the Delaware State Housing Authority, has declared his interest in running.\n\nIn her announcement, McBride touted the endorsements of dozens of Delaware politicians, notably Attorney General Kathy Jennings, who called her a \"once-in-a-lifetime talent.\" McBride has also received the support of labor organizers and national organizations.\n\nHer history in Delaware politics\n\nHer major policy achievement while in Delaware's General Assembly was shepherding the passage of statewide family and medical leave, one of the more significant pieces of legislation Delaware has enacted in recent years.\n\nMcBride, who describes her ideology as a progressive who “likes to get things done,” said her role in paid family leave is a “clear demonstration of the kind of leader” she will be in Congress.\n\n“I will be someone who recognizes that you can be both bold and build bridges at the same time,” she said. “Indeed, that's the only way you're able to achieve lasting permanent change.”\n\nThe state senator also cited combating disinformation, expanding reproductive rights and embracing green technologies like electric vehicles as other legislative accomplishments.\n\nMcBride’s campaign video had a clear focus on policy, particularly health care. It briefly alluded to the larger political climate; she said in her campaign video that “too many politicians want to divide us, to tell us that teachers, doctors, even our own neighbors are the enemy.\" Simultaneously, images of presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Reps. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., appeared.\n\nMoments later, so did a photo of McBride with Biden, who wrote the foreword to McBride's memoir.\n\n“Blocking out the noise and focusing on what actually matters isn’t easy,\" she said in her campaign video. \"It takes guts and a backbone.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/26"}]}

The positions will offer an average annual salary of about $65,000, bank officials said.\n\nWallace said the bank will gradually fill the 1,800 positions based on need, rather than hire in waves, starting Jan. 1.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's a projection of our hiring needs two to three years out,\" said bank spokesman Paul Hartwick. \"There is some science behind it based on capacity and other factors.\"\n\nGov. Jack Markell noted the 1,800 new jobs to be created by JPMorgan would raise the number of people employed in Delaware's financial sector to the highest level in history.\n\n\"[But] the expansion means more than just setting historical records for employment,\" he said, \"because one of the most successful and one of the most important companies in the world, JPMorgan, is affirming that Delaware has embraced the new economy and is meeting the evolving needs of our employers in high-demand fields.\"\n\nMonday's announcement came during a press conference at the company's new Delaware Technology Center, a 357,000-square-foot office complex off Concord Pike in Fairfax. The bank acquired two connected buildings known as the Chesapeake and Delaware from AstraZeneca last year for $44 million.\n\nMonday's briefing by JP Morgan reportedly was the largest hiring announcement by a single company since AstraZeneca moved its U.S. headquarters to Delaware in 1999. The pharmaceutical giant's workforce swelled to about 5,000 in 2005. But by 2013, AstraZeneca announced it would lay off 2,300 workers worldwide by 2016, including some in Delaware.\n\nRoughly 2,400 AstraZeneca employees currently work in Delaware, with most located across the street from JPMorgan's new Delaware Technology Center, which the bank renovated and re-opened with about 1,900 workers this summer.\n\nAbout 400 of the new Delaware jobs JPMorgan plans to add also will be housed at the Delaware Technology Center, with the remaining 1,400 to be spread out over the company's other Delaware properties, Hartwick said.\n\nThe Fairfax center is now the newest of seven technology hubs that JPMorgan operates in the U.S. and Delaware was chosen for the bank's latest expansion because of the number of high tech jobs already located here.\n\nThe bank invests close to $9 billion each year on technology and employs more than 44,000 \"technologists\" internationally – including 2,600 in Delaware. Those employees work on everything from building customer service software, websites and apps, to sophisticated financial data analysis, to securing the company against cyber attacks.\n\nWallace said the bank is counting on a steady pipeline of well-trained workers from a variety of education initiatives in Delaware.\n\nHe specifically mentioned Delaware TechHire, a program aimed at providing training to entry-level computer programmers through accelerated community college programs and ZipCode, a new coding school that opened in Wilmington this year.\n\nThe bank also recently expanded the JPMorgan Chase Innovation Center at University of Delaware's Purnell Hall where about 60 students work as interns between classes and after school.\n\n\"We think it's absolutely critical to strengthen the technology ecosystem and the community around it here in Delaware,\" Wallace said.\n\nJPMorgan's promise to hire 1,800 workers in Delaware comes less than six months after the company announced plans to lay off 5,000 employees nationwide by 2016 as the nation's largest bank overhauls 5,570 branches to eliminate tellers in favor of a greater focus on technology.\n\nRichard Goeke, an assistant professor of Information Systems at Widener University, said the banking technology industry is poised for explosive growth over the next few years as consumers increasingly switch over to online banking.\n\nTo meet that demand, he said, banks are moving away from outsourcing information technology in favor of hiring in-house workers to build mobile applications and security systems.\n\n“The information systems is what gives you a competitive advantage these days,” he said. “You need people in-house who can develop those systems.”\n\nGoeke said he was not surprised JPMorgan plans to add so many tech jobs in Delaware.\n\n“Mobile banking applications are massive, very intricate and need to comply with government regulations,” he said. “This is very difficult and time consuming. You need a highly skilled staff to do for this.”\n\nGoeke added that Delaware already has highly qualified people ready to take advantage of the banking technology expansion in a few years.\n\n\"This could be a huge growth industry for Delaware,” he said.\n\nUD unveils JPMorgan Chase 'innovation' center\n\nMarkell said the state would support JPMorgan's expansion by providing up to $13.5 million over the next three years in direct and indirect assistance, including a commitment to increase train service between Wilmington and Philadelphia.\n\nThe Delaware Economic Development Office will directly support JPMorgan with up to $9 million in Strategic Fund grants over three years. The grants – contingent on the bank's ability to meet annual employment benchmarks – will be used fund the construction projects at the bank's Delaware locations, state officials said.\n\nThose sites include three buildings in downtown Wilmington, a multi-building campus near Christiana, a human resource and finance center in a former MBNA building in Ogletown, a data center in Bear and a 357,000-square-foot Delaware Technology Center office complex off Concord Pike in Fairfax.\n\nDetails about which locations are slated for expansion – and when – were not immediately available Monday afternoon.\n\nKenneth Woods, who represents Sheet Metal Workers Local Union No. 19, said JPMorgan's investment in its existing properties would have the ripple effect of creating construction jobs. He said union members would be doing work at both the bank’s Fairfax campus as well as its data center in Bear.\n\n“I’ve got about 30 to 40 men who are unemployed right now,” he said. “JPMorgan cleared out my hiring hole and put all of my men to work.\n\nWoods estimated those construction jobs would pay about $30 an hour and provide work to pipe fitters, carpenters, electricians, plumbers and pipe fitters.\n\nThe state also will use the Strategic Fund to provide JPMorgan with $500,000 each of the next three years to support training for JP Morgan's new hires.\n\nBernice Whaley, director of the Delaware Economic Development Office, said those funds require an even match from the bank.\n\n\"That can be an in-kind match ... including paying workers a salary during their training,\" she said. \"Our records show it typically ends up being like a 2:1 match in terms of private sector investment in paying for training.\"\n\nThe Council on Development Finance, an advisory board that vets state economic development projects, will consider the JPMorgan grants next month, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Delaware Transit Corporation has committed $1 million a year in indirect support through \"enhanced regional transportation options\" that will include more frequent Amtrak service to the Wilmington train station.\n\nAbout 64 percent of JPMorgan's workers here are Delaware residents, while roughly 4 percent commute from the Philadelphia-area, company officials said.\n\nJohn Sisson, the chief executive officer of DART, said the agency has been working with SEPTA and Amtrak to expand train service in Delaware for several months.\n\n\"We haven't specifically identified the exact number of trains,\" he said. \"But we're also looking at bus service from the train station.\"\n\nOnce complete, JPMorgan's hiring drive would bring its total employment in Delaware to nearly 10,000 – making the nation's largest bank the second largest employer in the state, behind only Christiana Care at 11,100 workers.\n\nJPMorgan Chase now has about 8,000 employees in Delaware and plans to reach 8,700 by Jan. 1. That's up from nearly 2,000 from 2012.\n\nJPMorgan currently has about 400 job openings available, in addition to the 1,800 jobs the bank plans to add over the next three years, Hartwick said.\n\nJeff Mordock contributed to this story.\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/28/iconic-circle-rock-roll-fight-firefly-lottery-news-around-states/50151855/", "title": "Iconic Circle K, rock 'n' roll fight: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPelham: New public access areas will be available later this year at Alabama’s largest state park, which is growing with the purchase of more than 1,600 acres of land in metro Birmingham. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources plans to expand biking, hiking and horse-riding trails at Oak Mountain State Park with the addition of acreage acquired through the Forever Wild Land Trust, the agency said in a statement. The park, located in heavily populated Shelby County, will encompass more than 11,000 acres with the additional land, most of which is forested. “We’re still doing the environmental and biological assessments to identify those areas where we want to keep the public from disturbing threatened and endangered species,” said Commissioner Chris Blankenship. “So we’ll be looking to open up more public access later in 2022.” The land being added to the park was one of the largest undeveloped tracts near Birmingham along U.S. 280. It was owned by EBSCO Industries. Forever Wild has acquired 285,000 acres of land around the state, and nearly all of it allows public access for outdoor activities.\n\nAlaska\n\nHomer: A trailer containing mail intended for a dozen communities on the Kenai Peninsula caught fire and was destroyed. The driver of the truck hauling the trailer was not injured in the Tuesday incident, the Homer News reports. The cause of the fire is under investigation, the U.S. Postal Service said in a statement. The contract truck left a processing center in Anchorage and caught fire near Mile 38 of the Seward Highway, or just north of the intersection of the Seward and Sterling highways, near Tern Lake. Mail in the trailer was intended for Kasilof, Clam Gulch, Ninilchik, Anchor Point, Homer, Fritz Creek, Halibut Cove, Nanwalek, Nikolaevsk, Port Graham, Nikiski and Seldovia. Anyone who believes they were affected by the lost mail should contact the Postal Service. If a lost package was insured, a claim can be filed online. “The Postal Service regrets this unfortunate situation and any inconvenience it may cause,” USPS wrote in a copy of the letter attached to the press statement. “If you are questioned by a mailer, creditor or correspondent regarding mail or packages that may have been destroyed in this fire, feel free to use this letter as explanation.” The Postal Service should be able to identify lost mail or packages that had tracking numbers by Wednesday, said James Boxrud, an agency spokesperson.\n\nArizona\n\nTempe: Whoa. The Circle K that plays an important part in “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure” is closing, according to employees there. The store is where Keanu Reeves, who plays Ted in the 1989 film, utters the line: “Strange things are afoot at the Circle K.” Employees at the store, at 1010 W. Southern Ave. said they had been notified the store is closing May 19. Circle K’s ownership did not respond to requests for comment. Other Valley locations where the film was shot include Metrocenter Mall – already gone – and Golfland Sunsplash water park. In the film and its sequels, Bill and Ted are high school friends with a band, Wyld Stallyns. They’re also miserable students, and if they don’t pass an upcoming history exam, Ted’s father will send him to military school, breaking up the band. That can’t happen, though, because Wyld Stallyns will eventually unite the world in a utopian society. So George Carlin visits by way of a phone booth time machine to take them back to meet historical figures to help them pass. The Circle K is where Carlin first meets Bill and Ted. And now it’s going away. Sounds bogus.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain View: Authorities say they’ve identified a person of interest in connection with the fatal shootings of four people last week in a rural community. Arkansas State Police say the person is now jailed on unrelated charges. Police did not release that person’s name or say how they may be connected to the deaths last week in rural Stone County, about 75 miles north of Little Rock. According to state police, 77-year-old Shirley Watters and her 55-year-old son, James Watters, were found dead the afternoon of April 21 by a family member. State police said both had gunshot wounds. About eight hours later, investigators were called to a nearby home where William Clinton Trammell, 75, and his wife, Sharon Trammell, 72, were found dead, also with gunshot wounds, state police said. “While area residents should continue to be vigilant at their homes and while traveling through the area, the state police has not found any evidence to indicate an imminent threat related to this particular investigation,” state police said in a statement Tuesday night.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The spiraling number of overdose deaths and hospitalizations among prison inmates in the state fell dramatically during the first two years of a program that uses prescribed drugs to treat more incarcerated addicts than any such program in the country, officials said Tuesday. The rate of overdose deaths dropped 58% after the program began in 2020. Hospitalizations were 48% lower among those receiving the anti-craving drugs than among those waiting to begin treatment. The promising results show the program was effective even after accounting for restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, according to doctors and researchers with the state corrections system and the federal official who oversees medical care in California prisons. The report said the large scale results “are trending in a positive direction,” and officials are “cautiously optimistic.” The findings come as Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration seeks $126.6 million in the next fiscal year and $162.5 million annually thereafter to expand treatment. The report said expanding the state’s latest expensive attempt to curtail the prisons’ pervasive drug problem is “at the highest priority level,” given the impact on prisoner health, community safety upon inmates’ release, and drug trafficking and violence it brings to prisons.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The head of the state’s parks and wildlife agency has been placed on paid leave after he reportedly referred to a Black colleague across a room as being “in the back of the bus” while on stage during a recent conference. Dan Prenzlow will be replaced by acting director Heather Dugan while a “fact-finding investigation” is conducted, said Dan Gibbs, the executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, which includes Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Gibbs did not explain what Prenzlow was accused of doing, only noting that he had received several complaints last week about “inappropriate comments and interactions” at Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s Partners in Outdoors Conference in Vail. According to Alease “Aloe” Lee, the agency’s statewide partnership coordinator and the conference’s organizer, Prenzlow asked 600 attendees to turn their attention to her as she was standing in the back of the room, The Denver Post reports. “There she is!” Prenzlow said, according to Lee. “In the back of the bus, Aloe!” In an open letter to Gov. Jared Polis, Lee said people’s heads turned in shock, and she ran into the arms of another Black woman, crying. Lee also wrote about her experience encountering a lot of people in the outdoor conservation industry “who do not value a Black woman in power.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state moved closer Tuesday toward placing tougher restrictions on marijuana advertising, including barring ads from cross-border retail cannabis establishments such as the billboard ads that have popped up along the border with Massachusetts. A bill that cleared the House of Representatives on a 98-48 vote prevents anyone without a Connecticut cannabis-related license from advertising the product or cannabis services within the state. The same bill also bars Connecticut licensees from using images of the cannabis plant, advertising on an illuminated billboard between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m., or advertising within 1,500 yards of a school or church. These new restrictions would be in addition to the state’s original rules for cannabis advertising that were included in the legalization law that passed last year. While residents over age 21 can legally possess up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana in Connecticut, retail recreational cannabis establishments are not expected to begin operating in the state until late 2022 at the earliest. Rep. Mike D’Agostino, D-Hamden, said that rather than an outright ban on the advertising, which would raise constitutional issues, the legislation provides “very reasonable time, place and manner restrictions” while also requiring those who advertise to hold Connecticut licenses.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A man who spent nearly half of his life behind bars before convincing the state Supreme Court that the 2008 murder trial that imprisoned him was unfair still hasn’t been able to leave prison. The court agreed last year that new evidence in the case of Mark Purnell, 32, “creates a strong inference that he is actually innocent.” That ruling discredited much of the evidence that convinced a jury to convict Purnell but left the door open for prosecutors to retry him for the 2006 murder of Tamika Giles in Wilmington’s Quaker Hill neighborhood – an opportunity prosecutors said shortly after that they intended to take. Nearly 10 months later, Purnell remains in prison. Prosecutors for the Delaware Department of Justice are arguing that he is too dangerous to be released on bail while also dangling immediate freedom in front of him if he would accept a deal to plead guilty to a lesser crime than murder, according to statements in court. His attorneys say that Purnell is determined to clear his name; that prosecutors likely won’t have a “single credible witness” to testify against him in a new trial, now scheduled for August; and that his continued imprisonment is an “outrage.” They are asking a judge to toss out the case against Purnell entirely or at least allow him out of jail to await a future trial.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Rapper Pharrell Williams made an appearance at Ballou High School on Tuesday, alongside Mayor Muriel Bowser, to help highlight summer events in D.C., including his own “Something in the Water” music festival. The festival – formerly held in Virginia Beach, where Williams grew up – will instead happen on the National Mall over Juneteenth weekend, WUSA-TV reports. Tickets for the three-day event June 17-19 go on sale Saturday at 10 a.m. Williams said the weekend chosen is no coincidence, meant to highlight the efforts that led to Virginia recognizing Juneteenth as a paid holiday in 2020 and “recognize that something that has been flowing through the country’s soil for over 400 years.” He has previously said he is moving the festival out of Virginia Beach due to how the city handled the investigation into the shooting death of his cousin by a police officer, according to the Associated Press. “When we hit challenges, you can either stop and stay stagnant, or you rise above it and go onwards and upwards,” Pharrell said. “We chose to take our festival to the highest grounds, in my opinion, in this entire nation: our National Mall.” Williams also said everyone in the room at Ballou would be given tickets to the festival, which will include performances by Calvin Harris, Pusha T, Chloe x Halle, Dave Matthews Band, Ashanti & Ja Rule, Lil Baby and more.\n\nFlorida\n\nPace: A sheriff invited a homeowner who shot at a would-be robber to attend a gun safety course to “learn to shoot a lot better” and “save the taxpayers money.” Santa Rosa County Sheriff Bob Johnson made the comments during a news conference last Thursday regarding the arrest of a 32-year-old man who was breaking into houses in Pace, in the Panhandle near Pensacola. Multiple residents called 911 on April 20 to report the break-ins, and deputies quickly set up a perimeter, Johnson said. The suspect was jumping over fences and breaking into homes as deputies tried to catch him. “We don’t know which homeowner shot at him. I guess they think that they did something wrong, which they did not,” Johnson said. “If someone is breaking into your house, you’re more than welcome to shoot at them in Santa Rosa County. We’d prefer that you do, actually.” He added that the sheriff’s office conducts a gun safety course every other Saturday. After shots were directed at the man, deputies eventually caught up to him, already inside another home. As they broke through a door he was trying to block, the man went head-first through a window to escape, cutting himself on the glass. He had active felony warrants for his arrest at the time of his capture and is being held on a $157,500 bond, facing multiple charges, records show.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Board members abruptly fired the leader of the state’s third-largest school system Tuesday, creating further questions about the district’s direction. DeKalb County School Board members voted 4-1 in a virtual meeting to fire Cheryl Watson-Harris immediately, after less than two years on the job in the 93,000-student district. Watson-Harris was DeKalb County’s sixth superintendent in a decade, having worked as first deputy chancellor in New York City’s sprawling school system before coming to Georgia. Watson-Harris said in a statement Wednesday that she was “blindsided” by her firing. “I was unaware that my contract or employment would be discussed during yesterday’s meeting as I was not notified and it was not identified on the meeting notice,” she said. Vasanne Tinsley, formerly deputy superintendent of student support and intervention, was named interim superintendent. The firing came hours after board Chair Vickie Turner appeared to blame Watson-Harris for poor conditions at one of the district’s high schools in a letter to state Superintendent Richard Woods. However, Turner and the majority of the board said in a statement that its “relationship with Mrs. Watson-Harris had been deteriorating for some time to the point the association became irreconcilable.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige said Tuesday that the state has agreed to pay $328 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by 2,700 Native Hawaiians who languished on a waitlist to receive homestead leases. Ige said the Legislature must approve the funds for the settlement, and then a Circuit Court judge must sign off on its terms for it to be final. The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 was meant to provide economic self-sufficiency to Hawaiians by supplying them land. Those with at least 50% Hawaiian blood quantum can apply for a 99-year lease for $1 a year. But Hawaii has been slow to award leases. An estimated 28,000 people are on the waitlist. The lawsuit stems from a 1991 law allowing Native Hawaiians to file claims against the state for losses incurred while waiting for a homestead lease from 1959 to 1988. The Legislature created a panel to address claims, but the existence of the panel wasn’t extended past 1999. So the plaintiffs sued. The Hawaii Supreme Court in 2020 voted to allow the class-action lawsuit to continue and for damages to be awarded. Carl Varady, an attorney who has represented the plaintiffs, didn’t immediately return a voicemail message seeking comment.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The trial for a former state lawmaker accused of raping a 19-year-old legislative intern began Tuesday with a prosecutor telling jurors the case was about power imbalances and the defense saying the sex was consensual. Aaron von Ehlinger was charged with rape and penetration with a foreign object, both felonies, last year after the young Statehouse staffer reported a sexual assault in March 2021. “This case is about power – power wielded in the wrong hands,” Ada County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Katelyn Farley told the jury. “The defendant, Mr. von Ehlinger, wielded that power against a 19-year-old intern,” Farley said, telling jurors that they would hear several ways in which the intern tried to resist the lawmaker’s advances. Von Ehlinger’s attorney, John Cox, told jurors the intern and his client had passionate consensual sexual contact. He said the intern stayed at von Ehlinger’s apartment for a time after the sexual contact. The allegations first came to light during the 2021 legislative session after the intern told a Statehouse supervisor that von Ehlinger raped her at his apartment after the two had dinner at a restaurant. At the time, von Ehlinger was a representative from Lewiston, but he resigned after an ethics committee unanimously agreed he engaged in “behavior unbecoming” and recommended he be suspended without pay for the rest of the session. Von Ehlinger, 38, has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which carry maximum penalties of life in prison.\n\nIllinois\n\nCrestwood: A former suburban Chicago mayor was sentenced Monday to a year in federal prison for taking $5,000 to help a red-light camera company. Louis Presta, 72, resigned as Crestwood’s mayor in November when he pleaded guilty to felony counts of official misconduct and other crimes. According to his plea agreement, Presta took the money in exchange for helping the company, SafeSpeed LLC, put more cameras in the southwest suburb as well as increase revenues from existing cameras by approving more violations. Presta, a Democrat first elected mayor in 2013, held back tears as he spoke to the judge, apologizing to his wife and residents. “I’m so sorry for bringing this scandal to the village of Crestwood,” he said. “I never thought that I’d be a criminal defendant.” U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin said the corruption damaged Crestwood. He could have ordered a longer sentence but noted Presta’s ailing health and several letters of support. Omar Maani was an executive at SafeSpeed. He was cooperating with the FBI, and the exchange of cash was recorded on a camera. “SafeSpeed had no knowledge of this criminal conduct, and SafeSpeed certainly did not authorize it and does not condone it,” the company said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department has suspended the officers involved and launched two investigations after a man in custody died after being hit with a stun gun. The department’s Critical Incident Response Team responded to the scene of the incident early Monday on the city’s northeast side to conduct a criminal investigation. The department’s Internal Affairs department is conducting a separate investigation, IMPD said. The civilian-majority Use of Force Review Board will conduct a separate review after the other two investigations are complete. Officers were told by a father that his son, Herman Whitfield III, 39, was experiencing a mental health issue and needed an ambulance, police said. Officers requested an ambulance after they saw Whitfield moving through the home naked, sweating and bleeding from his mouth, police said. He moved to parts of the home where officers lost sight of him several times. Officers had tried negotiating and using de-escalation tactics for more than 10 minutes when Whitfield moved quickly toward an officer, police said. “The officer activated the Taser twice and the man continued to resist,” police said in a new release. Officers handcuffed the man, but medics received no response from him, and they began CPR, police said. Whitfield was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.\n\nIowa\n\nAltoona: A former rides manager at Adventureland told state investigators probing last year’s fatal accident on the amusement park’s Raging River that “duct tape and bubble gum, basically,” were being used to keep rides operating. The spinning Tea Cups children’s ride was propped up with bits of 2-by-4s. The Falling Star “leaked oil and started on fire.” Access hatches popped open on the Lighthouse drop tower. The safety restraints on the Outlaw and the Tornado roller coasters broke. Bolts came out of the Himalaya coaster “all the time.” Adventureland maintenance crews were “using duct tape and bubble gum basically to keep those rides afloat,” Melvin McCollum told Iowa Division of Labor officials in a telephone interview, one of a series of recorded conversations with park employees, witnesses and others in connection with the accident that killed a Marion boy. “It’s such a beautiful park, and I just hope that maybe by me saying something that the accident that tragically happened will never happen again,” McCollum said. A lawyer for the park’s then-owners disputes the allegations and McCollum’s basis for making them. “I’m sorry, but these uninformed sensational comments by Mr. McCollum are untrue,” attorney Guy Cook wrote in an email.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly’s campaign to axe the food sales tax ran into a political meat grinder Tuesday when Republican legislators voted down a procedural move from Democrats to advance a plan that has been blocked by GOP leadership since January. House Democrats attempted to force action on HB 2487, Kelly’s plan to cut the state sales tax on groceries to 0% starting July 1. The bill has been stuck in a tax committee, where it never received a vote. The procedural motion from Rep. Jim Gartner, D-Topeka, to pull the bill to the House floor failed 48-74. Ten Republicans sided with Democrats. “What are you doing with that sales tax on food? Are you going to get it done this session?” Gartner said constituents asked him during the three-week legislative break. “I hope we eliminate it totally.” A Republican plan to gradually reduce the food sales tax could still come from the legislative sausage factory. The proposal would wait until after Election Day to make the first installment in cutting the rate to 0% in 2025. That bill, HB 2106, was drafted by a group of six lawmakers in a conference committee after senators indicated that GOP leadership opposed a large cut this summer. It cannot be amended on the floor of either chamber.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear cleared the way Tuesday for a cannabis research center to open as he reviews whether he has the executive authority to single-handedly legalize medical marijuana in the state. The governor revealed his action on a bill authorizing the research center at the University of Kentucky. The measure won overwhelming approval from lawmakers on the final day of this year’s legislative session earlier this month. In his review, the governor preserved the language creating the center. He said he used his line-item veto authority to broaden the center’s work and allow more leeway in picking an oversight board. The Democratic governor’s line-item vetoes will stand since the Republican-dominated Legislature won’t reconvene until January 2023 for its next regular session. In the final weeks of this year’s session, key lawmakers resisting the legalization of medical cannabis pushed for the research center as an alternative. It would allow more time to study the effectiveness of marijuana in treating certain ailments, they said. A separate bill to legalize medical marijuana passed the state House but died in the Senate this year. The legalization bill would have strictly regulated the use of cannabis for a list of eligible medical conditions, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, epilepsy and chronic nausea.\n\nLouisiana\n\nHouma: Move over, Memphis and Cleveland. Louisiana’s rock ’n’ roll roots run deep, from New Orleans to Shreveport to Ferriday, and state Rep. Tanner Magee wants to lay claim to what he contends is rock ’n’ roll’s true birthplace. Magee’s House Bill 889 would create America’s Rock and Roll Museum in New Orleans, aligned with the legendary Dew Drop Inn hotel and nightclub on LaSalle Street. Black musicians stayed and performed at the inn from the 1940s until it closed in the ’70s. “You could argue the Dew Drop is where the birth of rock ’n’ roll took place,” said Preston Lauterbach, author of “The Chitlin’ Circuit and the Road to Rock ’n’ Roll.” “The New Orleans culture mixed with the touring artists who were coming through. That’s what really made it a special place.” A second measure from Magee, House Bill 895, would create the LaSalle Cultural Corridor for neighborhood development, anchored by the museum and the under-renovation inn. Magee, a rock ’n’ roll history buff with a dizzying array of albums at his home in Houma, notes New Orleans favorite son Fats Domino recorded “The Fat Man” in 1949, two years before Ike Turner’s “Rocket 88” was cut at Memphis’ Sun Records studio. Sun and other sources cite “Rocket 88” as the first rock ’n’ roll record. “This is categorically untrue,” Magee said.\n\nMaine\n\nEliot: After fending off death, a critically injured common snapping turtle that became a viral sensation after being struck by a motorist last year has been released back into the wild. The Center for Wildlife in Cape Neddick has been treating and rehabilitating the wounded male reptile since late last year, when he was admitted after being found by a mother and daughter on the side of an Eliot road last September. A video of the animal – which sustained a major fracture of his shell and wounds that stretched into his organs – cautiously drinking water last year at the Center for Wildlife quickly went viral on social media. For a substantial period of time, Center for Wildlife employees would carry him from a tub into a private room with a sink so he could take sips of water. The reptile’s deep wounds meant he could not be submerged because he could essentially drown if water seeped into his shell. Two surgeries and several months of incremental progress later, he’s back in an outdoor freshwater setting. Center for Wildlife Executive Director Kristen Lamb said the turtle weighs about 20 pounds and is likely about 40 years old. Before Tuesday’s release, Lamb said, the patient had become a bit more “grumpy” with staff, occasionally snapping in their direction when tending to him. “That means he’ll be ready and do a good job protecting himself,” Lamb said before his release.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The decade­long process to finalize the location of the third span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is over, with the site chosen to be within 2 miles of the current Bay Bridge. The Maryland Transportation Authority announced in 2019 that 14 proposed locations had been narrowed down to three. Mounting infrastructure concerns and spot repairs have led to a crescendo of support for the new span, namely from Gov. Larry Hogan, as traffic is only expected to increase on the outdated bridge. While some Eastern Shore residents have decried the amount of potential additional traffic, especially through residential areas while using apps like Google Maps, others welcome the boon for tourist-dependent locations such as Ocean City and Rehoboth Beach. The need for a third span, the transportation authority said, is clear given that summer weekend traffic on the bridge is typically more than 118,600 vehicles. Non-summer weekends dip to more than 68,000 vehicles. By 2040, those totals are expected to balloon to 135,300 vehicles on summer weekends and 84,300 vehicles on non-summer weekends. The selected location runs along the existing Bay Bridge corridor on Route 50/301 to Route 50 between Crofton and Queenstown.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPittsfield: The Berkshires, one of the state’s most popular touríst destinations, will be easier to reach for the next two summers with the launch of seasonal Amtrak service from New York City. The Berkshire Flyer service will start July 8 and operate on weekends during the summer with a Friday afternoon departure from New York’s Penn Station to Pittsfield, with several stops including Albany, New York, and a return trip Sunday afternoon, officials said Monday. The service is a collaboration among Amtrak, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, and the New York State Department of Transportation. The goal is to boost tourist access to the world-renowned museums, concert venues and outdoor activities in the region, officials said. “Western Massachusetts and the Berkshire region offer a whole host of cultural and recreational opportunities during the summer and we hope this pilot service will encourage even more visitors to this part of our state,” Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement. The service will be evaluated after the two-year pilot program to determine its long-term feasibility. Tickets will be available starting next month.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A Saginaw doctor has been charged with a federal hate crime for allegedly intimidating Black Lives Matter supporters in a series of actions involving nooses and threatening messages left for Starbucks employees across the state, the Department of Justice announced Wednesday. According to court documents, Kenneth Pilon, 61, an optometrist, called nine Starbucks stores across the state in 2020 and told the person who answered the phone to relay a specific message laden with hate slurs to any Starbucks employees wearing a BLM T-shirt. He also allegedly told one employee he wanted to lynch a Black person. Pilon left the messages in the summer of 2020, two days after Starbucks announced it would provide 250,000 BLM T-shirts to employees who wanted to wear them during their shifts, according to the documents. One month after making those calls, court records show, Pilon left nooses in Kroger and Walmart parking lots in Saginaw, including one he tucked inside a beverage cooler at a 7-Eleven store with a hand-written note attached that read: “An accessory to be worn with your ‘BLM’ t-shirt. Happy protesting!’ ” Pilon is charged with six counts of interfering with federally protected activities, a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minneapolis Police Department has engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade, including stopping and arresting Black people at a higher rate than white people, using force more often on people of color, and maintaining a culture where racist language is tolerated, a state investigation launched after George Floyd’s killing found. The report released Wednesday by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights following a nearly two-year investigation said the agency and the city would negotiate a court-enforceable agreement to address the long list of problems identified in the report, with input from residents, officers, city staff and others. The report said police department data “demonstrates significant racial disparities with respect to officers’ use of force, traffic stops, searches, citations, and arrests.” And it said officers “used covert social media to surveil Black individuals and Black organizations, unrelated to criminal activity, and maintain an organizational culture where some officers and supervisors use racist, misogynistic, and disrespectful language with impunity.” Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said during a news conference after the report was released that it doesn’t single out any officers or city leaders. “This investigation is not about one individual or one incident,” she said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state needs to update its Supreme Court districts to ensure Black voters have a chance to elect a candidate of their choice in a state with a history of racially polarized voting, Black plaintiffs said in a lawsuit filed Monday. Mississippi’s three districts for its high court are all majority-white, and they were last updated in 1987 over the objection of Black legislators, the lawsuit said. It alleges the districts violate the Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution by diluting Black voting strength. About 38% of Mississippi residents are Black. Eight of the nine current justices are white, and one is Black. Four Black justices have served on the Mississippi Supreme Court – never more than one at a time. The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Mississippi, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the New York-based law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett filed the lawsuit in federal court in Greenville on behalf of four Black residents of Mississippi. Ty Pinkins of Vicksburg, one of the plaintiffs and an attorney who works in the majority-Black Mississippi Delta, said it’s important that his relatives and neighbors feel they are fairly represented at all levels of government, including in the judicial system.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The GOP-led state House on Monday voted to limit the public high school sports teams on which transgender athletes can compete. House members voted 93-41 to require transgender students to compete only on teams that match the “biological sex” listed on their birth certificates. The provision was added to Republican Rep. Kurtis Gregory’s bill on public school busing – a tactic often used to pass legislation as the end of session nears. Lawmakers face a May 13 deadline to send bills to Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s desk. Amendment sponsor GOP Rep. Ron Copeland said he wants to ban transgender girls from competing on girls’ sports teams but doesn’t care if transgender boys compete with other boys, although his proposal would prevent both. “As a father, my daughters should not have to play against a male in sports,” Copeland said. Democratic Rep. Ian Mackey, who is gay, cautioned lawmakers about how a vote against transgender athletes will be perceived in the future. “Your vote on the record will last forever,” Mackey said. “And I can guarantee you that while not all of you will regret it, I know that some of you looking at me right now will. Do the right thing.”\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The latest season of “Yellowstone,” filmed near Missoula and the Bitterroot Valley, brought $72million of qualified spending to the state in 2021. The report produced by the University of Montana’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research showed the state’s economy with “Yellowstone” resulted in 527 more jobs, $25.3 million in annual personal income, and $85.8 million in additional gross receipts to Montana businesses and organizations. It also resulted in $10.6 million of revenue to the state government. The MEDIA Coalition of Montana and the Paramount Network paid for the study. Another benefit of “Yellowstone” that was not included in the economic impact study but mentioned in the report is the free advertising Montana gets from the show. “The visual depiction of our state that increases exposure and awareness of our physical landscape, culture and history to audiences that are potentially global. While it is difficult to quantify, the image of Montana that is projected to mass audiences through film production is arguably important in selling the state as a place to visit or even relocate,” the report said. The report comes as the Legislature’s Interim Revenue Committee considers drafting legislation to raise the state’s film tax credit.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The city will pay $497,500 to a woman who says she was injured when police fired rubber bullets during racial justice protests in May 2020. Elise Poole, now 20, alleged in a lawsuit that she was fleeing from tear gas fired by law enforcement officers at protesters near downtown Lincoln on May 31, 2020, when she was hit by a rubber bullet. She required emergency surgery to reattach her nose and will require further surgery to regain normal breathing, according to her attorney. Daniel Gutman, an attorney litigating the case on behalf of the ACLU of Nebraska, said the lawsuit successfully held law enforcement accountable for responding to peaceful protests with dangerous weapons, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. City Attorney Yohance Christie said officials don’t know what caused Poole’s injury. He said that gasoline, fireworks and other dangerous objects were thrown at officers during the May 29-June 1 protests and that more than two dozen officers were injured.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The consensus Republican front-runner for governor drew attention and applause from a GOP luncheon audience Tuesday when he used an expletive to deride Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak’s decision to enact a state-managed public health insurance option. Answering a question about homelessness, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo expressed frustration about people who don’t or won’t accept help from public services. He said he wanted to stop the Clark County jail from being the “No. 1 facility” for mental health services in Nevada. “A very small percentage are homeless due to circumstances out of their control,” said Lombardo, who served two terms as nonpartisan elected head of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. “You have to hold them accountable and, unfortunately, society is turning a blind eye to that issue. The governor can make that a priority,” he said, referring to Sisolak. “He said his priority is health. And he’s talking about bull---- things like the public option.” Last year Sisolak signed Nevada’s public health care option into law, amid projections it will lower insurance premium costs 15% for participants by 2026. Sisolak campaign aide Reeves Oyster responded to Lombardo’s comment with a statement saying 350,000 Nevada residents will benefit from the law, pointing to the coronavirus pandemic, and accusing Lombardo of siding with “big insurance over Nevada families in need of health care.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Lawmakers in the state House will vote next week on a congressional map built around the Interstate 93 corridor despite opposition from Gov. Chris Sununu. The House Special Committee on Redistricting voted 8-7 on Wednesday to recommend a plan that creates a new, Republican-leaning 1st Congressional District by clumping together towns and cities along I-93 in the southern half of the state, with the 2nd District reaching up and around it on both sides. Sununu has promised to veto an earlier plan passed by both the House and Senate and has indicated the new one falls short as well. Both seats are held by Democrats, but the new plan would put both their hometowns in the 1st District. It also would move several current candidates for the GOP nomination in the 1st District to the 2nd. Candidates are not required to live in the district they seek to represent. The map’s creator, Rep. Ross Berry, said he did not take incumbency into account but focused on achieving as even a population split as possible, keeping counties intact, and grouping together communities with similar economic interests. The current map hasn’t changed drastically since 1880, but Berry argued it should be abandoned because it was drawn to dilute the Catholic vote. Democrats – who favored moving just a single town, Hampstead, from the 1st District to the 2nd – noted that every map since 1880 has been created by Republicans.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Residents of a pollution-choked neighborhood said Tuesday that they’re tired of their community being used as a dumping ground for projects that foul their air yet exclude them from the economic benefits of industry. In an online public hearing, residents of Newark’s Ironbound section denounced a plan by a sewage treatment facility to build a backup gas-fired power plant designed to keep the treatment plant operating when the power goes out. The Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission is seeking a state environmental permit to build the largest portion of the $180 million backup facility. The nation’s fifth-largest sewage treatment plant accepts liquid waste shipped from communities ranging from Maine to Virginia and is the largest single-site user of electricity in New Jersey. But it has become a cause célèbre among community activists and a key test of an environmental justice law that Gov. Phil Murphy signed in 2020. The law is designed to prevent communities already overburdened with pollution from having to accept additional contamination sources. “I have a hard time breathing on a lot of days, and a lot of it comes from your plant,” said Lenny Thomas, who lives in the Ironbound, which got its nickname from the railroad tracks that surround it on three sides. “This has been going on for decades. It’s not just, it’s not right, and it’s not fair.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Native American leaders said Tuesday that they were excited about a series of meetings this week with land managers as the Biden administration considers prohibiting new oil and gas development on hundreds of square miles of federal land in northwestern New Mexico that several tribes consider sacred. Top officials with the All Pueblo Council of Governors said during a virtual briefing that they will reiterate their support for the proposal during tribal consultations. The meetings are part of the public outreach being done by the U.S. Interior Department as it considers the withdrawal from nearly 550 square miles around Chaco Culture National Historical Park. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, from Laguna Pueblo, cited the cultural significance of the area surrounding the national park when she first proposed the 20-year withdrawal during a visit in November. She has said many tribes in the Southwest, including her own, have a connection to the area. Randall Vicente, governor of Acoma Pueblo, said tribes were ready to band together to ensure more permanent protections are adopted for lands outside park boundaries. He said the remnants of stone dwellings, ceremonial kivas, pottery sherds, petroglyphs, shrines and the other cultural resources that dot the high desert around Chaco Canyon were left there by the ancestors of today’s pueblo people. “Together, this area is one irreplaceable, sacred, interconnected landscape unlike any other. We remain tied to those resources,” he said, describing them as “the footprints and fingerprints of our ancestors.” A World Heritage site, Chaco park is thought to be the center of what was once a hub of Indigenous civilization.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Meaningful changes could be implemented within days at the troubled Rikers Island jail complex, the head of New York City’s jails told a federal judge Tuesday. The city has insisted that years of failed reforms could be overcome without the court taking control of the nation’s second-largest jail system. “You will see change,” Department of Correction Commissioner Louis Molina promised Judge Laura Taylor Swain. Molina said he’s “in alignment” with recommendations from Steve Martin, a monitor tasked with reporting on changes that are needed at a jail system which includes Rikers Island, where about 5,500 inmates are held. In a recent report, Martin said about 30% of the workforce at the jails was not coming to work or not available to work with inmates. On Tuesday, he said of Molina: “Every time I’ve called on the commissioner for a remedy or attention, he has stepped up.” Sixteen inmates died at Rikers last year, and three have died so far in 2022. Molina spoke after he was ordered to appear by the judge after she received a scathing letter about the jails from prosecutors, who suggested Molina appear before the court as they warned that court oversight of the jail system might be necessary.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A loaded gun was found in U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn’s carry-on bag at an airport security checkpoint Tuesday – the second time he has been stopped with a gun at an airport in the past 14 months, officials said. When Cawthorn went through checkpoint D at Charlotte Douglas International Airport with the 9 mm Staccato C2 about 9 a.m., Transportation Security Administration officers notified Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police officers on standby in the area, TSA spokesperson R. Carter Langston said. Responding officers identified the 26-year-old Republican as the owner of the bag where the gun was found, police said in a statement. Cawthorn acknowledged the gun was his and cooperated with officers, authorities said. He was issued a citation for possession of a dangerous weapon on city property, a misdemeanor. Cawthorn was released, but police held on to the firearm, as is routine. The infraction is punishable by civil penalties, including a fine of up to $13,900 depending on certain factors, such as whether a firearm is loaded and the presence of multiple offenses, Langston said, noting this was the second time in recent history that a gun was found in Cawthorn’s carry-on bag. The first was at an Asheville Regional Airport checkpoint in February 2021.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s oil industry wants lawmakers to change the framework for taxing crude production that abolishes the price-based triggers that have been in place for decades. Unless oil prices suddenly decline, North Dakota’s treasury may start reaping the benefits of a tax increase on drillers that could bump state tax collections by tens of millions of dollars in the current two-year budget cycle. The present situation with high crude prices is in contrast to just a few years ago when low oil prices threatened to trigger a tax break for drillers that would have cost the state lost revenue. Abolishing oil-tax triggers gives drillers certainty and keeps the industry’s jobs and revenue flowing, said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, a group that represents several hundred companies working in the state’s oil patch. Companies could leave North Dakota, the nation’s No. 3 oil producer, and focus drilling in other states that have a better and more certain tax climate, he said. “Taxing oil more gets you less,” said Ness, who wants a flat tax on oil production. “The roller coaster prices we’ve seen really mean that we need to be concerned about keeping investment (in North Dakota), “ he said. “Predictability where possible is key.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A federal jury has rejected allegations that police used excessive force when they fatally shot a man in 2016 during an undercover operation, an episode that led to heightened criticism of actions by Columbus police. The city has said 23-year-old Henry Green, who was Black, ignored commands to drop his gun by Officers Zachary Rosen and Jason Bare, who are white. Court documents and depositions say Green shot at the undercover officers, who then returned fire. Green’s family has argued Green fired after police shot at him. Columbus, the state’s largest city, has experienced multiple protests in recent years over the killing of Black men and children, including last year’s fatal shooting of 16-year-old Ma’Kiah Bryant. A grand jury declined to indict the white officer who shot Bryant as she swung a knife at a young woman. The officer said he feared for the other woman’s life. A grand jury had also declined to indict officers Rosen and Bare in Green’s killing, and an internal Columbus police investigation cleared them. A federal judge dismissed the excessive force lawsuit brought by Green’s family in September 2019, finding it was reasonable to use deadly force under the circumstances. But a federal appeals court reinstated it a year later, determining a jury could “reasonably conclude” there wasn’t justification for the officers to use force in this context. The first trial ended in a mistrial in November 2021. On Monday, a unanimous jury sided with the city after a short deliberation, acquitting Rosen and Bare of excessive force and assault and battery allegations.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill Tuesday explicitly prohibiting the use of nonbinary gender markers on state birth certificates, a ban experts say is the first of its kind in the nation. The bill followed a flap last year over the Oklahoma State Department of Health’s agreement in a civil case allowing a nonbinary option. The birth certificate in that case was issued to an Oklahoma-born Oregon resident who sued after the agency initially refused the request. People who are nonbinary do not identify with traditional male or female gender assignments. News of the settlement prompted outrage among Republicans, including Stitt, who along with fellow conservatives in a number of GOP-led states has been engaged in a culture war over issues like restricting LGBTQ and abortion rights that drive the party’s base in an election year. Stitt’s appointee to lead the agency abruptly resigned the next day, and the governor then promptly issued an executive order prohibiting any changes to a person’s gender on birth certificates, despite the settlement agreement. A civil rights group has challenged the executive order in federal court, but the state has not yet responded. Many states only offer male or female gender options on birth certificates, but Oklahoma is the first to write the nonbinary prohibition into law, according to Lambda Legal, the civil rights group suing Oklahoma.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: Two areas off the state’s coast are being targeted to host offshore wind farms as the Biden administration seeks to ramp up renewable energy production. The U.S. Department of the Interior announced Wednesday that the locations being identified to potentially host wind farms are about 12 nautical miles offshore Coos Bay and Brookings. The areas comprise about 1.16 million acres in total. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland described the upcoming steps taken toward possible leasing off the coast of Oregon as “another opportunity to strengthen the clean energy industry while creating good-paying union jobs.” Any offers to lease waters off the Oregon Coast would require environmental review and consultations with local, state and tribal governments. The agency is seeking public comments on how wind development would affect marine life and other ocean uses, such as commercial fishing in the areas, until June 29, 2022. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports this is the first big regulatory step toward bringing an offshore wind project to the Pacific Northwest state. Late last year, Interior said that the Oregon Coast was being targeted by the agency for offshore wind energy production because it has some of the best wind resources in the country.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Police arrested a man Wednesday who is accused of at least two sexual assaults, including one reported Sunday aboard a subway train. A police spokesperson said late Tuesday in an email that officers were looking for 28-year-old Quintez Adams in relation to two assaults this month. Police announced Wednesday afternoon that Adams was taken into custody and had been taken to a hospital for evaluation. Court records did not contain current charges or information on an attorney who could speak on Adams’ behalf. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority officials confirmed its officers are reviewing surveillance video as part of a police investigation into Sunday’s assault. Police did not release many details of the assault, which came about six months after a much-publicized rape on a commuter train in October while other passengers were present. Fiston Ngoy, 35, is charged with rape and related offenses in that attack. It was unclear whether other passengers were on the train Sunday. Adams was wanted in relation to a reported sexual assault the afternoon of April 4 at 7th and Market streets and in the Sunday assault, which happened shortly after noon. Only one of the sexual assaults happened on SEPTA property, spokesperson Andrew Busch said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee announced Wednesday that he has appointed Lt. Col. Darnell Weaver to be the next superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police, making him the first person of color to command the department. Weaver will assume the rank of colonel during a swearing-in ceremony Friday at the State House. He takes over from Col. James Manni, who is retiring to become town manager of South Kingstown. Manni was appointed by former Gov. Gina Raimondo in 2018. Weaver, who is Black, is a Marine Corps veteran who has been with the state police for 28 years, according to the governor’s office. “Lt. Colonel Darnell Weaver has a proven record of public service and strong leadership,” McKee wrote in a tweet. As deputy superintendent and chief of field operations, he oversees patrol, detective and administrative bureaus, the specialty units and the Department of Public Safety, according to the state police website. He has previously served in all the state police barracks and as night executive officer and assistant patrol commander of the Hope Valley and Wickford barracks. He has been a district commander and the officer in charge at the State Police Training Academy.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Several civil rights groups are suing the state over conditions at its juvenile lockups, alleging that children in state custody are subject to violence and isolation while deprived of educational or rehabilitative programs. The lawsuit filed in federal court Tuesday comes less than two weeks after officials at the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice agreed to make changes at its main detention center following a federal investigation that found the state was violating the civil rights of youths housed there. But that agreement doesn’t go far enough because it only addresses issues at the Broad River Road Complex in Columbia, the groups said in their complaint, arguing that the Department of Juvenile Justice also needs to fix conditions at four other facilities across the state. Echoing findings by federal and state investigators in recent years, the complaint describes routine youth-on-youth violence and violence by staff against the youths that agency employees often ignore or enable. Children who commit minor infractions are also placed in isolation for up to 23 hours a day. One officer told a 16-year-old who was assaulted by three other children earlier this year to stay away from facility cameras so he would not be seen bleeding, the complaint alleges. Another child was beaten and choked by five members of the agency’s police force while handcuffed and shackled over accusations of robbing staff; he was then hogtied and blocked from filing a grievance, according to the complaint.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Ranchers say moisture from recent scattered rains is a welcome addition but nowhere near the amount needed to get South Dakota pastures back on track for normal production. The South Dakota Grassland Coalition is urging ranchers to plan ahead. Bart Carmichael, of Faith, a coalition board member, said part of his drought plan included selling half of his cow herd over the last year. “Not planning is a plan to fail; I really believe that,” Carmichael said. Almost 90% of the state remains in severe or moderate drought or is considered abnormally dry, according to the latest U.S. Drought Monitor. Ryan Beer, a rangeland management specialist with the Natural Resources Conservation Service in Bison, said up to 150% of normal rainfall would be needed in May and June to get back to normal forage production. Carmichael said he looks at drought as a way to improve his management skills, in part by ranking his cows from most to least desirable. Once you put a cow in the cull group, he said, it takes the emotion out of selling them. “It’s hard to look at drought making things better, but that’s our outlook on it,” Carmichael said.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: The annual lottery to view the synchronous fireflies in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park opens Friday. Every year in late May to early June, thousands of visitors gather near the Elkmont Campground to observe the Photinus carolinus, a firefly species that flashes synchronously. Since 2006, access to the area has been limited during the eight days of predicted peak activity in order to reduce congestion and minimize the disturbance to the fireflies during their peak mating period. This year, park scientists predict that period will be June 3-10, according to a park news release. Those wishing for a vehicle pass can enter the lottery on the recreation.gov website. A total of 800 vehicle passes, 100 passes per night, will be issued. All lottery applicants will be charged a $1 application fee. Successful applicants will automatically be awarded parking passes and charged a $24 reservation fee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Texas National Guard member who drowned on the U.S.-Mexico border while on duty was not equipped with a flotation device when he jumped in the Rio Grande to help a migrant who was struggling to swim across, state officials said Wednesday. Spc. Bishop Evans, who was missing three days before search crews found his body Monday, was among the more than 6,100 Guard members stationed on the border as part of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s massive border security mission known as Operation Lone Star. The mission has 43 flotation devices for Guard members who are assigned to boat missions, Maj. Gen. Thomas Suelzer said. Evans was not a boat crew member. Requests for more flotation devices were first made in February but have been delayed by supply chain issues, Suelzer told lawmakers in the Texas Capitol while facing questions about Evans’ death, low morale and equipment shortages that have rattled the yearlong mission. Guard leaders defended not issuing all soldiers flotation devices, saying many are stationed on land. Suelzer said that since Evans’ death, Guard members have been instructed not to go in the water unless they have special training. “(He) was a human being,” Suelzer said. “He saw a human being drowning, and he jumped in the water to save them.” Evans is at least the fifth Guard member who has died during the mission, a number that included suicides, said state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat has called for an inquest into the deaths.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Zion National Park is seeking pets for its newest ranger recruitment. The B.A.R.K. Ranger program, already in place in national parks including Yosemite, Acadia and Glacier, is touted as part of an effort to “protect you, your pet and the park while you are here.” “The park mission is to get folks out here, to preserve the resources that we have and to encourage enjoyment and education and inspiration,” Lead Ranger Ben Gibson said. “And with B.A.R.K. Ranger is just one more way that we can get folks out into the park and better educate them on how to do so safely and responsibly.” B.A.R.K. stands for a reminder to dog lovers in the great outdoors: Bag your pet’s waste. Always leash your pet. Respect wildlife. Know where you can go. With extreme summer temperatures bringing scorching pavement, other unpredictable weather, crowding and cyanobacteria in the Virgin River, Zion officials are hoping the program will help people strategize when and how to bring their pets. “The park is learning a lot about the cyanobacteria issue as the days weeks, months and years go on, and whatever we can communicate to folks just so they can be aware and be safe with their pets in the park is one of the primary goals,” Gibson said. Cyanobacteria, a harmful algal bloom in the Virgin River, was first reported in July 2020 with the death of 6-month-old puppy Keanna after she played in the river along the Pa’rus Trail, the only trail in the park that allows pets.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Police say they are investigating a broken window at the office of an organization dedicated to the health and safety of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people as a possible hate crime. Police say surveillance video showed an individual approach the office of the Pride Center of Vermont just after midnight Tuesday and throw two objects. Officials at the Pride Center discovered a broken window in the center’s door when they arrived Tuesday morning. Mayor Miro Weinberger said he was troubled to learn about the vandalism. “Our city is using its full resources to investigate who committed this crime and why,” Weinberger said in a statement. “Acts of hate have no place in Burlington.” Burlington’s acting police chief, Jon Murad, said officers are investigating the vandalism “with an eye toward the very real possibility that it was motivated by malice related to the Pride Center.” Police said that when a crime in Vermont is determined to have been maliciously motivated, it may be enhanced as a hate crime, which means the perpetrator can be given additional penalties at sentencing.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia has renewed an order banning an organizer of the Unite the Right rally from the school’s grounds, a university police spokeswoman said. The department issued a no-trespassing order against Jason Kessler in 2018 after a clash with students at the School of Law library and renewed the order last week, The Daily Progress reports. In the original order, police cited reports that Kessler threatened students based on protected characteristics and said he intentionally misled police about his torch march held at the university the night before the rally. The new superseding notice was issued April 20 for the same reasons, the university said in a statement Tuesday. It will be in effect until further notice. These orders can be reissued before the four-year expiration if a person is “engaged in ongoing conduct that threatens the health, safety, or property of a member of the university or its Medical Center community, a patient or visitor at the Medical Center, the educational process, or for other reasons.” Kessler, a UVa graduate, appealed the order in 2018, accusing students “of being evidence of Jews following him around and harassing him” and saying he was the victim of racial harassment. But an independent consultant upheld the university’s decision that Kessler had intentionally misled police about the march, which ended in violence and turned deadly the next day when a self-avowed admirer of Adolf Hitler rammed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A civilian oversight board says some police officers routinely – and illegally – ignored state and city mask mandates during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and refused to obey direct orders from the chief to comply. The Seattle Times reports that a recently released review by the Office of Inspector General exposed a “serious cultural issue” within the city’s police department. The report says the agency was fined $17,500 last year after receiving two notices of “serious violations” of the Washington Administrative Code over officers’ refusal to comply with the mandates after inspections by the state Department of Labor and Industries. The report noted it was difficult for command staff to demand officers comply with the regulations because some captains and assistant chiefs didn’t mask up, either. L&I concluded the police department “did not provide a workplace free from recognized hazards that are causing, or likely to cause, serious injury or death.” The department’s OIG, one of three civilian-run police oversight agencies, said the police chief gave officers “clear direction” and “explicit orders” about mask-wearing as early as March 2020 – followed by a string of increasingly stern reminders.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A political candidate who was not a registered Republican when he filed papers to run for a House of Delegates seat in the upcoming GOP primary said Tuesday that it was a simple oversight and that he plans to continue with his campaign. Bob Fehrenbacher is running against incumbent Del. Roger Conley in the May 10 primary for the District 11 seat representing portions of Wood County. Forms that candidates fill out to run for office must be signed and notarized. They specifically require candidates to attest to their party affiliation. Fehrenbacher said in an interview that when he signed his candidacy papers in January, “I thought in good faith that I was registered as a Republican. Much to my surprise, I was not. And as soon as that came to my attention, I immediately went into the West Virginia secretary of state’s system and changed it. I should have checked, and I did not do that.” The West Virginia Republican Party said in a statement that Fehrenbacher instead was an unaffiliated voter when he filed his papers and did not register as a GOP voter until late March. “Simply put, lying on a sworn statement is not acceptable behavior for those who wish to be elected officials,” GOP chairman Mark Harris said in the statement, calling on Fehrenbacher to withdraw from the race “for the good of the West Virginia Republican Party and our voters.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nKewaunee: One of the state’s largest dairy farms is suing the Department of Natural Resources over changes to its wastewater permit that require the operators to limit the size of their herd and begin monitoring groundwater in an area where nitrate contamination has occurred. Kinnard Farms in Kewaunee County said in its complaint that the business will be harmed if it isn’t allowed to expand its herd and will be burdened by the cost of a groundwater monitoring system. Farm operators say the monitoring system will cost tens of thousands of dollars initially, plus the fees indefinitely paid to experts to sample, analyze and interpret data from the wells. The Kinnard operation includes 16 industrial farms with about 8,000 cows. It has struggled with agricultural pollution for years as contaminants began showing up in private wells. In a statement Tuesday, the Kinnard family said it remains committed to regenerative agriculture practices and sustainability. “On-farm practices such as planting cover crops, limited soil tillage (known as no-till), sand and water recycling and more demonstrate our dedication to protecting groundwater in our community,” the family said. “We continue to invest in cutting-edge innovation to protect our environment.” The permit changes are seen as a big win for area residents, who said they felt like it was the first time the DNR had listened to their concerns about their water in public hearings and submitted testimony.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state Department of Transportation says work has been bumped up on a highway slide-stabilization project after a weekend rockslide, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. According to K2 Radio News, members of a varsity soccer team from Powell stopped on their way back from a game and helped to move rocks from the roadway.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/23/nuns-donate-home-canines-court-swine-control-news-around-states/118941372/", "title": "Nuns donate home, canines in court: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: Archaeologists are analyzing pieces of pottery, nails and glass found at Pope’s Tavern, an inn and stagecoach stop for travelers dating back to the early 1800s before Alabama achieved statehood. A state team funded by a grant recently conducted a dig at the northwest Alabama site, which has a museum that focuses on the history of the city of Florence. Museum curator Brian Murphy told the TimesDaily pottery was the most common item discovered during the work. “They pulled out a bunch of artifacts that are being cleaned and processed right now,” Murphy said. “They will give us a really good image of the types of materials and type of utensils used, and really a glimpse into the daily life of the people who lived there and used that space.” The crew also found the brick remains of an old structure that could have been a hearth or outbuilding, he said. “They are seeing what type of materials are associated with that, using flotation, which brings up microscopic material to a level that can be processed. After they do that, they’re going to get back to us with the larger picture of what it all means and what might be under there still that could be the source of a future excavation,” he said. Pope’s Tavern was built in the the 1830s, he said, and artifacts found on the grounds dated to the 1820s and ’30s.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Officials are aiming to make the first wave of dividend payments to state residents the week of Oct. 11, a Department of Revenue spokesperson said. Genevieve Wojtusik, the department’s legislative liaison, said in an email Wednesday that the first wave would include those who filed for dividends electronically. She said the second mass payments, which would include those who filed paper applications, would go out about two weeks later. The Legislature last week approved $730.5 million for dividends this year of about $1,100 and for administrative and other related costs. Wojtusik said the final check amount is being calculated and is expected to be announced by Oct. 1. Dividends typically are paid in the early fall, but this year’s payout wasn’t finalized until the third special session of the year, which ended last week. Lawmakers earlier this year proposed a roughly $1,100 dividend, using money from various sources, but failed to win sufficient support for use of some of the funds. What was left at that time was a dividend estimated to be $525, which Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: This year’s wet monsoon is contributing to a record-high season for the West Nile virus, which is spread through mosquito bites, health officials said. Arizona had 123 cases and four deaths through late last week, the state Department of Health Services said Tuesday. Nearly all of the cases were reported in Maricopa County, where the virus has been detected in record numbers of mosquitos studied, the department said. While most people infected with West Nile don’t get symptoms, older people and those with weakened immune systems are more prone to diseases that be fatal. Health officials recommend wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants to help prevent mosquito bites on arms and legs and eliminating standing water where mosquitos lay their eggs.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two men have been convicted of conspiring to kill a federal witness in 2016. A federal jury deliberated for about 61/ 2 hours before delivering the verdicts Tuesday against Donald Smith, 37, of Malvern, and Samuel Sherman, 38, of Batesville, in the shooting death of 44-year-old Suzen Cooper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Prosecutors alleged Smith, Sherman and Suzen Cooper’s former sister-in-law, Racheal Cooper, conspired to sell methamphetamine and cocaine, and Cooper was a confidential informant who had purchased meth from Sherman. Racheal Cooper was originally charged with capital murder in Hot Spring County but later pleaded guilty to a charge of hindering apprehension, for which she served five years of a 25-year sentence. Smith and Sherman face up to life in prison after being convicted of federal charges of witness tampering resulting in death, conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, and aiding and abetting the use, carry and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. A sentencing hearing has not yet been set. Porter led the police to the grave site, Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Gardner said. “Suzen Cooper’s body was exactly where Jimmy Porter said it would be,” Gardner said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Residents failed to significantly cut back their water consumption in July, state officials announced Tuesday, foreshadowing some difficult decisions for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration as a historic drought lingers into the fall. Newsom had asked people in July to voluntarily cut back their water consumption by 15% to help address a severe drought that has left some of the state’s reservoirs at dangerously low levels. But in the three weeks after Newsom’s announcement, residents reduced their water consumption just 1.8%, according to new data released Tuesday and reported by the Sacramento Bee. “On conservation, we’re going to be needing to do more,” board chair Joaquin Esquivel said. Still, Esquivel was hopeful the state’s conservation numbers will improve. Newsom declared a drought emergency in the Russian River watershed along the state’s north coast in April. Data from that region shows people reduced their water consumption by 17% in July compared to 2020. “We see that it takes time for conservation to boot up,” Esquivel said, adding that the 17% figure “shows the responsiveness of communities” to appeals for conservation. Dave Eggerton, executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies, said the numbers “represent a promising start in reducing water use.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Criminal charges have been dropped in connection with the death of a spiritual leader whose mummified body was found in what appeared to be a shrine in a southern Colorado home, according to court officials. The body of Amy Carlson, 45, leader of the Love Has Won group, was found decorated with Christmas lights and glitter in the tiny, rural town of Moffat in April, according to previously released arrest affidavits. Seven people were charged with tampering with or abusing her corpse as well as child abuse, presumably because there were two children living in the home. Charges against six people were dropped during court proceedings, the Saguache County court clerk’s office said in an email Tuesday. It said no case existed for a seventh person who was among those charged with the others in May, though the office did not explain what happened in that case. It’s not known why the charges were dropped. Assistant District Attorney Alex Raines asked a judge to dismiss all the charges during a Sept. 14 hearing, the Valley Courier reports. Defense lawyers also requested that records be sealed, which was approved, it said. A telephone message left for Raines was not returned.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Hundreds of unionized group home workers are threatening to walk off the job next month if settlements aren’t reached on new labor contracts. The New England Health Care Employees Union, District 1199, SEIU, delivered strike notices Tuesday to two private agencies – Whole Life Inc. and Network Inc. – that have about 70 locations across the state that could be affected. The union’s deadline for an agreement is Oct. 5. The threat of a strike, which would involve over 500 workers at group homes and day programs for people with developmental disabilities, comes more than three months after state officials authorized $184 million to increase wages and benefits for group home workers. The union said these remaining two operators have failed to settle on new agreements, despite the added funding. In July, a threatened strike by over 2,100 group home workers at 200 homes was called off after a late-night agreement for higher wages and improved benefits was reached with the Lamont administration’s help. “The State of Connecticut stepped up and provided funding that was adequate,” Rob Baril, the union president, said in a statement. “Now it’s time for these agencies to do the same: to provide people with pensions, affordable health insurance and enough wages that people can take care of their families.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A new law is expected to make it simpler for residents to use solar energy to power their homes through a community-centered program scheduled to start next year. To participate, customers can get credit on their electric bills by subscribing to a centrally located local community solar project, which can be cheaper than paying to install solar panels on their own roofs. Community-owned solar generation facilities have been legal in Delaware since 2010 but included some legal barriers such as requiring the facility to identify all its customers before being built. The bill by Sen. Stephanie Hansen, D-Middletown, removed some of those barriers to make it easier for people to take advantage of the fast-growing industry. Delaware hasn’t had the facilities in the past because the laws weren’t set up to accommodate them, Hansen said. The bill specifically changes regulations for solar facilities that will connect through Delmarva Power, the most prominent energy company in the state. Once facility owners get the green light, Delaware can expect to see the solar panel facilities popping up in open lands like Brownfield sites, undeveloped fields, or on top of parking lots or landfills, according to Hansen.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Artifacts from the racial injustice protests that erupted last year in the wake of George Floyd’s death are being preserved, and their protectors are hoping to find new homes for some of the mementos, WUSA-TV reports. As pro-Trump demonstrators repeatedly targeted a makeshift memorial at the barrier that separated Black Lives Matter Plaza from the White House, “fence guardians” sought to protect artifacts of the movement that shone a spotlight on police brutality against Black people. The Biden administration dismantled the fence earlier this year, but not before Nadine Seiler saved more than 700 mementos. “We were lucky that the Library of Congress took some pieces, and Howard University took some pieces,” Seiler said. “But the vast majority of the collection remained with us.” Hundreds of signs, photographs and pieces of artwork remain in her D.C. storage space. Seiler and fellow “fence guardian Karen Irwin are now finding homes for each item, asking interested businesses, nonprofits and organizations to contact them via Facebook. “Ideally, the Black Lives Matter community would like the pieces to stay in the hands of Black organizations,” Seiler said. “But personally, any organization that would give these treasures a safe home and recognize their value, they should reach out as well.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis named a UCLA doctor and health policy researcher who shares his approach to managing the coronavirus pandemic to serve as the state’s surgeon general Tuesday. Like DeSantis, Dr. Joseph Ladapo said he doesn’t believe in school closures, lockdowns or vaccine mandates. “Florida will completely reject fear as a way of making policies in public health,” Ladapo said. DeSantis said there’s been misinformation spread about COVID-19 to control personal behavior and mentioned monoclonal antibody treatment, claiming that while he’s been advocating it for months, others haven’t been pushing it as vocally. Doctors agree with DeSantis that the treatment, when delivered soon after infection, is effective. Lapado said vaccines aren’t the only way to combat COVID-19. “There’s nothing special about them compared to any other preventive measure,” he said, adding that people should be encouraged to lose weight, exercise more and eat healthier. And Lapado spoke out against lockdowns, saying that “after lockdowns, overall mortality increased ... lots of reasons why they’re bad.” On Wednesday, Ladapo signed new protocols allowing parents to decide whether their children should quarantine or stay in school if they are asymptomatic after being exposed to someone with COVID-19. His new guidelines also tweaked the state’s prohibition against school mask mandates, prompting an administrative law judge to dismiss a lawsuit against the old rule that had been filed by various school boards.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Some of the people living in a homeless camp known as Cooterville say they’re skeptical of a new, government-sanctioned homeless camp planned for the community. The Cooterville encampment under CSX railroad tracks is set to be cleared by Nov. 12, with city leaders trying to time the ejections with the opening of the new camp where homeless will be allowed to stay legally. City officials are looking for an organization to head the government-sanctioned encampment, which will determine what it eventually looks like. The Athens-Clarke County Commission this summer selected a site for it at the North Athens School. Opponents have said they’re concerned it will attract more homeless people to Athens. But supporters say the new camp will come with services aimed at helping homeless people make the transition to permanent housing. In the Cooterville camp, some have expressed feeling left in the dark about the process are are unsure whether they will be secured a spot in the new camp. Oscar Sutton, who’s lived in Cooterville a couple of months, said he has no plans to move to the government-sanctioned encampment and worries about placing so many random people from the homeless community together. “It’s going to be chaos,” he said. “If I have to stay out here, I’ll just find somewhere to stay.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man who helped organize a group that opposes COVID-19 vaccines and mandates says he contracted the disease and now has regrets. Chris Wikoff told Hawaii News Now he helped start the Aloha Freedom Coalition last October, believing government shutdowns and mandates were threatening liberties and harming businesses. “They were talking about vaccine passports and vaccine mandates, and it seemed like it was over-the top totalitarianism and control,” Wikoff said. But then he and his wife contracted COVID-19. “We were told the COVID virus was not that deadly. It was nothing more than a little flu. I can tell you it’s more than a little flu,” he said. Wikoff was sent to a hospital on the west side of Oahu but transferred to a facility in Honolulu because hospitals were at or near capacity. “I was in a bed. I can’t move; I can’t breathe,” he recalled. “I was afraid I was going to die.” Wikoff is now considering getting vaccinated because his family and doctors recommend it. “Probably getting COVID again would be more dangerous than getting the reaction from the vaccines,” he said. Wikoff said he asked the Aloha Freedom Coalition to remove his name as a member on state business registration and is warning people not to attend large protests like the ones the group staged in front of Lt. Gov. Josh Green’s home. “Before I thought Josh Green was exaggerating the situation, and after my experience he sounds very rational to me,” he said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Health care workers are exhausted and angry. COVID-19 vaccines are expiring because they have sat unused for so long. And coronavirus case numbers and deaths continue to climb, putting the state among the worst in the nation for the rate of new diagnoses. Idaho’s public health leaders painted a grim picture – again – during a weekly briefing Tuesday. The state continues to set records with 686 hospitalized COVID-19 patients as of Saturday, 180 of them in intensive care beds and 112 on ventilators, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Dave Jeppesen said. At the moment, there is no end in sight to the surge. The entire state entered “crisis standards of care” last week, officially allowing hospitals to ration health care as needed so that scarce resources can be directed to the patients most in need and most likely to survive. Urgent surgeries have been placed on hold, some patients are being treated in lobbies or field hospitals, and hospital administrators and doctors are desperately trying to shuffle the sickest patients to any facility that has enough open beds or ventilators to treat them. Over the weekend, physicians at one hospital nearly had to face “de-allocation,” in which one patient is taken out of an ICU bed to give it to someone with a greater chance of survival, said Dr. Jim Souza with St. Luke’s Health System.\n\nIllinois\n\nBeecher: A fire destroyed a historic church in Chicago’s far southern suburbs that had appeared in the 2002 film “Road to Perdition.” Officials said nearly a dozen fire departments responded, but by the time the flames were doused, St. Paul’s Lutheran Church was in ruins. No one was injured, and the cause of the fire is under investigation. Flames swept the church Sunday afternoon as members of the congregation were enjoying an Oktoberfest celebration in the parking lot. The building dates to 1865. “Yeah, it is devastating: The 150 years of the weddings and the funerals and the baptisms and all of that are gone. But the church still stands, the people; we still have our folk and our faith,” said the Rev. Michael Stein. The closest fire hydrant was approximately a mile away, prompting an effort to shuttle roughly 91,000 gallons of water to the rural location to extinguish the flames, officials said. The church appeared in Tom Hanks’s 2002 film “Road to Perdition,” WGN-TV reports. “My grandparents are buried there. It’s really sad seeing the church like this,” Beecher resident Zachery Wehling told the station. Stein said it’s an opportunity to rebuild. “It is a dark chapter, and a sad one, and we mourn it, and we grieve it … but we still look to Christ, and we find that hope to go on,” he said.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University said it has nearly 50,000 students this fall, a record fueled by a freshman class of about 10,200. Purdue said it was surprised by an increase in out-of-state students accepted for admission. Families and students told Purdue they were impressed by the school’s response to COVID-19. “Our focuses have been encouraging everyone to be vaccinated,” said Jay Akridge, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity. “We’re up over 83% of the campus (vaccinated). And then if you’re not, get tested,” he said. “And then students have been great about masking inside. … Just as they did last year, students have been very good about following that protocol.” Purdue was expecting 8,450 freshmen but greatly exceeded that number. Total enrollment is pegged at 49,639.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Dodge: Experts say a cyberattack on a northwest Iowa grain cooperative could signal Russian-linked groups are beginning to target smaller farm businesses in rural America as bigger companies tighten their security. The cyberattack on New Cooperative, a farm services business with headquarters in Fort Dodge, comes on the heels of a ransomware attack on the giant meatpacking company JBS in late May. JBS closed at least one Iowa pork processing plant as well as all nine of its U.S. beef plants before paying hackers $11 million in ransom. Cybersecurity experts say Russian-backed ransomware group BlackMatter is demanding a $5.9 million ransom from New Cooperative. New Cooperative acknowledged Monday that it had experienced “a cybersecurity incident” affecting some of the company’s “devices and systems.” The member-owned business said it’s using “every available tool and resource to quickly restore our systems.” The cooperative said it had notified law enforcement and was working with data security experts to “investigate and remediate the situation.” New Cooperative declined to say more about the attack Tuesday. Chad Hart, an Iowa State University agriculture economist, said “size really doesn’t matter” to hackers, who “are looking for any target that they think could be valuable.”\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: An organization run by rapper Jay-Z has filed a petition seeking records from the city’s police department related to what it calls a history of officer misconduct within the agency. The request was filed Monday in Wyandotte County District Court by Team Roc, the criminal justice division of Jay-Z’s entertainment organization, Roc Nation. The filing said the department has failed for decades to hold officers accountable for misconduct, including planting evidence, fabricating witnesses, and soliciting sex from victims and witnesses, The Kansas City Star reports. “And, thanks to the blue veil of silence and apparent failure to investigate serious allegations, little of it has come to light,” according to the petition. It alleges department officials refused to provide Team Roc with complaints filed against the department’s investigative division, reports or internal investigations against an officer who has a history of abuse allegations and policies relating to supervising detectives. The department responded in a statement that it has given hundreds of pages of documents to Team Roc but that the Kansas Open Records Act does not require the release of personnel records and criminal investigation files.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A drive-by shooting at a school bus stop Wednesday morning left a 16-year-old student dead and another hospitalized, police said. A third child was injured by unknown means as the youths waited at the bus stop just west of downtown Louisville, authorities said. A person in a car drove by and shot at the waiting students, some of whom were not injured, Louisville Metro Police Maj. Shannon Lauder said during a news conference. No suspects were in custody Wednesday afternoon. Police put a photo of a dark gray Jeep SUV on social media and asked for the public’s help in finding it. The vehicle had Illinois license tags, with the plate number BD91644. Mayor Greg Fischer said the shooting – the city’s 145th homicide this year – violated a “sacred space.” Police were working with the FBI and other agencies in investigating the shooting, Chief Erika Shields said Wednesday morning. The chief suggested the shooting could be gang-related, but she said she did not believe the victim was involved with gangs. The bus stop near the city’s downtown was for students of Eastern High School. Jefferson County Schools Superintendent Marty Pollio called the incident “one of the most difficult mornings of my career.” He said support is being provided to students and teachers at the school.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Smoke and flames shot up the side of the Superdome’s roof Tuesday after a pressure washer being used to clean the roof of the sports and entertainment arena caught fire. The New Orleans Fire Department confirmed firefighters responded to flames on the building’s roof shortly after 12:30 p.m. The fire appeared under control a short time later. New Orleans Emergency Management Services said on Twitter that it was transporting one person to the hospital for “minor burns.” Emergency officials called on people to stay away from the area. Crews were power-washing the roof to prepare it to be painted, officials said. “The fire was contained to the exterior gutter system surrounding (the) Superdome, and only a small area of the roof suffered minimal damage,” said a statement from the Louisiana Stadium and Expedition District, a state board that governs the dome, and ASM Global, which manages the Superdome. “Initial assessments suggest that damage is superficial and there appears to be no structural damage or impact to the integrity of the roof’s exterior skin. The building’s outer skin and roof remain watertight.” A photo posted on the city’s emergency management Twitter feed showed firefighters in the trench that separates the Superdome roof from an outer wall as they sprayed down the fire-blackened walls.\n\nMaine\n\nLebanon: Residents will vote on whether to recall several town leaders in a flap that grew out of the select board chairman’s decision to take a farmer’s pot plants. Farmer Eric Kelley accused Select Board Chairman Charles Russell Jr. and board member Ernest “Butch” Lizotte Jr. of swiping $100,000 worth of plants, knowing that the farmer was in jail. In addition, local animal control officers took his livestock. District Attorney Kathryn Slattery confirmed there was an investigation that focused on possible theft. But there was not enough evidence to prove the charges “beyond a reasonable doubt,” she said. Anger over the marijuana episode apparently served as a tipping point for a recall effort targeting Russell, Lizotte and another person who went to the farm that night. The recall also targets a third selectman who’s accused of missing half of this year’s meetings. Russell, who grows medicinal marijuana for household use, consulted for a local pot business and helped draft town marijuana ordinances, acknowledged to the Boston Globe that he pilfered Kelley’s marijuana plants. But he said he did it because he didn’t want the plants getting “into the hands of the wrong people” while Kelley was in jail. He called it a “public safety” matter.\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: National Public Radio can air audio recordings from the trial of the gunman who killed five Capital Gazette newspaper employees in 2018, a federal judge has ruled in a case challenging the state’s ban on broadcasting court proceedings. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Bennett on Tuesday permanently barred the state of Maryland from enforcing its “broadcast ban” against NPR, which intends to use audio from the trial of Capital Gazette newsroom shooter Jarrod Ramos in an upcoming episode of its “Embedded” podcast. Bennett ruled it would be unconstitutional for Maryland to ban NPR from broadcasting recordings of the jury trial for Ramos’ criminal case. NPR’s challenge to the broadcast ban was limited to its use of recordings of Ramos’ court proceedings. In July, a jury rejected defense attorneys’ mental illness arguments and found Ramos criminally responsible for killing five people at the newspaper’s office in Annapolis. Prosecutors are seeking five life sentences without the possibility of parole when Ramos is sentenced. The judge already had ruled in NPR’s favor after a hearing Sept. 13, issuing a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocked the law’s enforcement against the radio network. Tuesday’s ruling granted NPR’s request for a permanent injunction.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A group of high school students had to ride on a party bus complete with a stripper pole and neon lights during a recent field trip – an experience their teacher said highlights problems with the education system. Jim Mayers, an 11th grade Advanced Placement language and composition teacher at the Brooke Charter School in Boston, said in a since-deleted tweet that the original charter bus had fallen through, Masslive.com reports. “It is a funny story, but there actually is a real bus shortage, and it speaks to major flaws in our education system,” he said, adding that the field trip was a success. He is now using the attention he’s getting because of the original tweet to urge people to better understand educational inequities and other problems facing the nation’s schools. “I’m worried that there is too much attention being paid to the tweet itself, or simply the fact that it went viral, instead of attending to the many systemic issues that are facing not just my students, but students all across the country,” he wrote in a follow-up tweet. For example, districts across the nation are struggling to hire enough drivers to shuttle kids to school, and some states have become creative, including Massachusetts, which is enlisting National Guard members to drive school transport vans.\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: Plans are underway for the state to construct a first-in-the-nation segment of road that will charge electric vehicles while they’re driving, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Tuesday at the Motor Bella auto show in Pontiac. Michigan’s Department of Transportation and the Office of Future Mobility and Electrification are partnering to make a 1-mile stretch of state roadway in Wayne, Oakland or Macomb counties to allow public transportation and private vehicles to charge while traveling as a part of the Inductive Vehicle Charging Pilot, according to a news release. “Michigan was home to the first mile of paved road, and now we’re paving the way for the roads of tomorrow with innovative infrastructure that will support the economy and the environment, helping us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050,” Whitmer said in the release. As electric vehicles advance, charging infrastructure has become a priority for Michigan cities that want to draw residents. The city of Saginaw got its first charging stations in September in the hope that those traveling in the east side of the state toward tourist areas in northern Michigan will stop because there is little electric vehicle infrastructure available at most destinations.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Joseph: A small crowd of local business owners and community members gathered around a gray house near downtown Tuesday morning to kick off a project that would give a house used by the Sisters of the Order of St. Benedict a new life. Armed with sledgehammers, Sisters Dorothy Manuel and Karen Streveler posed for photographs outside the house as Habitat for Humanity volunteers in blue hard hats walked around the inside, ready to begin renovating the home that the sisters donated to the organization in December. Next summer a local family will move into the house, addressing a need for affordable housing in the area. “As volunteers and family members begin the kicking out the old to make room for the new and improved, we pray for the safety of all who participate in the renovation project and that everything gets accomplished in a timely manner,” Manuel said as she led a prayer in front of the home. “May this house truly become a home for the family and a blessing for their lives.” The Genesis House was built in 1926 and purchased by the sisters in 1950. It was used to accommodate lay staff from the College of St. Benedict in the past and later to house chaplains, Streveler said. Most recently, some of the sisters lived there for the past seven years.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The authors of the state’s 1890 constitution had racist intent when they stripped voting rights from people convicted of some felonies because they chose crimes they thought were more likely to be committed by Black people, an attorney argued Wednesday in a federal appeals court. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should overturn most of Mississippi’s felon disenfranchisement plan, attorney Donald B. Verrilli Jr. argued on behalf of people with felony convictions. The case could affect thousands who have lost voting rights. “Because the 1890 provisions were unconstitutional, they were invalid from the moment that they’re enacted,” Verrilli said. Attorneys representing the state said Mississippi dropped burglary from the list of disenfranchising crimes in 1950 and added murder and rape to the list in 1968. They said in written arguments that those changes “cured any discriminatory taint on the original provision.” The Mississippi Constitution strips voting rights from people convicted of 10 felonies, including forgery, arson and bigamy. The state attorney general issued an opinion in 2009 that expanded the list to 22 crimes, including timber larceny, carjacking, felony-level shoplifting and felony-level bad check writing.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The city’s police used force against Black people more than three times as often as on white people, according to a newly released study. The California-based, nonprofit research group Center for Policing Equity examined police report data from 2012 to 2019 and also found that in 9 out of 10 instances in which police pulled out a gun, it was at a Black civilian, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Even as the overall use of force dropped by 18%, police still used it more often against Black people, the report said. “What we typically hear from police officers is that use of force happens predominantly in areas with high crime,” said Hans Menos, vice president of law enforcement initiatives at the center. “So we try to control using neighborhood-level demographics, and even after controlling for that, the number (of Black people who have force used against them) is still higher.” Mayor Tishaura Jones said eliminating racial disparities in policing is key to making St. Louis safer for all of its residents. Outgoing Police Chief John Hayden said this kind of research can bring about scrutiny and questions about policing practices. “However, we embrace the challenge to do better and consider all suggestions from professionals, community stakeholders, and citizens,” Hayden said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: National Guard soldiers will assist hospitals with their COVID-19 response as the state struggles with a surge in infections, Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Tuesday. A total of 70 soldiers will assist six different hospitals in Helena, Billings, Butte, Missoula and Bozeman. They will begin helping the hospitals either this weekend or next weekend, according to an announcement from the governor’s office. The Guardsmen will support staffing with nonmedical intensive care assistance, environmental services, patient data entry and coronavirus testing. Gianforte has stopped short of issuing any statewide mask or vaccine requirements even as some communities face record-high COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. “While we will not mandate them, vaccines are safe, they work, and they can save your life,” Gianforte said in a statement. The decision to mobilize the National Guard comes after Gianforte announced last week that 10 Guardsmen would begin assisting Billings Clinic, and seven additional Guardsmen would assist in the state lab. The state anticipates additional requests for Guard resources from several other hospitals, according to the governor’s office.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Lawmakers remained at a stalemate Wednesday over how to draw new congressional and legislative maps despite a looming deadline that could force them to postpone the decision until next year and delay the May primary election. Lawmakers have until Saturday to advance both measures, or else Speaker of the Legislature Mike Hilgers has promised to end their special session, forcing them to resume the debate during their next regular session in January. Delaying the new maps until next year would force state officials to reschedule the primary and create major hassles for county election officials and candidates. At issue with the maps are accusations that Republicans and Democrats are trying to draw political boundaries in ways that benefit their party. Republicans enjoy a majority in the officially nonpartisan, one-house Legislature, but they don’t have enough votes to overcome a filibuster led by Democrats and some moderate Republicans, preventing them from forcing through their preferred map. Hilgers said lawmakers have made good progress toward an agreement, and he hoped to pin down specific concerns about the maps to try to reach a compromise so that lawmakers aren’t “just talking past each other.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: In their first public opportunity to voice concerns on a proposal to let tech companies that meet certain requirements create semi-autonomous jurisdictions called Innovation Zones, officials from Storey County dressed down the idea in a line-by-line fashion. They called into question the motives of the company that wants to break away from its control. “While I’m sure many would prefer to have no independent government oversight, we don’t make laws based on what is convenient for just one party,” Storey County Commissioner Clay Mitchell told lawmakers Tuesday. Mitchell and other county representatives oppose a proposal backed by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak that would allow companies that promise a $1.25 billion investment and possess at least 78 square miles of land to apply to form the Innovation Zones. The zones would be governed by three county commission-like board members – two of whom would at first be nominated by the company. They would operate outside the jurisdiction of preexisting local government and eventually could create court systems, impose taxes and make zoning decisions. The company’s proposal has been met with opposition from skeptics of overly powerful tech companies, environmentalists and local officials.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Fall visitors to the Granite State are being asked to keep their tempers in check and their trash off the ground during their leaf peeping trips this year. With interest in outdoor recreation on the rise amid the coronavirus pandemic, state tourism officials last year launched a “Leave No Trace” campaign to remind visitors not to sully the state’s natural resources. This year, they added a new message – “Don’t Take New Hampshire for Granite” – to encourage visitors to be understanding about rules and respectful of other people and property. With foliage season just beginning, officials are again reminding visitors to show courtesy to workers and the environment alike. Fall is New Hampshire’s second-busiest tourism season, and state officials expect 3.2 million visitors to spend $1.4 billion this year, nearly back to pre-pandemic levels. Businesses still are struggling with workforce shortages and supply chain delays, said Mike Somers, president of the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association. That, in turn, has led to an increase in rude and abusive customer behavior. “We’re really asking folks to plan ahead and have a little bit of patience and understanding,” he said. “Just call ahead, find out what the hours of operation are, and please don’t get upset if we’re not open until 11 o’clock at night.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Liquor stores, bars and restaurants are all having trouble stocking their shelves with enough wines, beers and spirits, thanks to COVID-19’s impact on supplies, along with heat waves and frosts that damaged crops. “It’s not just one thing that’s causing the liquor shortage,” said Joe Ringwood, manager of Super Cellars, a fine wine and spirits shop in Ridgewood. It’s a shortage of truck drivers, a scarcity of aluminum, a shutdown of factories, a dearth of containers, extreme weather, tariffs or a lack thereof, and even the greater demand by consumers for premium liquor. “Some of it is directly related to the pandemic,” Ringwood said. “But not all of it.” And it’s not just one category of liquor that’s gone missing. What is in short supply seems to change from month to month, if not week to week. Last year, liquor store owners said, they had trouble getting canned beers, amid a shortage of aluminum. Today, bottled beers and top-shelf tequilas are in particularly short supply. “Every week it’s something else,” said Kathy Mahon, bar manager for Park West Tavern in Ridgewood. Paul Santelle, executive director of the New Jersey Liquor Store Alliance and owner of Garden State Discount Liquors in Perth Amboy, said he has begun to ration over a hundred items so more people will be able to enjoy them.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A coalition of Native American communities has unveiled its proposal for redrawing the state’s political map to boost Indigenous voters’ influence in elections. The proposed changes from New Mexico’s 19 Native American pueblos and the Jicarilla Apache Nation, outlined Monday, would reshape a congressional swing district where Republicans regained control in 2020. They would also bolster Native American majorities among eligible voters in six state House and three Senate districts in northwestern New Mexico. The proposals were submitted to a committee that will provide recommendations to the Legislature at the end of October. The Democrat-led Legislature can draw its own lines. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham must approve the redistricting, and court challenges are possible. New Mexico is home to 23 federally recognized tribes, and the share of New Mexicans who identify themselves as Indigenous by race or by combined ancestry is 12.4%. Four Indigenous tribes have joined together for the first time to form a stronger voting bloc within one Senate district that might unite Acoma, Laguna, Isleta and Zuni pueblos. Other proposed changes would split the Mescalero Apache reservation between two congressional districts, in hopes of expanding that tribe’s voice in Congress.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Four members of Congress from New York demanded the release of inmates and closure of New York City’s troubled Rikers Island jail complex after another inmate was reported dead at the facility. Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jerry Nadler, Jamaal Bowman and Nydia Velazquez called conditions at the jail “deplorable and nothing short of a humanitarian crisis,” in a letter Tuesday to Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Bill de Blasio. The demand followed the 11th death reported at Rikers Island this year. The city’s Department of Correction said an inmate died Sunday at the jail after reporting he did not feel well and was taken to the infirmary. His death came on the heels of both Hochul and de Blasio announcing plans to try to improve conditions at Rikers Island, where long-standing troubles were exacerbated amid the pandemic. The House members said the jail has failed to provide inmates with basic services and protection against the spread of COVID-19, and lawmakers on a recent visit to the facility found conditions that were “life-threatening and horrific.” They reported overflowing toilets and floors covered in dead cockroaches, feces and rotting food. State Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas said inmates told her they felt like they were being treated like slaves and animals.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: People attending the 2021 N.C. State Fair won’t be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but it’s strongly encouraged, officials said. Also, those going to the fair, which begins Oct. 14, will be required to use clear plastic bags upon entering, and officials say there will be no indoor concerts at this year’s event – a decision they said has nothing to do with the pandemic. A statement from fair officials said any size or type of clear bag is acceptable. Wristlets, diaper bags and medical equipment bags will be accepted at the fair even if they are not clear, but they will require additional inspection. In addition, officials said there will be no concerts inside Dorton Arena. That room will be reserved for vendors. “Moving the vendors, displays and cheesemakers into Dorton Arena will offer a larger space to include more vendors and provide more space for consumers to sample featured products and shop for their favorites,” state Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said in a statement.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The head of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is asking a federal agency overseeing the environmental review of the Dakota Access oil pipeline to cut ties with a contractor conducting the analysis, citing a conflict of interest. Chairman Mike Faith and other tribal leaders fighting the pipeline sent a letter Wednesday to a top U.S. Army Corps of Engineers official, taking issue with Environmental Resources Management, the company doing the review, and its ties to the oil industry, the Bismarck Tribune reports. One of the tribes’ concerns is that the London-based company is a member of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group that lobbies for the oil industry and has submitted court briefs supporting Dakota Access. Meanwhile, the company that operates the Dakota Access pipeline has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse an appellate ruling ordering additional environmental review, saying it puts the line at risk of being shut down. Texas-based Energy Transfer operates the $3.8 billion, 1,172-mile pipeline. Faith said in a statement that the request by the pipeline operator “is part of an ongoing attempt to “evade accountability.” The pipeline began operating in 2017, after being the subject of months of protests during its construction.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: The city plans to demolish the 129-year-old historic building that once was the site of the Wright brothers’ first bike shop because the building has deteriorated to a point where it can no longer be maintained and redeveloped. The shop was first built in 1892 to serve as the Wrights’ first bike shop. Soon thereafter, Gem City Ice Cream Co. bought the property and was housed there until it closed in 1975, when the building was sold to another company, the Dayton Daily News reports. Years after a wide array of owners, the city attempted to sell the rundown property to developers, but it failed inspection tests. The building was deemed structurally damaged and in danger of collapse. City officials also attempted to receive approval to bulldoze the property but did not move forward after hearing community concerns, Daytons Landmark Commission staff report said. But multiple inspections in 2019 concluded the building can’t be saved. City staff and nuisance abatement specialists said the building needs to be removed, the report said. This isn’t the first of the Wright brothers’ bike shops to be torn down in Ohio. Their second and third bike shops were torn down, but the fourth is a national historic site in the Wright Dunbar District, according to the newspaper.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Efforts to control feral swine eating their way across fields might seem as futile as trying to catch a greased pig – the hogs are known to destroy crops and land for farmers, who say the animals aren’t picky eaters and will consume just about anything they find growing. But an influx in federal dollars creating pilot eradication projects across broad areas of the state and a new pesticide introduced this month are making the fight just a little more fair for farmers, ranchers and regulators. The two feral swine control pilot projects, paid for by about $3.6 million in federal dollars allocated through the 2018 Farm Act, have combined tracking efforts with hunting and trapping activities across multiple counties in northern and southwestern Oklahoma to blunt swine activity in those areas. The manufacturer of the new pesticide, called HogStop, claims it can decrease the fertility of male swine and help cut rapid reproduction rates for the animal. It was approved for use by the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food & Forestry this month. Any and all tools to fight the infestation are welcome, as feral swine damage across the state has cost landowners hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A broken power-sharing deal, the lingering possibility of a Republican walkout and a COVID-19 case are adding greater uncertainty to whether legislators will successfully redraw the state’s political districts ahead of a tight deadline. Stakes are high as Oregon gained a new, sixth U.S. House seat following the latest census. Lawmakers were told the House would reconvene Wednesday following news Tuesday that someone in the building had tested positive for the coronavirus. But House Speaker Tina Kotek now says the chamber won’t convene until Saturday to give time for those potentially exposed to the virus to be tested and receive results. Democrats say their entire caucus in the House has been vaccinated. The number of vaccinated Republican lawmakers was not immediately available. When the House reconvenes Saturday, lawmakers will have just two days to vote on and pass new political boundaries. If congressional maps are not passed by Sept. 27, the task will fall to a panel of five retired judges appointed by the Oregon Supreme Court. House Republicans showed signs of a possible walkout this week after Kotek, a Democrat, rescinded a power-sharing deal to redraw political maps that she made with the House GOP as Republicans used delaying tactics to block bills during the 2021 legislative session.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state Supreme Court is saying yes to canines in the courtroom, under certain conditions. A trial witness may be accompanied by a “comfort dog” if the animal will help yield reliable, complete and truthful testimony, the justices ruled Wednesday in a precedent-setting opinion that established a “balancing test” for Pennsylvania judges confronted with such a request. Ruling unanimously in a murder case, the Supreme Court pointed to other states that allow witnesses to testify with the help of emotional support dogs. The justices said it’s permissible, as long as steps are taken to minimize any potential harm to a defendant. “Trial courts have the discretion to permit a witness to testify with the assistance of a comfort dog,” Chief Justice Max Baer wrote for the court. “In exercising that discretion, courts should balance the degree to which the accommodation will assist the witness in testifying in a truthful manner against any possible prejudice to the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” The defendant, Sheron Purnell, was convicted of third-degree murder and sentenced to up to 47 years in prison. Purnell’s lawyers argued a judge abused his discretion by allowing a comfort dog to accompany a teenage witness who testified against Purnell, with the defense saying that would “generate sympathy” among jurors for the girl.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Health officials are allowing a little leeway to a state mandate that requires health care workers to receive a COVID-19 vaccine by Oct. 1. State Department of Health Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott announced Tuesday that unvaccinated workers will be allowed to continue working beyond that date if their absence would jeopardize quality of care at a facility. “If there is a risk to quality of care and an unvaccinated worker must continue to work beyond October 1 to mitigate that risk, the employer has 30 days to ensure that role is fulfilled by a fully vaccinated health care worker,” she said in a statement. The change was made to “safeguard patients, residents, and staff by holding health professionals and facilities accountable to the October 1 vaccination requirement, while also preventing disruptions to care in Rhode Island as health care facilities work toward full compliance,” she said. According to the latest state survey, 87% of health care workers in Rhode Island are vaccinated. Many of the state’s nursing homes had expressed concern about the Oct. 1 deadline, saying it would put additional strain on facilities already struggling with staffing shortages.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A tent has been pitched at Prisma Health’s Greer Memorial Hospital to provide additional triage and treatment space, according to a spokesperson for the health system. The 40-by-80-foot tent was erected over the weekend by the South Carolina State Guard but has not yet been activated to provide treatment, according to a statement from a representative of the health system. Prisma spokesperson Sandy Dees said the tent is part of efforts at Prisma emergency departments in the Upstate to “proactively ‘surge up’ and create additional space to treat patients as needed.” Prisma did not respond to a question about the occupancy of its hospital in Greer. “We’re here to take care of our communities and that means taking the necessary steps to ensure we’re ready when and if those additional resources are needed,” Dr. Matthew Bitner, chair of emergency medicine at Prisma Health in the Upstate, said in the statement. “From a traditional ‘all-hazards’ approach, we are preparing not only for COVID patients but also the everyday emergencies such as trauma, heart attack, strokes, illness and injuries.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The nation’s largest domestic hunger-relief organization projects more children will go hungry in South Dakota this year and won’t know where their next meal is coming from. Feeding America said the state’s child food insecurity rate for 2021 will be 16.3%, up from 15.3% in 2019. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as reduced food intake, disruptive eating, and decreased quality and variety in diets. The USDA recently reported a national trend of increasing food insecurity, which rose to 14.8% in 2020. “I think it is really concerning,” said Lisa Davis, senior vice president of the No Kid Hungry campaign, a national initiative to end child hunger. “Children who face hunger generally have worse health impacts on their physical and brain development. … They don’t do well in school, they graduate at lower rates, and those consequences for kids literally last a lifetime.” Before the coronavirus pandemic, food insecurity was at its lowest rate since USDA started tracking it in the late 1990s. But the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on food access to households with young children, households of children headed by single women, and households of color, specifically Black and Hispanic, Davis said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials are asking the public to pick their favorite of four redesign options for new license plates that will be available starting in January. Gov. Bill Lee’s office said voting began Monday and runs through Sept. 27 at tn.gov/ratetheplates. The new design will replace the current plate that launched in 2006, with modifications in 2011, 2016 and 2017. State law includes a redesign every eight years if lawmakers approve funding for it. Tennessee law also requires the words “Tennessee,” “Volunteer State” and “TNvacation.com” to be on the plate, and it lets Tennesseans pick an “In God We Trust” option. The winning design of the primarily white and deep-blue options will be announced in the fall.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: After serving as interim police chief for the capital city since March, Joseph Chacon was named Wednesday as the permanent choice for the top spot. City Manager Spencer Cronk announced the appointment of Chacon, whose career with Austin police has spanned more than 20 years, after a nationwide search for a new chief. Chacon has been interim police chief since the retirement of former Chief Brian Manley amid a reckoning over racial injustice and use of force in law enforcement. Chacon, who served as assistant chief in Austin for almost five years before being named interim chief, said he was “extremely excited and humbled” by the opportunity. Chacon’s appointment must still be confirmed by the City Council, which is set to place an item on the appointment on next week’s agenda. Manley, chosen to lead the department in 2018, had been at the center of ongoing criticism following a fatal police shooting in April 2020 of a man driving away from officers and controversial uses of force by officers during protests over the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis in May 2020.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced Wednesday that masks will be required inside temples to limit the spread of COVID-19. Church leaders said in a statement that masks will be required temporarily in an effort to keep temples open. The message was the latest in a series of statements from church leaders encouraging masking and vaccination efforts against COVID-19. “As cases of COVID-19 increase in many areas, we want to do everything possible to allow temples to remain open,” the church said in a statement. “Therefore, effective immediately, all temple patrons and workers are asked to wear face masks at all times while in the temple.” In Utah, where the church is based, a summer surge of the coronavirus among unvaccinated residents has continued to grow, while vaccination rates have slightly increased. Data from the Utah Health Department showed that in the past 28 days, state residents who are unvaccinated have been 5.9 times more likely to die from COVID-19 and 7.2 times more likely to be hospitalized than those who are vaccinated. About 64% of Utah residents ages 12 and older were fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, state data shows. Utah reported 25 new deaths from COVID-19, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 2,829.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont State Police has its first director of mental health programs to help coordinate and oversee the delivery of mental health services to people who come into contact with state police, officials said. Mourning Fox, who was deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Mental Health for the past four years and has more than 25 years of experience in the field, was named to the position, the Department of Public Safety and state police announced. “This is a crucial position within the Department of Public Safety and for the Vermont public safety community as we pursue short-, medium- and long-term goals with respect to mental health response and reimagining policing and safety services,” DPS Commissioner Michael Schirling said in a statement. Fox, who joined the department Aug. 30, will work with the state police’s 10 barracks and the Department of Mental Health to complete hiring. He will also ensure that each field station has at least one embedded mental health crisis specialist and that training is consistent, officials said. In the long term, he’ll help the Public Safety Department reimagine how police provide services to people who may be experiencing a mental health or substance use disorder crisis or have other unmet social service needs, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A year and a half into the coronavirus pandemic, the Virginia Employment Commission is still swamped with backlogged claims, its call centers are underperforming, and serious staffing problems persist, according to a scathing interim report the state’s legislative watchdog agency presented to lawmakers Monday. The agency’s staff undertook its review after the employment commission came under harsh scrutiny from lawmakers and the public for what by some measures is a worst-in-the-nation response to the surge in jobless claims. Thousands of Virginians have faced lengthy delays while waiting for benefits, and many have been unable to reach anyone for help or information about their case. “While operating in the extremely challenging public health environment created by COVID was understandably difficult … meaningful actions could have been taken sooner to respond to the public’s needs,” said Hal Greer, director of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s secretary of labor, Megan Healy, oversees the employment commission and defended its performance. Although she agreed the agency was not prepared for the pandemic, she argued to lawmakers that the root of the problem was a complicated federal funding formula that has long left the agency starved for resources.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Three new buildings with 165 studio apartments that were supposed to be rented at market rates will instead house people leaving homelessness and people at risk of becoming homeless. The nonprofit Low Income Housing Institute will buy the buildings on Capitol Hill for about $50 million, with city and state housing programs sharing the cost equally, The Seattle Times reports. Seattle is using federal COVID-19 relief funds for its part, Mayor Jenny Durkan said. Two of the buildings will be managed by LIHI for adults. The third will be managed by YouthCare for young adults. Each will have a live-in case worker, said Sharon Lee, LIHI’s executive director. The deals will house people quickly and cheaply, relative to the time and cost required to develop low-income projects from scratch, Durkan said. The three buildings should be occupied by the end of the year, according to the city. “This is the fastest we have ever brought housing online,” Lee said. Tent encampments in parks and greenbelts have grown in Seattle during the coronavirus pandemic partly because the city has lacked shelter and housing spots, Durkan said. LIHI will move people into the buildings from tiny house villages it manages for the city, which should open more of those houses for people living on the streets, Lee said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLewisburg: Gov. Jim Justice has withdrawn from consideration as the coach of a boys basketball team at a high school where he already is the girls coach and where he’d already faced rejection for the job. In a letter to the Greenbrier Board of Education on Tuesday, Justice asked that a boys coach be named soon at Greenbrier East High School, with practices for the 2021-22 season starting in a month. Last month the board rejected a motion to hire Justice as boys coach. The board is looking to replace former NBA player Bimbo Coles, who resigned in July. “We need to move forward,” Justice said. “Pick a coach. The kids deserve that, and I wish them all the success.” Justice served as the boys coach from 2010 to 2017, his first year as governor. He has coached the girls team since 2000, winning a state championship in 2012. Justice’s second term as governor runs through 2024.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Workers reinstalled two statues Tuesday on the state Capitol grounds that protesters ripped down during a demonstration last year in the wake of George Floyd’s death. Workers reinstalled a 9-foot-6-inch statue of Wisconsin abolitionist Col. Hans Christian Heg as well as a 7-foot statue of a woman symbolizing the state’s “Forward” motto. The statues have no associated racist history, but protesters said they represented a false narrative that Wisconsin supports Black people and racial equity. Demonstrators toppled both statues in June 2020, breaking off Heg’s leg and head. The “Forward” statue was dented and one of its fingers broken off. The demonstration was among several that shook downtown Madison in the days after Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Floyd, who was Black and handcuffed, died after white police Officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Heg, a Norwegian immigrant who became an outspoken abolitionist, served in the 15th Wisconsin Regiment during the Civil War. He was killed at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863. His statue, funded by the Norwegian Society of America, had stood outside the Capitol since 1926. The “Forward” statue was a bronze replica of the one that represented Wisconsin at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: Rescue crews recovered the body of a 67-year-old man and searched around a lake Tuesday for his half-brother after the pair failed to return from a backcountry canoe trip. A 10-person ground crew was walking the shoreline of Shoshone Lake looking for Kim Crumbo, a 74-year-old former Navy SEAL from Ogden, Utah, Yellowstone officials said. A helicopter from nearby Grand Teton National Park was helping in the effort. Rescuers found the body of Mark O’Neill of Chimacum, Washington, on Monday along the eastern shore, where a canoe, paddle, flotation device and other items were found Sunday. A vacant campsite was found on the south side of the lake. A family member reported the two experienced boaters and former National Park Service employees overdue from their four-night trip Sunday. Shoshone Lake covers 13 square miles and has an average temperature of about 48 degrees Fahrenheit, with survival time estimated to be only 20 to 30 minutes in such cold water, officials said. The lake also can be subject to high winds and sudden storms. Drowning is one of the top causes of death in Yellowstone, behind car and snowmobile accidents and illness, park historian Lee Whittlesey wrote in his book “Death in Yellowstone.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/23"}]}

Much like Christmas is to Christians, Diwali holds great importance to Hindus and other faiths, as it honors the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance.\n\nThe Festival of Lights is celebrated by decorating homes with lamps and candles to symbolize the inner light that protects people from spiritual darkness. Over the course of five days, the observance is commemorated with revelry, family gatherings and a vibrant display of colors.\n\nAs growing diversity in the United States pushes the holiday into the foreground, here are a few more things to know about the festivity to understand its significance and the traditions that accompany it.\n\nWhen is Diwali celebrated?\n\nDiwali usually falls in October or November, depending on the lunar calendar. This year Diwali will be on Sunday, Nov. 12, and celebrations usually last for several days.\n\nIs Diwali a national holiday in the United States?\n\nAlthough Diwali is celebrated in many U.S. communities, it is not currently recognized as a federal holiday in the United States. There is, however, a growing movement advocating for its official recognition. U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., first vice chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, announced on May 26, 2023, that she introduced the Diwali Day Act. This bill aims to establish Diwali as the 12th federally recognized holiday in the United States. A month earlier, in April, Pennsylvania declared Diwali an official state holiday.\n\nThe Indian diaspora sees Diwali celebrated beyond its country of origin. It is an official holiday in several countries including Fiji, Guyana, Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica.\n\nWhy are Americans celebrating Diwali?\n\nThere are more than 4.4 million people of Indian heritage in the United States. Many celebrate Diwali to maintain a connection to cultural roots or observe Hindu, Jain, and Sikh religious practices. However, the appeal of Diwali is reaching outside of the Indian American community, as people from diverse backgrounds are drawn to its vibrant and festive pageantry. Diwali celebrations in the U.S. have now become a platform for promoting cultural awareness and diversity, offering an opportunity for others to learn about and actively engage in this culturally rich tradition.\n\nWhat are the 5 days of Diwali?\n\nEach day of Diwali is marked by its own distinct observances:\n\nDay 1: Preparation day involves cleaning homes and shopping for gold or kitchen utensils for good luck.\n\nPreparation day involves cleaning homes and shopping for gold or kitchen utensils for good luck.

Day 5: Brothers visit their married sisters for a meal and to nurture kinship.\n\nWhat is eaten during Diwali?\n\nDistinct from other Indian celebrations, Diwali is a time of indulgence, rather than fasting. The Diwali table is adorned with a variety of dishes, but it is the sweets, known as \"mithai,\" that is the featured honeypot. These Indian sweets are more like \"sweetmeats\" than typical candies, often made with nuts or vegetables simmered in sugar and milk. Popular mithai include:\n\nHalwa - a sweet, flavorful carrot-based delight\n\nLaddu (laddoo) - sweet flour balls\n\nBarfi - a sweet fudge made with condensed milk\n\nGulab jamun - a type of syrup-soaked donut holes\n\nKheer - cardamom-infused creamy rice pudding\n\nApart from the assortment of sugary treats, Diwali meals also feature a variety of vegetable-based snacks and main dishes. Savory appetizers like filled triangular pastries called samosas, crispy bhaji (or pakora), steamed Idli, a type of rice cake, and ghee-fried Puri are popular during this festive occasion. Vegetarian meals like the Paneer Makhani, a creamy and indulgent curry, are also typically on the menu.\n\nContact reporter Anitra Johnson at ajohnson@delawareonline.com.

But because a physician helped her steady, her top-12 finish was disqualified.\n\nMeanwhile, Donohue accelerated up the final ridge, finishing in 19:09.9.\n\n“Maisie had a really awesome finish,” said Pryor, who bested Donohue by 13 seconds at the Joe O’Neill Invitational two weeks ago.\n\n“I don’t know how I got that burst at the end,” said Donohue, who finished 40 seconds behind Brinsky in last week’s Blue Hen Conference meet.\n\n“I think I have an unfair advantage in that field since I’m a vegan and so I have a higher energy level and recovery rate than I otherwise would have if I ate a normal diet.

Conrad finished a best-ever sixth.\n\nAvila, who twice previously finished third in the boys race, navigated from the lead, a steady two strides ahead of Higley.\n\n“I came in here with a plan, but I did not execute it that well,” Avila said. “Once I realized that I wasn’t having the best day, I just wanted to conserve as much energy so I could make sure I had enough for the last couple of hundred meters. Aidan’s a good competitor.\n\n“This course offers the opportunity to put in your last ditch effort 600 meters from the finish line, and that’s what I did.

Henlopen Conference champ Smyrna rode Naomi Bowser’s third-place race to its first-ever Division One second place. Mount Pleasant, 11th among 17 teams last year in Division One, earned second place in Division Two, after winning its first Blue Hen Conference championship.\n\nAfter breaking her own Winterthur course record to win the New Castle County meet last week, Olivere showed the unremitting pace that has made her the state’s best distance runner since she entered high school, looking unhurried while beating the field by 37 seconds in 17:45, the third fastest in Killens Pond history.\n\n“We came in here very relaxed,” said Olivere. “Everything been coming together. This year it’s sunken in that we can do really well,” as Padua is regionally ranked for the first time.\n\n“We train together closely. We’ve had a more relaxed approach. We’ve been having a lot of fun this year.”\n\nPadua modified its workouts in anticipation of the cold. “We knew that our workouts had to be longer,” said Bader. “We had slower warmups, extra rest and hydration”\n\nTatnall took nothing for granted. “We didn’t take it too easy this week. We wanted to get our legs under us today,” said Anshen.\n\n“At the end of the day, we’re all running for each other,” said Hardin. “It’s my favorite course in the state.”\n\nNewark Charter’s Lilian Peterson’s strong finish earned her second place in Division Two. “I tried to enjoy every minute of it.

Salesianum won its seventh straight state championship by an even closer margin than last year's one-point victory.\n\nAfter Charter of Wilmington and Salesianum both finished Saturday's Division I championship meet at White Clay Creek State Park with 39 points, the Sals' sixth runner, Asa Bloom, became the most important man on the course, his 15th place finish breaking the deadlock.\n\nOn a day when three runners broke the 16-year-old course record, three teams sought statewide supremacy. Charter, coming off its first New Castle County championship, was leading yesterday's Division I meet by five points as the runners headed into the last mile. At that point, Salesianum accelerated.\n\nThe Sals, who edged Tatnall on a similar tie-breaker to win the season's other major meet, the Joe O'Neill Invitational, pushed five runners into the top 12. Andrew Hally (3rd), Kyle Jones (9th) and Tim Bouchard (10th) passed rivals down the stretch. With Thomas Higley holding fifth and George Steinhoff in 12th, they tied Charter.\n\nBloom, who would have been the best runner on 13 of the 17 other teams, is Salesianum's sixth runner. His superior sixth-place finish gave Salesianum the Joe O'Neill title over Tatnall and yesterday yielded the Sentinels' 40th Division I title over 46 years.\n\nCharter's Kieran Tuntivate (15:50) concluded his undefeated season in state, bolting ahead of teammate Kevin Murray (15:57) in the last 1,200 yards.\n\n\"I'm proud of the season,\" said Tuntivate after word of the tiebreaker spread. \"It's an unfortunate end, but it's a really successful season – for coach [Rick] Schuder, for me personally and for every member of the team. Kevin and I do our part. Everyone else does their part. Our 3-4-5 guys are good 3-4-5 guys. Sallies just stepped it up.\"\n\n\"It came down to the last straightaway,\" said Hally, who blossomed from junior varsity to all-state in one year. \"We had run a couple of 400s here, so we knew what we had to do.\n\n\"It's nice having a team with a solid seven, where any day anything can happen. I don't think we've had the same order of kids this year.\"\n\n\"We didn't have that one top guy guaranteed to finish first like Pat [Hally] last year,\" said Higley. \"It's been getting that one through five time as close as possible.\"\n\nJarod Wilson (4th) and Daniel Mwaniki (7th) led third-place Newark. Chris Avila (6th) of Charter and Sam Hete of Sussex Tech (9th) also made the top 10.\n\nBehind Stephen Garrett, who won his second Division II championship in 15:37, breaking Eric Eckstrand's 1998 course record by 20 seconds, young Tatnall won its sixth straight Division II title, taking five of the top seven places to finish with 20 points, the best Division II score ever.\n\nGarrett's principal competition was his brother Joey, who finished second. \"I was looking 1,000 meters in and saw my brother running with me,\" said Garrett, who plans to run at Duke next year. It gave me such a boost. Going up to the hill, I said come on, lets go. It's a great feeling to have teammates working with you.\"\n\n\"I wanted to stay with Stephen,\" said Joey Garrett. \"The rest of the team wanted to follow suit.\"\n\nBrad Keen (4th), Michael Flanagan (6th), Ryan Pala (7th), Noah McFoy (12th) and Adam McFoy (15th) gave Tatnall overwhelming depth.\n\nBrandywine's Eamon McCoy (3rd) led Blue Hen Conference runners. Kyle Swain (9th) led fifth-place Delaware Military. Eddie Leonard (10th) paced Archmere to fourth.\n\nBrendan Harris (5th) and Hudson Pepper (8th) led runner-up Tower Hill to its best finish in 30 years.\n\n\"The word's getting around.

But it was an important milestone nonetheless, setting Biden on course to win the nomination as he looks to unite the entire party around his candidacy.\n\nBiden won a whopping 96.2% of the vote, followed by author Marianne Williamson, 2.1%; and Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., 1.7%.\n\nHere are 3 key takeaways from the night.\n\nDespite Democratic angst, Biden is headed for the nomination\n\nBiden quashed any doubts whether he will be the Democratic nominee with his dominant win in South Carolina − despite facing repeated questions about his ability to rally the base.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nFor the past year, polls have shown that most Democratic voters would prefer someone other than Biden as their party's standard-bearer in 2024.\n\nBut Biden's overwhelming victory in South Carolina − the first state to vote in the new Democratic primary calendar − proved that the longshot candidacies of Phillips and Williamson are not serious threats.\n\nBiden, 81, still faces concerns within his party about his age and ability to fire up young voters, progressives and other core constituencies. Yet despite his flaws as a candidate, a viable Democratic challenger never emerged last year, and Biden is cruising toward the nomination.\n\nPam Joy, a Black 62-year-old waitress from Charleston, sat out of the Saturday's primary but said she plans to vote for Biden in November despite her concerns about his age because she usually votes for Democrats.\n\nWith the outcome in South Carolina never in doubt, Biden spent Saturday traveling to Los Angeles to attend a fundraiser for his campaign. He called into a South Carolina Democratic watch party to address supporters via speakerphone.\n\n\"The stakes in this election could not be higher,\" Biden said in a statement after his win, warning of \"extreme and dangerous voices at work in the country − led by Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign had already pivoted to a likely rematch against Trump after the former president's victory in the New Hampshire Republican Primary. Next up in the Democratic primary is Nevada, which votes Tuesday.\n\nWhile South Carolina gave Biden an opportunity to test his message with Black voters, who dominate the Democratic electorate in the state, Nevada offers a similar opportunity with Latino voters. Nevada, unlike heavily Republican South Carolina, is also a critical battleground state in the general election.\n\nA big night for Black voters\n\nSaturday's primary marked South Carolina Democrats' first since the Democratic National Committee upended its primary calendar to scrap Iowa and New Hampshire as the first and second states to vote to begin with the Palmetto State.\n\nThe party's rationale: Even though South Carolina isn't in play in the general election, its large Black population showcases Democrats' most reliable and important constituency, letting them set the course for the nomination process.\n\nVoter turnout Saturday, not surprisingly, decreased dramatically from the highly competitive, open Democratic primary of 2020, which Biden also won. Turnout among Democrats Saturday was only about 24% of the 2020 turnout.\n\nBut Michael Tyler, communications director for the Biden campaign, said Black voters made up approximately 76% of the early vote in South Carolina this year, compared with 56% in 2020.\n\nBetty Managault, 82, a retired nursing assistant who is Black, said she voted for Biden because he was “a godly man.” She said there was no doubt in her mind that Biden would win the primary but felt it was important for her to vote.\n\n“My ancestors, they died for me to get this right to vote,” she said, as she sat at a table selling sweet grass baskets she’d made.\n\nSouth Carolina − with a boost from the state's most prominent Democrat, Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C. − famously saved Biden's candidacy in 2020 after his initial losses in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\n\"Now in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again,\" Biden said in a statement after his win Saturday, \"and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the presidency again − and making Donald Trump a loser − again.\"\n\nAhead of the general election, Biden has work to do to ensure Black voters support him at the same level they did in 2020. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll last month found Biden has support of just 63% of Black voters, a sharp decline from the 87% he carried in 2020.\n\nIf Black support continues to lag, it could be devastating to Biden's chances in the fall.\n\nWhat's next for Biden's challengers?\n\nIt's quite clear now: Williamson, the self-help author, and Phillips, a congressman from Minnesota, pose no threat to Biden, raising questions about how long they plan to stay in the race.\n\nBiden has ignored both and not suffered any consequences as a result.\n\nTheir brutal performances in South Carolina came after Biden won the New Hampshire primary overwhelmingly last month even though his name did not appear on the ballot. Biden won as a write-in candidate after Phillips hinged his campaign on claiming a symbolic New Hampshire win in Biden's absence.\n\nBack-to-back blowout losses for Phillips, who upset many in the party when he launched a late primary challenge in October, beg the question whether it is time to bow out.\n\nPhillips, though, said he is pressing on even as it appeared he will finish third behind Williamson.\n\n\"Cracking four digits never felt so good!\" Phillips said on the social media site X, formerly Twitter. \"Congratulations, Mr. President, on a good old fashioned whooping.

Last election, the primary was won with only 4,200 votes.\n\nThis year, after seeing her city rocked by shootings and labeled \"Murder Town\" in a Newsweek article about violence, Crifasi said she has had enough – and viewed becoming a registered Democrat her only chance of lending her voice to who becomes Wilmington's next mayor.\n\n\"I know for a fact the mayor's race is decided in the primary,\" said Crifasi, who lives in an affluent neighborhood near the Delaware Art Museum. \"I've lived in this city for a really long time, and it is a critical time.\"\n\nCrifasi's move to the Democratic Party is a reflection of Republicans feeling disenfranchised in Delaware's largest city, where there are five times as many Democrats as members of the Grand Old Party. The practice of having closed primaries, in which only registered members of the party can cast ballots, further diminishes influence non-Democrats have on local government.\n\nVoters had until May to change party affiliation with the state Department of Elections, and the more than 1,000 new Democrats on the city's voter rolls represents a significant shift compared with the last mayoral primary in 2012 – when Dennis P. Williams won the primary and only 292 voters changed their registration to vote Democrat.\n\nWilliams, a former state representative who went on to win the mayor's office in the general election, this year faces seven contenders in the September primary: City Council President Theo Gregory; former City Council President Norm Griffiths; Kevin Kelley, a former councilman who was runner-up to Williams four years ago; longtime state Rep. Robert Marshall; City Councilwoman Maria Cabrera; newcomer Eugene Young; and Mike Purzycki, head of the city’s Riverfront Development Corp.\n\nThe winner of the primary faces Independent Steven Washington, a special education teacher, in November. No Republicans have filed for the race.\n\nThe race for the Democratic nomination has seen candidates spar over economic development and slowing violence in the city's poorest neighborhoods.\n\nWith so many vying for city government's top job this year, candidates and political observers say only 2,200 to 3,000 votes could secure victory in the Democratic primary.\n\nThat's why the large number of new Democrats could put one candidate over the top if he or she is able to capture half the votes of those who switched, said Fred Sears, former president and chief executive officer of the nonprofit aid organization known as the Delaware Community Foundation and previous City Council member.\n\n\"It could be huge,\" Sears said.\n\nSTORY: Wilmington mayor, without a mandate\n\nSTORY: Mayoral candidates go after each other at debate\n\nSears said the city has not seen such a large push to change registration ahead of the primary since Republicans came out to help Dan Frawley beat then-City Council President Frank Vari in the 1984 Democratic primary for mayor. In 2008, Democratic voter rolls swelled by more than 4,100 statewide ahead of Gov. Jack Markell's tight race with then-Lieutenant Gov. and current candidate for governor John Carney.\n\nState GOP Chairman Charlie Copeland said the practice is damaging to the party. Only a quarter of Republicans who switched ahead of the Carney-Markell primary returned to the GOP, he noted.\n\nDemocrats make up 47 percent of the state's electorate, followed by Republicans at 28 percent. Independents comprise 22 percent of the voting population in Delaware, according to the most recent voter registration statistics from the Department of Elections.\n\n\"I respect anyone's decision to do what they want for their vote,\" Copeland said. \"I'm just saying they are going to be disappointed with their choice.\"\n\nEight months ago, the state GOP conducted a poll of those who switched for the 2008 race and found the overwhelming majority were disappointed in the candidate they had jumped the aisle to support.\n\nSome say this year's influx of voters into the Democrat ranks in Wilmington residents' unhappiness with Williams, as well as frustration among non-Democrats, who, for decades, have had no real say in the city's leadership.\n\n\"People have been upset for years,\" said Kelley, who was defeated in the 2012 primary by Williams. \"This is due to a mass frustration toward Williams.\"\n\nOthers point to a concentrated campaign by those supporting Purzycki's campaign.\n\nIn the months leading up to the deadline to switch party affiliation, some of the city's most prominent non-Democrats started the \"Republicans and Independents for Mike\" campaign, which saw telephone and mailing outreach persuading residents to switch registration to support Purzycki.\n\n\"It is no secret that the next mayor will be a Democrat and will be chosen in the Sept. 13 primary,” reads a letter posted on the Republicans and Independents for Mike website. “Our only option is to switch parties.”\n\nThe letter was signed by Jane Castle, the wife of former Congressman Mike Castle, the last Republican elected Delaware governor. State election records show Jane Castle has changed her affiliation, while her husband has not. Attempts to reach Mike and Jane Castle were unsuccessful.\n\nThe note was also signed by well-known Wilmington Republicans Joe DiPinto, a former state representative and Wilmington city councilman, and Bill Manning, a prominent local attorney.\n\n\"The Republican party in the city is presently and has been for a decade or so fairly moribund ...,\" DiPinto said. \"If I am not registered for a party that has a candidate on the ticket, that is essentially a disenfranchisement.\"\n\nDiPinto said he switched party affiliations in the lead-up to the 2012 mayoral primary. He lobbied others to do so as well, but the effort started too late to convince enough voters to alter the outcome.\n\n\"In my view, this is the first time you have well-respected and well-known Republicans like DiPinto and Manning saying, 'It is OK to do this,'\" said Rhett Ruggerio, a Delaware lobbyist who ran mayoral campaigns for former Mayor James Baker.\n\nPurzycki described the Castle family as \"close friends.\" He said wooing non-Democrats has been a feature of his campaign and is not something he is ashamed of.\n\n\"Everybody in the city has the right to be safe and have economic vitality,\" Purzycki said. \"There is nothing partisan about those issues.\"\n\nExperts and candidates are split on how the switch-campaign on behalf of Purzycki will influence the primary's outcome.\n\nSome point to the fact that nearly half of those who switched are in the city's affluent 8th District, described by all as stronghold for Purzycki.\n\n“I think it is huge,” Ruggerio said. “I think he will get a lot of support from Democrats as well.”\n\nVIDEO: Wilmington mayoral candidates debate the arts\n\nSTORY: Wilmington mayor on debates: Why be a 'punching bag?'\n\nPurzycki said he is isn't entirely sure how many will support him, though he is confident a large portion will.\n\n\"It can be a pretty significant number in determining the outcome of the election if you walk away with 700 or 800 of those votes,\" Purzycki said.\n\nOthers said the situation is muddied by multiple city civic and neighborhood organizations that have been driving non-Democrats to switch parties on behalf of candidates other than Purzycki.\n\n\"A group of associations and candidates have all pushed Republicans and independents to change their registration,\" said Paul Calistro, executive director of Wilmington's West End Neighborhood House, who is supporting Young's campaign. \"I think what you will get is a greater turnout. Will it sway the election? No.\"\n\nYoung said he has spoken with voters outside the Democratic Party about making the switch, but he has not focused on it to the degree Purzycki has.\n\n\"If there is an independent who feels they should be involved in the process of this election because they want their vote to count, so be it,\" Young said.\n\nMarshall said he thinks the votes of many who switched are up for grabs.\n\n\"I am encouraged because I believe that when those who have switched read about my record, I will get part of that change in registration group,\" Marshall said.\n\nLikewise, Gregory believes the new Democrats were more motivated by angst toward the Williams' administration than support for Purzycki. Courting voters across the aisle has not been a significant feature of his campaign, Gregory said, but he is now working to woo those who have switched.\n\n\"I do not think it is enough for [Purzycki] to pull ahead,\" Gregory said. \"I don't think he is popular enough with Democrats, and I am not conceding votes [of those who switched].\"\n\nMike Brown, a Republican City Council member, shamed his fellow Republicans behind the push to switch. He doesn't like the practice of lobbying others to switch parties for a primary vote. But after seeing the push for Purzycki, Brown began advocating for others to do so in support of Gregory.\n\nBrown believes the effort to recruit Republicans on behalf of Purzycki is a racially motivated ploy to diminish black leadership in the city.\n\n\"Race is behind this. African-Americans have been in charge of the top layer of government for 20 years,\" Brown said. \"For '12, we were getting it right under Baker. Then we fell short for four years. That doesn't give anybody the right to undermine the voting process.\n\n\"You have Mike Purzycki, who folks are looking to be the great white hope, to ride his great white horse with his great white hat and say, 'I'm here to save Wilmington,'\" said Brown, adding that he does not feel Purzycki has the city government experience needed to do the job.\n\nPurzycki called the allegation \"offensive\" and said it \"makes no sense.\"\n\n\"All anybody wants is the city to be safe and it to function well and government to work,\" Purzycki said. \"Nobody cares about the race of the individuals. It has never come up for one minute.\"\n\nCabrera said she doesn't believe race is motivating the Purzycki push.\n\n\"I'd say it is more selfish because he wants to get those votes,\" Cabrera said.\n\nShe noted race always plays a role in Wilmington elections. She is the only Latino candidate running for mayor. She said a feature of her campaign has been registering more Latinos to vote. Cabrera has also encouraged independents and Republicans to switch registration to support her, she said.\n\nWilliams did not return a phone call seeking comment about his campaign. But his campaign manager, Ed Osborne, said in his time working with Williams, there has never been a suggestion to pursue voters of another party.\n\n\"Mayor Williams will either win as a Democrat or lose as a Democrat,\" Osborne said. \"But in the end, he will have been loyal to his party and the Democrat voters in the city of Wilmington.\"\n\nOsborne said Purzycki's attempt to win votes from Republicans is an underhanded trick.\n\n\"Being from a generation that still respects our Constitution and democracy, I have a big problem with Republicans and Democrats switching,\" Osborne said. \"If you can't win as a Democrat, then maybe you should be running on the Republican ticket.\"\n\nPurzycki disagreed, saying local government should be divorced from party politics because local issues are typically not partisan. He said changing the system would allow more people to have their say in who leads.\n\n\"We have thousands of people that say, 'OK, I'd like to switch' and it is too late,\" Purzycki said of the May deadline for switching party registration. \"Some days you just wonder if we should even have partisan elections in municipal government.\"\n\nKelley said the deadline to switch parties should be moved to August. He said it is time for multiple candidates to drop out of the race so voters can get a clearer picture of who can win and who has the best ideas.\n\nQUICK LINK: Free tickets to July 19 mayoral debate\n\nSTORY: Wilmington residents want future mayor to tackle crime\n\n\"You split the pot up enough, the mayor is liable to get back in,\" Kelley said.\n\nRuggerio said there has been movement in the past to reform the primary system for more participation, but politics always got in the way.\n\n\"The Democrats are in power right now,\" Ruggerio said. \"They look at things and say, 'We have it pretty good, why would we mess with that?'\"\n\nThough he feels the campaign on behalf of Purzycki increased the number of voters who switched, Ruggerio said picking a winner this early is a \"crapshoot.\"\n\n\"I do think the race is up for grabs,\" Ruggerio said.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

Williams remaining conspicuously absent for the same reason as before – he doesn't want to be his rivals' \"punching bag.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Williams’ no-show playbook was less effective than it had been in previous debates in which his opponents were reluctant to beat up the incumbent. Moderators' questions were more directly aimed at Williams’ tenure of leadership, pushing back against his favored political strategy of running on his record without speaking to the public through the news media.\n\nSTORY: Kevin Kelley has narrow lead in Wilmington mayoral race\n\nSTORY: No one backs out of Wilmington mayoral race by deadline\n\n“If he had the guts, he would show up at the debate,” state Sen. Bob Marshall said of Williams.\n\nAttending the debate Tuesday were his opponents for the Sept. 13 Democratic primary: Councilwoman Maria Cabrera, City Council President Theo Gregory, former City Council President Norman Griffiths, former City Councilman Kevin Kelley, Marshall, Riverfront Development Corp. Executive Director Mike Purzycki and Delaware Center for Justice Advocacy Director Eugene Young.\n\nThe winner of the primary will face Independent candidate Steven Washington in the general election.\n\nNo Republicans have entered the contest, but Purzycki’s courtship of Wilmington’s GOP voters lead to a dust-up on campaigning and race in the city. There were accusations that his campaign pushed white Republicans to switch parties and vote for him.\n\nPurzycki denied race had anything to do with what he called a voter registration drive.\n\n“We found people who supported us and made sure they were registered,” Purzycki said.\n\nYoung said race is a pivotal issue in Wilmington and has shaped the election, especially where candidates target their time and messages.\n\n“White candidates campaign in white areas, black candidates in black areas,” he said.\n\nBut Cabrera pushed back against the flare-up, saying she has her own base of Republican supporters who are disaffected by a “good old boy” network of Democrats who control citywide elections.\n\n“You have this whole block of people who do not get to vote in the elections because we do not have open elections,” Cabrera said.\n\nThe night seemed to be the culmination of previous mayoral debates, which have focused on public safety, economic development and the arts. Quality of life, the candidates said through a collection of answers, is all these things and the way they manifest in citizens' daily lives.\n\nDirect questions on such issues were answered and forgotten, and it was the moderators' prodding to have the candidates talk about each other that carried the night.\n\n“We didn’t talk about those things tonight, so I’m not sure what the whole quality-of-life debate was about,” Cabrera said.\n\nShe wasn’t alone in voicing that opinion, though none of the candidates tried to steer the conversation in the direction of quality of life.\n\n“I, like Maria, am sorry we did not speak to the topics and talk more in depth about leadership and the kind of leader you want,” Griffiths said.\n\nMaybe more than at any of the previous debates, the candidates bared their teeth when the questions shifted to leadership. They targeted each other’s qualifications, motivations and methods, and the packed house ate it up.\n\nPurzycki and Young engaged in a back-and-forth about experience, with Purzycki saying the city has too large a budget and too many workers to have a mayor without a lengthy résumé.\n\n“We already have seen what happens when you tell someone with no executive experience, ‘Here run the city,’” he said.\n\n[Editor's note: If you do not see a poll question here, please refresh this page.]\n\nYoung fired back, disassociating the sense it takes to run a business with what it takes to manage a city.\n\n“When I become mayor, first of all, Mike has done a great job with the Riverfront,” Young said. “Let’s be clear about a couple things, it’s not a corporation where you … just turn a profit. Being mayor, the test is people.”\n\nMarshall didn’t make any friends at the table when he slammed Wilmington’s City Council for present and past failures. He invoked recent shootings as proof the council and its members are impotent to effect change.\n\nGregory took up arms for himself and Cabrera in what quickly became a heated exchange.\n\n“We are very big proponents for community policing,” Gregory said of the council. “We have done everything we can to get this mayor to do legitimate community policing.”\n\nThe ultimate audience, however, was not at the table at the front of the gym but in the chairs and stairwells filled with residents. Many in the crowd clearly came to support a candidate for whom they already have plans to vote, but the feedback when the debate heated up often drowned out the candidates.\n\nFor Bill Charles, Tuesday's debate made his decision for him.\n\n\"It's a time for change,\" Bill Charles said, voicing support for Eugene Young. \"He's more for the youth, the ones in trouble in the judicial system. There's a lot of youth in the jails, and when they come out, people don't want to do anything for them and he's willing to do that.\"\n\nDennis Gallagher, 65, came into the debate favoring Young but said he thinks some policy and personality from each would make the best candidate. He was disappointed in the debate overall.\n\n\"The debate was kind of weak,\" Gallagher said. \"The questions weren't really about the topic, and the candidates didn't respond to what they were asked.\"\n\nAndre Ackerman expressed frustration with some of the candidates, saying that he thinks many of their promises are shams.\n\nSTORY: Wilmington police: 71% of public safety recommendations implemented\n\nSTORY: The News Journal to host New Castle County executive debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everybody just says the same things to get people's votes,\" he said. \"Year after year, things still stay the same.\"\n\nMartha Patterson said Kelley’s plans to foster better relationships between law enforcement and the community really struck a nerve with her. Patterson, who lives near the Hilltop area, said that she often feels unsafe in the city. While she believes that bringing more business to Wilmington is an important issue, safety needs to come first.\n\nAsked about what she thought about the other candidates, Patterson said, “I just don’t think that they can do it like Kevin.”\n\nSwiyah Whittington, 36, has attended several mayoral debates this year, but she said she still doesn't have her mind made up over which candidate she'll vote for in September. In the end, Whittington, a lifelong Wilmington resident, said that she will choose a candidate she believes is the most concerned about crime, poverty and education – all quality-of-life issues that did not get the kind of focus the debate had promised.\n\nJessica Reyes, Quint Forgey, Jordan McBride and Xerxes Wilson contributed to this article.\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 324-2785 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Previous versions of this story mischaracterized Mike Purzycki's elected history.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/local/2022/11/08/election-day-2022-georgia-live-updates-savannah-chatham-bryan-county-voting/8265886001/", "title": "Election Day 2022 in Georgia: Live updates from Chatham, Bryan ...", "text": "Staff reports\n\nElection Day in Georgia is all over but the countin'.\n\nPolls closed at 7 p.m. across the state, bringing to a close a contentious midterm election driven by interest in a governor's race rematch, a U.S. Senate contest pitting Sen.

So No. 1, that's huge,” Jessie said. “And we like doing our part to make Georgia a little bluer.”\n\nThe two were also surprised at the efficiency and friendliness of the precinct, which they said was at-odds with their California voting experiences.\n\n\"The gentleman (at the ballot machine) made sure to count my number. He was like, ‘make sure your number was counted,’\" Earth said. “It felt like they had an intention of making sure the vote was counted properly. And I've never had someone say that to me before. So that was important.”\n\nThe Thunderbolt residents said they were excited to do their civic duty, turning their voting time into date night.\n\n“We’re not just transplants either.

She said 900 registered voters in her precinct, 4-08, voted early and another 90 mailed in absentee ballots.\n\n\"It’s pretty good, but we hope to have at least 1,000 (ballots cast),\" she said. \"I would rather have 1,200...\"\n\nReed added that the precinct had not had any issues, \"because I don't allow them.\"\n\nAcross the street at precinct 4-07, poll manager Norma Canicatti said all but two of their machines had not been properly programmed with today's date and time, but her team solved the issue before doors opened at 7 a.m.\n\n\"We had about 30 (people) in line at 7, and we cleared them right out.

The church just off Georgia 21 has seen around 175 voters.\n\nEllen Gehrke said this year’s election is especially important as she is concerned about the state of small business owners.\n\n“I’m passionate about getting our economy under control,” said Gehrke. “People don’t have money for extra spending. In general, voting for people who have small communities and business owners at heart is who I voted for. Gas prices are high and that impacts how people spend with us and what we can do as a family.”\n\nWith her daughter in tow, Gehrke cast her ballot and explained to her youngster the importance of having a voice in this election, saying the number of voters have declined in recent years.\n\n“I was explaining to her this is important because those that lead us are the ones that make decisions for us,” said Gehrke. “I went over the process with her and I think it was important for her to see that.”\n\nJordan Callais was eager to cast his vote at Bethel Luthe Church in Springfield. He is leaning more towards Gov. Brian Kemp because of his investment in local communities, as well as protecting Georgians’ rights to carry.\n\n“I like Kemp,” said Callais. “I think there are things he could have done better but I prefer him over Miss Abrams because I feel like he understands more about the agriculture side of things. Being born and raised here, when it comes to gun laws, I agree more with Kemp on that. I think he has more of what I’m interested in.”\n\nCallais said voting integrity is always on the back of his mind when he casts his vote, citing the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“The media talks about it a lot so I do think about it,” said Callais. “Your thinking about it and questioning it. But I’ve never been worried too much about our state becoming like that.”\n\n3:05 p.m. | Hopeful voter turned away at Tybee precinct after registering too late\n\nThis section has been updated to reflect that Tybee Island has two voting precincts, not one, as previously reported. We regret the error.\n\nLily Heines showed up to vote at the Tybee Island precinct, 4-11, but was turned away.\n\n“I registered (to vote) three days ago,” the island native said. “In hindsight, it’s way too soon.”\n\nWhile defeated she wasn’t able to vote — Georgia required all voters to register by Oct. 11, four weeks before Election Day — she did not begrudge the poll workers at the Tybee YMCA who turned her away.\n\n“It’s not their fault, they’re just messengers,” she said. “I learned my lesson.”\n\nThe YMCA where Heines sought to cast her ballot is one of two voting precincts on Tybee Island. By 2:45 pm, 545 people had cast their ballots in-person at precinct 4-11.\n\n2:52 p.m. | The 'A-Team' on Talahi Island is fielding an efficient polling location\n\nThe “A-Team” of poll workers at Lighthouse Baptist Church on Talahi Island — precinct 4-04 — welcomed Election Day with a line of 30 people before doors opened, according to manager Dave King.\n\n“By 7:20 a.m., the line was cleared,” King said.\n\nThe precinct is in unincorporated county and seen 468 voters cast their ballots by 2 p.m., according to King, who credited his team of about eight volunteers with the efficiency of their operation.\n\n“I’m blessed to have them, they’ve made my day easier,” the first-time poll manager said.\n\nDebbi Reid was in and out “in seconds” when she voted at 2:15 Tuesday afternoon. On a break from work, she said she’s been voting at the church for 15 years and has never had an issue.\n\nReid said she was not well-versed on the TSPLOST referendum but knew which candidates she wanted to vote for.\n\n“I wanna see the right people in the right office,” Reid said.\n\n2:30 p.m. | Steady flow of voters showing up in Guyton\n\nPineora Baptist Church in Guyton has seen a steady flow of voters throughout the day but more than expected, according to poll manager Sue Payne. The site has been free of any hiccups related to faulty machines or other technical issues.\n\n“We have had about 350 people come through today, which is a lot for this precinct,” said Payne.\n\nLameisha Hunter-Kelly has been overwhelmed by this year’s election, saying each party’s political strategy in ad campaigns can divide communities. “We are being saturated with political commercials and I’m tired of the negativity,” said Hunter-Kelly.\n\nShe went on to say she is not concerned about voting integrity. As a former poll worker, she understands the hard work that goes into getting everything prepped for the big day.\n\n“I believe some of that is perceived and made up,” said Hunter-Kelly. “I know what it’s like from the inside and the steps it entails to make sure all votes are counted.”\n\n2:22 p.m. | Democrat candidates Wade Herring and Derek Mallow share lunch at Randy's BBQ\n\nAs Chatham, Bryan, Effingham and Liberty County residents head to the polls to vote for the next U.S. House Rep. for the 1st District, Democratic candidate Wade Herring talked to Chatham voters outside Randy's BBQ in Savannah at lunchtime on Tuesday.\n\nHerring was joined by Georgia Senate candidate Derek Mallow, who is running against Republican candidate Clinton Young for the state senate seat held by Lester Jackson. Jackson gave up the seat to run for the Democratic nomination for the state Labor commissioner post, but lost in the primary.\n\nHerring is trying to unseat U.S. House Rep. Buddy Carter, who has held the position since 2015.\n\n1:47 p.m. | Savannah State students head to the polls despite lack of options on campus\n\n“I think the importance of voting is controlling your future,” Savannah State University student Jadon Adams said. “[With] the lawmakers, you don’t want to be put in a bad position, so if you want to control that, you should go vote.”\n\nThe 2022 Election season was one of Adams’ first voting experiences, which was very enjoyable for him.\n\n“It was very fun because it was one of my first times voting. I thought it was going to take a long time, but it didn’t. It was very productive.”\n\n“...If you want to see change happen, you have to vote for the people you want in office,” student Nadiri Morrison says.\n\nHis second time voting was a “smooth-sailing” process. To students who are interested in voting, but may not know where to start, Morrison suggests: “Ask your parents [or] an adult who is either eligible to vote or has been voting for a long time so they can help you with that process.”\n\nMorgan Usher hasn’t voted yet but considers voting to be very important.\n\n“It’s important because you want the right people in office… on a local level, it’s very important to have the right people in office to help the [community].”\n\nUsher voted in the 2016 elections and didn’t enjoy the experience as much as she expected to. “It was a long line [and] we were cold outside… but it was smooth after that.”\n\nShe plans to vote in the next major election.\n\nHope Tennison wanted to vote but wasn’t able to due to the lack of polling access on campus.\n\n“I’m not voting because there really aren’t facilities to vote at now that I can get to easily without access to a car or taking a bus… I can’t vote because I don’t have transportation.”\n\nDespite the lack of voting resources, Tennison still considers voting to be very important for the younger generation. “I do believe voting is important for students,” she said.\n\n“We are going to be the ones who are growing up in the world that the [government officials] have control over. Of course, our opinion does matter because we’re going to be the ones stepping into that world.\"\n\nJamari Rice is going to his hometown of Atlanta to participate in the election season.\n\n“For me… the importance of voting is what you see in the future,” he says. “People you can count on and rely on and who can help you with your needs and wants… having your voice heard.”\n\nRice believes that the students who are active voters are the resources for students who are becoming interested in their civic responsibility. “We have to pass [our knowledge] down to people [younger] than us or those who are starting to get into voting… People may not realize how important it is.”\n\n1:37 p.m. | New voters at Georgia Southern Armstrong exercise their right\n\n“I do believe that voting is important because that is a way for us just as a people and a race to express the way that we feel and to get into politics,” Georgia Southern student Da’Jah Moore says.\n\n“That is also a way for us to have a voice. We get to speak up and say what we do agree with and what we do disagree with, by also being proactive in our country.”\n\nMoore plans to vote later on during the day and considers herself a consistent voter.\n\n“… I do try to get out and exercise my right, and to just have a say-so. There are some people that are aligned with my morals, my values and the things that I do believe in. That’s why I do try to get out and be proactive, and I spread the word so we can all be proactive.”\n\nStudent Jocelyn Fitzpatrick is considerably new to the voting world but understands its importance. “My parents were never really big on politics… so I never really had the chance to vote, but I would like to start sometime soon,” Fitzpatrick says.\n\n“It’s our country as well. We are people of the country, and we should have a say in what gets done.”\n\n“I think that in the grand scheme of things, if everyone votes… If it’s something that everyone decides is important and everyone is actually doing their research and looking into it, everyone could make a big difference,” student Olivia Forrest says.\n\n“Regardless of your opinions, just having that option to be able to voice what you believe is super powerful. I think taking advantage of that is crucial to seeing the America we want to live in.”\n\nDavid Trappio just turned 18 and cannot wait to register and begin voting.\n\n“I do think that voting is absolutely important, especially if you have a general concept of what you want to happen, whether it’s in your general area or just in the world, period,” he says.\n\n“With all the things that are going on in our society, it’s huge. I think that for our generation, our voices matter. For years in the past, they haven’t, but now that we have the platform, I think it’s important that we should vote,” says student Maya Brown, a new voter.\n\n“I think it’s important to vote because everyone has a voice. If you want to see what you want out of your country, then it’s your duty to vote. That’s how you see change,” Hugh Markowsky said.\n\nMarkowsky voted at one of the polling precincts in Downtown Savannah.\n\n11:42 a.m. | Process 'rolling along' after 'heavy early voting'\n\nVoting at precinct 2-03 was smooth sailing Tuesday morning, according to poll manager Neota McMora.\n\n\"We're just rolling along,\" she said.\n\nMcMora has been working at the same precinct for 15 years, and said this year's turnout was average, \"but after such heavy early voting, we expected that,\" she said.\n\nAcross Savannah's eastside, poll workers said machines were working well and there had been no major issues during the first half of Election Day.\n\nFor McMora and her crew, Election Day serves as a way to interact with the community. She said she has watched kids come in with parents voting, \"and now they're coming to vote themselves.\"\n\nSeveral precincts reported average \"or slightly above\" turnout. McMora said she expects the day to continue in much the same way.\n\n\"We’ve been steady and not had any problems. Now, we got about ... \" McMora said as she glanced at her watch, seeing there was eight hours left of voting. \"So we'll see.\"\n\n10:58 a.m. | Still no Bruno, but 'Bruno Jr.' makes his debut\n\nAs far as local Election Day folklore in Savannah goes, there are not many recurring oddities.\n\nBut at Precinct 1-05, the Jewish Educational Alliance, poll manager Jeannette Cooper, who has been doing this for almost two decades, has contributed plenty to the mythos.\n\nIn 2019, when Georgia rolled out the Dominion voting system, Cooper and her poll workers came to love an especially bulky scanner, who they affectionately named \"Bruno.\" Bruno was larger than the other scanners, which accept paper copies of the ballots in each polling place.\n\nBruno was special. Brurno was unique. And since 2019, Bruno has been missing.\n\nDuring the primary, it wasn't Bruno providing voters with a paper audit. It was another scanner, of regular size, which Cooper named \"Dummy.\"\n\nThis year, Cooper and the election workers at the JEA missed Bruno again, but this time, they were feeding the ballots to a machine, also of regular size, that Cooper called \"Bruno Jr.\"\n\nSome poll workers said this machine was Bruno's stepson, and Cooper said it was performing well. About 200 voters had been through by 10 a.m.\n\n\"Junior's doing good, he's really doing it all today,\" Cooper said. \"Everything is going good, it's beautiful, we had no line. There were a bunch of people waiting on that door to open, and once that door opened, piece of cake.\"\n\nOtherwise, Cooper said things were shipshape at the JEA. Cooper said there hadn't been any issues to speak of earlier in the day. Cooper, the poll workers and yes, Bruno Jr., were working hard to make sure voters got in and out quickly.\n\n10:51 a.m. | Voters mull issues such as TSPLOST, abortion rights\n\nElizabeth Williams, 57, was among the first group of people to cast their ballots at the Moses Jackson Community Center. The most important thing that brought the West Savannah resident out that morning?\n\n\"Change,\" Williams said. \"Make sure those Democrats stay in office.\"\n\nOne of the biggest decisions on the ballot is the Transportation Local Options Sales Tax, which is a penny sales tax that would go toward transportation projects in the county. Just a few miles down the street was a sign that urged residents to vote \"no\" on TSPLOST.\n\n\"I won't be voting (for TSPLOST),\" Williams said as she gestured toward the road. \"I don't see any improvements. Not in this neighborhood.\"\n\nRoman Hughes, 51, was on his way to work when he decided to stop by the community center to cast his ballot beforehand. In West Savannah, he wants to see the city cleaned up. In Georgia and beyond, abortion is an issue that weighs on his mind.\n\nTelevision advertisements attacking both Republican candidate Herschel Walker and incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, have dominated the Georgia airwaves in the past few months. Hughes noted the allegations made against Walker and said that while he's \"not sure if all the stuff they're saying about him are correct,\" he believes most are, sharing the same sentiment with Williams about keeping the Democrats in office.\n\nAt Resurrection of our Lord Catholic Church in West Savannah, Uncle Rodney Middleton, as his niece affectionately called him, turned out to vote around 8 a.m. Tuesday to make sure the next generation has \"better power.\"\n\nAt Rothwell Baptist Church in Pooler, the 2022 midterm elections marked 18-year-old Taylor Rexroat's first time being able to vote. While she felt nervous going into the polling station, the process was easier and faster than she had imagined.\n\nStacey Collins, 49, is turning 50 on Wednesday. But before she ushers in a new age, the Pooler resident welcomed this year's Election Day by performing her civic duty at the Pooler Recreation Park gymnasium.\n\n\"There's so many important issues that we're facing right now ... the economy, inflation, education.\"\n\nAll was calm at there on Tuesday morning as voters got in and out of the gym with ease, \"I voted\" stickers in their hands.\n\n\"I would just shout out to Chatham County, especially this location,\" Collins said. \"I mean, they're running it professionally. It was easy. It took me less than five minutes to get through the whole process and I'm used to longer lines where I came from when I moved to this area.\n\n\"I've been pleasantly surprised by how well it's run, especially for such a fairly-heavily populated area.\"\n\n10:42 a.m. | A college student's perspective on voting in Georgia\n\nAsher Freidberg, an Illinois native, became a Georgia voter this year ahead of the midterm elections. The Savannah College of Art and Design senior was excited to cast his vote and make his voice heard Tuesday morning at his precinct, the W.W. Law Community Center on East Bolton Street.\n\n“I'm just not a fan of a lot of focus on election denying and stuff like that,” Freidberg said. “I try to keep my head out of that. My vote counts.”\n\nWhile it was his first time voting in Georgia, he said the process was streamlined and the poll workers at Precinct 2-03 were helpful.\n\nThe college student said his top issue was protecting a “woman’s right to choose” whether she wants an abortion or not, but he was not prepared to vote on TSPLOST, the transportation penny sales tax referendum that would approve $600 million in tax revenue for roadway improvements, sidewalk construction and other transportation-related projects across the county.\n\n“I have to admit, I didn't know that. I read about them. It was interesting. I have to admit, I wish I had more time to look it up in advance, but reading it, I feel like I made the right choice,” Freidberg said of his vote.\n\nFreidberg said registering in Georgia was important to him, particularly when it comes to key battleground races, including the U.S. Senate race between incumbent Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, and Herschel Walker, a Republican.\n\n“I'd like to say that I think Herschel Walker has no chance but it's kind of scary,” Freidberg said, referencing the latest polls showing Warnock with less than a 1-point lead over the former UGA running back. “I'm a big supporter of Raphael Warnock, so it'd be a real shame if it got to a run-off. I swear, comparing these two men ... it's almost an insult.”\n\n10:30 a.m.| An issue with a printer — we've all been there\n\nSavannah High School's precinct, 3-03, was down one voting booth as of 9:30 a.m.\n\nThe printer was not working, according to a poll worker, but a county technician has already been by to pick up the broken printer and a new one was on the way.\n\nThe precinct was operating with three of its four voting booths, but voters were slowly trickling in — there were 55 ballots cast by 9:30 — so it didn't cause a problem.\n\n9:51 a.m. | 'Eventful' start smoothed over at Trinity Lutheran Church\n\nSouthside locations were mostly running smoothly, with small technological issues here and there, but no long delays.\n\nAt the polling location at Windsor Forest Church, there were a huge chunk of early votes, but still a 20-foot line out of the door at 7 a.m., said poll manager Emily Wise.\n\nMeanwhile, at the polling location at Trinity Lutheran Church, voting started off “eventful,” said poll officer Napoleon Martin. The Ballot Marking Device (BMD) wasn’t working, causing a 10-15-minute delay for voters who came in around 7:30 a.m.\n\nThey could have switched to paper ballots, but chose not to, Martin added. Other than that, everything ran smoothly.\n\nAt around 9 a.m., however, the voting process was “perfect,” said voter Rachel Westfall. She said she has voted four times at Trinity Lutheran.\n\n“It was easy, people were really nice, absolutely no complaints,” Westfall said.\n\nGeorgetown Elementary, on 1516 King George Blvd., was busy, but it was also marked by early voting. According to poll manager Bobbie Torres, about 40% of voters were early voters. Still, at 7 a.m., 60 people waited in line inside, while 40 waited outside.\n\nTorres noted that she thinks one out of 10 people were new voters in Chatham County — either having just moved to the area or young, first-time eligible voters.\n\nTwo voters who voted together agreed that it was “easy to vote” at Georgetown Elementary. Both of them, who declined to provide their names because they didn’t want people knocking on their doors, voted Republican.\n\nThe female voter said she was motivated to vote because she wants to retake the house and senate. The male voter said he was motivated by two main issues: crime and inflation.\n\n“I foresee a runoff,” said the male voter.\n\n9:45 a.m. | Busy is 'lovely' at the polls\n\nOver at First Presbyterian Church (Precinct 1-01), poll manager Katherine Simmons said things were running smoothly.\n\nTuesday marked Simmons' second year serving as poll manager for the precinct, and she said she felt prepared. She had seen 283 voters come and go since the day started, and it was only 9:15 a.m.\n\n\"It's been very busy, which is lovely,\" Simmons said. \"There was a mad rush in the beginning, and now it's going pretty steady.\"\n\nSimmons said she is getting a handle on poll managing, with her first foray into the field coming during the primary over the summer.\n\n\"They train us really well. Before every election we get training (and) in case things change, a refresher,\" Simmons said. \"There's always going to be crazy stuff that happens, and we just try to problem solve, call the office if we need help.\"\n\n9:42 a.m. | No reported issues at Morningside Baptist Church\n\nIt was business as usual at Precinct 2-07 at Morningside Baptist Church on West Gwinnett Street.\n\nBy 9 a.m., there had been no reported issues with voting machines or processes.\n\nVoters Andre and Kesha Baxter were in and out in less than five minutes. They said the intense scrutiny on Georgia's voting procedures was for naught.\n\n\"It's definitely a bunch of fearmongering, but we understand,\" Andre Baxter said. \"We've been voting the same way for how many presidential elections? It's been done the same way for I don't know how long — mail-in ballots, stuff like that. So, what's the issue now?\"\n\nThe 2021 Georgia law restricted the number of drop-off ballot boxes, the length of time to request a mail-in ballot and established a statewide, nonpartisan position to oversee the validity of elections. Many have called the bill a move to restrict votes by the Republican Party, while the GOP said the measures are an attempt to safeguard elections.\n\nFor voters like the Baxters, a Black couple who live on Savannah's Eastside, the changes had no impact on their in-person voting plans. \"It's quick and easy,\" they said.\n\n8:51 a.m. | Abortion rights issue impacts midterm elections\n\nAbortion rights were top of mind for Shekita Hendrix at the Salvation Army, where she cast her vote in person around 8:25 Tuesday morning.\n\n\"That's one of the main issues being a woman myself and having a daughter,\" Hendrix said as she left her voting precinct, 2-09. \"I think most people should be able to control what goes on with their body without the government having any say so in it.\"\n\nAbortion rights have been a crucial issue for many voters across the political spectrum and country, as America takes to the polls for midterm elections. And in Georgia, key races have turned the Peach State into a battleground for control of the U.S. Congress yet again.\n\nThe national spotlight on Georgia — and endless tide of political ads and fundraising — didn't do much to sway Hendrix toward one candidate. She stuck to the issues.\n\n\"My mind was pretty much made up of who I wanted to vote for, so it didn't sway me or change my mind about who I wanted to vote for. I kept it straightforward: looked at the Democrats and what they had to offer and voted from that,\" Hendrix said.\n\nAnd while the state already has seen a record number of early voters, in-person voting for the midterms far outpaced morning turnout during the June primaries.\n\nHendrix was one of 115 people to cast their vote before 8:30 a.m., where poll workers said there had been no issues with machinery or processes.\n\n8:43 a.m. | Status report from Chatham Board of Elections Supervisor: Smooth start\n\nIt's the busiest day of the year for Chatham Board of Elections Supervisor Billy Wooten, but this ain't his first rodeo.\n\nWooten's first year at the helm of the BOE was last year, and he's got two decades of poll managing experience before that. He said, as far as he could tell, it was a smooth start to the day.\n\nWooten said as of about 8:20 a.m. Tuesday morning, no polls in Chatham County had seen issues that caused them to delay their opening time — a good sign, as a poll opening late can lead to extensions to polling hours later Tuesday evening.\n\n\"We had some power issues, a few polls had connectivity issues, or too much plugged into one circuit,\" Wooten said. \"But we've got all that resolved right now, as far as I know.\"\n\nWooten said the only issues seen so far this morning involved plugging too many voting machines into a single electrical outlet cluster, a common issue since the implementation of the Dominion Voting System in 2020. But Wooten says these issues were cleared out quickly by technicians. On Election Day, voting machine technicians field reports of equipment errors throughout the county, going from precinct to precinct solving issues. Wooten said there are 16 countywide today.\n\nOverall, he said the day is off to a good start as far as Election Day goes, but they're remaining vigilant.\n\n\"I think it's a good start so far, but there's always gonna be issues. Always,\" Wooten said.\n\n7:57 a.m. | Questions on the TSPLOST funding\n\nElection day rose over Savannah on Tuesday morning, and the air was cool.\n\nOutside Holy Spirit Lutheran Church (Precinct 2-05) on East 37th Street, a line of about 10 people had formed by 7:15 a.m.\n\nKristin Harward-Grant was in line, looking over a printed list of constitutional amendment questions tacked onto the bottom of the ballot.\n\nShe was talking to her neighbors in line about the Transportation Local Options Sales Tax, or TSPLOST, and noted that while she supports the idea of using tax dollars to improve roads, she questioned the vagueness of the project lists.\n\n\"I like the idea of it, but I just think it's going to hurt those who live here,\" Harward-Grant said. \"I just don't think it's going to go where they say it's going to go.\"\n\nBy 7:45 a.m. the line had moved through into the poll, with no one waiting outside. 48 people had voted by then.\n\n7:30 a.m. | Inflation disinformation?\n\nCampaign signs always seem to proliferate even more in the days right before an election. The 11th-hour popups this year? Signs that read simply \"Bacon $10.99,\" a reference to inflation in the grocery store and a condemnation of the political party in power, the Democrats.\n\nA quick run to Kroger showed the signs to be misleading: A pound of Smithfield bacon is on sale for $4.49 today. So two packages of bacon costs less than $10.99.\n\n7 a.m. | Early (Election Day) voting\n\nGeorgia saw midterm record high turnout for early in-person and absentee voting, with more than 2.5 million ballots submitted as of early in-person voting's close on Friday. Election Day voters were out early, too, with lines stretching outside of several precincts prior to the 7 a.m. opening of polls.\n\nDozens of voters snaked outside neighboring churches that are used as polling places on Wilmington Island as the sun came up. The same went for a polling place adjacent to Islands High School, much to the chagrin of arriving students. More than 100 voters waited in line to vote outside Coastal Cathedral in West Chatham.\n\nThe early rush is not unusual as many voters choose to complete their ballot before heading to work.\n\n7 a.m. | Polls are open.

For the latest news on the presidential election, read USA TODAY's live election updates for Tuesday, Oct. 29.\n\nJust eight days until Election Day.\n\nIn the final stretch of the 2024 presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are focused on two pivotal battlegrounds that could decide the race for the White House: Michigan and Georgia.\n\nThe Trump campaign scrambled to distance itself from a backlash against racist, vulgar, and sexist comments made by speakers at the former president's Sunday night rally at Madison Square Garden in New York. Harris and President Joe Biden both used the rally to contrast the Democratic campaign with Trump's, as polls continued to show a photo-finish race.\n\nHarris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz rallied together in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for one of their final pitches to swing state voters. The rally focused on individual freedoms, particularly reproductive rights that they said have been under assault since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Meanwhile, Trump delivered his final pitch to Atlanta voters on Monday evening in an address attacking his political opponents and urged his supporters to vote on Election Day.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage from the campaign trail.\n\nObama says Trump’s MSG rally featured 'the most sexist, racist, bigoted stereotypes'\n\nSpeaking at a Philadelphia rally supporting Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday night, former President Barack Obama ripped into Donald Trump’s rally in New York City.\n\n\"So the man holds this big rally at Madison Square Garden, and the warmup speakers were … trotting out and peddling the most racist, sexist, bigoted stereotypes,\" Obama said of the former president.\n\nComedian Tony Hinchliffe, one of the featured speakers, called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage and talked about carving watermelons with a Black friend.\n\n“These are fellow citizens he's talking about here in Philadelphia. They're your neighbor. They're your coworkers,” he said. “And that is the reason why this election should not be close. It should be clear.”\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nHarris at Michigan rally: Trump refused to 'acknowledge the pain' caused by overturning Roe v. Wade\n\nVice President Kamala Harris urged Michiganders to make their voices heard on Election Day at a Monday night rally in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nShe talked about her rival, former President Donald Trump, and his refusal to \"acknowledge the pain and suffering he has caused\" with the overturning of Roe v Wade.\n\n\"He insists that quote, everyone wanted for Roe v.

Most analysts believe the race is pretty much tied.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nTrump makes pitch to women\n\nThe gender gap appears to be very much on former President Donald Trump's mind.\n\nWhile not specifically mentioning Vice President Kamala Harris' substantial advantage among female voters, Trump devoted a segment of the Atlanta rally to a specific theme: \"I will protect the women of our country.\"\n\nTrump then proceeded to describe crime, illegal border crossings, and the economy as women's issues.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nTrump: 'I'm not a Nazi'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is spending part of this Atlanta rally disputing some Democratic accusations against him — including claims he is another \"Hitler\" and a \"Nazi.\"\n\n\"'He's Hitler!'\" Trump mockingly growled at one point. \"And then they say 'he's a Nazi.'\"\n\nHe quickly added: \"I'm not a Nazi ... I'm the opposite of a Nazi.\"\n\nTrump also disputed allegations that he is too old and \"tired,\" saying he has never been more energized.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nTrump opens Atlanta rally, criticizes Michelle Obama\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his Atlanta rally more than 50 minutes late, reminding Georgia voters how important they will be next week. \"We love Georgia,\" Trump told the cheering crowd.\n\nHe also started what was now his standard speech opening question: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? No, the crowd replied.\n\nTrump added a notable name to his Democratic attack list: former first lady Michelle Obama, who ripped the former president in a weekend speech.\n\n\"She was nasty,\" Trump told the Atlanta crowd.\n\nThe former first lady told Harris supporters about Trump: \"I hope that you’ll forgive me if I’m a little angry that we are indifferent to his erratic behavior, his obvious mental decline, his history as a convicted felon, a known slum lord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse, all of this while we pick apart Kamala’s answers from interviews that he doesn’t even have the courage to do.\"\n\nReplied Trump: \"That was a big mistake she made.\" He did not elaborate.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nTrump: Harris running a 'campaign of demonization and hate'\n\nAt one point, former President Donald Trump accused Vice President Kamala Harris of \"running a campaign of demonization and hate,\" drawing accusations of hypocrisy. \"She's a hater,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats pointed out that Trump is the one who has attacked Harris' intelligence, ethnicity, and competence.\n\nEarlier, Harris said Trump is \"fixated on his grievances, on himself and on dividing our country,\" citing Sunday's Madison Square Garden rally as the latest example.\n\n\"It is absolutely something that is intended to and is fanning the fuel of trying to divide our country,\" Harris said.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nJohn Legend calls Trump a 'career con artist'\n\nJohn Legend on Monday opened for a concert and rally supporting Vice President Kamal Harris at Temple University's Liacouras Center in Philadelphia, with the musician saying the Democratic presidential nominee would be a president for \"every American\" if elected.\n\n\"The contrast could not be clearer,\" Legend said, adding that former President Donald Trump was focused on serving Wall Street, billionaires, big corporations, and \"whichever dictator wrote him a nice note or gave him a hug.\"\n\nThe voters have a choice, Legend said — they could either pick Harris or \"you can stand with a career con artist who's far more interested in himself than in you.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and rockstar Bruce Springsteen are scheduled to attend the Philadelphia event.\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nMichelle Obama to campaign for Harris on Saturday\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama will stump for Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania, the Harris campaign announced Monday night. It did not specify where.\n\nDuring an appearance at a Michigan rally Saturday, Obama criticized former President Donald Trump, referring to the Republican presidential candidate as a \"convicted felon, a known slum lord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse\" who has \"no honesty, no decency, no morals.\"\n\n“I hope you’ll forgive me if I am worried that we will blow this opportunity to finally turn the page on this ugliness once and for all,” Obama said in the rally supporting Harris. \"Because believe me, if Donald Trump is president again, at some point or another, that ugliness will touch all of our lives.\"\n\nThough former President Barack Obama has headlined multiple rallies for Harris this month, it was not a given that his wife would appear at additional events.\n\nThe former first lady is also headlining a rally that’s being put on by her nonpartisan, nonprofit organization When We All Vote on Tuesday in Atlanta. She is expected to emphasize the importance of voting.\n\n— Francesca Chambers\n\nDemocrat on Trump's 'little secret' remark: It's incumbent 'to be transparent'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said during his Madison Square Garden rally that he has a \"little secret\" to help the GOP win big in congressional races.\n\nThat cryptic reference has Democrats questioning what the Republican presidential nominee could mean with a little more than a week to go before Election Day. Some Democrats thought Trump's remarks referred to the House's role in settling — or perhaps trying to overturn — contested election results for the White House.\n\n\"It's incumbent upon them to be transparent and to tell the voters exactly what their secret is, and if it is not an effort to overturn the election with Mike Johnson as the Speaker of the House, then tell us what it is,\" said Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who before being elected to Congress served as a federal prosecutor and later a lead counsel during Trump's first impeachment.\n\nBut the Trump campaign said the former president was simply referring to a campaign strategy in which he tunes in to virtual rallies in key House districts that will determine which party controls the chamber for the next two years.\n\n\"President Trump has done countless tele-rallies reaching millions of Americans across the country in key regions that also helps bolster Republicans in congressional races,\" said Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung.\n\n— Riley Beggin and Josh Meyer\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries blasts Trump rally as 'racist'\n\nTop House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement that former President Donald Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden Sunday featured \"racist, dangerous and un-American statements\" from the president's supporters.\n\n\"The unadulterated hatred directed at Puerto Ricans, the Jewish community, women, Latinos, African-Americans, Muslim Americans and decent people of every race by Donald Trump and far right extremists is disqualifying,\" he said. \"These people are unfit to govern and must forever be banished to the dustbin of history in November.\"\n\nComedian Tony Hinchliffe who spoke before Trump on Sunday, referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage,” joked about a Black person in the crowd “carving watermelons” and said Latinos don't use birth control. Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson falsely referred to Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is half-Black and half Indian-American as “Samoan-Malaysian” and a “low IQ former California prosecutor.” Businessman Grant Cardone referred to Harris's nonexistent “pimp handlers.”\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nWhat are the swing states? See polling, past results for key states for 2024 presidential election\n\nJust more than a week away from Nov. 5, all eyes are on seven states that are likely to decide the 2024 presidential election.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been cycling through these battleground states hosting rallies, giving interviews and bringing celebrities along for the ride, as they try to persuade any remaining undecided voters and mobilize their supporters.\n\nNational polls and state polls alike are showing an incredibly close race. That means small margins of voters in these states could have big consequences for the Electoral College. Here is what to know about the battleground states: Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump to Christians: Get out there and vote\n\nDuring a religious summit near Atlanta, Trump talked about the role of faith in his life − particularly in surviving the July 12 assassination attempt − and in the presidential election.\n\n“We have to get all the Christians to get out there and vote,\" Trump told the supportive group.\n\nTrump, who is counting on religious voters in Georgia and other battleground states, said Christians don't always turn out for elections.\n\n\"I shouldn't scold anyone,\" he said, \"but Christians aren't known for being very solid voters, you know.\"\n\nFaith summit organizers ended the event by praying with Trump.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nHarris campaign turns Trump comedian’s Puerto Rico insult into TV ad\n\nThe Harris campaign quickly seized on a highly ridiculed insult about Puerto Rico from a comedian during Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, turning the remark into a 30-second television ad.\n\nThe new ad features a clip of comedian Tony Hinchliffe referring to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage” before Trump is heard saying, “Puerto Rico.”\n\n“I will never forget what Donald Trump did,” Harris says in the ad as she criticizes Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria in 2017 while he was president. “He abandoned the island and offered nothing more than paper towels and insults. Americans deserve better.”\n\nThe Harris campaign has highlighted the insult in its appeal to Puerto Rican voters, who represent a significant share of voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nMariah Carey joins Kerry Washington for GOTV video\n\nThe Queen of Christmas will need to wait just a little longer.\n\nMariah Carey posted a playful video on social media Monday of her singing the intro of the song “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” before Kerry Washington burst into view.\n\n“No, no, no, no, no.

He criticized Harris for calling Trump a fascist and her running mate, Tim Walz, for comparing Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally to a pro-Nazi event.\n\n–Karissa Waddick\n\nMore:Steve Bannon, to be released from prison on Tuesday after 4-month sentence\n\nWho is Tony Hinchcliffe, aka 'Kill Tony, the Trump-supporting comedian?\n\nComedian Tony Hinchcliffe, known as Kill Tony, has been known for years for his offensive material, but he became front page news on Sunday night at a rally for Donald Trump thanks to comment targeting Latinos, Blacks and Jews one week from Election Day.\n\n\"I don't know if you know this, but there's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now,\" Hinchcliffe said in New York City. \"I think it's called Puerto Rico.\"\n\nHe went on to say that Latinos \"love making babies\" and made a vulgar remark about immigrants entering the country.\n\nThe 40-year-old proceeded to point out a Black man out in the crowd, claiming the two had \"carved watermelons together.\"\n\nMore:Donald Trump is in a strong poll position - does it matter?\n\nThe Trump campaign has attempted to distance itself from the comedian. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt took to Fox News where she dismissed Hinchcliffe's comments.\n\n\"It was a comedian who made a joke in poor taste,\" she said Monday morning. \"Obviously that joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or our campaign.\"\n\nHinchcliffe's comments have sparked outrage and criticism from both sides of the aisle and he has long been known for his insult-style comedy, as a recurring figure on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" and garnering millions of subscribers on his own weekly podcast \"Kill Tony.\"\n\n−Sam Woodward\n\nWalz rips Trump over 'garbage can' of the world remark\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz tore into former President Donald Trump at a Monday event in Waukesha, Wisc. for saying the U.S. is the \"garbage can for the world\" in a speech last week.\n\n\"Very difficult to love this country when Donald Trump can only love himself. That's why he has a difficult time doing that,\" the Democratic vice presidential nominee told a small group of invited Kamala Harris supporters at the Co-Pilot Cafe.\n\n\"Their closing argument last night was clear to the rest of the world. It's about hate, it's about division, it's about, dividing us,\" Walz said, referring to the former president's Sunday night rally at Madison Square Garden in New York. The event featured several speakers who made racist comments about Harris, Puerto Ricans, Latinos in general, and Blacks.\n\nWalz said that, while the Harris campaign has a to-do list, \"Donald Trump has an enemies list.

But the high court noted that state law says if “the date of the postmark cannot be determined,” ballots received within three days of Election Day “shall be deemed to have been postmarked on or before the day of the election.”\n\nTossup states such as Nevada have become a legal battleground over rules in the closely contested election. Republicans have focused many of their cases on the rules for voter registration and counting mailed ballots.\n\nBut few votes are at stake in the postmark dispute because only 24 arrived that way during the primary, according to the trial judge.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Election official in Reno, Nevada tells AP she was forced out before 2024 election\n\nTrump to address the press on Tuesday morning\n\nThe Trump campaign has been secretive about this week's non-rally schedule as Election Day nears on Nov. 5.

The result is hundreds of burned ballots, elections officials said.\n\nShasti Conrad, chair of the state Democratic Party, said in a statement to USA TODAY that this represents “an attempt to disenfranchise” voters. State Democrats trut that law enforcement and other officials will \"find those responsible and hold them accountable,\" she added.\n\nThe attack in Washington is the second ballot box fire that police have responded to in the Pacific Northwest region. In nearby Portland, police responded to a fire at a ballot box on Monday morning at an elections office.\n\nConrad and others stressed how people concerned about their ballot was destroyed should check its status at VoteWA.gov or by calling their county's auditor or elections department to find out where their ballot is in the process of being counted.

The contest is intended for entertainment purposes only and is not a scientific poll. “Kids Pick the President” has accurately predicted the outcome of every election but two since 1988.

According to the American Cancer Society, Black men are about 40% more likely to die from colon cancer than other groups and 70% more likely to die from prostate cancer.\n\nBoth candidates have rushed to popular podcasts as a strategy to reach undecided voters in this razor-thin contest.\n\nHarris and her allies have been keen on making direct appeals to Black men as surveys for months have shown Trump making slight gains with segments of that demographic. A recent ABC News/Ipsos survey, however, showed Harris winning 85% of the Black male vote.\n\n— Phillip M.

Lawsuits from both the group and Republican organizations suggest widespread voter fraud could be happening – without providing proof that it is.\n\nThe claims feed into the false narrative from Trump that he didn't lose the 2020 election, which critics fear is a precursor to claiming similar election theft if he loses again. Numerous counts and audits showed President Joe Biden won the last presidential election. Nearly all of more than 60 lawsuits from Trump allies in the wake of that election failed.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nNew polls show slim leads for Republicans in Nebraska and Texas Senate races\n\nNew polls from The New York Times/Siena College, conducted between Oct. 23 and Oct. 26, show tight Senate races in both Nebraska and Texas.\n\nIn Texas, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a Trump-endorsed, two-term incumbent is leading his Democratic opponent Rep. Colin Allred 50% to 46% among 1,180 voters in Texas, according to the poll. Democrats have been eyeing the seat as one they could possibly flip to keep control of the Senate, pouring millions of dollars into the race.\n\nIn Nebraska, Republican Sen. Deb Fischer is leading her independent opponent Dan Osborn 48% to 46% among 1,194 voters in Nebraska. Five percent of likely voters said they were undecided or didn’t answer.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nCourt rejects Mississippi’s 5-day grace period for mailed ballots − but policy for 2024 is uncertain\n\nA federal appeals court revived a Republican lawsuit against Mississippi’s grace period for mailed ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they arrive up to five days after Election Day.\n\nBut the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t block the state law that allowed the grace period. Instead, the appeals court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola for further review.\n\nGuirola had rejected the lawsuit in the July from the state and national Republican Parties that challenged the grace period approved during the COVID pandemic. “The upshot: These statutes ‘mandate holding all elections for Congress and the Presidency on a single day throughout the Union,’” Judge Andrew Oldham wrote for the three-judge appeals panel.\n\nIf the case were appealed to the Supreme Court it could potentially have brought implications because more than a dozen states have grace periods for mailed ballots postmarked by Election Day to arrive up to 10 days afterward.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nCourt refuses to revive Virginia policy to remove suspected noncitizens from voter rolls\n\nA federal appeals court on Sunday rejected a Republican case from Virginia that sought to reinstate a purge of suspected noncitizens from voter rolls.\n\nU.S. District Judge Patricia Giles on Friday had halted the state program that removed about 1,500 names since Aug. 7 because federal law prohibits removing names from voter rolls within 90 days of an election. She also ordered the registration of those who were removed to be restored.\n\nThe state appealed but the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Giles’ ruling.\n\n\"For the second time in three days, a federal court ruled Virginia's purge of eligible citizens is unlawful,” said Ryan Snow, a lawyer with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “We urge the Supreme Court to stop this madness and make it clear that it is unacceptable to block eligible citizens from voting.\"\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nHarris and Trump locked in a dead heat in key battleground state, new poll shows\n\nA new USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that Trump and Harris are almost tied in Wisconsin, 48% to 47%, among 500 likely voters. The results are within the poll’s margin of error of 4.4 percentage points. The poll was conducted Oct. 20 to 23.\n\nIn Door County, Wisconsin, which has been a bellwether for the state, Harris has a slight edge. Harris leads Trump in that area, 50% to 47%, the poll of 300 likely Door County voters found. The results are still within the margin of error of 5.7 percentage points.\n\nWisconsin, which has 10 electoral votes, is among several important swing states that both Trump and Harris are eyeing to help catapult them to the presidency.\n\n− Rebecca Morin and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDoes Puerto Rico vote in the 2024 presidential race?\n\nNo, Puerto Rican residents cannot vote for president.\n\nThey can help choose each party's nominee for president, however.

Puerto Rican voters living in the United States make up the second largest Latino group in the country, including in key battleground states like Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the face of a growing uproar, senior Trump advisor Danielle Alvarez on Sunday night issued a statement addressing Hinchcliffe's bit. “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,” she said.\n\n− Rebecca Morin and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhere do Trump, Harris stand in the polls?\n\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris are neck-and-neck in national polls.

Maggie Hassan from 2013 to 2017. Newmarket restaurant owner Jon Kiper also announced his candidacy in late November.\n\nSununu has been a popular governor, continuing to win races even when New Hampshire has gone blue in presidential and congressional races. His decision in July not to seek re-election for governor opened the door to the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the governorship.\n\nWhoever wins the Democratic primary Sept. 10 will face off in the general election against one of the Republican candidates, former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte or former state Sen. Chuck Morse. But first, Craig and Warmington must both differentiate themselves and convince voters they're the best candidate to go up against the Republican nominee in the general election in November.\n\nWho are the Democratic candidates for NH governor?\n\nWarmington was the first Democrat to officially declare her candidacy for governor, announcing in June 2023. She is currently the only Democrat on the five-member Executive Council. Elected Executive Councilor for District 2 for the first time in 2020, she represents a fifth of the state, including the counties of Grafton, Merrimack, Sullivan and Cheshire.\n\n“We live in, in my opinion, the greatest state in the country, and certainly most beautiful, but we have real challenges that we need to tackle,” Warmington said. “As an executive councilor, I have had a front row seat to seeing everything in the state, every program that's working, every program that's not working.”\n\nCraig announced her candidacy a month later. Craig served from 2018 to 2023 as the first female mayor of Manchester, the state’s largest city with a population of about 115,000.\n\n“I'm running for governor to strengthen our local communities and ensure that everyone in our state has the opportunity to succeed,” said Craig. “I also was on the front line dealing with statewide challenges, and I know that we can be doing better.”\n\nBoth Craig and Warmington said tackling the housing crisis would be their first priority as governor. Strengthening public education and ensuring access to reproductive freedom are other top issues for both.\n\nCraig and Warmington each have a long list of endorsements. Former Gov. John Lynch, former DNC Committee Member Kathy Sullivan, and former US Congressman Chet Atkins are some of the Democratic leaders backing Craig, along with eight labor union endorsements.\n\nWarmington’s endorsements include former U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter and state senators Donavan Fenton and Sue Prentiss.\n\nIn the last campaign finance report from December, Craig led the fundraising race with $1.26 million over Warmington’s $1.05 million. Both candidates trailed Ayotte’s $2.74 million.\n\nThe next campaign finance report by Candidate Committees, Political Committees, and Political Advocacy Organizations is due June 19. This report is not required to be filed by candidates. Candidates will file their next report by Aug. 21.\n\nWhile the candidates have announced their campaigns, they can’t officially file for candidacy until June 5, and they’ll have until June 14 to apply to appear on the primary ballot.\n\nWhere do the candidates stand on the issues?\n\nHousing:\n\nA UNH poll revealed Granite Staters believe housing is the most important problem facing New Hampshire, and both Warmington and Craig said that tackling that crisis would be their top priority as governor.\n\nBoth shared the statistic New Hampshire needs 60,000 more housing units by 2030. Craig pointed to her hands-on experience in Manchester as evidence of her capability to handle the problem statewide.\n\n“In Manchester right now we have over 2000 housing units in development. I allocated over $30 million toward affordable housing program initiatives. And this past December we broke ground on one of the largest affordable housing state developments in this state,” Craig said. “I know what it takes to negotiate with developers to provide incentives that are needed to get these projects done and then also work with local communities to ensure housing that's built or proposed works for them.”\n\nWarmington said the government has not focused enough on this issue.\n\n“It is underlying homelessness in our state. It is what is underneath our workforce shortage. It is contributing to the fact that our young people can't afford to stay here and raise their families,” Warmington said.\n\nEducation:\n\nEducation has become a hot button issue in New Hampshire, where Republican lawmakers have been trying to expand the Education Freedom Account program, which allows families to use the share of state funding that would go to their child’s public school toward private and home school instead.\n\n“Public education is under assault every day in this state with Frank Edelblut as commissioner of education, someone who just simply doesn't believe in public education,” said Warmington, adding that she would “reverse this really damaging voucher program that is just siphoning massive amounts of taxpayer dollars away from our public schools.”\n\nCraig emphasized the need for strengthening New Hampshire’s public schools.\n\n“When you look at our public education, for example, and the downshifting from the state and the impact that has, we need to make sure that we're adequately funding public education, and providing good quality schools,” said Craig. “Creating a foundation for students coming into the public school system for generations to come.”\n\nReproductive freedom:\n\nAs the only Democrat on the Executive Council, Warmington has a record of voting for reproductive freedom in contrast to the four Republicans who have repeatedly voted down funds for reproductive health.\n\n“You probably know me as the leading voice on the Executive Council and the leading voice in the state on reproductive freedom,” said Warmington. “I would repeal this Sununu abortion ban and replace it with protections to access safe and legal abortion in our state.”\n\nCraig, too, has made abortion rights a central part of her campaign. As mayor, she said, she supported the largest Planned Parenthood in the state, which is located in Manchester.\n\n“Kelly Ayotte has voted multiple times for a national abortion ban. We need to make sure we're doing everything we can to protect and codify access to abortion in New Hampshire,” Craig said. “Government does not play a role in this decision that should be between a woman and her doctor and I'll fight to ensure it stays that way.”\n\nThe border:\n\nGov. Sununu recently requested $850,000 to send New Hampshire National Guard troops to Texas to help secure the nation's southern border, and it was approved by a state legislative committee.\n\n“I support the (U.S) Senate's bipartisan immigration and border deal to provide a pathway for those seeking asylum, secure our border and prevent illegal drugs from entering our country,” said Craig when asked about the border in general. “Our federal delegation is working to secure more funding for security and technology at the northern border and I'll work with our federal partners in law enforcement to provide the support that they need to keep our communities safe.\"\n\nHowever, Craig told WMUR she does not support sending the NH National Guard to the southern border with taxpayers' dollars.\n\nAt an Executive Council meeting on Wednesday, Warmington accused Sununu of using his emergency powers to avoid bringing the debate to a public hearing or the Executive Council and voiced her concern the New Hampshire National Guard members will be compelled to follow Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's orders over federal government orders.\n\n\"What's different about this, governor, is that the governor of Texas has actually said that Texas law is the law of the land, and that it trumps federal law,\" Warmington said. \"That is concerning.\"\n\nWarmington said while she thinks it’s important for every country to have a secure border, New Hampshire also needs immigration reform.\n\n“As we travel across the state, and I talked to farmers, they need more H-2A visas. They need help. Our seasonal businesses need help, and our medical facilities, calling out for more immigration in our state,” said Warmington. “My first priority as governor is to keep our state safe and I believe that we should secure our borders. I also believe that we need comprehensive immigration reform.”\n\nShe said she’s tired of Republicans using this issue as a “political football” to block progress.\n\nMarijuana:\n\nNew Hampshire is the only state in New England where recreational use of marijuana is not legal. Sununu vetoed the legalization of marijuana in 2023, saying “now is not the time” and a legalization bill would need to keep the state of New Hampshire in control of the marketing, sales, and distribution.\n\nBoth Democratic candidates support the legalization of the drug.\n\n“The question is now, what is the right way to do it?” said Craig. “I support the small business option.”\n\nWarmington says she has long been in favor of the legalization of cannabis “properly regulated and taxed.”\n\nWhat are the differences between Craig and Warmington?\n\nA challenge for Craig and Warmington in the primary election will be differentiating themselves from the other, said Steve Marchand, a Democratic political activist and former mayor of Portsmouth who ran for but did not win the Democratic nomination for governor in 2016 and 2018.\n\n“In this case, we have two women ... who are stylistically quite similar,” said Marchand. “There is no obvious large difference in a key public policy area between the two of them, they are from two of the three largest cities in the state that are less than 20 miles apart.” It’s a contrast, he said, from his governor primary run in 2018, where he and his opponent, Molly Kelly, had clear differences: gender, backgrounds, age, and part of the state.\n\nIndeed, even this year’s candidates’ answers about their top priority were almost identical: Warmington’s, “I think the housing crisis is something that we really need to tackle,” versus Craig’s, “I think number one is tackling the housing crisis.”\n\nWarmington said she has a statewide perspective of the issues having represented a large swath of the state as executive councilor, rather than just one area of the state. But Craig said that not only has she tackled local issues in the city of Manchester, she also has experience dealing with statewide challenges.\n\nBoth candidates referred to their executive experience as a “difference” between them: Warmington as a member of the Executive Council and already working in the executive branch, Craig as having executive experience from being mayor of Manchester.\n\n“For voters, it's even two that have an 'executive' element explicitly in their title,” said Marchand. “They're very similar and that means that the differences for most voters in the primary is extremely nuanced.”\n\n'It really is about electability' and other challenges the candidates face\n\nAn Emerson College poll in November showed Ayotte with advantages over both candidates; 43% to 40% over Craig, and 44% to 37% over Warmington.\n\n“After four terms of Chris Sununu, Democrats are extremely hungry to figure out how to take back the corner office and to figure out which Democratic candidate gives us the best chance to do that,” Marchand said.\n\nMarchand said the No. 1 factor for most primary voters he speaks to is electability: who has a better chance of defeating the Republican nominee in November.\n\n\"I'm the only candidate who is within a margin of error with Kelly,\" said Craig. She continued that her record of winning in Manchester proves she is the most electable candidate.\n\n“I have been through tough elections. When I was elected mayor of Manchester, I beat a popular four-term incumbent Republican. I was the first Democrat elected mayor of Manchester since 2005,” Craig said. “So I know what it takes to win top elections.” She pointed to her record during her tenure, which she says includes creating jobs, reducing violent crime, and strengthening their public schools.\n\nShe says that Republican Jay Ruais’ win to succeed her as mayor of Manchester shows how tough of a place it is for a Democrat to be elected. But Dante Scala, an associate professor of political science at UNH, said Ruais' win over Craig-backed Kevin Cavanaugh could be seen as a referendum against her.\n\nScala is also unsure if voters will be convinced by Craig’s tenure as mayor.\n\n“I do think people point to the city of Manchester and say, ‘Those are big city problems. We don’t want New Hampshire to be like Manchester,’” said Scala. He said he could see the city’s homeless population and the problem with opioids being used as attacks against Craig. But he said Warmington too has trouble with the topic of opioids: she has faced criticism for her past as a lobbyist for Purdue Pharma, where she defended the company's drug OxyContin before the NH Senate Committee on Executive Departments and Administration in 2002.\n\n“This is an attack launched by Joyce Craig as a distraction to not be talking about opioid problems in Manchester,” Warmington said of the criticism, adding it was 22 years ago when the problem was less well understood. “The real question here is, which one of us is better equipped to tackle the problem? I have spent two decades working on this issue.” She said she helped bring medication assisted treatment to the state and has served on the boards of opioid treatment centers, along with other efforts.\n\nWarmington listed electability specifically as one of the biggest differences between her and Craig.\n\n\"Governor Sununu said it himself when asked on the radio what he thought about the Democratic primary and he said, 'Warmington would be formidable,'\" she said, adding that the two of them would go “head to head, toe to toe” fighting at the council table, but still find ways to work together.\n\nAnother sign she is more electable, she said, is her favorability rating. A UNH poll showed her with a net favorability rating of positive 4% as compared to Craig’s negative 9%.\n\nThat same poll also showed 65% of respondents didn’t know enough about Warmington to have an opinion. Craig was more well known: 37% said the same about her.\n\nName recognition is an important factor and something both Democratic candidates will likely have to build, said Scala, especially in the general election if they're facing Kelly Ayotte, who has significant name ID from her time as a U.S. senator.\n\n“Joyce Craig was the mayor of New Hampshire's largest city, but New Hampshire’s largest city isn't all that big,” said Scala. “Warmington, of course, executive councilor, but they don't tend to be especially well known, even among other partisans.” Building that name recognition, he said, could be the key to differentiating themselves.\n\nWarmington says her name recognition will be built over the summer when the campaign is in full swing with television ads, digital advertising, and mail pieces. Craig said her closeness in the polls with Ayotte is meaningful given the former senator's statewide name recognition.\n\nFundraising may play a crucial role in building name ID, said Marchand, as candidates need the money to purchase TV and other advertising space.\n\nMarchand isn’t sure the favorability or Manchester election arguments are convincing voters of each candidate’s electability.\n\n“I hear them less from the voters than I hear them from the candidates. There's an element of nuance to those arguments,” he said. “That's a level of nuance that most even high information voters are not really parroting.”\n\nIt’s still far out, Scala said, and measures of electability can be fuzzy. Does a voter think a candidate is electable because they like the candidate, or does a voter like a candidate because they think they are electable?\n\nThat answer and more, he thinks, will play out in the months to come.\n\nEditor's note: A look at Republican candidates for New Hampshire governor in 2024 is forthcoming.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/28/election-2024-the-key-races-to-watch-in-all-50-states/75674463007/", "title": "Election 2024: The key races to watch in all 50 states", "text": "USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nElection Day will be about more than just Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nThough the presidential election is commanding the most attention, a host of down-ballot races across the country will determine control of Congress, the direction of state legislatures and major policy battles on issues such as abortion rights and marijuana.\n\nHouse races in states like Arizona, Alaska and California will determine control of the control of the 435-seat House, where Democrats seek to upend the current 220-212 GOP majority.

Milligan. While the state initially refused to redraw the map, defying a federal court order, a new map was eventually drawn. This allowed for another nearly majority Black district in Alabama and set the stage for the competitive primaries as a minority opportunity district. The winner of this race will be the first person to represent the new district. If Figures wins, Alabama will have two Democrats in the House for the first time since 2008 when it had three Democratic representatives.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Terri Sewell, Incumbent, Republican Robin Litaker\n\nWhat's at stake: Sewell is currently the only Democratic member of Congress from Alabama. If unseated, all nine of Alabama’s Congress members could be Republicans, depending on the outcome of the closely watched race in the 2nd Congressional District. It would also be the first time District 7 has ever been represented by a Republican.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Democrat Eric Hafner, Republican Nicholas Begich and independent John Howe.\n\nWhat's at stake: Holding onto Alaska’s sole House seat is key to Democrats regaining control of the House. Peltola narrowly won in 2022, defeating former Gov. Sarah Palin, becoming the first Democrat from the state elected to the House since 1972. The state’s rank choice voting system advances the top four primary candidates and places them in the general election, regardless of party. Hafner, who’s a New Jersey resident, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for making false bomb threats over the phone and threatening judges, police officers and lawyers, pleading guilty to the crimes in 2022. He’s previously ran for office outside of his home state, running in Hawaii in 2016 as a Republican and in Oregon in 2018 as a Democrat.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and require employers to provide earned paid sick leave for employees.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, Alaska will become the 8th state (not including Washington D.C.) to install a $15 or higher minimum wage.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 2\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting system that was adopted in 2020\n\nWhat's at stake: If repealed, the state will resume traditional voting. There are currently four other states, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, and Oregon, with rank choice related measures their ballots this election.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Republican Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona\n\nWhat's at stake: It’s one of the marquee races across the country that could help determine which party will control the chamber. Lake appears to have gained ground on Gallego, but he has held an advantage in the polls since the outset of the race. The seat is now held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nThe race: Proposition 139 – Arizona Abortion Access Act\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A measure to protect abortion rights\n\nWhat's at stake: This measure would create a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution. If passed by voters, the state will not be able to interfere before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible. Polling shows strong support for the measure.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican David Schweikert, Democrat Amish Shah\n\nWhat's at stake: David Schweikert, a seven-term member of Congress, is locked in a tight race with emergency room physician Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker, in Arizona’s most affluent congressional district. Schweikert is a free-market Republican; Shah is a “practical” Democrat who won a crowded six-way primary. The race is rated a toss-up.\n\nThe race: 6thCongressional District\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Republican Juan Ciscomani, Democrat Kirsten Engel\n\nWhat's at stake: In a rematch from 2022, Ciscomani faces Engel, an environmental lawyer and former state lawmaker whom he defeated by less than 2% of the vote. He is a free-market Republican and served as an aide to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The race is rated a toss-up. Arizona’s congressional delegation is now 6-3 Republican, so flipping both seats could flip the delegation to the Democrats.\n\n— Arizona Republic, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nWho is running: Arkansas Supreme Court Justices Karen R. Baker and Rhonda Wood are competing for the position of chief justice in a runoff election.\n\nWhat's at stake: While the outcome of this race won’t likely affect the ideological breakdown on the seven-member court, it could serve as a symbolic referendum on the two justices who have diametrically opposed views on a number of issues, notably around direct democracy. Both justices recently took strong stances on Secretary of State John Thurston’s disqualification of a ballot measure that if approved would have guaranteed a limited right to abortion in the state Constitution. Wood wrote the majority opinion in the controversial decision to uphold Thurston’s rejection of the measure, while Baker wrote a scathing dissent.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 62\n\nWho is running: In House District 62, Dexter Miller, a tech worker at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is challenging Republican Mark McElroy, a moderate Republican who’s served on and off in the legislature since 2012, also having run as a Democrat and an independent.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Miller ran against McElroy in 2022, losing by less than 200 votes. If 2024’s rematch is nearly as close this time around, the race could be an opportunity for the Democrats to pick up a district in eastern Arkansas, contiguous with the blue counties around West Memphis. Arkansas Democrats are mounting a big push to challenge Republican incumbents in the state legislature and in Congress, many of whom have run unopposed for years.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 56\n\nWho is running: Conway eye doctor Steve Magie, an incumbent Democrat, is defending his state House seat against conservative Republican Kim Slaughter, the owner and operator of a miniature golf course.\n\nWhat’s at stake: If the results of the 2022 elections are any indication, Magie might be one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the Arkansas General Assembly. He won by only 10 votes while running for his seventh term representing District 56, outside of Little Rock, in the last election. Republicans in the Arkansas House command an 82-seat supermajority in the 100-person chamber. Picking up a handful of seats could allow the state’s Democrats to gain some leverage, since spending bills require a three-quarters vote. But this will be challenging without holding onto seats like Magie’s.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 24\n\nWho is running: Moderate Democrat Ryan Intchauspe, an employee for a training contractor that works with the Dept. of Transportation, is running against conservative Republican Brad Hall, a rancher.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This matchup is part of a trend of Arkansas Democrats running for seats which have been solidly Republican for years and where a blue win might be a long shot. Outgoing incumbent Republican Charlene Fite ran unopposed in 2022. In 2020, before redistricting, she won in the equivalent district by close to 40 percentage points in a three-way race, and in 2018 by almost 45%. Intchauspe, a relatively conservative Democrat with some talking points that could appeal to Libertarian-leaning voters, as well as a military service record, might be a good indicator of whether districts like this are necessarily as safe for Republicans as they appear.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent and freshman Rep. John Duarte is hoping to keep hold of his seat in this rural swing district, facing his 2022 challenger, Democrat Adam Gray, a second time.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The rematch is one of five highly competitive House races in California, all of which forecasters say will help decide which party is in the majority next year. They’re also all held by Republicans, despite the state’s overwhelming Democratic majority, making them rare purple races in a state not known for dramatic election face-offs. The 13th district is among the tightest of those five, and with Gray and Duarte facing off again, it’s expected results will be razor-thin. Just two years ago, Duarte won by fewer than 600 votes, the second-slimmest margin in the nation.\n\nThe race: 27th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia is defending his seat from Democrat George Whitesides, a deep-pocketed political newcomer and who once headed space-tourism company Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In this Northern Los Angeles County district, Garcia picked up the seat in 2020 in a special election and has held on to through the general election and 2022 midterm. But all those prior victories were against Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman. With a new Democrat in the mix in Whitesides, the race could see an upset. It’s one of the five most competitive races in California this year, all of which have Republican incumbents representing areas that went to Biden in 2020. Garcia’s record could present challenges in deep-blue California. A staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, he is one of a few California Republicans who voted against certifying election results Jan. 6, 2021, and signed a 2021 amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nThe race: 41st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Rep. Ken Calvert, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades, is up against Democratic upstart Will Rollins. It’s a rematch, as former federal prosecutor Rollins attempts to grab the seat again after his 2022 defeat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whereas most of California's toss-up House races feature relative newcomers who assumed office within the last few years, Calvert is one of the state’s longest-serving representatives. Calvert won against Rollins in 2022 by less than 5 percentage points, and the Democratic challenger boasts a much larger war chest this time around. The race has attracted much attention and cash, making it the most expensive House race in the state as of early October. Polling roughly a month out from Nov. 5 has the pair at a dead heat. While Calvert has defended his seat many times over, this second match-up against Rollins is increasingly competitive, especially as 2021 redistricting looped in more liberal areas like Palm Springs.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, Democrat Trisha Calvarese and three third-party candidates: Paul Noel Fiorino, Unity; Frank Atwood, Approval Voting; and Hannah Goodman, Libertarian\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has been a U.S. House member since 2021, but in a different district: the 3rd Congressional District that covers western Colorado. She decided to run in the 4th Congressional District last year after longtime Republican Rep. Ken Buck announced he wouldn’t be seeking a sixth term, saying many within his Republican Party have strayed from its ideals and are no longer addressing solutions. If Boebert is not elected, it will shift the representation of a portion of Colorado that has long been represented by a Republican and will represent a significant shift in the political makeup of Colorado's representation.\n\nThe race: Proposition 127\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure regarding the hunting of mountain lions, bobcats and lynx\n\nWhat's at stake: Citizen-initiated Proposition 127 seeks to make it illegal to hunt bobcats, lynx and mountain lions in Colorado, though it’s important to note that it’s already illegal to hunt lynx under state and federal law. With appropriate licenses, the hunting of mountain lions has been allowed in Colorado since 1965. Hunting of bobcats in the state has been allowed even longer. Trophy hunting mountain lions is illegal in the state. By law, mountain lion meat must be prepared for human consumption. Bobcats are considered furbearers, so you do not have to eat their meat under state hunting laws. This initiative would allow bobcats, lynx and mountain lions to be killed if they are deemed a threat to human life, livestock or property.\n\nThe race: Poudre School District R-1 Ballot Issue 4A\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A local measure on levy for schools\n\nWhy it matters: This local ballot issue represents a critical crossroads school districts face as they grapple with school funding woes and aging facilities: Do they cut services, ask for help or do both? And if they do ask for help, will they get it? Poudre School District is asking voters to approve a debt-free mill levy to support a wide range of wants and needs, including repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to school facilities.\n\n— Kelly Lyell, Miles Blumhardt, Rebecca Powell and Sarah Kyle, The Coloradoan\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent Rep. Jahana Hayes is seeking a fourth term against Republican challenger George Logan in a highly anticipated rematch. Logan, a former state senator, narrowly lost to Hayes in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 5th District is a key swing seat and the outcome could help decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both candidates are focused on economic issues, but their approaches differ. Hayes backs more federal funding for affordable housing and wage increases, while Logan advocates for reducing government spending. Other major topics include immigration reform and abortion rights, with Hayes supporting federal protections for abortion access and Logan opposing them.\n\nThe race: No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Connecticut voters will decide on the No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment. A \"yes\" vote would allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. A \"no\" vote keeps the current rules, which require voters to give an excuse, like being out of town or having a disability.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, this amendment would make voting more accessible by expanding the use of mail-in ballots. Supporters say it’s the next step in ensuring all voters have the flexibility to cast their ballot. Opponents worry about the potential for misuse and prefer keeping in-person voting as the primary method. With many states already allowing no-excuse absentee voting, this decision could reshape how elections are conducted in Connecticut.\n\nThe race: Key state legislative races\n\nWho is running: Connecticut's state legislature expects to see several highly competitive races. In the 8th Senate District, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Seminara faces Democrat Paul Honig, who seeks to flip the seat held by Republicans since 1967. The 28th Senate District features Republican Sen. Tony Hwang challenged by newcomer Rob Blanchard, a Democrat, testing the suburbs' political leanings. In the 36th Senate District, Republican Sen. Ryan Fazio contends with Democrat Nick Simmons, a former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ned Lamont. The 22nd House District showcases Republican Rep. Francis Cooley battling Democrat Rebecca Martinez, who aims to reclaim her seat after a narrow loss. The 65th House District sees Democrat Rep. Michelle Cook go against Republican Joe Canino. In the 81st House District, Democrat Rep. Chris Poulos is up against Republican James Morelli. Lastly, in the 138th House District, Republican Rep. Rachel Chaleski battles Democrat Ken Gucker, who seeks to reclaim his former seat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These races could reshape Connecticut's political landscape as demographics shift and voter turnout spikes during the presidential election. With several traditionally GOP districts in play, the outcomes will determine whether Connecticut leans further left or sees a Republican resurgence.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Current U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester faces Republican Eric Hansen and independent Dr. Mike Katz. Hansen is a Wilmington resident and businessman, while Katz is an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Both of Delaware’s seats in the U.S. Senate have been held by Democrats since 2001, so a win by Hansen or Katz, while unlikely, would be a major upset. Katz specifically would be the state’s first independent U.S. Senator. If Blunt Rochester is elected, she would be the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride faces Republican political newcomer John Whalen III, a retired state police officer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Delaware’s sole House seat is up for grabs without an incumbent in the race for the first time since Lisa Blunt Rochester, now running for Senate, was elected in 2016. A Republican hasn’t held the seat since 2011, and the odds appear to be against Whalen. If McBride wins the race, she will be the first transgender person elected to federal office, as well as the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer won the Democratic nomination after a tight primary race with the current lieutenant governor. He faces Delaware House Minority Leader Mike Ramone.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats have held the governor’s office in Delaware since 1993, with current Gov. John Carney – now running uncontested for mayor of Wilmington – winning his last election with nearly 60% of votes. Ramone, who has held a seat in the statehouse since 2008, is running on a platform of bipartisan leadership to challenge the state’s “single-party rule.”\n\n— The News Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second six-year term against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who served just one term in Congress before being defeated by U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Miami.\n\nWhat's at stake: At stake is a seat that could decide which party controls the upper chamber, with the power to approve or block appointments to the judicial branch in the next administration. Each has harshly criticized the other on perceived vulnerabilities heading to the Nov. 5 election. Scott slammed Mucarsel-Powell as an “open-border socialist” while Mucarsel-Powell called Scott an “extremist” who would put social safety net programs at risk and push for a federal abortion ban.\n\nThe race: Amendment 3\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Recreational marijuana\n\nWhat's at stake: In Florida, voters statewide will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. As with all proposed constitutional amendments in the state, the measure requires no less than a 60% majority to pass. It would allow people to purchase, possess and use marijuana, but would not allow home growing. Its passage could align Florida with the 24 other states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, potentially affecting the state's economy and criminal justice system. Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top conservatives in the state oppose the measure, with the governor saying it could lead to prolific pot smells, among other criticisms.\n\nThe race: Amendment 4\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Abortion access\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot initiative aims to guarantee abortion access in Florida. It’s generated the most attention, especially since the Florida Supreme Court gave its OK to a six-week abortion ban in the state. Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, have come out in force against the amendment. If approved, abortion access would be assured up to fetal viability, or how soon a fetus can survive outside of its mother's womb, generally considered 24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Opponents say that’s too vague and will lead to an unregulated abortion industry, but proponents dismiss those claims as “scare tactics.”\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 42\n\nWho is running: Gabriel Sanchez, a 27-year-old Democratic Socialist, and Republican Diane Jackson are both vying for their first term in the Georgia legislature.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Sanchez is the first Democratic Socialist to win a state primary in Georgia, according to the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the May primary, he defeated incumbent Rep. Teri Anulewicz, who has served in the House since 2017. District 42 has not been represented by a Republican since 2012 and overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, meaning Sanchez will likely be the first Democratic Socialist state lawmaker in Georgia’s history.\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 53\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Deborah Silcox, a Republican, is vying for her second term representing District 53 against Democrat Susie Greenberg.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is one of the most competitive in the state, and one of the most expensive legislative battles. Silcox flipped the district Republican in the last election, winning by fewer than 1,500 votes. Greenberg has raised nearly $432,000, according to her most recent campaign filing, more than four times Silcox’s $103,000 from this year’s campaign. Silcox previously represented House District 52 but lost to Rep. Shea Roberts, a Democrat, in 2020. Silcox notably refused to concede for over six months following the election, after a lawsuit was filed by a Sandy Springs resident alleging that voter fraud had occurred in the district. The case was eventually dismissed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe race: Georgia Senate District 48\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican, is defending his seat from Democratic challenger Ashwin Ramaswami\n\nWhat’s at stake: Still was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia as part of former President Trump’s fake elector scheme, having served as a secretary who signed and filed false documents in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. His opponent, Ramaswami, has been campaigning on his experience in election cybersecurity and other progressive issues, and has raised more than five times as much as Still, according to recent campaign filings. If elected, Ramaswami would be the first Indian American and first Gen Z lawmaker in the Georgia Senate.\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Hawaii Island mayor\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Mayor Mitch Roth is seeking a second term against challenger Kimo Alameda. Roth, a former Hawaii County prosecutor, has over 40 years of public service experience, while Alameda, a psychologist and former VP at Hawai‘i Island Community Health Center, has deep ties to the island and has been compared to the late Mayor Billy Kenoi.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Key issues include affordable housing, homelessness, permit backlogs, and infrastructure upgrades. The race is closely watched due to the split endorsements from labor unions, with Roth supported by private-sector unions and Alameda backed by public-sector unions. In the August primary, Roth led with 38% of the vote, but Alameda’s 28% and the 34% secured by four other candidates make this a competitive race, as those voters could swing the outcome in November.\n\nThe race: Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees\n\nWho is running: Six candidates are running for three seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) Board. For the at-large trustee seat, incumbent Keli‘i Akina is being challenged by Lei Ahu Isa. In the Kauai-Niihau seat race, incumbent Dan Ahuna faces Laura Lindsey. For the Molokai-Lanai seat, incumbent Luana Alapa is running against Kunani Nihipali. Additionally, Kaiali‘i Kai” Kahele has already secured the at-large trustee seat for Hawaii County in the primary election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The OHA Board directs significant resources to Native Hawaiian communities through scholarships, loans, and grants. These trustees play a vital role in shaping programs that promote education, business development, and community support for Native Hawaiians across the state.\n\nMore: Hawaii House speaker loses reelection bid, deceased lawmaker wins seat: 5 takeaways from Saturday's primaries\n\nThe race: Hawaii legislative races\n\nWhat’s at stake: Hawaii's Legislature is set for a major shakeup, with at least 11 new members joining the upcoming session. With all 51 House seats and 13 of 25 Senate seats up for election, a wave of retirements, primary defeats, and shifting political dynamics are driving significant turnover.\n\nKey races: One of the most notable upsets occurred in House District 25, where progressive Kim Coco Iwamoto ousted House Speaker Scott Saiki, leaving a leadership vacancy that will be addressed after the election. In other key House races, Ikaika Hussey unseated longtime Rep. May Mizuno in District 29, while Shirley Ann Templo defeated Rep. Sonny Ganaden in District 30, signaling growing ideological diversity within Hawaii’s Democratic Party. The race in District 50, where Mike Lee will face Republican Timothy Connelly, could also see a competitive challenge from the GOP. In the Senate, Democrat Cedric Gates is battling Republican Samantha Decorte in Senate District 22, a district that has been trending more conservative, offering the GOP a rare opportunity in a predominantly Democratic state.\n\nWhat's at stake: These contests reflect broader trends of political shifts in Hawaii, with an incoming class that could tilt the legislature in new directions on housing, education, and economic policy. Whether the state moves further left or sees a surge in conservative momentum will depend on the outcomes of these races, marking a pivotal moment for the future of Hawaii’s politics.\n\nThe race: Constitutional amendments\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Voters in Hawaii will consider two significant state constitutional amendments. The first proposal aims to remove the legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, contingent upon a reversal of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The second proposal seeks to streamline the judicial appointment process by aligning the selection of district court judges with that of Supreme Court justices and higher court judges, enhancing consistency and efficiency in the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These amendments mark a notable shift from Hawaii's recent trend of maintaining legislative control over such matters. They represent the first constitutional amendments on the ballot since 2018, following a long period of inaction where the legislature rejected hundreds of proposals, including 68 in the current biennium. Given Hawaii's stringent requirements for passing amendments — requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers or consecutive majority votes — the outcome could have lasting implications for the state’s legal framework and judicial system.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore: Hawaii voters to decide on marriage law authority and judicial appointment process\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Idaho voters will weigh in on an initiative to institute a top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting. Under a top-four primary system, all the primary candidates appear together on the same primary ballot, regardless of their party, and the top four vote-getters from that pool move on to the general election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Idaho’s Republican, Libertarian and Constitution Party primaries are currently closed, meaning that only registered members can vote in them. The Democratic Primary is open, meaning anyone can vote regardless of their affiliation. According to Boise State Public Radio, almost a third of all registered voters in Idaho today are unregistered, which means they can’t vote in most primaries.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 15\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Rick Just, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Republican former state Rep. Codi Galloway in a rematch of a race from 2022. District 15 is a swing district in the western part of Boise.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Spending on this race has been the highest among any state legislature race this year, Idaho Education News reported. Close to a quarter million in spending between the two candidates works out to almost $6 per resident in the district. Just won the seat in 2022 by less than 2 percentage points, a little more than 300 votes which, if that’s any indication of how this race will go, makes him perhaps one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the legislature this cycle.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 6\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Foreman is fending off a challenge from Democrat Julia Parker. In 2022, Foreman ousted incumbent Democrat David Nelson in a tight race decided by little over 400 votes.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This might be one of the best opportunities in Idaho for Democrats to flip a seat in the state Senate, which is dominated by Republican lawmakers by a four-to-one margin. Foreman had run against Nelson twice, in 2018 and 2020, before finally winning in 2022, showing how competitive the district is.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Eric Sorenson faces off with challenger Joe McGraw, a retired Rockford judge running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race, which covers majority of northern/northwestern and parts of central Illinois has been hotly contested the last few races, with the Democrats winning in tight races. The race is seen as a potential seat where Republicans can make a gain. Of the 17 seats in the congressional delegation, 14 are held by Democrats.\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Nikki Budzinski faces off with Joshua Loyd, a political outsider running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is another one which was seen as a potential seat that could flip from blue to red in the Springfield area. In August, Democrats across the state poured “seven figure investments” into two races, this being one of them. Loyd is a West Point graduate and fervent backer of the Second Amendment.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: This is an open seat, since outgoing Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb is term-limited. Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun is giving up his Senate seat to run against Democrat Jennifer McCormick, a former state Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Libertarian Donald Rainwater, who previously garnered 11% of the vote in the 2020 gubernatorial race, a record for Indiana Libertarians.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Braun's to lose, in a solidly red state where Democrats haven't won a statewide office since 2012 or the governor's office since 2000. But since recent polling has shown Braun underperforming compared to other Republicans in Indiana, the race has suddenly seemed more competitive in the eyes of national observers and each party's governor associations, which have chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to each candidate in the last few weeks. A Democratic win is still unlikely, but there are signs that a solid performance by McCormick could mark the beginning of a pendulum shift for the balance of power in Indiana in elections to come.\n\nThe race: Indiana Attorney General\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita is seeking a second four-year term against Democratic challenger Destiny Wells, an Indiana Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who has quickly risen to prominence in the state Democratic Party. Rokita has been a mainstay in Indiana Republican politics for the last two decades, serving in both the U.S. House and as Indiana Secretary of State. Wells has not held elected office but ran for Indiana Secretary of State back in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: There’s been a lot of attention on the race in the context of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban. Rokita is an ardent anti-abortion candidate who faced a national firestorm over his comments on Fox News about an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, who gave an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim back in 2022. Wells has campaigned with Bernard and has pitched the race as a way for Hoosiers to weigh in on abortion rights since the state lacks a ballot referendum process.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan is seeking a third term in the U.S. House. He is being challenged by Republican Lake County Council member Randy Niemeyer, who has been endorsed by high-profile national Republicans and tapped as a “Young Gun” race to watch by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Libertarian Dakotah Miskus, a 25-year-old from LaPorte County, is also running in this election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The district is one of only two Democratic congressional districts in all of Indiana and the 2024 race is the second election cycle that Republicans have eyed the seat as a potential flip to grow their party’s majority in the House. In the 2022 midterms, Mrvan won reelection by 6 points over his Republican challenger in a race closely watched by national political analysts. Democrats have held the 1st District for nearly 100 years, but the area is made up of working-class Rust Belt communities where former President Donald Trump typically performs well.\n\n— The Indianapolis Star, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks is in a rematch with Democrat Christina Bohannan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 1st Congressional District could be the sleeper swing district in a state that has turned decidedly red in recent elections. Active voter registrations favor Republicans, and Miller-Meeks defeated Bohannan in 2022 by about 7 percentage points. But in this rematch, national Democrats have funneled money into the race to capitalize on what they see as Miller-Meeks’ weakness with independents and even some Republicans. The limited publicly available polling of the race suggests Bohannan might have the edge.\n\nThe race: 3rd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Zach Nunn is being challenged by Democrat Lanon Baccam, both of whom are veterans.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 3rd District was anticipated to be its most contested after Nunn squeaked into office with a victory of less than 1 percentage point in 2022. In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional posts, it’s perhaps Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat. It’s got a narrower Republican voter registration advantage than other districts in the state, and it’s home to some of Iowa’s largest urban metro areas, which tend to favor Democrats. But Nunn has avoided major missteps, and Republicans remain confident in their chances.\n\n— The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: House District 52\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jesse Borjon, R-Topeka, faces challenger Jacquie Whitney Lightcap, D-Topeka.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the legislature. National Democrats early on identified Borjon’s seat as a key pickup opportunity, but Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s PAC did not endorse in the race.\n\nThe race: House District 102\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, faces challenger Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Republicans believe they can grow their supermajorities and identified Probst’s seat as a key pickup opportunity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 10\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, faces challenger Andrew Mall, D-Shawnee.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, is widely viewed as the most important electoral battleground, and this race could be a barometer for others in the Kansas City suburbs. Thompson is an affable former television weatherman, but has established himself as one of the most conservative lawmakers with high-profile questioning of climate science and election integrity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 11\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, faces challenger Karen Thurlow, D-Stilwell.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is another high-profile race in Johnson County. Warren was a significant figure behind Value Them Both, an anti-abortion constitutional amendment that voters decisively rejected in 2022. The race could show whether reproductive rights continue to be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 2\n\nWho is running: Kentucky voters will weigh in on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would let state lawmakers direct spending toward non-public education, including through charter school and voucher programs.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While proponents of the change say this would allow Kentucky students to have wider access to a variety of schools that may better suit their educational needs, critics allege that the amendment would leave a devastating financial impact on the state's public school system.\n\n— The Courier-Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t face a serious challenge in what is considered a safe GOP seat, but his race and reaction after will be closely watched because of his close ties to former President Trump.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson’ previous defense of Trump both during his impeachment and following the 2020 election that Trump lost has raised questions as to whether the leader of the House will certify the 2024 presidential election if Trump loses again.\n\nThe race: 6th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress in the 1990s, and former Republican state Sen. Elbert Guillory are familiar faces on the ballot, but they are joined by newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson, a Democrat and executive chairman of a social justice nonprofit, who is also running a district-wide campaign.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana’s new 6th District boundaries created a court-ordered second majority-Black district that favors Democrats and caused incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves to bow out of race. A victory here by Democrats would cut into the Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\nThe race: Amendment No. 1 to the Louisiana Constitution\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The proposed amendment would expand the dedication to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund to add federal money the state receives from offshore wind, solar and other alternative or renewable energy sources generated in federal Gulf waters off the state’s coast.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930s, about the size of Delaware. The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund provides money for projects to restore and preserve the Louisiana coast.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is being challenged by Republican Austin Theriault\n\nWhat’s at stake: Golden is running for his third term in Congress, but as a Democrat in a Trump-won district, he is particularly vulnerable to a Republican challenge. Not only are the party demographics stacked against him, but he also recently changed his position on assault weapons after Maine’s deadliest ever shooting in Lewiston last October. A district with a high proportion of gun owners, this may come back to hurt him in the election. While Golden is a blue dog, conservative Democrat, Theriault, a Republican state representative and former NASCAR driver, has tried to tie him to national Democrats as well as criticized him on the gun issue. The race will be an important one for determining which party will take control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe race: Maine state legislature\n\nWho is running: Every representative and senator in the Maine state legislature\n\nWhat’s at stake: Maine currently has a Democratic trifecta in state politics, with Democrats controlling the governorship, the state House, and the state Senate. The governor has two more years left of her term, but every seat in the legislature is up for reelection. Maine also has term limits on its legislators — they are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms — making the races more volatile and open than other states. While Democrats are the favorites to retain control, these factors along a national election with Trump on the ballot is causing Republicans to feel hopeful of capturing one of those chambers this year, more likely the House.\n\nThe race: Flag question\n\nWho is running: Measure to change Maine’s state flag\n\nWhat’s at stake: This measure would replace the current official Maine state flag, which is blue with the state’s coat of arms, with the former state flag, which features a green pine tree and the North Star on a light tan background. The former state flag, commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, was originally adopted in 1901 before being replaced by the current flag in 1909. It’s become a slightly controversial ballot measure, with some conservatives see changing the flag as a sign of “wokeness,” as the current flag features two white men next to the coat of arms. However, the Pine Tree Flag is already an iconic image, appearing on souvenirs, clothing and many flag poles.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Ben Cardin, who is not seeking reelection after serving three terms.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The eyes of the nation are on Maryland as the Senate race may help might decide the balance of power in the chamber. Though Larry Hogan has said he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, the shadow of presidential race holds major sway over this contest. Alsobrooks leads by double digits in many polls, but this one should still come down to the wire.\n\nThe race: Legislatively referred abortion amendment\n\nWhat's on the ballot: In 2023, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to refer an amendment to the state’s Constitution on abortion to voters. The state’s voters approved a related measure in 1992 with a majority voting to make the procedure legal. If the measure is passed, any future changes would require a future General Assembly to put the issue again before voters. If the measure fails, the procedure would still be allowed under current state law.\n\nWhat's at stake: Though this ballot measure in bright blue Maryland is almost certain to pass, by how wide a margin could have a big impact on Maryland's U.S. Senate race. Ads supporting Democrat Angela Alsobrooks have continuously singled out Republican Larry Hogan's personal opposition to abortion, though Hogan's campaign has stressed that he has publicly opposed to a federal abortion ban and as far back as when he first ran for governor, Hogan promised not to change Maryland’s laws protecting abortion access.\n\n— Keith Demko, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is being challenged by Republican John Deaton\n\nWhat's at stake: Warren has gained a national profile in her two terms as senator, compiling one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. She's been willing to break with party leadership on key issues such as immigration — voting earlier this year against a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and criticizing President Joe Biden's executive order on tightening the border. Deaton moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island only months before the primaries. The cryptocurrency lawyer has highlighted his rough childhood in the Detroit area while presenting a moderate stance on issues such as abortion — at times infuriating conservative Republicans in the process.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 2, Eliminating the MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nWhat's on the ballot: For more than 20 years, students have been required to pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests in math, science and technology, and English in order to graduate from a public high school in Massachusetts. If it is passed, Ballot Question 2 would eliminate the requirement.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The question has divided some of the most prominent Democrats in the state. Supporters include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Ayanna Pressley, James McGovern, Lori Trahan and William Keating. Opponents include Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kimberly Driscoll and Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. Supporters of the ballot question, including the state's teachers unions, say the test is a one-size-fits-all exam that does not properly evaluate student performance and achievement. Opponents, who include business-aligned groups as well as the state superintendents association, say removing the requirement would lead to a lowering of standards across the board.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 5, Minimum Wage for Tipped Workers\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Current law allows employers of service workers such as servers, bartenders and nail technicians to pay them as little as $6.25 an hour, as long as tips raise the workers’ pay to at least the regular minimum wage of $15. If they do not, employers must make up the difference. Question 5 would gradually eliminate the difference between tipped workers' minimum wage and the standard minimum wage.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the question passes, by Jan. 1, 2029, the statewide minimum wage would apply to all workers. The measure would also allow employers to pool tips to distribute to all their workers, as long as everyone on the payroll is paid the state minimum wage. Supporters of the ballot question say that tips should be a reward for good service, and not a subsidy for employers who pay less than minimum wage. The ballot question has been fiercely opposed by the restaurant industry, which warns passage will lead to higher menu prices for consumers, and will force restaurants to cut staff or even close.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served as a CIA officer in Iraq and as a Pentagon official, faces Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who served seven two-year terms before leaving in 2015 and rose the rank of House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is one of a handful of open seats in the U.S. Senate, the result of Democratic U.S. Debbie Stabenow’s decision last year not to run for a fifth six-year term, so it could play into which party ends up with majority control of the chamber. Democrats (and the independents they caucus with) currently have a one-seat majority. No Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since Spencer Abraham in the Republican wave of 1994. But with Michigan clearly in play as a presidential battleground, Republicans are hoping Rogers can ride what they are hoping is former President Donald Trump’s strength in a state he won in 2016 to a victory.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican former state Sen. Tom Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, faces former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., a member of a well-known Michigan political family who was a key aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Two years ago, Barrett lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in one of the most expensive House races in the nation in a redrawn district centered in and around Lansing, the state capitol. Slotkin is running for U.S. Senate this year and Barrett is back figuring that Hertel may be an easier opponent than his former rival who was known for raising scads of money and doing well in tossup districts like this one. Hertel, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on Barrett’s previous stance as an all-out abortion opponent, even though he says he will vote for anything that crosses protections put into the state constitution in 2022. With control of the U.S. House possibly in play, millions in outside spending have already poured into this race again.\n\nThe race: 8th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet faces Paul Junge, a former assistant prosecutor, TV anchor and official with the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Like the race in the 7th District, this is one which, if U.S. House races are close nationally, could determine which party holds majority control of the chamber. Right now, Republicans hold an eight-seat majority in the U.S. House. Even though this district, anchored by Flint, Bay City and Saginaw in mid-Michigan, has been trending more Republican in recent years, it was considered a likely Democratic hold until U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee last year announced he would leave at the end of this term, his sixth. KIldee’s late uncle, Rep. Dale Kildee, sat in the seat before him for 18 two-year terms.\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. John James, in his first term in Congress, faces a rematch with Carl Marlinga, a Democratic former Macomb County judge and prosecutor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This district, which includes much of southern Macomb County and parts of neighboring Oakland County, was widely seen as trending Republican when it was redrawn ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Democratic groups largely stayed away, figuring James, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who had run two strong but ultimately unsuccessful U.S. Senate races, would easily win. It was anything but easy in the end: Marlinga, who has been in and around Macomb County politics for decades and presents himself as a pragmatist and a moderate Democrat, came within about one-half of 1% of beating James, despite being outspent by a 6-to-1 margin. James is running on his record, saying he has worked to bring projects back to the district; Marlinga, now with some Democratic support behind him, is trying to portray James’ conservativism as out of step with the district.\n\n— Detroit Free Press, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Minnesota House of Representatives District 14B\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, is looking to keep his seat in the Minnesota legislature, which he first won in 2018. He is being challenged by Republican Sue Ek, who previously ran for office in 2005.\n\nWhy it matters: The Minnesota statehouse is completely controlled by the DFL, which is Minnesota's Democratic party. Republicans are looking to flip the House to end the DFL trifecta, and St. Cloud is historically a political battleground, with some candidates in District 14A winning by fewer than 200 votes. Wolgamott came under fire last fall after he got a DWI. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent is labeled as extreme with her vocal opposition against same-sex marriage, contraceptives and abortion access. LGBTQ+ issues remain a hot topic in the state. The DFL trifecta passed a law banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth last legislative session. In addition, the state passed gender-affirming care legislation for minors.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection. She is challenged by Republican Royce White, Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey and Libertarian Rebecca Whiting.\n\nWhat's at stake: Minnesota's U.S. Senate race is sparking a conversation about morals. White, a former NBA player, has been criticized for allegedly using past campaign funds at strip clubs. At a St. Cloud appearance, he told voters he is transphobic, alleged the \"woke left\" are trying to villainize Christians and said he's further right than former President Donald Trump. This in part caused former Republican, current Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey to run, saying conservatives needed another option. Despite the conversations, incumbent Klobuchar is polling significantly behind her 24-point margin of victory in 2018. Current 2024 polls show the Democratic senator having an 8- to 11-point lead.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic candidate Ty Pinkins, a Delta native, is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Pontotoc native who has been in office since 2008. If Pinkins' wins, he would be the first Democrat to occupy the office since John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989. While Pinkins' name became more common due to the 2023 Mississippi Secretary of State race in which Pinkins lost, he is polling at a mere 1% against Wicker.\n\nWhat's at stake: Pinkins' challenge to Wicker, if successful, would contribute to the Democratic defense of their majority in the U.S. Senate. A Pinkins victory would also take Mississippi's congressional ratio from five Republicans and one Democrat to four Republicans and two Democrats. While a Democratic win in this race is a long shot, how far Pinkins closes the 99-point gap with Wicker by Nov. 5 will be used as a starting line for future Democrats running for Mississippi's congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is running against Republican challenger Ron Eller, who has never won a political race. Thompson, who is favored to win, has been in office in Washington, D.C., since 1993 and has become something of an institution among national and state Democrats. Notably, Thompson has served as the chair of the Jan. 6 Investigative Committee, trying to unfold the chain of events surrounding a Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat's at stake: Thompson is the only Democrat from Mississippi in the U.S. Congress right now and has been so since 2011. If he were to lose to Eller, the state's largest Black and Democratic district would go red and Mississippi would not be represented by any Democrat in Washington, D.C., if Republican U.S. Reps. Trent Kelly and Mike Ezell, and Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker don't lose to their respective races.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court Central District, Place 1\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Jim Kitchens faces a challenge from four opponents for one of the state's supreme court judge seats. Kitchens was appointed to his seat in 2009, and it is uncommon for a judge to win a seat as a challenger to incumbents in Mississippi, according to state election records.\n\nWhat's at stake: Of Kitchen's opponents, one, state Sen. Jenifer Branning, R-Philadelphia, has been endorsed by the Mississippi Republican Party. The race, as well as the Mississippi Supreme Court, is supposed to be nonpartisan. With an endorsement from the state GOP, a Branning victory could mean a more conservative lean on the court. Kitchens is listed as a nonpartisan candidate, as well as Ceola James and Byron Carter, who are also running in that race.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court District 2, Place 2\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Dawn Beam has served on the court since she was appointed by former Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016. She faces just one challenger, David Sullivan, a South Mississippi attorney.\n\nWhat's at stake: Like in other races this year, the Mississippi GOP has endorsed Beam to beat Sullivan, who himself has so far been outraising Beam for the court seat. Judge positions in Mississippi and judicial races are known for being nonpartisan. Considering the endorsement for Beam, a Sullivan victory could signify a political shift. It would also represent a break from how judges usually win a Supreme Court seat, which is to be appointed and then reelected as an incumbent.\n\n— The Clarion-Ledger, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 3, abortion rights\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A ballot initiative amending the state Constitution to establish a “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” without government interference. While establishing a constitutional right to abortion, the amendment would still allow government regulation of the practice as well as restrictions on abortions that take place after fetal viability.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri was the first state to outlaw abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, enacting a trigger law passed in 2019. The heavily-funded effort to get the abortion rights initiative on the ballot has been opposed by Republican legislators and elected officials at every step, with the state Supreme Court weighing in at the 11th hour to keep it on the ballot.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is seeking a second term after flipping Missouri’s second Senate seat in 2018, when he defeated Democrat Claire McCaskill. Though polls still show Hawley favored to win, Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce, a former Marine, has closed the gap while significantly outperforming Hawley in fundraising. In addition, independent candidate Jared Young, who formed his own Better Party when establishing his candidacy, is running with the endorsement of former Republican Sen. Jack Danforth.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have established a significant advantage in Missouri over the past two decades and now control every statewide elected office, as well as both seats in the U.S. Senate. How competitive the race turns out to be is likely to highlight Hawley’s vulnerability as well as the effectiveness of Democrats’ strategy — Kunce is the second Missouri Democrat with a military background to run competitively for Senate. Young’s performance, meanwhile, could point to desire among moderates and conservatives for a return to a more balanced approach.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe faces Democrat Crystal Quade, who is termed out in the state House of Representatives, where she has served as minority floor leader.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri last elected a Democratic governor in 2012, when moderate Jay Nixon won a second term. In the years since, Republicans have taken every statewide office and hold supermajorities in the legislature. Kehoe, endorsed by outgoing Gov. Mike Parson, is heavily favored to win, but the race against Quade — a well-liked leader who has helped flip several seats for Democrats in conservative southwest Missouri — will show how much ground progressives need to make up to be competitive again. With abortion rights on the ballot and Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, conditions are as favorable as they’re likely to get for Quade to close the gap.\n\n— Amos Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate:\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is fighting for his fourth term against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Sheehy currently leads by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Tester is one of the last remaining Democrats in a heavily Republican state. His loss could almost guarantee a GOP Senate majority. Despite trailing in the polls, Democrats are heavily investing in Tester’s campaign, with outside groups spending tens of millions of dollars. Native American voter turnout, which played a crucial role in Tester’s previous victories, could be a deciding factor. Sheehy's comments about Native Americans and questions about his past have provided Democrats with attack lines. The outcome will likely come down to turnout and the effectiveness of both candidates’ ground games.\n\nMore: These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House\n\nThe race: Montana's Second Congressional District\n\nWho's running: Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking reelection, facing Democrat Monica Tranel in a rematch from 2022. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and interior secretary under Donald Trump, won that race by 4 points. Tranel, a former Olympic rower and energy lawyer, is giving it another shot after her narrow loss.\n\nWhat's at stake: This race could play a key role in deciding control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Zinke has moved further to the right, aligning closely with Trump on issues like the border and \"cancel culture.\" Tranel, once a Republican herself, has positioned her campaign as a fight for accountability and transparency in government. The district includes both Democratic hubs like Missoula and Republican strongholds, making it a competitive battleground.\n\nThe race: Montana Supreme Court justices\n\nWho is running: Voters in Montana will elect two new justices to the state Supreme Court in 2024. The race for chief justice features Jerry Lynch, a former federal magistrate, and Cory Swanson, an attorney with military experience. For the associate justice position, Katherine M. Bidegaray, a district court judge and ranch owner, is running against Dan Wilson, a former justice of the peace.\n\nWhat's at stake: The upcoming election is crucial as it could shift the ideological balance of the Montana Supreme Court. Currently, the court has three liberal-leaning justices, two conservative-leaning justices, and two swing voters. If both conservative candidates win, the court may lean conservative for the first time in years. However, if at least one liberal candidate secures a seat, the court will maintain its existing balance. Partisan groups are already making endorsements: Democratic-aligned organizations support Lynch and Bidegaray, while Swanson and Wilson receive backing from prominent conservatives, including Gov. Greg Gianforte.\n\nThe race: Montana abortion access\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Montana voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution. This measure seeks to protect a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling, which asserts that the right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice.\n\nWhat's at stake: This initiative comes as Republican lawmakers have tried to overturn the Supreme Court ruling since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2023 stating that the right to privacy does not safeguard abortion rights. Supporters collected over 81,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents attempted to block it. With abortion access becoming a hot button issue nationwide, the outcome in Montana could set a precedent for similar measures in other states.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fifth term in a race against Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race between Bacon and Vargas is seen as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year and is being eyed by national Democrats as an opportunity to flip a Republican seat in its attempt to regain a majority in the House. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District is deeply moderate and has gone for Bacon since 2016, despite flipping for President Joe Biden in 2020. Vargas ran against Bacon in 2022 and lost by nearly three points. Vargas has been polling just points ahead of Bacon in recent weeks and the Cook Political Report identified the race as a toss up in late September.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term against former union leader, steamfitter and independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nWhat’s at stake: A few months ago, the race appeared to clearly favor Fischer, who has broad financial and political backing in the deeply Republican state. That was the case until this summer, when polls conducted by Osborn’s campaign showed him and Fischer in a dead heat. Outside groups are pouring advertising money into both campaigns and the Cook Political Report recently changed the race’s leaning from solid-R to likely-R.\n\nThe race: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives: one aiming to expand abortion access in the state and the other looking to limit it.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While multiple states will see abortion on the ballot this election, Nebraska is the first since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to put competing measures before voters. One measure backed by Protect Our Rights, a coalition of reproductive rights groups in the state, aims to enshrine the right to abortion when it is “needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” as well extend abortion access up to fetal viability. However, it does not list a specific number of weeks. The other sponsored by Protect Women and Children would enshrine Nebraska’s current 12-week ban in the state Constitution with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman. It would allow the state legislature to pass narrower or complete bans in the future.\n\nThe race: Ballot measure on the legalization of medical cannabis\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Two measures aimed at legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Nebraska is one of the last states where the use of medical cannabis is still illegal. To combat Nebraska’s single-issue law, the group is sponsoring two separate measures. One would decriminalize the use of medical marijuana and create protections for patients and caregivers. The other would legalize possessing, manufacturing, distributing, delivering and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes and create a state commission to regulate the drug.\n\n— Maya Hoff, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats’ majority in the U.S. Senate is hanging by a thread, and Nevada’s seat up for election this year is considered competitive. Rosen, who prides herself on being one of Congress’ most bipartisan members, has an edge in the polls against Brown, an Army veteran who’s fully in former President Donald Trump’s camp. If Trump wins Nevada — the presidential race is within a single percentage point in the polls — his coattails could help Brown. In 2022, Catherine Cortez Masto — a well-liked incumbent Democrat with support from numerous prominent Republicans — won her U.S. Senate race by only about 8,000 votes. The Senate race may be a squeaker again.\n\nThe race: Ranked-choice voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A “yes” vote on the initiative would create primaries where the top five candidates regardless of party would move on to the general election.\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot race could upend Nevada politics for years to come by allowing nonpartisans — who outnumber Republicans and Democrats in the state — to participate in partisan primaries for state and federal races. Currently only Republicans and Democrats can vote in their own party’s primary races. Supporters think the initiative will create less extreme candidates because candidates will need to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and they say voters will have more choice because often only the two candidates with the most money get on the November ballot. Opponents say it’ll create confusion and could diminish the chances of independent candidates who would now have to compete with major party candidates in primaries. Only three states currently have ranked-choice voting: Alaska, Maine and Hawaii.\n\nThe race: Washoe County Question 1 — library funding\n\nWhat’s the ballot: Continue a dedicated funding stream for the Washoe County Library System or give the county commission more oversight of library programs.\n\nWhat's at stake: As part of the culture wars in a swing county of a swing state, Reno-area libraries have been the scene of heated protests and increased security. Of the 22 book challenges last year in Nevada libraries — most of those over LGBTQ+ content — all were in Washoe County. This summer, the library system ended Drag Queen Story Hours at its libraries, citing “violence against staffers … perpetrated by a small group of very vocal, very aggressive protesters.” A Drag Queen Story Hour protester — Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party — co-authored the official ballot argument against continuing the library’s dedicated funding stream. The dedicated funding stream represents about a quarter of the library system's budget. If the initiative fails, the library would have to appeal to elected officials to make up that shortfall.\n\n— Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces Democrat former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in an open seat race to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been the state’s popular Republican governor for eight years.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats are hoping to take back the governor's office in New Hampshire for the first time since 2016. The most competitive governor’s race in the country, Ayotte benefits from name recognition, while Craig is bolstered by Vice President Kamala Harris’ popularity in the state. Ayotte’s poor relationship with Trump as well as his lack of popularity in the state means she will likely have to run far ahead of the former president to win the seat. She has also faced attacks on her past votes on abortion policies, while Craig has faced attacks over homelessness in Manchester. While the state has trended more Democratic in federal elections in recent years, the state government has been controlled by Republicans. Ayotte currently holds a narrow lead over Craig in the polls.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is seeking a fourth two-year term to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District against Republican former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Russell Prescott.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a swing district, the moderate Pappas has dominated in recent years, proving his ability to win over voters from both parties. It is currently rated likely Democratic by the Cook Political Report. But Prescott is a less pro-Trump Republican opponent than Pappas has faced in the past, and his supporters hope this will help him unseat the popular incumbent and allow Republicans to take one of the two congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Maggie Goodlander faces Republican Lily Tang Williams in this open race seat to replace retiring Rep. Annie Kuster.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This seat leans likely Democratic, but features two unique candidates. A political newcomer, Goodlander is a former senior White House aide in President Joe Biden’s administration as well as the wife of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. She won a hard-fought primary against Kuster’s endorsed successor, Colin Van Ostern, proving herself to be a savvy campaigner and fundraiser. She is favored over Lily Tang Williams, whose American dream-esque story of escaping communist China allowed her to emerge victorious from a field of 13 Republican candidates.\n\nThe race: New Hampshire Executive Council District 3\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent Executive Councilor is seeking a third term to represent the Seacoast of New Hampshire in the five-body Executive Council. She is being challenged by Democrat former state Sen. Jon Morgan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Hampshire’s little known Executive Council has been dominated by a Republican majority of 4-1 thanks to heavy gerrymandering and has faced controversy for the Republican’s repeated rejection of funding for Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics in the state that provide basic, low-cost reproductive health care. Stevens is favored to hold onto her seat in the Republican-leaning district, but Morgan’s record of winning in similar partisan districts means he could be a legitimate threat.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, faces Republican Curtis Bashaw.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The contest will determine the future of the seat long held by former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was convicted on federal bribery charges earlier this year and resigned from the Senate. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to fill the seat until a successor is elected. Bashaw, a Cape May hotelier and businessman who is gay, has framed his campaign around moderate Republican positions familiar to New Jersey voters. Bashaw is pro-choice and has made his focus on government accountability and lowering spending. Kim, who has served in Congress since 2018 and was a diplomat in the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, prevailed in a competitive primary in which he held off a challenge from New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. Kim is focused on ensuring America’s global economic competitivesness and stabilizing affordability.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Faces Democrat Sue Altman\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Jersey’s sprawling 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of the Garden State itself and stretches across 95 municipalities in six diverse counties. The district includes urban, suburban and rural communities. Kean, first elected in 2022 after a career in the New Jersey Senate, is a moderate Republican who is focused on affordability and lowering government spending. Kean has endorsed former President Donald Trump. Altman, the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, is running on a platform that espouses women's and reproductive rights, safeguarding democratic institutions and asserting America’s leadership on the world stage. The race is tight, but registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by more than 14,000.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New Jersey\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Gabe Vasquez faces Republican Yvette Herrell\n\nWhat’s at stake: As a result of redistricting in 2020, New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from its traditional boundaries encompassing the conservative southeastern part of the state to include portions of blue-leaning central and northern New Mexico. The seat has bounced back and forth between the parties since Republican Steve Pearce left it to seek election to the U.S. Senate, with Yvette Herrell gaining the seat in 2020 from Democrat Xotchitl Torres Small, who she challenged in 2018. Herrell then lost it in 2020 to Gabe Vasquez. Herrells’ loyalty to Trump is reflected in her stand on abortion and enthusiasm for domestic drilling of crude oil and natural gas resources, positions in direct opposition to the governor and majority Democratic state legislature.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Martin Heinrich faces Republican Nella Domenici\n\nWhat’s at stake: Martin Heinrich has been at the forefront of developing New Mexico’s green energy transition, committing federal funds to establish wind and solar farms. Nella Domenici, daughter of Pete Domenici, a Republican who held New Mexico’s Senate seat for six terms, is following in her father’s conservative footsteps. Domenici says New Mexico should trade on its position in the Permian Basin, one of the largest oil producing regions in the U.S.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in office since 2009, is seeking another six-year term against Mike Sapraicone, a Long Island resident who owns a private security company.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Gillibrand is widely favored to win, New York state has seen some shifts in places from blue to red. Her margin of victory and where her numbers might slip from the 2018 election will be telling about New York’s political trends.\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: New York has one statewide ballot question for voters to decide this fall: whether to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state Constitution. New York's would ban discrimination based on \"reproductive healthcare\" and a host of other reasons unrelated to abortion, such as sexual orientation, national origin and age.\n\nWhat’s at stake: At a time when such rights are under attack in much of the country, this ballot measure’s fate will be instructive.\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional district\n\nWho’s running: First-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 17th Congressional District, one of the nation's most hotly contested swing districts — a seat Democrats lost in 2022 and need to recover to regain a House majority. Lawler eked out a narrow upset win in the suburbs north of New York City two years ago. If he retains his seat, that would reflect a reddening of these areas where residents have been concerned about immigration and crime. Jones is a former House member who saw his previous seat disappear in redistricting earlier this decade.\n\nThe race: 19th Congressional District\n\nWho’s running: Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro is seeking a second term in a rematch against Democratic challenger Josh Riley, former Dutchess County executive and a former state Assembly member.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In early autumn, this was the most expensive House race in the country, reflecting the importance of the seat in terms of which party will control Congress in 2025 and 2026.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New York\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Mark Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor, has caused shock waves in North Carolina and national politics for his incendiary comments, most recently after a CNN article alleged he made racist and sexual posts on a pornography message board, which he denies. Robinson, 56, is running against Josh Stein, the 58-year-old lawyer and current attorney general.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Abortion and education have become key aspects of this race. Although he’s flipped on his abortion stance, Robinson in the recent past has supported tighter restrictions. Stein is an outspoken reproductive rights supporter and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic. These candidates are also on opposite ends when it comes to funding education. Stein is fighting for fully funding public schools, and Robinson is supporting taxpayer funded private school vouchers. Robinson also used his time in office to investigate possible indoctrination of schools.\n\nThe race: Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nWho is running: Republican Michele Morrow is a former missionary and homeschool curriculum developer and nurse who is running against Democrat Maurice (Mo) Green, a previous superintendent of Guilford County Schools and general counsel and deputy superintendent for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Morrow, 53, has become a controversial candidate for her presence at the Jan. 6 riot and incendiary remarks posted on social media, recently posting on X that the “+” in LGBTQ+ stands for “Pedophilia.” Morrow supports private school vouchers and has said she wants an audit of federal money in North Carolina schools, claiming their money often comes with strings attached, WRAL reports. Green’s campaign has called Morrow a “dangerous” choice for students, and he supports fully funding public schools and rejects using taxpayer money for private school vouchers. Green, 56, also hopes to partner more with outside community organizations to support children's education.\n\nThe race: North Carolina Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is looking to keep her seat on the state’s high court after Gov. Roy Cooper appointed Riggs, a Democrat, to fill former Justice Mike Morgan’s slot on the bench in 2023, following his retirement. She is running against Jefferson Griffin, a Republican on the state court of appeals.\n\nWhat's at stake: Republicans already hold a 5-2 majority on the state’s highest court, which in recent years has upheld gerrymandered maps that could give Republicans even greater control in the U.S. House. But if Riggs, a Democrat wins, her party will have the opportunity to regain that majority in 2028. Griffin is close with N.C. Supreme Court Justice Paul Newby. (Newby won his seat in 2020 by just 401 votes against Cheri Beasley.) So far this election, Griffin has raised $1.3 million, to Riggs’ $1.1 million.\n\nThe race: Buncombe County Board of Commissioners chair\n\nWho is running: Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan is running for chair of the county board of commissioners as an unaffiliated candidate. His opponent, Commissioner Amanda Edwards, a Democrat, faces a steep fundraising gap.\n\nWhat's at stake: Duncan, a former Democrat, is trying to toe the line between parties. But he’s received sizable campaign contributions from notable area Republicans like former Congressman Charles Taylor. Buncombe County is home to Asheville and was hard hit be Tropical Storm Helene. Whoever wins will likely play a major role in the county's Helene recovery efforts.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The measure creates a new chapter of the North Dakota Century Code related to the legalization of cannabis and related regulation, according to North Dakota’s Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat's at stake: If approved, it would allow for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis and the possession and use of various forms of cannabis by individuals who are 21 years of age and older. It would also allow the state to regulate the industry and preserve employer rights regarding the use of cannabis products by employees, among its provisions. The measure includes revenues of $10,227,600, expenses of $8,324,275, and “an undetermined amount of additional costs associated with behavioral health and social impacts for the 2025-2027 biennium,” the website states.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Michael (Coach) Coachman, an independent; Kelly Armstrong; a Republican; Merrill Piepkorn; a Democrat.\n\nWhat's at stake: North Dakota caught a bit of attention this election season, when current Gov. Doug Burgum ended up on the short-list as a vice-presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. Last year, Burgum briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination and in January, he announced he would not seek a third term as governor, leaving the race wide open.\n\n— Shelly Conlon, Argus Leader, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno\n\nWhat’s at stake: Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year − second only to Montana Sen. Jon Tester − and the outcome in Ohio could determine which party controls a closely divided U.S. Senate come January. Former President Donald Trump also won Ohio by 8 points in 2016 and 2020. Polls show Trump easily winning Ohio again. This is the first time Brown has been on the ballot the same day as Trump, who has endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe race: State Issue 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A group called Citizens Not Politicians crafted a new way to draw districts and put the constitutional amendment on the ballot as Issue 1.\n\nWhat's at stake: The proposal would replace the current politician-run commission with a 15-member citizen commission of five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, currently the Republicans and Democrats. Members couldn't be elected officials, lobbyists or political consultants. During the last redistricting cycle, lawmakers and elected officials repeatedly drew legislative maps deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. Currently, Ohio Republicans dominate the redistricting process and hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nThe race: 3 seats on the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: Cleveland Democrat Melody Stewart and Cincinnati Republican Joe Deters, both incumbent justices, are facing off. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Deters to an unexpired term but Deters decided to challenge Stewart for a full term. Cleveland Democrat Michael Donnelly, an incumbent, is being challenged by Cincinnati Republican Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge making her first statewide run. Cleveland Democrat Lisa Forbes, an 8th District Appellate Court judge, and Columbus Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge, are both running for the seat left open by Deters' decision to challenge Stewart.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have held majority on the court for nearly 40 years. The Democrats are trying to reelect two incumbent justices and win an open seat. The GOP wants to expand its majority by sweeping all three races, which would give Republicans six of seven seats. Who controls the court has a major impact on issues including abortion and redistricting.\n\n— The Columbus Dispatch, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nWho is running: Republican Brian Bingman faces Democrat Harold Spradling and Libertarian Chad Williams in a race to replace outgoing Commissioner Bob Anthony. Bingman was the secretary of state until he stepped down last year to campaign for corporation commission.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The influential Corporation Commission regulates public utilities, oil, gas and other energy sources, commercial transportation and petroleum storage tanks. The three-person commission has been the subject of recent turmoil after witnesses reported seeing Commissioner Todd Hiett grope a man while Hiett was extremely intoxicated at a conference in June. Hiett has refused to step down, and Anthony launched an investigation into his colleague’s behavior. Anthony’s replacement will now help determine how the commission moves forward.\n\nThe race: State Question 834\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure put on the ballot by Republican lawmakers asks voters to tweak part of the state Constitution that defines who can vote as a “qualified elector.”\n\nWhat’s at stake: While only a few words would change, supporters say the move is needed to make clear only people who are legal citizens of the U.S. can vote in Oklahoma elections. Critics say the proposed change is targeting issues that don’t exist — routine audits of election results and voter rolls show the state’s election system is accurate and secure.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District, representing Oklahoma City and parts of central Oklahoma\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice faces a challenge from Democrat Madison Horn, a cybersecurity expert.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Oklahoma is a solidly red state, the metro area district Bice and Horn are vying to represent is turning purple. If voters send Horn to Washington, D.C., she would be the state’s lone Democratic representative in Congress. Her odds remain long, however. While Democrats are gaining ground in and around Oklahoma City, they’re still outnumbered by Republican voters. Republican incumbents are on track to retain Oklahoma’s four other seats in the U.S. House.\n\n— The Oklahoman, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Measure 118\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Measure 118, known as the Oregon Rebate, would raise the minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Oregonians will decide whether to raise the minimum tax rate by 3% for corporations with Oregon sales above $25 million a year and distribute the proceeds to every Oregonian, beginning in 2025. Passage would make Oregon the first state with a universal basic income program. State analysts estimate the measure would increase corporate tax revenue by $1.3 billion during Oregon’s two-year budget cycle. Proponents say the measure would decrease the state poverty rate by “rebating” some $1,600 a year to every resident. Opponents say the measure would result in increased costs and loss of businesses.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez DeRemer, R-Oregon.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in the U.S. House. Bynum twice beat Chavez-DeRemer for the Oregon legislature and seeks to flip the seat. Polls have designated the race as a “toss-up.”\n\nThe race: Oregon attorney general\n\nWho is running: Republican Will Lathrop and Democrat Dan Rayfield\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Oregon’s first attorney general election since the state’s 2020 drug decriminalization measure was passed and later dismantled. Lathrop previously served as a deputy district attorney in Yamhill and Marion counties, while Rayfield has been a member of Oregon’s House of Representatives since 2015 and served as speaker of the House from February 2022 until the end of the 2024 legislative session. Democrat Ellen Rosenblum, who has been attorney general since 2012, announced her retirement in 2023. With more than $2 million in combined spending, the race is the most expensive of Oregon’s three statewide elections. Oregon’s last Republican attorney general left office in 1993.\n\nThe races: Mayor of Portland and Portland city councilors\n\nWho is running: There are 19 people running for mayor, including three city commissioners, a trucking company leader, a stripper/author, and a nonprofit director. Ninety-eight candidates are running for 12 Portland City Council seats.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 2024 election will be the first using ranked-choice voting for the mayoral, auditor and city council races in Portland, Oregon's largest city. The new Portland mayor also will have a new job description. A voter-approved change in 2022 means the mayor will not have a vote on the Portland City Council unless there is a tie and will mostly serve in an administrative role.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is vying for his fourth term against Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO and high-ranking Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The Pennsylvania Senate seat is a must-win for Democrats seeking to retain control of the upper chamber, which they hold by a razor-thin margin. Casey, a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, has breezed through his past reelection battles. But McCormick does have the advantage of voter discontent with President Joe Biden and has worked hard to implicate Casey in the Democratic administration's perceived shortcomings on immigration and the economy. While the incumbent is favored, the race has narrowed, and a handful of polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat.\n\n— Bethany Rodgers, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Six-term incumbent Republican Scott Perry is facing perhaps his strongest opponent so far, Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson, a popular former TV news anchor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Control of the U.S. House could be on the ballot in this race. Perry, a former chair of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has not faced strong opposition during his tenure in Congress in a conservative district. But Stelson, a Republican turned Democrat, has hammered Perry for his positions on reproductive rights and has cast the election as a choice between anti-democratic views and her commitment to democracy. Perry was on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s fight to overturn the 2020 election, an effort that led the U.S. Justice Department to launch an investigation and seize Perry’s cell phone via a search warrant. That investigation has not resulted in any charges, and Perry has denied any wrongdoing. Political observers predict a close race in a district that became more competitive after the most recent redistricting. Polls show the race in a dead heat.\n\n— Mike Argento, York Daily Record, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is seeking a fifth term against Army veteran and Apache helicopter pilot Ashley Ehasz, who lost against Fitzpatrick in 2022 but now has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a “top-tier candidate” to flip a longtime red district in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nWhat's at stake: The 1st District is one of 33 congressional races the DCCC has highlighted in its Red to Blue campaign to maintain or bolster control of the House. The southeastern Pennsylvania district has been under Republican leadership since 2011, with Fitzpatrick cementing a reputation as the most bipartisan member of congress. Ehasz’s campaign has pushed back on that neutral image, saying the incumbent’s bipartisanship won’t extend to reproductive rights and threats to democracy.\n\n— Chris Ullery, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: Pennsylvania Senate, 49th District\n\nWho is running: Two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Dan Laughlin faces a challenge from the former chair of the Erie County Democratic Party Jim Wertz, a first-time candidate.\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats see district, which covers nearly all of Erie County, as being among the seats they can flip to take over the state Senate. Laughlin and Wertz, who used to trade emails about politics, also are engaged in a civil lawsuit. Laughlin claims the weekly Erie Reader and Wertz defamed him by publishing an opinion piece by Wertz — who was a contributing editor and writer for the publication before his state Senate bid — that accused Laughlin and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of seeking a pardon over the 2020 election. Laughlin had signed an amicus brief that specifically stated it was not taking the side of either the plaintiff or the defendant in the case Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was a hail-Mary attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\n— Matthew Rink, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking a fourth term against Republican state legislator Patricia Morgan, who lists her occupation as \"financial advisor.\"\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whitehouse, 68, a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, has been in the Senate since 2007, after he ousted Republican Lincoln Chafee. He is known for warning about the perils of climate change and \"dark money\" in campaign finances. Whitehouse was named Senate Budget Committee chair last year and turned much of its focus toward climate issues. More recently, he’s been one of the louder voices in Washington on term limits for the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan is a former state Republican chair, House minority leader – and unsuccessful 2018 primary candidate for governor – who has served in the legislature off and on for 12 years. She has attacked Whitehouse for supporting President Joe Biden on immigration and federal spending, among other issues. In announcing her candidacy, she took aim at inflation, the economy and \"massive and wasteful federal spending.\"\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Question 1 will determine whether there will be a constitutional convention\n\nWhat’s at stake: If voters approve Question 1 on Nov. 5 there will be an election to choose 75 delegates who will meet at a time and place to be determined to recommend amendments to the state Constitution that would be put up for approval at another statewide election. The last time voters called for a convention was 1984, and past conventions have taken on many shapes and sizes, from the 1973 convening that lasted a month to the 1964 affair that lasted four years. The last one cost taxpayers $891,000, or about $2.5 million in today's money.\n\n— Providence Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposed constitutional amendment on voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: South Carolina voters will see a proposed amendment to section 4 of Article II of the state Constitution reading “Must Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of this State, relating to voter qualifications, be amended so as to provide that only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law?”\n\nWhat’s at stake: The proposed change would alter one word of the state Constitution to have it read “only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law.” Although an investigation fou", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/12/06/georgia-election-runoff-2022-walker-warnock-us-senate-race-voting-news-updates/10838957002/", "title": "Election Day in GA: Recap, results from US Senate race runoff", "text": "Staff reports\n\nGeorgia Sen.

Voting is faith put into action and Georgia you have been praying with your lips and your legs, with your hands and your feet, your head and your hearts. You have put in the hard work and here we are standing together.\"\n\nWalker conceded the race in a speech at 11 p.m.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State officials said 1.3 million voters cast ballots on Election Day and overall turnout surpassed 3.4 million, topping expectations.

And after a hard-fought campaign, or should I say campaigns, it is my honor to utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy: the people have spoken.”\n\nWarnock recounted his family history, recounting how his mother grew up picking cotton and his father supported the family hauling cars, and his own history growing up in Savannah.\n\n“I am Georgia,” he said. “I am an example and an iteration of its history, of its pain and its promise, of the brutality and the possibility. But because this is America and because we always have a path to make our country greater against unspeakable odds, thank you Georgia.”\n\nWarnock said that his victory was not evidence that voter suppression does not exist in Georgia, but that instead it was an indicator that voters had managed to overcome it. He highlighted several policy issues – lowering prescription drug prices, creating jobs, and working on criminal justice reform. And he thanked his staff and volunteers.\n\n“After a hard fought campaign, you got me for six more years,” he said.\n\n– Abraham Kenmore\n\n11 p.m. | Walker concedes but makes 'no excuses'\n\nWalker gave a short concession speech shortly after the race was called in favor of his opponent.

The crowd was watching the results, displayed on a giant screen playing Fox News behind Velo. Walker, who had been trailing Warnock from the start of the night, finally caught up in the close race.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, that’s your hard work right there,” Velo said, as he began playing an original song.\n\nThe timbre of the room changed entirely. What before was a fairly reserved party became energized, as Walker supporters cheered together and hugged each other.\n\nAt that point, about 1.8 million ballots of 3.3 million total had been counted.\n\n6:50 p.m. | Democratic strategist voices confidence in Warnock\n\nWarnock’s campaign is confident as the polls are about to close, according to Democratic strategist Tharon Johnson, founder and CEO of Paramount Consulting Group.

Warnock back to Washington.”\n\n– Abraham Kenmore\n\n6:45 p.m. | More voters than ballots on Wilmington Island\n\nAs the day wound to a close, both precincts on N. Cromwell Road on Wilmington Island were running out of paper.\n\nNorma Canicotti, poll manager for precinct 4-07 at Wilmington Island Methodist church, said several printers ran out of paper at once. And it was during the post-work rush of voters. She said there was a line of about 20 people waiting to vote at one point.\n\n“It was rotten,” she said.\n\nThey received more paper from the county, but no extra reems were left behind, leaving Canicotti to worry they’d run out again.\n\nAs of 6:15, precinct 4-07 had cast 1,087 ballots, more than double what the location typically sees during a runoff.\n\n“We’ve had a pile of people come through here today,” Canicotti said.\n\n6:15 p.m. | Warnock watch event prepped and ready\n\nSupporters of Sen.

The couple were two of nearly 500 people who’d voted as of 5:30 p.m. — nearly one-third of the precinct’s registered voters.\n\n“We haven’t beat (primary) elections number yet, but we might,” said poll manager Lydia Alva. “though, not by too much.”\n\nNorth and Russell were part of widespread voter turnout in Georgia for the Senate runoff, which was the only race on the ballot. They said the high turnout was a signal to the rest of the country that Georgia cares.\n\n“I think what's important is that it's going to show that Georgians… they (care) about the elections and they're gonna turnout and make their voice heard,” Russell said.\n\nWhile “civic duty” is what pushed the couple to the polls, North said women’s reproductive rights were a big issue for them heading into the voting booth.\n\n“(These issues) matter to us,” Russell said. “As someone who's had a miscarriage and almost needed a D&C (surgical removal of uterine lining after a miscarriage), it’s important.”\n\n- Zoe Nicholson\n\n5:50 p.m. | Media arrive at Walker Election Night watch party\n\nThe College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta was bustling with journalists Tuesday around 5:30 p.m., as they took their places for Herschel Walker's watch party.\n\nThe former UGA standout's football legacy is enshrined there. Walker was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nWalker's watch party is officially set to begin at 7 p.m., and campaign staffers said other guests of Walker should start to arrive around then.\n\n- Will Peebles\n\n5:30 p.m. | Runoff voter demographics come into focus\n\nAs of mid-afternoon, approximately 800,000 Georgians had visited polls on Election Day, according to a Georgia Secretary of State's office official. Before election day, Georgia had accepted about 175,000 absentee ballots and 1.7 million people had voted early in person – a total of 1.89 million ballots, or 27% of registered voters.\n\nWhite voters had the highest number of votes among early voters, but Black voters had slightly higher early voting turnout at 29.5% - a full percentage point higher than white voters. About 10% of voters under 30 voted early, while 49.5% of registered voters 65 and above had already voted by election day.\n\n– Abraham Kenmore\n\n2:15 p.m. | Dept. of Justice monitoring Georgia runoff\n\nThe Justice Department will monitor polls in four Georgia counties Tuesday as voters cast their ballots in the Senate runoff election, the last remaining contest in the 2022 midterms.\n\nJustice regularly dispatches monitors as a guard against voting rights violations. And on Tuesday, monitors from the Civil Rights Division and U.S. attorneys’ offices will be deployed to Cobb, Fulton, Gwinnett and Macon-Bibb counties.\n\nComplaints involving possible violations can be made on the department’s website or by telephone at 800-253-3931.\n\n– Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY\n\n1:30 p.m. | Absentee ballot never arrived\n\nFrancine Scott requested a ballot on Nov. 28, more than a week ago, but never received it. Without a car or way to vote, Scott, a 79-year-old Savannah native, called a friend who was offering free rides to the polls so she could cast her ballot at her precinct at the W.W. Law Community Center.\n\n“I'm a citizen of the United States of America. And I have a right to vote. And so whatever it took, I was going to vote,” Scott said.\n\nScott believes mail delays — which are plaguing communities nationwide as the US Postal reduces costs by relying mainly on ground travel — kept her ballot from arriving by Election Day.\n\nChatham County elections chief Billy Wooten said issues with mail-in ballots occur every year, and it’s not a widespread issue.\n\nDue to delays with mail-in ballots in Cobb County, a federal court demanded election officers receive mail-in ballots until Dec. 9 — they must be posted by Dec. 6, though — to ensure all ballots are received for the final count.\n\n1:30 p.m. | 'Incredible' turnout for a runoff at W.W. Law Center\n\nWhen Kathleen Roberson Austin came out of the voting precinct at the W.W. Law Community Center, she waved her “I’m a Georgia Voter” sticker in the air proudly, a smile on her face.\n\n“It’s my first time,” she exclaimed.\n\nThe pastor has worked in Savannah for four years, but just recently made the permanent move from Virginia to the Peach State, meaning Tuesdays run-off was her first as a resident.\n\n“This election is so important. This particular one, the runoff is just so important and so, I'm just so honored to be able to cast my vote and to let my voice be heard. And so it's really significant to me to cast this vote,” Roberson Austin said.\n\nThe pastor was one of more than 200 people who’d voted at precinct 2-03 by 1:30 p.m., an “incredible” turnout for a runoff, according to the poll manager.\n\n10:33 a.m. | JEA records 255 votes by 10 a.m.; pace remains steady, peaceful\n\nThe scene at the Jewish Education Alliance in Abercorn Street — precinct 1-05 — was like most polling places across Chatham County: voters came to cast their ballots in an unrelenting yet peaceful tide.\n\nBy 10 a.m., 255 people had cast their votes at the JEA.\n\nChatham County Elections Chief Billy Wooten said it was smooth sailing as of 10:30 Tuesday morning — “All polls opened on time. Turnout is steady. No lines. Customary and usual equipment issues; no major problems,” he reported via text message to the Savannah Morning News. The “usual equipment issues” mean broken printers, or a voting machine down here and there.\n\nTurnout at the JEA wasn’t as busy as Nov. 8, according to poll workers, but early voting flooded ballot boxes statewide — Wooten said roughly 10% of the county’s population (approximately 30,000 people) voted early at in-person precincts ahead of Tuesday.\n\n10:27 a.m. | More than 400 votes cast at First Presbyterian this morning\n\nWhen First Presbyterian Church opened its polling location, precinct 1-01, at 7am, there was a line wrapped around the building, according to poll manager Katherine Simmons.\n\nWhile they cleared the line quickly, Simmons said the pace has kept up all morning. By 9:45 a.m., 410 people had cast their ballot at the location.\n\nSimmons said the turnout was “exciting to see.”\n\n“Seems kind of busier than Nov 8,” she said, referencing the primary election. “Because it seems like a lot of people didn’t get a chance to early vote.”\n\nVoters who voted early in Chatham County reported wait times of an hour or more, but it took Josie Bustos less than five minutes to cast her ballot Tuesday morning.\n\nShe said the increased turnout doesn’t surprise her. “I think it's been happening in the state for a couple of years now, and it's just what we need,” Bustos said.\n\n8:50 a.m. | Relaxed and steady at Morningside Baptist\n\nIt took reporter Zoe Nicholson less than five minutes to vote at precinct 2-07 — Morningside Baptist Church on East Gwinnett Street. She was the 163rd ballot, cast at 8:50 a.m. Tuesday morning. There was no line, but the precinct was never without voters during the 20 minutes she spent observing after voting. Poll workers were relaxed and congenial.\n\n8:37 a.m. | Five minutes in and out at the Salvation Army\n\nA steady stream of voters filed into the Salvation Army on Bee Road around 8:30 a.m. Tuesday morning, but Johnny Simmons was in and out in about five minutes.\n\nSimmons said the inundation of political ads on television, radio, email — virtually anywhere an advertisement can be delivered — did not impact his decision.\n\n“I don't like to pay attention to it because it's a bunch of crap,” he said.\n\nAlthough the national stakes of today's senate race hang heavy for some, Simmons said it’s the same story he’s been told since he began voting at precinct 2-09 in the 1980s.\n\n“The emphasis is always there…” he said, adding that pre-voting polls seem to dominate conversations. “I don't know who they survey because I done been in this a long time and I never got surveyed.”\n\n7:55 a.m. | Return of the bacon signs\n\nThe inflation disinformation election campaign returned Tuesday morning as signs reading \"Bacon $10.99\" co-mingled with the Warnock and Walker signs along Savannah area roadways. The message is a reference to inflation in the grocery store and a condemnation of the political party in power, the Democrats, and Warnock by extension.\n\nA quick price check at Kroger revealed a pound of bacon for $4.49. The breakfast meat is even cheaper at Walmart, which advertises its \"Great Value\" brand for $3.58.\n\nSupport local journalism by subscribing to a Georgia newspaper.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/08/23/delawareonline-com-opinion-section-welcomes-different-perspectives/74720578007/", "title": "We welcome voices from all perspectives to shares views on issues ...", "text": "Delaware News Journal\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal deeply values our readers’ opinions on the news of the day in Delaware and beyond. We publish op-eds and letters to the editor regularly on issues – Delawareans should rest assured that their perspectives are welcome in our opinion report.\n\nOur opinion report is curated and edited by Ed Forbes, a veteran editor who has spent more than 20 years in newspaper journalism. Forbes brings experience on editorial boards in New York and New Jersey and has been part of the DelawareOnline.com newsroom for more than five years.\n\nWe recently asked Forbes a series of questions about his work and his perspectives on why community engagement – the voices of our readers across the First State – is still essential to our journalism.\n\nQuestion: As we approach the 2024 election, what role do you feel newspaper opinion coverage plays in keeping Delaware voters engaged and informed?\n\nAnswer: Our journalism is nothing short of essential. We report news daily that impacts how Delaware’s elected officials undertake their work in Dover and in Washington, D.C. We continue to take our role as Delaware’s watchdogs seriously, too. And, on our opinion pages, we welcome voices from all perspectives to share their views on the politics of the day – be they local, imperative to all of Delaware or national. The reality that we are the President of the United States’ hometown newspaper is also a responsibility we take seriously and we have worked hard to publish a variety of perspectives about the Biden administration and its policies during the president’s term. We’ll continue to do so through the campaign – now the Harris-Walz campaign, of course – and the election.\n\nIt’s been a head-spinning, historic summer for political news so far. As you oversee our opinion coverage, how challenging is it to stay on top of so much change and respond?\n\nI’m locked in to local, regional and national coverage of the election for most of my day. I typically read the national newspapers’ morning reports as early as 6 a.m. and am on top of what we and other outlets publish throughout each day and evening. I also stay in close contact with a wide variety of sources, colleagues and friends who work in state capitols, mayors’ offices, campaign operations, Congress and the White House. Election years are especially intense and 2024 has proven to be a year like no other. The evolution of the presidential campaign and its impacts on down-ballot races will continue to play out in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nAs a veteran newspaper journalist who has witnessed so many changes in our industry, what do you most want younger people to know about the role of local newspapers in the democratic process?\n\nPut simply: We still matter. Journalism still matters. I have been so heartened in recent years by the interest younger readers have in our work. And it’s also encouraging to see so many young people continuing to pursue journalism in higher education and in their careers. As many Gen Z voters prepare to vote in the first major general election, we are working hard to amplify their voices – particularly in the presidential race. And we always want to hear from more younger voters. Get in touch.\n\nWe are a country polarized on so many key issues, and we certainly see divisions on many issues affecting Delaware. How has that affected the way you approach your mission?\n\nWe hold ourselves to high journalistic standards that depend entirely on reporting based on facts. While we recognize that the polarization of opinion on politics is broad – and while we welcome views from all sides – we are unequivocal when it comes to facts.\n\nWhat do you see as the core issues motivating voters in Delaware this election cycle, particularly on the statewide or local levels?\n\nDelawareans are focused on a range of issues. Reproductive and womens’ rights are essential to many voters. Investment in education and health care are also priorities for many of our readers. Reducing taxes remains a perennially important issue. Finding a smarter path forward for how the country handles immigration is important. Public safety is important – as is police reform. And, of course, the economy looms large for many of our readers – worries about inflation and job growth are constant.\n\nWe read a lot about groups around the country attempting to “bridge the gap,” attempting to foster dialogue and find common ground in the face of a lot of divisiveness. As you communicate with so many community members, do you feel a longing for this in Delaware?\n\nEntirely. Yes, Delaware likes compromise – especially when it leads to progress. Our readers want lawmakers to debate the policy questions smartly – and then take action. Meeting in the middle – moderation – remains a very appealing concept whenever I talk with our readers.\n\nWe are approaching a new school year. What issues do you feel will be hot topics this year?\n\nAs a parent myself – of three daughters: one headed to middle school, a rising second grader and another headed to preschool – I’m particularly focused on student safety. Of course, that’s a broad topic that spans gun control and access to social media. Both of those concerns for our kids have my attention – and the attention of most parents I speak to, regardless of political affiliations. There are particular concerns about when it’s appropriate for kids to have their own smart devices. I think the local and national conversations on phones and social media are really still just beginning.\n\nThe Bidens have long put Delaware in the national spotlight. Do you think the state will have a bit of an identity crisis as Joe Biden leaves politics?\n\nI don’t, to be honest. I think Delaware is likely to embrace the president’s homecoming. I think we’ll celebrate his decades of service. But the baton really has been passed now – from baby boomers to the next generation of political leaders. I think Delaware, like much of the country, is ready for fresh perspective from both sides of the aisle. There are some really terrific rising stars in both political parties who we should all be watching with interest. All that said, we should also be grateful for the impact the president has made here – his imprint on Delaware is likely indelible.\n\nYour job isn’t easy. What do you like to do when you have some time to yourself?\n\nI walk at least three miles a day. In the winter, I try to ski as often as possible – both Nordic and alpine. I spend a lot of time with my three daughters, encouraging their interests in cooking, baking, tennis, swimming, skiing and more. I love cooking and finding new restaurants. We spend a lot of time with the kids on road trips that take us across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. And I also enjoy making cocktails and listening to everything from jam bands to jazz standards.\n\nAny favorite books or podcasts right now?\n\nI’ve just started Daniel Mason’s “North Woods” and have been revisiting some old favorites this summer – stories by John Cheever and some of John Updike’s novels. I’m a big fan of NPR’s “Throughlines” and, with football season on the horizon, I’m starting to gobble up coverage of the Buffalo Bills on every platform.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/23"}]}

It’s cold and bleak, but brighter days are ahead. As you look to shake off winter, consider community theater.\n\nNestled in the heart of Middletown, The Everett Theatre stands as a beacon of cultural vibrancy and artistic excellence.\n\nEstablished with an unwavering belief in the transformative power of performing arts, the Everett has been the center of cultural activity in Middletown for more than 100 years.\n\nCurating a rich tapestry of offerings catering to the varied tastes of our community, The Everett has not only preserved its historical charm but continues to thrive, drawing arts enthusiasts from our region and beyond.\n\nAt the heart of The Everett's greatness lies its unwavering commitment to artistic excellence, accessibility and community engagement. We take immense pride in offering a diverse array of high-quality productions throughout the year, captivating audiences of all ages, artistic preferences, and walks of life. The production quality and talent of our shows so often leaves first-time audiences walking out the door wondering what took them so long to visit.\n\nUnder the direction of Meredith Peterson, our resident Bard expert, The Everett has become a destination for Shakespeare enthusiasts and novices alike. Meredith's ability to bring the playwright’s words to life and infuse them with humor and unexpected elements charms audiences and cultivates a second home for actors who return time and again to share their passion.\n\nNext month, Meredith will oversee the production of an edgy, modern-day rendition of \"Romeo and Juliet'' set in post-COVID Texas 2021. (If that doesn’t pique your interest, I don’t know what will.)\n\nThe Everett is not just a theater; it’s a hub of activity for visual arts, youth programs, adult classes, special events and film. Whether you are drawn to our engaging performances or our sold-out Taylor Swift ‘'pizza and paint'’ events, you’ll find something for every interest. At our core, we aim to be a dynamic, flexible environment that listens to our community and adapts to its interests.\n\nOf all our achievements, youth programming is one of our proudest. The Everett’s youth theater productions offer students the opportunities to grow and learn critical life skills like teamwork, creativity and fiscal management. From volunteering as ushers and stage crew to directors and choreographers, the young people we mentor find support throughout the process. And unlike so many youth programs, involvement in our productions is free to anyone who wants to participate.\n\nThis April, a cast and crew comprised solely of students will present \"Clue,\" under the direction of local high school student Spencer Wattay, a show you surely won’t want to miss.\n\nOur youth offerings also include a robust summer camp program that sells out each season. This year, dozens of kids ranging in age from 4 to 18 will travel from Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and beyond to act, dance, sing, draw, paint and more.\n\nA core tenant of The Everett is accessibility. We believe the arts are for everyone and work hard to make this mission a reality by subsidizing our summer camps for those who may not otherwise be able to afford them. Additionally, participation in our theater productions is always free. As a fully volunteer-based organization, we rely on the community to serve as actors, crew, choreographers, directors — and donors. It is only through support that we’re able to offer the type of accessibly we do.\n\nNext month, we will be participating in our biggest fundraiser of the year, Do More 24 Delaware. Between 6 p.m. on Thursday, March 7 and 6 p.m. on Friday, March 8, any donation made to The Everett, or any of the participating nonprofits, will go further than gifts made during any other day of the year. Thanks to dozens of sponsors from across the state, Delaware’s nonprofits will earn matching gifts, prizes, and other incentives when donations are made by visiting domore24delaware.org.\n\nDo More 24 Delaware — organized by United Way of Delaware and Spur Impact — plays a crucial role in The Everett’s ability to maintain accessibility and create a vibrant, inclusive community. Thanks to last year's Do More 24 Delaware campaign, we were able to supplement and subsidize summer camp fees, ensuring accessibility for students from all socioeconomic backgrounds. The campaign also has empowered us to expand our programming, educational offerings, and community outreach.\n\nAs we embark on another season of performances, youth programs, and community engagement, we invite you to be a part of The Everett's legacy.\n\nDrive up, drive down, make the trip — it's worth it. And donate on March 7 to 8!\n\nDan Sieglen serves on the board of directors of The Everett.\n\nMore about the arts in Delaware\n\nMarley in Delaware:Q&A: Delaware native co-writes 'Bob Marley: One Love' & makes sure Wilmington scene included\n\nDelaware &'The Feud':Artist Jamie Wyeth's glimpse of Truman Capote at New York restaurant is tied to 'Feud'\n\nWorld premiere ballet:'TRIPLE BILL' by First State Ballet Theatre debuts 3 world premieres this month", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/07/03/delaware-nonprofit-shoes-that-fit-helps-more-students-with-new-support/74196462007/", "title": "Delaware nonprofit Shoes That Fit helps more students with new ...", "text": "Earlier this year, Joanne Glauser didn't know if her organization would have a future.\n\n\"Without getting some more support in Delaware, it could die with me,\" Glauser told Delaware Online/The News Journal around the winter holidays.

Anyone – adoring fans, stalkers, the paparazzi – can walk through its glass front door, down the hall, up the stairs and around the corner to reach their office, Suite 123. The carpet is beige, not red.\n\nYet 501 Silverside Road is the address the movie superstars and global philanthropists consider their legal address as co-presidents of the non-profit Jolie-Pitt Foundation. It's incorporated here, but it gives all its money — $21.5 million from its founding in 2006 through 2011 — to charities in Cambodia, Namibia, Pakistan and destitute portions of the USA.\n\nTheirs is one of more than 1,200 charitable foundations incorporated in Delaware, nearly all of which focus their philanthropy elsewhere. Only Rhode Island has more foundations per capita, but Delaware specializes in \"foreign\" foundations that have no significant connection to the state.\n\nNearly 800 of those foundations — which are established by wealthy donors to give money to favorite causes — all legally reside with Pitt and Jolie behind the oak door of Suite 123. They include those of actor Hugh Jackman, entertainer Cher, NFL quarterbacks Matt Hasselbeck and Phillip Rivers, Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek, Melrose Place creator Darren Star and actress Yeardley Smith, better known as the voice of Lisa on The Simpsons.\n\nThey give to their alma maters and their churches, to charities for sick children and endangered animals, to non-profit groups advocating abortion rights and others fighting to end abortion.\n\nAn additional 100 foundations with an overseas focus — such as Save the Rhino International, Friends of the American School of Warsaw and Historic Royal Palaces, which supports several popular British tourist sites — are served by Chapel & York, a British company with a \"virtual\" office in downtown Wilmington.\n\nThey're all drawn, experts say, by Delaware's well-earned reputation as a place to set up shop quickly, easily, cheaply and with few questions — many of the same reasons that nearly 1 million public corporations are here.\n\n\"It's the company state, and it's well known that way,\" said David Wickert, executive director of Chapel & York.\n\nFoundations in Delaware pay just $25 a year in franchise tax, don't need CPA-certified audits and don't pay state tax on unrelated-business income, as they would in some other states, said Jeffery Haskell, chief legal officer for Foundation Source, the Connecticut company that administers the Silverside Road foundations.\n\n\"They really know how to attract for-profit businesses and non-profits, too,\" Haskell said.\n\nLike most states and the federal government, Delaware's oversight of the growing number of private foundations and public charities is \"woefully inadequate,\" said Aaron Dorfman, executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a non-profit advocacy group.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service audits only a small portion of the 1.1 million financial statements filed by non-profit groups annually, most of which are a year or two out of date anyway, Dorfman said. States don't do much better.\n\n\"Most state attorneys general have just one person overseeing the entire charity sector,\" Dorfman said. \"Without staff at the state level to investigate, most abuse goes undetected. It's not rampant, but it is significant.\"\n\nIn Delaware, foundation oversight falls to the seven attorneys in the attorney general's consumer protection unit, but they cover 3,200 other charities and all kinds of disputes between consumers and businesses. Their work is entirely driven by complaints, director Gregory Strong said.\n\n\"Someone would have to call us and say, 'I gave money to this organization, and I don't think it was used for charitable purposes,' \" he said.\n\nThe attorney general's office collects the Form 990 financial statements that Delaware non-profit groups submit annually to the IRS, Strong said. No one reviews those statements, and the state does not make them public.\n\nStrong said 39 other states require non-profit groups to register and submit financial information annually, so regulators and the public can know who is operating in their states.\n\nDelaware laws allow foundations to have just one director, instead of three, and the state lets Foundation Source pay the franchise tax and file papers for all of its 800 non-profit groups at once, instead of separately, he said.\n\n\"They do things in a friendly, efficient, convenient way,\" Haskell said. \"It's just such a clear choice to go with Delaware.\"\n\nThe IRS requires all tax-exempt organizations to be incorporated somewhere, so Delaware appeals to philanthropists who don't care where their legal home is, Wickert said. That's especially useful for organizations with a global focus.\n\n\"More and more Americans want to support organizations outside the United States, and the only way to do that is to make a donation to a group registered in the United States,\" said Wickert, a former Episcopal priest who lives in Sussex, England.\n\nMike Chalmers also reports for The (Wilmington, Del.)

That's tuition for the average Delaware undergrad on campus increasing by $560, now reaching $14,600, while out-of-state students can expect a $1,510 increase to $39,100.\n\nThe cost of dorm living will increase by about the same percentage, according to the board, though dining prices will increase about 6% on average. Student fees will also increase — the comprehensive fee by 13.7%, the student center fee by 4.2% and the student wellbeing fee up 1.4%.\n\nThese increases meet concern with a \"per-student tax\" the city of Newark hopes to levy on its university neighbor.\n\nAnd now, there's a bill on the table to make it happen.\n\nUniversity of Delaware student fee:City of Newark moves forward on new UD student tax, looks to state for support\n\nNewark's hope for a per-student tax on UD\n\nState Rep. Cyndie Romer introduced a bill at the top of May that would allow Newark to execute a new tax — seeking \"up to $50 per semester, per full- or part-time undergraduate or postgraduate student, at any college or university\" attending in-person, the resolution reads, with that fee adjusting with inflation.\n\nThe Newark Democrat's bill would amend the city's charter to allow for such a tax, if passed and signed, and Newark would then set the fee.\n\nThat's $100 a year at the largest amount, aiming for some $2 million in annual impact for the city depending on UD enrollment. The concept resolution passed in City Council caused a stir back in February, and the university has been lobbying against it since.\n\nThe tension here has existed for decades.\n\nNewark says about 42% of real estate within the city is tax-exempt. That's because the University of Delaware, like all nonprofits under state law, doesn't pay property taxes. If it did, the city estimates they would total around $6 million. It does pay operating costs to the city, like water and electricity, as well as certain fixed payments in lieu of taxes — but the council says such \"PILOT\" payments haven't been adjusted in nearly 60 years, despite the school quadrupling in enrollment.\n\nIt contends that additional revenue sources are \"imperative\" to continue to provide city services. The city says it's staring at a widening budget deficit, and an unstable path forward with inflation and rising labor costs.\n\nWhen is graduation?Here's the latest 2024 commencement breakdown across Delaware colleges\n\nOver at UD, last year already marked the largest increase in a decade. Hikes were marked up to 5% for the 2023-2024 school year, alongside a 9% increase to the cost of a meal plan and a 5% increase to the cost of living in the dorms.\n\nWith Romer's bill awaiting consideration in the House, time will tell if it adds to the growing cost for Delaware's largest university.\n\nGot a story?

The website also includes plenty of legitimate listings, from people looking to rent apartments, sell a car or advertise a job opening.\n\n\"Visa's rules prohibit our network from being used for illegal activity,\" company spokesman John Earnhardt said in a statement. \"Visa has a long history of working with law enforcement to safeguard the integrity of the payment system and we will continue to do so.\"\n\nMasterCard said it followed its protocol of prohibiting its cards from being used for \"illegal or brand-damaging activities\" in making its decision.\n\n\"When the activity is confirmed, we work with the merchant's bank to resolve the situation,\" MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said. \"Based on a request from the Cook County Sheriff's Office, we contacted Backpage's acquiring bank about the issue. They have advised us that they are terminating acceptance at this time.\"\n\nAmerican Express stopped doing business with Backpage earlier this year, spokeswoman Sanette Chao said. She declined to detail why the credit card company ended the relationship.\n\nDart on Wednesday thanked the companies for quickly responding to his request.\n\n\"The actions today of both MasterCard and Visa are huge and they should be roundly commended for their actions,\" Dart said. \"We realize the battle ahead is still going to proceed. We realize that Backpage probably is not going to go away. But what we can tell you is that for all the women, children and men, to some extent too, that have been exploited by these sites it's going to be increasingly difficult for those events to occur again.\"\n\nThe website, which is similar to Craigslist, has been under pressure from lawmakers and law enforcement for years to end adult-services advertisements. Craigslist ceased posting adult and erotic service ads in 2010. Users can still use bitcoin to pay for ads.\n\nIn April, Backpage published over 1.4 million adult-services ads in the U.S., with the company bringing roughly $9 million in revenue per month through that channel, according to the Cook County Sheriff's Department.\n\nBackpage accounted for about 70% of prostitution advertising among five websites that carry such ads in the United States, earning more than $22 million annually from prostitution ads, according to a 2012 estimate by AIM Group, a media research and consulting company.\n\nCook County Sheriff's Police Dept. say they have made more than 800 arrests since 2009 connected to Backpage adult service ads. Fifty of the arrests were for sex trafficking, involuntary servitude or promoting prostitution.\n\nDart argued that by taking away the ease of a credit card to advertise often underage girls who have been forced into the situation, MasterCard and Visa could help reduce the number of victims.\n\n\"(I)nstitutions such as yours have the moral, social and legal right to step up on this pervasive problem and make a fundamental and everlasting difference,\" Dart wrote in the letter to MasterCard CEO Ajaypal Banga and the company's board of directors.\n\nEarlier this year, a federal judge in Boston threw out a lawsuit against Backpage that alleged that the web site was designed to facilitate sex trafficking. Judge Richards Stearns ultimately agreed with the company's — and digital rights groups' — argument that under federal law Web service companies are immune from liability for crimes by users.\n\nLiz McDougall, senior counsel for Backpage, declined to comment. Digital rights advocates, however, were critical of the tack Dart took in going after Backpage.\n\n\"I really don't think this is the way we should be making law in this country,\" Rainey Reitman, activism director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which filed an amicus brief on behalf of Backpage in the Massachusetts case. \"We shouldn't have informal pressure from public officials forcing financial service companies into deciding which types of speech should and shouldn't be allowed. MasterCard and Visa are not supposed to be the arbiters of free speech on the Internet.\"\n\nDart says his office did not threaten Visa and MasterCard, but simply asked for their cooperation. He added that he believes his agency is on firm legal ground.\n\n\"In this case, I would find it very, very difficult to understand how in anyone's twisted way (of thinking), we are infringing on someone's First Amendment right here,\" Dart said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/entertainment/kanye-west-chaney-jones/index.html", "title": "Kanye West appears to confirm new romance with Chaney Jones ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt looks like Kanye West has a new “boo.”\n\nThe rapper/mogul posted on his verified Instagram account a screenshot of a post from The Shade Room, which read “It appears #Ye and his new boo #ChaneyJones are going strong.”\n\nWest, who now goes by “Ye,” captioned the photo with a black heart emoji.\n\nKanye West performs onstage at the iHeartRadio Music Festival in 2015.

Weiss is one of a handful of appointees of former President Donald Trump who were kept on by the Biden administration because they were overseeing politically sensitive investigations.\n\nAdding to the pressure, Republicans in Congress have already announced that if they take over the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, they plan to launch new investigations and hold hearings to examine the conduct of Hunter Biden and others in the Biden family.\n\nAlso potentially in play are Justice Department guidelines governing politically sensitive investigations during an election year. Current and former Justice Department officials say there is an unwritten rule that prosecutors avoid bringing politically sensitive cases within 60 days of an election.\n\nSome current and former Justice officials have debated whether the rules necessarily apply in this instance since Joe Biden isn’t on the ballot in the midterms.\n\nA lawyer for Hunter Biden declined to comment. The US Attorney’s Office in Delaware declined to comment.\n\nHunter Biden has not been charged with any crimes and has previously denied any wrongdoing. His father is not being investigated as part of the probe of his son’s business activities, according to sources who have been briefed.\n\nNarrowing the focus\n\nThe Justice Department investigation initially focused on Hunter Biden’s financial and business activities in foreign countries dating to when Joe Biden was vice president. But investigators have examined a swath of broader conduct, including whether Hunter Biden and associates violated money laundering, campaign finance, tax and foreign lobbying laws, as well as whether Hunter Biden broke federal firearm and other regulations, multiple sources said.\n\nAs the investigation has entered its final stages, prosecutors have narrowed their focus to tax and gun-related charges, the people say.\n\nJustice officials have debated the strength of the case for months, and have held discussions about whether more work is needed before deciding on possible charges. Those discussions have involved investigators from the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation agency and prosecutors in Delaware and at Justice Department headquarters, CNN previously reported.\n\nHunter Biden has publicly discussed his own substance abuse struggles, and some Justice officials questioned whether his open discussions of his past drug use could potentially weaken their case should they bring one.\n\nSome officials have noted that Biden could argue he wasn’t aware of wrongdoing because he was on drugs, one source said. CNN has previously reported that some officials were concerned it could be a defense, but more recently, Justice officials have coalesced around the view that Biden’s own public accounts of his recovery show he was fully responsible for actions now under scrutiny, according to the person familiar with the discussions.\n\nIn the meetings, officials also discussed the timing of any possible indictment given the sensitivity of bringing a politically connected case close to an election, another person said.\n\nJustice Department memoranda advise prosecutors against bringing any cases or taking any overt investigative steps with the purpose of impacting an election or providing an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate.\n\nGarland issued a memo in May to prosecutors reiterating the department’s stance on election year sensitivities. The memo is one attorneys general send every election year, and generally advises prosecutors about avoiding making major investigative or charging decisions near an election to avoid the perception of partisan motives.\n\nIn 2018, the last year of congressional midterm elections, prosecutors with the US attorney’s office in Manhattan charged two politically sensitive cases in August: one against Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, and another against Chris Collins, then a Republican congressman and early Trump supporter who was up for reelection that year.\n\nIn both cases, prosecutors made their charging decisions with the elections in mind, people familiar with the cases said.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty that August to campaign finance, tax and other charges and completed a three-year prison sentence.

Al.com reported that the Alabama Historical Commission is reviewing reports of nearby residents and an Army archaeologist who raised concerns about items found near a development called Flint Crossing, located in Huntsville near the Flint River. Jeff Benton Homes began building the subdivision last year, but nearby residents reported finding items that could be linked to a former Indian settlement in and around the site. They contacted Ben Hoksbergen, post archaeologist at the U.S. Army’s Redstone Arsenal, who said he informed the developer and the city about the finds in mid-2019. Jeff Benton, owner of Jeff Benton Homes, said in an email the company had no prior knowledge of “significant artifacts” or human burials on the site. But Hoksbergen said he found an assessment conducted by a private archaeological firm in 2010 that showed significant evidence of a Native American village at the site from roughly 500 to 900 AD. People who live near the site have sent him photos of what appeared to be bones, he said. Some bones found at the site were most likely those of deer, Hoksbergen said, but some appeared to be fragments of a human leg bone, skull and teeth. Hoksbergen said he informed the developer and the city the construction might violate laws protecting human burial or historic sites but construction continued. He also told the Alabama Historical Commission, which is conducting a review. The Alabama Historical Commission said it couldn’t comment on an active investigation, but law requires that construction stop if human remains are found at a site. Hoksbergen said an assessment of the site conducted a decade ago by Tennessee Valley Archaeological Research found a large number of artifacts.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Navy will collect public comment about its proposal for permits to again use the Gulf of Alaska for training exercises, a spokeswoman said. “Anytime the Navy wants to do any sort of action, they have to go through an Environmental Impact Statement,” said Julianne Stanford of Navy Region Northwest. Exercise Northern Edge is a major Army, Navy and Air Force exercise held every two years across Alaska, the Juneau Empire reported. The supercarrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and its escorts took part in exercises last year. The public has expressed concern about Navy sonar and explosive ordnance disturbing marine life. The environmental review, Stanford said, is about hearing concerns so that the Navy can avoid negatively affecting marine mammals such as humpback whales, gray whales and Steller sea lions. The Gulf of Alaska has been a training ground for more than three decades, Stanford said, and best practices have been put in place to minimize disruptions. The Navy and regulatory agencies have not noted changes in marine mammals numbers in training areas, she said. “The Navy has developed numerous mitigations that include navigating away from marine mammals, implementing exclusion zones to cease activities or power down and shut down equipment if marine mammals are in proximity to training,” Stanford said.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale:The school board ended its yearslong superintendent search Saturday, unanimously naming Scott Menzel its permanent leader. The decision came after 18 hours of deliberations that started Friday morning. Five groups composed of teachers, students, parents and residents, administrators and staff members in the Scottsdale Unified School District interviewed three finalists and provided feedback to the board. Menzel currently serves as superintendent of the Washtenaw Intermediate School District in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He was one of three finalists who had been narrowed from 29 applicants. The other finalists included Kimberly Guerin, the district’s assistant superintendent of educational services, and Shelley Redinger, superintendent of Spokane (Washington) Public Schools. Menzel has led Washtenaw for eight years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He earned doctorate degrees in philosophy and educational leadership from Eastern Michigan University. He was a finalist in Peoria Unified School District’s superintendent search, which concluded in December. The Scottsdale board deliberated all day Friday and for six hours Saturday about the decision, according to spokeswoman Amy Bolton. The board chose to meet Saturday to ensure continuity of discussions and to not prolong the decision, she said. Current Superintendent John Kriekard’s contract runs through June 30. District officials hope Menzel could begin on July 1. Kriekard came out of retirement to provide the district a steadying hand when Denise Birdwell resigned in April 2018 after more than a year of controversy.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The head of the state lottery said he opposes a measure a group is trying to get on the ballot that would allow thousands of coin-operated “amusement machines” across the state to raise money for the lottery program. Lottery Director Bishop Woosley announced his opposition with the leaders of a group formed to campaign against the constitutional amendment vying for a spot on Arkansas’ ballot. Supporters of the proposal have until July 3 to gather nearly 90,000 signatures from registered voters to qualify for the November election. The amendment would require the lottery to issue 50 licenses to own and lease the machines that would award noncash prizes such as lottery tickets or vouchers for merchandise valued at less than $5. Each licensee would be allowed to operate up to 300 machines. Twenty percent of net receipts from the machines would go toward the state’s lottery. But Woosley said the machines would ultimately result in a loss to the state, with the lottery facing additional costs for licensing and oversight. He also criticized the measure for prohibiting any local limits on the machines. Arcade Arkansas, the group behind the expanded gambling proposal, has raised more than $360,000 and spent nearly $359,000 on its campaign. A spokesman for the group said Woosley was entitled to his opinion but believed opponents were mischaracterizing the proposal, noting it wouldn’t allow cash prizes. The measure is vying for the ballot months after Arkansas implemented a voter-approved amendment legalizing casinos in four counties. Casinos have opened at a West Memphis dog track, a Hot Springs horse track and another location in Pine Bluff under the amendment. Protect Arkansas Communities, a group launched to oppose the proposed amendment, hasn’t received any money from the casinos but has reached out to them, campaign consultant Robert McLarty told reporters.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBrentwood: A bomb used to get rid of gophers might have started a brush fire in a Northern California suburb, authorities told the East Bay Times. The fire that started about 2:30 p.m. Friday burned seven acres in Brentwood in Contra Costa County, Firefighters put out the blaze two hours later, the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District said. If the fire is determined to have been started by a gopher bomb, it would be reminiscent of a scene in the 1980 movie “Caddyshack” in which a frustrated groundskeeper played by Bill Murray used dynamite in a futile effort to get rid of a burrowing rodent. No injuries were reported in connection with the fire. “We would like to take the opportunity to remind everyone to be mindful of their conditions and this early season fire should be a reminder of what can happen very quickly,” the East Contra Costa fire district wrote on Facebook, calling the blaze accidental.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Police are looking for a person who broke into a woman’s apartment and stole her underwear last week – and they are asking anyone with a similar situation to report it. The victim came home from work on Feb. 10 and reported someone had ransacked her apartment and stolen her underwear, according to a news release from police. Police have not identified any suspects. Because of the potential sexual motivation of the crime, police are asking anyone with information or other unreported incidents to come forward. “We know that people typically don’t call police if an item of clothing is missing,” Sgt. Heather Moore, who leads the Crimes Against Persons Unit, said in a video statement. “If you’ve had personal items disappear from your home and you suspect they may have been stolen, please contact police. In any situation that just feels off, trust your instincts and give us a call. Your tip may be our best lead.” Anyone with information is asked to contact officer RJ Tutle at 970-416-2825 or email tipsline@fcgov.com. People who wish to remain anonymous can contact Crime Stoppers of Larimer County at 970-221-6868 or www.stopcriminals.org.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Puerto Rico residents looking to relocate to Connecticut after recent natural disasters are getting financial assistance to help with housing. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday that $75,000 in state funding will be allocated to provide housing support for Puerto Rican residents coming to the state after recent earthquakes on the island territory. Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin told a news conference Friday that when news of natural disasters reaches the state, thousands of residents wonder if their family members are going to be all right. He added that many in Puerto Rico also look to Connecticut as a place of refuge and a possible new home. Connecticut already has a large population of Puerto Rican descent. The money will be used to make security deposits or help with paying rent and will be distributed to nonprofit organizations like Alpha Community Services in Bridgeport, Casa Otoñal in New Haven, and the San Juan Center in Hartford, among others. Housing Commissioner Seila Mosquera-Bruna noted in a release that over the last few years Puerto Rican families have suffered devastating natural disasters including the recent earthquakes. Hurricane Maria – a Category 5 hurricane – struck the island in 2017.\n\nDelaware\n\nMagnolia:A 9-year-old girl stricken with cancer appeared on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Feb. 20, according to the Love 4 Layla Facebook page dedicated to her cancer fight. A preview of the segment posted online showed Layla Mosley and several other children with cancer surprised by an appearance by rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs. Mosley, who is fighting an extremely rare form of bone cancer called Ewing’s Sarcoma, appeared on the program in coordination with Fighting All Monsters, a nonprofit group supporting children facing life-threatening illnesses. The group had been leading an online campaign for Combs to dance with their children. The children even made a dance video to Combs’ “Bad Boy for Life” to entice the entertainer to join them. In the “Ellen” preview clip, Combs surprised the children and Mosley told DeGeneres about how her trip to California had been. “So far it’s been great. I’m just so excited to be here to see you because I watch your show all the time. I love your ‘Game of Games’ show and I just love everything about you,” she tells a smiling DeGeneres, eliciting applause and “aws” from the audience. With eight children seated in front of her, DeGeneres responds with a deadpan joke: “Look, I hate to pick favorites, but she is mine.” When Combs appeared after faking out the audience with a taped video apologizing for not attending, Mosley leapt off the couch and was the first child to run across the stage and jump in his arms. Her segment was apparently filmed on Feb. 19 with Love 4 Layla posting, “She had the most incredible day!! Lots more pictures to come!! Layla is having the best time ever out in Hollywood!”\\ Mosley’s cancer fight isn’t her first. In 2016, she was first diagnosed with metastatic Ewing’s Sarcoma at the age of 5, which affects only about 200 children and young adults in the United States annually. She underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatments at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia for the Stage 4 cancer, completing a 16-month fight. But after two years, she relapsed in May and has been fighting ever since with help from her friends and family, who have set up a GoFundMe page and have held fundraisers and raffles for her.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The DC Board of Elections confirmed that some mailers went out with the wrong primary date, WUSA-TV reported. The correct primary date is June 2. The District actually has two elections coming up before the general election. The primary is first on June 2. A couple of weeks later, on June 16, DC is holding a special election for Jack Evans’ former position, the Ward 2 council seat. The Board of Elections said some people received voter registration cards with a different election date listed. Ladawnae White, a spokeswoman for the D.C. Board of Elections, said some of the cards listed the primary as the third Tuesday in June. White said the mix-up happened, because of an earlier template created before the primary date was changed to June 2. She said the template has been updated to reflect the June 2 date, and all future mailings will have the correct date printed. In a statement released on Twitter, the Board of Elections said in part, “We regret the error and will correct it in all future communications ... We have planned a number of future communications about important events in this election cycle, and voters will be well-informed about when and where to vote.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: A female manatee named Marlin and its calf were rescued after wildlife specialists found them injured in Florida waters. The South Florida Sun Sentinel reported the pair was being treated for wounds and infections at the Miami Seaquarium. The mother was found Saturday with boat strike wounds. The female calf has a wound on her underside. On Tuesday, rescuers initially spotted the mother swimming sideways, which indicates lung damage. On Wednesday, the manatees swam away and disappeared under a low bridge in Fort Lauderdale. After Saturday’s rescue by experts from SeaWorld in Orlando and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, both were started on antibiotics. Marlin will be scheduled for a procedure where veterinarians will drain liquid or air from its chest. The newspaper said boats and other watercraft were the biggest cause of manatee deaths statewide last year, causing at least 136 of the 606 animal deaths.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Health officials said students at Savannah State University have been warned after a rabid bat was found on campus. The Chatham County Health Department said the bat tested positive for rabies after it was taken to a veterinarian. It was found Feb. 18 on the rear porch of the school’s College of Business Administration building. The health department said in a news release it was interviewing students who had contact with the bat to determine whether they needed treatment. Rabies is a potentially fatal disease that can be spread from infected animals to humans through bites, scratches and other contact. Health department officials said people should be aware of the risk of possible rabies exposure before getting close to wild animals such as bats, foxes and raccoons.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Oahu experienced its hottest year on record in 2019, according to federal officials and municipal authorities. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the island reached its highest temperatures last year and the National Weather Service said 273 daily temperature records were tied or broken across the state,Hawaii Public Radio reported Thursday. A separate study by the City and County of Honolulu also found the state experienced its hottest recorded day last year. The city’s Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency performed the first Community Heat Assessment on Aug. 31. The study found the maximum heat index in several Oahu communities was more than 100 degrees, with Waimalu Plaza Shopping Center recording the highest temperature at 107.3. “By all indications, that’s the new normal,” said Josh Stanbro, Honolulu’s chief resilience officer. “So that’s why we have to take action immediately to try to reverse that trend. We have to completely slam on the brakes in terms of burning carbon fuels for our energy source.” Mayor Kirk Caldwell said Wednesday that increasing the city’s tree canopy is expected to help cool communities. City officials advised residents to protect themselves from high temperatures, especially children and the elderly. Honolulu Emergency Services Director Jim Howe urged residents to not leave children or pets in locked cars on hot days and advised surfers and stand-up paddleboarders to drink a liter of water before heading onto the water. “The time you need to be most prepared is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.,” Howe said. “Every one of our lifeguards here knows that when you’re out at the beach, the first place you go is you go for the shade. So you want to stay in the shade and you want to stay well-hydrated.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Companies that are responsible for checking the quality of Idaho’s road materials have altered the results of their asphalt tests thousands of times, government documents showed. Those changes might have allowed contractors that repair and build Idaho’s highway infrastructure to get bonus payments when they should have been penalized for substandard work – or even forced to tear up the asphalt and replace it. For decades, Idaho has paid private contractors to repair and build the state’s vast system of highways, roads and bridges, the Idaho Statesman reported. They are trusted to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars and to ensure the state’s infrastructure is built to last and is safe for drivers. Although roads are under construction, Idaho and other states require contractors to take samples of the asphalt they’re using and run it through a series of tests. Those tests determine whether the asphalt is high quality and the right kind of material for that road. Can it withstand the winter snow and ice in northern Idaho? Can it withstand all the drivers and truckers who travel Interstate 84 in southern Idaho? Front-line workers for several companies involved in road construction throughout Idaho were recorded in 2018 changing their test results before submitting the results to the state for payment, a Statesman analysis of government records found. A Statesman analysis of four highway projects completed in 2018 found that Idaho paid contractors about $8 million, including about $190,000 in bonuses, for asphalt whose test results were altered dozens or hundreds of times. Internal documents from the Idaho Transportation Department say such changes might have allowed construction companies to receive more money than the asphalt was worth. For Idaho taxpayers, that would mean more funds went to private contracting firms and less went to other projects to fix potholes, strengthen highways and improve the state’s crumbling transportation network.\n\nIllinois\n\nBelleville: Cancer-causing chemicals used over the years at Scott Air Force Base in southern Illinois might have leaked into local water supplies, according to a report from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. The state’s EPA said an expanded site inspection is set to begin this summer for signs of the class of substances known collectively as PFAS, which are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they take thousands of years to degrade, the Belleville News-Democrat reported. The newspaper obtained the agency’s report through requesting records under the Freedom of Information Act. U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin said the Air Force contacted his office this month with preliminary details on the contamination at the base and his office has reached out to local elected officials to determine next steps. In recent days, officials started contacting those potentially affected. There is no reason for concern if a person uses tap water from a municipal supply, according to Col. Joseph R. Meyer, vice commander of the 375th Air Mobility Wing at Scott AFB. However, people should worry if they live near the base and drink from a private well. The Air Force Civil Engineer Center is locating and contacting anyone who uses a well within one mile southeast of the base. The center’s officials have identified five people who do so. The Air Force will test well water for PFAS levels, Meyer said. The EPA considers levels below 70 parts per trillion, which equates to roughly a drop of water in an Olympic-sized swimming pool, to be safe for consumption. If tests of well water reveal PFAS levels above EPA standards, individuals who use those wells should immediately stop drinking the water. High levels can cause cancer and birth defects, among other health problems, the EPA said. The Air Force will provide free bottles of water as it develops a long-term solution, Meyer said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An Indiana woman who had given birth just a few days earlier said her instincts kicked in when she stopped along a highway to help save a driver who was on fire after his tanker truck loaded with jet fuel burst into flames. Holly McNally, 35, had just left a hospital’s neointensive care unit Thursday afternoon with her mother after they checked in on her son Connor, who was born Monday. They saw the overturned truck and flames along an Interstate 465 bridge that crosses over Interstate 70 on Indianapolis’ far east side. McNally said she slowed her car and was stunned to see the 59-year-old driver on fire after he managed to get out of the truck on his own. McNally, who has three other children, ages 8, 11 and 15, said that despite the risk to herself, she knew she had to help. Running toward the driver, McNally crossed paths with another man who was bringing a blanket to help extinguish the flames and cover the driver, whose clothes had burned off. As they began walking him away from the fire, an explosion rocked the overturned truck, which the driver told them was loaded with 4,000 gallons of jet fuel. A second explosion then caused the fire to spread and follow the three of them down the embankment. and the driver, who appeared to be in shock, began to slow down. Luckily, another man ran to the embankment and helped move the driver to safety. Another Indiana State Police trooper drove down the highway embankment to meet the three rescuers and the driver. He used clothing from his gym bag to cover the man until emergency medical technicians arrived, Indianapolis Fire Department Battalion Chief Rita Reith said. The driver remained hospitalized in critical condition Friday morning, Reith said. Trucking company Jet Star Inc. released a statement Friday, thanking those who helped save the driver, which it identified as Jeffrey “Duke” Denman.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Dozens of South Sudanese Iowans and allies gathered at the state Capitol on Saturday for a peaceful rally protesting recent violence that left more than 30 dead and 15 children abducted in Abyei, a long disputed region between Sudan and South Sudan. Both countries – that after years of civil war split into independent nations in 2011 – claim the Abyei region in east Africa for ethnic and economic reasons. As a result, clashes between South Sudan’s ethnic Dinkla villages, and Misseriya, a nomadic tribe from Sudan, occur regularly in the region. The United Nations has more than 5,300 peacekeepers – known as the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei – deployed in the region to ease tensions and protect civilians. But on Jan. 22, a suspected Misseriya attack on the Dinkla village of Kolom left at least 32 people dead, dozens wounded and 15 children abducted. Six children have since been recovered. Protesters at Saturday’s rally said children have been abducted and placed into slavery. South Sudan’s government claims the UN failed to protect Kolom and South Sudanese Iowans have expressed anger, as well. During the rally, Abyei community leaders educated attendees on the history of the conflict between Sudan and South Sudan and the status of Abyei. Protesters chanted “Justice, justice for Abyei! Justice, justice for Kolom! Shame, shame UNISFA! Abyei is bleeding and the world is watching!” Some held signs showing graphic images reportedly from the attack last month.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Lawmakers are considering blocking the sale of raw milk or requiring farmers to include warning labels on packaging after the state abandoned a law prohibiting farmers from advertising raw milk outside their farm. The state stopped enforcing the ban after Shepherd’s Gate Dairy operators Mark and Coraleen Bunner filed a lawsuit against the state in October, The Wichita Eagle reported. Attorney General Derek Schmidt and the state Department of Agriculture settled the lawsuit in November resulting in the end of the ban. Schmidt admitted the law was “plainly unconstitutional.” Pasteurized milk undergoes a heating process to kill pathogens. Raw milk that comes straight from a cow or goat is much more likely to carry salmonella, E. coli and other bacteria, according to the Food and Drug Administration. But those who drink and sell raw milk think of it as an all-natural product that brings people closer to the source of their food. The Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee endorsed a bill Thursday that would allow the on-farm sale of raw, unpasteurized milk, so long as each container sold labels it as such. It goes next to the Senate for debate, possibly next week. It remains unknown how the Legislature as a whole would vote. A bill to ban the sale of raw milk have also been proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:Gov. Andy Beshear signed legislation Friday to require that law enforcement officers carry weapons when assigned to provide security at schools. The measure won strong bipartisan support in the legislature. It’s a follow-up to last year’s sweeping school safety law stemming from a 2018 fatal school shooting in Kentucky. Beshear had until Friday to either sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. In announcing his decision, the governor repeated concerns that the bill’s supporters made for arming school officers – that other law officers couldn’t respond quickly enough to a school shooting. Beshear said he considers the presence of armed officers at schools as a potential deterrent. Republican Sen. Max Wise, the bill’s lead sponsor, said the governor’s action signing the measure into law will go down as an “incredibly important day” for the state. The measure is crucial to the state’s efforts to bolster school safety, Wise said. Last year’s school safety law did not specify whether school police officers – known as school resource officers – needed to carry a weapon. The issue of arming school-based officers has sparked intense debate in the state’s largest school district, which includes Louisville. Beshear said Friday he hopes concerns about arming school officers can be alleviated through the officers’ training.Executive Cabinet Secretary J. Michael Brown said Beshear’s administration welcomes suggestions from the bill’s critics on shaping curriculum and training for school officers. The school safety efforts are in response to the 2018 shooting at Marshall County High School in western Kentucky, where two 15-year-old students, Bailey Holt and Preston Cope, were killed and more than a dozen others were injured when another student opened fire.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state can soon start spending $1.2 billion in federal cash to fortify communities against future flood risks, after the governor’s office announced Friday that federal officials have approved the state’s plan for the funds. The dollars, overseen by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, will bolster an effort that Gov. John Bel Edwards has pushed since the 2016 floods to use regional approaches to flood mitigation and drainage improvements around Louisiana. “HUD’s approval of our plan confirms that Louisiana is headed in the right direction,” Edwards said in a statement. “We have taken proactive steps and served as a blueprint for other states preparing their own flood mitigation plans to use these federal funds in ways that prioritize data, science and regional collaboration to build resilience in the face of future flooding.” The federal aid will be spread across projects in 46 Louisiana parishes identified through the governor’s Louisiana Watershed Initiative as most flood-prone and impacted by water. Edwards’ office said the state expects the federal dollars to be available by the spring.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: Seasonal ferry service between Maine and Nova Scotia is scheduled to resume this summer. Bay Ferries, the Canadian ferry company, said service is expected to begin by June 26, the Bangor Daily News reported Friday. The Cat, a high-speed catamaran, will sail between Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, to Bar Harbor until Labor Day, said Bay Ferries CEO Mark MacDonald. Crossings will then run six days a week – every day but Wednesdays –until the season ends on Oct. 13. The ferry company has to finish its $6.5 million renovation of a Bar Harbor terminal before service can resume, MacDonald said. The company needs to finish installing U.S. Customs and Border inspection booths and renovating the interior of the building.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:Salisbury University said a suspect has been identified in the investigation into racist graffiti on campus, but that person’s identity has yet to be made public. The case is being referred to the Wicomico County state’s attorney’s office for prosecution, according to a Friday news release. The only identifying information about the suspect released so far is that the person is not believed to have an “immediate connection to the campus.” The release does not state if the person is a suspect in one or multiple incidents. The investigation began after the discovery in October and November of vandalism in Fulton Hall involving racist and sexually explicit language that escalated to a threat of violence. More racist graffiti was found on campus on Feb. 19, first in Henson Hall and then in Fulton Hall. That same day the university announced the FBI had been aiding campus police in the open investigations. Administrators canceled classes Thursday for a day of healing, during which various gatherings were scheduled to support students and faculty.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNorton: Authorities have identified a man killed in what authorities said appears to be an explosion caused by a meth lab in Massachusetts. The Bristol County District Attorney’s Office identified the man on Sunday as 38-year-old Edward Rooney. Authorities said Rooney died Saturday after an apparent meth lab explosion in his Norton apartment. Police said they were called to the apartment complex around 1 a.m. and found damage believed to have been caused by the explosion. Police said Rooney had fled the home before first responders arrived. A short time later, authorities were called to an Attleboro home to help a man who was experiencing a medical emergency, officials said. Authorities said residents of the home were awoken in the middle of the night by a man outside who was screaming for help. Officials said the residents let Rooney inside the home, where he collapsed. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.\n\nMichigan\n\nVanderbilt: The state’s 108,000-acre Pigeon River Country State Forest is getting a nearly 600-acre addition in a land deal valued at more than $2 million, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources. The property purchase, completed last month, added the Elk Forest at Black River, which is in Montmorency County, to the state’s public lands. The area is surrounded on three sides by existing state-managed land and includes public access to Walled Lake. The money came from the state’s Forest Legacy Program with matching funds from the agency’s Land Exchange Facilitation Fund and a $75,000 donation from the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, according to state officials. “This spectacular place adds a gem to the crown of Michigan’s public lands,” said Debbie Begalle, DNR forest resources division chief, in a statement. “The land will be open for hiking, hunting, fishing, elk viewing, skiing, snowshoeing, bird watching, mushroom hunting and berry picking, to name just a few activities.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis:The state on Friday shut down a metal recycling company where a fire burned for days and sent up plumes of smoke. The state cited “imminent and substantial danger” to the public, the Star Tribune reported. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued an administrative order prohibiting Northern Metal Recycling from accepting any scrap metal at its plant in Becker, the site of the fire. The order also prohibits the company from accepting scrap metal at its previous facility in north Minneapolis, where it still has many junked cars stored. On Friday, Gov. Tim Walz said he is considering placing a30-day hold on Northern Metal’s recycling permit. Speaking at a forum organized by the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs, Walz said he is looking at ways to hold Northern Metal responsible for pollution caused by last week’s fire. Walz told the audience that he does not trust Northern Metal “to do the right thing,” KMSP-TV reported. The Democratic governor said state regulators would make the decision on a 30-day hold. On Feb. 11, a week before the fire erupted, fire inspectors cited Northern Metal’s former facility in north Minneapolis for a variety of code violations related to its outdoor storage practices, the Star Tribune reported, citing inspection records. A state fire marshal investigator was at the scene Friday. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Police said Thursday that firefighters had the blaze under control, but the fire flared late Thursday, sending more smoke over Becker. Classes in Becker were canceled Thursday but resumed Friday. On Friday, police said firefighting efforts have been turned over to a private company hired by Northern Metal. The fire has been reduced to a few smoldering areas and could be extinguished by the end of the weekend, police said. Residents of the city of 4,500 people have not been asked to evacuate but should stay away from the immediate area of the fire, police said. Becker is about 50 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Northern Metal moved its shredding operation from Minneapolis to Becker last year after the Pollution Control Agency ordered it shut down because of high levels of air pollution and inaccurately recorded pollution.\n\nMississippi\n\nSatartia:Authorities said they’re testing the air quality after a pipe ruptured, prompting the evacuations of more than 300 residents and sending dozens of people to hospitals. The Mississippi Department of Emergency Management said 46 people were treated at area hospitals after the Saturday night rupture, but all of them had been released by late Sunday morning. Authorities said the 24-inch pressurized pipe ruptured in a heavily wooded area near Satartia, about 40 miles northwest of Jackson. They said the pipe contained carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide and that residents in the area complained of green gas and a noxious odor. Residents were expected to be able to return to their homes soon, emergency officials said in an update late Sunday morning. It appears the ground caved into a ravine, damaging the 24-inch pipe, the state agency said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Missouri might have shed its unwanted image as the meth lab capital of the U.S., but the dangerous and addictive drug remains a major problem, a top Drug Enforcement Administration official said Friday. The depth of the problem became clear Thursday when the DEA announced a methamphetamine crackdown called Operation Crystal Shield, which will focus on eight “transportation hubs” where high levels of Mexican meth are being seized. The St. Louis Division, which covers all of Missouri and Kansas as well as southern Illinois, is the northernmost of the eight targeted areas. The others are Atlanta, Dallas, El Paso, Texas, Houston, Los Angeles, New Orleans and Phoenix. The targeted DEA divisions accounted for more than 75% of all meth seizures last year. The St. Louis Division includes hundreds of miles of major roadways through the three states, including interstates 35, 70, 44 and 55, providing a pipeline not only to the central U.S. but the upper Midwest and the Northeast. William J. Callahan, special agent in charge of the St. Louis Division, said the targeted operation will allow better coordination of intelligence about trafficking routes, the types of vehicles being used, and other information. For many years, meth was a two-pronged problem: Much of it came from Mexico, but thousands of users across the U.S. made their own drug in home labs or by mixing the dangerous concoction in a 2-liter soda bottle. In 2004, more than 24,000 meth labs were seized across the U.S., including nearly 3,000 in Missouri, which for years was atop the list of states for lab seizures.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. Interior Department officials are seeking to bolster their case for easing restrictions on energy development, mining and grazing in Western states inhabited by a declining bird species. A federal judge in Idaho blocked Trump administration plans last year over concerns that they could harm greater sage grouse, a ground-dwelling bird. Assistant Interior Secretary Casey Hammond said a new set of environmental studies published Friday clarified the steps the government will take to conserve the bird’s habitat. The Interior Department opened a 45-day public comment period on the studies that cover millions of acres of public lands in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Oregon and California. Sage grouse have been in decline for decades because of habitat loss and other factors, and their numbers dropped sharply last year across much of their range. Sage grouse territory in Montana, Washington and the Dakotas was not impacted by the proposed changes. The legal dispute over the administration’s proposal is before Judge B. Lynn Winmill In Idaho. The case dates to 2016, when environmental groups sued the Obama administration over a previous set of rules that they described as insufficient to protect grouse from heading toward extinction.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The U.S. Department of Transportation said it’s awarding $10.7 million in airport safety and infrastructure grants to 18 airports in Nebraska. The grants include $750,000 to go to parking lot improvements and construction of an access road at Blair Municipal Airport. The department is sending Lincoln Airport $360,000 to buy snow removal equipment and $450,000 to update the airport master plan. Hartington Municipal Airport is getting $549,000 for runway rehabilitation, and Hebron Municipal Airport will receive $315,000 to fund the sealing of apron pavement surface and joints, plus the sealing of taxiway pavement.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Four Nevada firefighters recently returned from Australia, and three more will be deployed in the coming weeks to help with fire suppression efforts, according to the Bureau of Land Management. Firefighters Brian Holmes, Eric Tilden and Joe Miller returned to Nevada on Feb. 5. Another firefighter, Justin Cutler, also returned on Feb. 10, officials said in a news release. Holmes, who usually serves as an engine captain in the Southern Nevada District, worked as a task force leader and crew member in Australia. Tilden, a fire helicopter supervisor in the Elko District, also served as a task force leader and crew member. Miller, an air tank base manager at the Battle Mountain District, served also served as an air tanker base manager in Australia. He also provided other aviation assistance, officials said. Cutler, an assistant superintendent for the Silver State Hotshots based out of Carson City, served as an aerial tactical supervisor. The BLM also deployed two more firefighters to Australia, and three more will be sent in a few weeks. In total, 11 firefighters were deployed to assist in the fire suppression efforts. The two firefighters who were recently deployed and the three others expected to fly oversees are set to return in March. Since 2000, Australia has deployed fire management specialists six times to the United States. Meanwhile, the U.S. has sent firefighters and fire managers to help with the fire season in Australia four times since 2003. The two countries have exchanged techniques, policies, and information as far back as 1964.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: State wildlife officials warn that bears are more active this winter because of mild weather combined with limited snowfall. New Hampshire Fish and Game officers said bears are encouraged to remain active because of the amount of available food, WMUR-TV reported Friday. Bears typically hibernate from November to April, but in a mild winter, that period can be shortened to December or January until March. “Bears aren’t actually true hibernators,” said Daniel Bergeron, of New Hampshire Fish and Game. “So, they can wake and go back out and get food and go back in and den up for an extended period of time. So just because they’re up doesn’t mean they’re up for good.” Vermont wildlife officials voiced similar concerns about bear activity earlier this month. Wildlife officials in New Hampshire and Vermont have recommended moving any potential outdoor food sources to prevent attracting bears.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Wildlife authorities and utility officials have been taking aim at one of the leading killers of bald eagles in New Jersey – electrocution on power lines. There is growing concern about protecting the endangered birds from getting electrocuted by power lines when they nest in suburban and urban areas following a spike in the eagle population, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Between 2015 and 2019, electrocution was the top cause of death of raptors found injured or killed, according to data compiled in annual reports by the New Jersey Bald Eagle Project, a partnership overseen by the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife and Conserve Wildlife Foundation. In addition to the 34 eagle deaths, crashes into vehicles left 29 eagles dead and fights with other eagles killed 14. The cause of 29 other deaths remains unknown, and officials said some deaths are undocumented.Kathleen Clark, supervising zoologist for the state’s Division of Fish and Wildlife, said an electrocuted 4-year-old eagle was found on a recent Sunday near Pickle Factory Pond in Belleplain State Forest. Cristina Frank, a biologist and raptor specialist who manages avian protection for Atlantic City Electric, said utilities can’t realistically bury all distribution lines, so they install protective equipment or build-in protections on new lines. The measures can include cross-arms on existing lines to spread wires farther apart, insulated conductors, or covering energized or grounded equipment. Some utilities also install barriers to prevent birds from perching and mark lines with colored tape or reflectors to warn birds from flying into them.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The funeral service for Sgt. 1st. Class Antonio Rey Rodriguez of Las Cruces, who was killed in action on Feb. 8 while serving in Afghanistan, was held Friday afternoon at Cathedral of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. There wasn’t an empty seat in the church as hundreds of residents, military members and veterans joined Rodriguez’s family and close friends to honor the fallen hero. Students from Valley View Elementary, which is across the street from the church, also paid tribute to the soldier before and after the ceremony by waving American flags. During the service, Rodriguez was described by many as a hero, warrior, an inspiration and a child of God who gave the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and to save others. Rodriguez, 28, was born and raised in Las Cruces and was affectionately known as “Rod.” He graduated from Mayfield High School in 2009. According to the Department of Defense, a Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha from 7th Special Forces Group was ambushed in Afghanistan on Feb. 8 by a rogue Afghan policeman in the Sherzad district of Nangarhar Province, located in eastern Afghanistan. It resulted in the deaths of two American operators, including Rodriguez and Sgt. 1st Class Javier Jaguar Gutierrez of San Antonio. Six others were wounded. Rodriguez joined the Army in October 2009, according to a news release from U.S. Army Special Operations Command. After completing the Basic Airborne Course and the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program, he was assigned to the 3rd Ranger Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment. He deployed eight times with the 75th Ranger Regiment and twice with 3rd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) in support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, part of the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. During his military service, Rodriguez earned the Bronze Star Medal-2, Joint Service Commendation Medal-1, and Expert and Combat Infantryman Badge. Rodriguez posthumously earned the Purple Heart, Combat Action Badge, Bronze Star Medal (1 OLC) and Meritorious Service Medal.\n\nNew York\n\nWest Nyack: An Orthodox Jewish man credited as a hero for attacking a knife-wielding man who stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration north of New York City is refusing to take a $20,000 reward from established Jewish groups because he considers them Zionists, according to a rabbi who knows him. Officials with the Jewish Federation and the Anti-Defamation League told The Journal News that they were caught off guard by Josef Gluck’s decision to turn down the reward, the newspaper reported Friday. “The reward would have been for anybody who offered information that would lead to an arrest,” said Miriam Allenson, spokesperson for the Jewish Federation & Foundation of Rockland County. “That was what was on our minds.” Allenson said that there were no strings with the money and that the groups had “no idea” regarding Gluck’s decision to turn away the funds. The reward presentation event was scheduled for Feb. 6, but Gluck said he had a family emergency, Allenson said. Rabbi Dovid Feldman of Monsey said Gluck’s decision stems from the discomfort he and some other Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox Jews have with organizations like the Jewish Federation and Anti-Defamation League. Feldman said Gluck was preparing to notify the groups in writing to explain in more detail his reasons for declining the reward. Rabbi Feldman is a leader of Neturei Karta International. Its Orthodox Jewish members believe “the entire concept of a sovereign Jewish state is contrary to Jewish Law.” Gluck is credited with throwing his body in front of the machete-wielding man and using a wooden table to try and stop the Dec. 28 assault in Monsey, the newspaper reported. He then lured the attacker outside and documented the attacker’s license plate number and alerted police.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: The body of a 6-month-old boy who had been reported missing has been found in a North Carolina cemetery and his mother is under arrest, authorities said Saturday. Law enforcement officials said the body of Chi-Liam Cody Brown-Erickson was found about 4 a.m. Saturday at Sharon Memorial Park in Charlotte. The boy’s body was found about six hours after Tamara Jernel Brown, 30, was arrested by Charlotte police for common law robbery and two counts of assault on a government official. She reportedly refused to tell police where her son was. Brown and the boy had been reported missing Thursday night. Authorities had said before Brown’s arrest that she might be suffering from a mental health disability and was last seen walking in uptown Charlotte around noon Friday\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Bismarck Park Board has voted to keep the name of Custer Park, despite efforts to change it because of the eponym’s history with Native Americans. Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer fought against Native Americans on the Great Plains in the 1860s and 1870s. Two Bismarck women led the effort to change the name. Three Affiliated Tribes member M. Angel Moniz said that to some, Custer is a reminder of violence and genocide. The Bismarck Tribune said commissioners Thursday adopted a formal process to rename city parks and to install an educational marker at Custer Park. Under the new process, there can’t be another proposal to rename Custer Park for 15 years. In 1868, Custer launched an attack on Chief Black Kettle’s Southern Cheyenne Village near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma, in which Native American women were raped and killed in an assault known as the Washita Massacre. Custer spent several years stationed at Fort Abraham Lincoln in Mandan before his death..\n\nOhio\n\nMassillon: A family thinks an unmarked grave might hold the answer to the mystery of a relative’s disappearance 50 years ago. Russell Brunner was 31 when he disappeared from his home at the former Massillon State Hospital in 1970, where he had been committed as a teen because of a diagnosis of schizophrenia, his sister, Rita Tod, told The Repository. Although the hospital allegedly told his family that Brunner had been discharged, a body was found in 1972 in a barn on the grounds where Brunner worked, the paper said. Although the coroner at the time apparently suspected the body was Brunner’s, the coroner didn’t identify him as Brunner and the body was declared an “unknown male” before it was buried in the city cemetery in Massillon in northeastern Ohio, according to The Repository. Brunner was known to have worked in the same barn, the remains fit his description and state hospital-issued items were found on the body, the paper said. An investigation into existing records by The Repository along with its interviews with Brunner’s surviving siblings indicated the body is most likely Brunner and that he died by killing himself. The current county coroner agreed with the paper’s findings. Because there was no evidence of foul play, the family would need a court order to exhume the remains and would have to pay that cost and any testing, the coroner said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed one regent on Friday to the governing boards of each of the state’s top two public universities. Stitt named Anita Holloway of accounting firm Ernst & Young to the University of Oklahoma Board of Regents, which oversees OU, Cameron University in Lawton and Rogers State University in Claremore. He also named western Oklahoma rancher and banker Jimmy Harrel to the Oklahoma A&M Colleges Board of Regents, which oversees Oklahoma State University and four other regional universities. Both appointments will require Senate confirmation. Holloway replaces outgoing OU Regent Leslie Rainbolt-Forbes, whose term ends March 21. Harrel replaces Lou Watkins, whose term ends in April. Rainbolt-Forbes served as chair of the OU Board of Regents during an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against longtime OU President David Boren, who retired in 2018.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The main Oregon highway connecting Salem and Bend reopened Saturday after a tanker crash and gas spill forced a weeklong closure. The double tanker trunk spilled an estimated 7,800 gallons of petroleum products into the soil at the crash site east of Idanha, the Statesman Journal newspaper in Salem reported. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality said in a prepared statement that water quality tests done on the North Santiam River show the concentration of petroleum levels is below federal safe drinking water levels except for in the immediate vicinity of the crash. The agency said there is no impact to nearby cities’ drinking water, and workers will continue to test the water quality in the area periodically. Cleanup crews dug up and hauled away about 6,200 tons of contaminated soil. Workers also added a new guardrail near the site of the crash. The area has had two major tanker crashes and spills into the North Santiam River in the last three years.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nChambersburg:A military repair depot in central Pennsylvania has announced plans to lay off or reassign hundreds of contract employees because of an anticipated decrease in workload. Letterkenny Army Depot said the reduction will affect 323 contract personnel, nearly half of its contract positions. Up to 75 positions will be cut on or about March 10, and up to 248 additional workers will lose their jobs by September, although some workers could be reassigned. Officials said the reduction will affect about 15% of its total workforce of approximately 2,200 employees. Spokeswoman Lisa Baker said nearly one-third of all employees are contract personnel, while the others are federal employees. Letterkenny, which is north of Chambersburg, is one of Franklin County’s top employers, with workers repairing tactical missile systems, route clearance vehicles, electrical generators and other items. Letterkenny Munitions Center on the depot stores rockets and ammunition.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s motor vehicles division is temporarily opening its headquarters on some Saturdays so residents can upgrade their driver’s license to meet federal requirements that will affect air travel. The Cranston office will be open from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on select Saturdays of each month, as the October deadline for the federal REAL ID program approaches. Appointments must be made online first. Current Rhode Island licenses aren’t compliant with the federal program, which was enacted after the Sept. 11 attacks to strengthen rules for identification. The federal law requires state driver’s licenses and ID cards to have security enhancements and to be issued to people who can prove they are legally in the United States. Beginning in October, noncompliant IDs won’t be sufficient for boarding a plane or entering secure federal facilities or military bases. The weekend service is limited to REAL ID transactions for those obtaining or renewing passenger-vehicle driver licenses and state IDs. Appointments for commercial driver license services, including REAL ID, are available on weekdays.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The Coast Guard plans to consolidate its facilities across the South Carolina coast to an old naval shipyard near Charleston and plans to base national security vessels at the new site, Adm. Karl Schultz said. The moves are linked with dredging of Charleston Harbor, which when competed in 2021 will make it the deepest harbor on the East Coast. The Coast Guard is looking to add three national security cutters to the two already stationed in Charleston and also place a group of offshore patrol cutters that might soon be built, Shultz said. That could double the Coast Guard population in the area to about 2,000 people, Shultz said. “A community like Charleston understands just how important our defense contributions are to the nation. And for generations, the people of this great port city have also appreciated the importance of maritime commerce to our nation,” Shultz said. The Coast Guard has property in Charleston from the tip of the city’s peninsula through North Charleston. They will all be consolidated at the old Naval Shipyard in North Charleston on the Cooper River, Shultz said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:The city plans a makeover at its namesake park, and officials hope infusing some friendly competition between companies in the architecture and design world will lift the project to new heights. In the last two decades, the city has added dozens of acres to the boundaries of Falls Park through land acquisitions and parcel redevelopment. And it has become the destination for hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. That’s why officials with the Parks and Recreation Department said the walkways and layout of the pedestrian elements of the park campus are no longer adequate and need to be upgraded. With that in mind, City Hall last week announced it will use a design competition to gather ideas for expanding and improving the infrastructure at Falls Park in the coming years. A design competition is an alternative to a more typical process used by the city, where one architecture firm is hired to create a design before a construction company is hired. Instead, the city will put out a call for designs in hopes of spurring wide-ranging ideas for how to improve and enhance the park. Eventually, all ideas the city receives will be considered by a selection committee before the architects with the best four ideas will each be given a $10,000 stipend to continue working through their concepts and even incorporate other ideas the city in the first phase of the competition. The winning design elements could see implementation through construction as early as 2021.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:Federal authorities conducted searches Friday at the home and business addresses of Democratic state Sen. Katrina Robinson, the FBI said. FBI spokesman Joel Siskovic confirmed that agents executed search warrants at two locations in Memphis. They are listed as addresses for Robinson’s residence and her nursing school, Healthcare Institute Inc. The FBI declined to discuss any additional details of the searches and the U.S. attorney’s office in Memphis said it “will not comment on the nature or progress of any FBI activities before charges are publicly filed.” No one responded Friday to a knock on the door of the school, which sits in a strip mall in southeast Memphis. Robinson didn’t immediately return phone and email messages seeking comment. Her legislative office forwarded a request to a Senate Democratic Caucus spokesman. “We’ve been made aware of the investigation and have received no indication that it relates to the legislature or her legislative service,”said Brandon Puttbrese, spokesman for the Senate Democratic Caucus. “Because the investigation is ongoing, we will not be making additional statements and will defer any further questions to Sen. Robinson’s attorney.” Puttbrese also said the caucus’ thoughts are with Robinson and her family. Robinson was elected to the state Senate out of a Memphis district in 2018. Edward L. Stanton II of Butler Snow LLP emailed a statement saying only that he had been retained by Robinson “in connection with today’s events.” The school’s website said it received a $1.6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a certified nursing assistant program focused on geriatric populations and educational programs. The school was founded in January 2015. Its certified nursing assistant program was introduced that July. The school also includes phlebotomy and electrocardiographic technician instruction.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Saba: A man fatally stabbed three people, including a 13-year-old girl, Friday before leading officers on a car chase and eventually being arrested, police said. Sheriff’s deputies in San Saba, a community of about 3,000 people 100 miles northwest of Austin, received a call around 4:30 a.m. from an 18-year-old woman who said she was one of four people stabbed inside a home, said Sgt. Bryan Washko of the Texas Department of Public Safety. Officers arrived to find a 62-year-old man, a 44-year-old woman and the girl dead, Washko said. He could not provide the names of the victims or the 22-year-old suspect. He also said it’s unclear how they are connected and that no motive is known at this point. The Texas Rangers were investigating. The girl was a seventh-grade student at a local school, which was open and offering counseling, said San Saba Independent School District Superintendent Wayne Kelly. “It’s hit us pretty hard, “ Kelly said. ”When there are only 200 kids in the junior high they tend to know each other.” Kelly described the stabbings as a “domestic situation” but said he could not elaborate. He declined to name the student. Moments after the stabbings, Washko said, the suspect fled in a car belonging to one of the victims. Police gave chase and followed him for 20 miles into the city of Goldthwaite, where he crashed into the wall of a senior citizen center and was arrested, he said. No one, including the suspect, was injured in the crash. Anthony Wayne Pierce was being held Friday in the Mills County jail in connection to the stabbings, jail employee Disa Purcell said. She said the 22-year-old is charged with aggravated assault on a public servant and evading arrest, and that more charges could be filed. The woman who survived the stabbing was hospitalized in critical condition, Washko said.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: A proposed public park and nature reserve on the shores of Utah Lake would provide restoration habitat for ospreys, bald eagles and waterfowl, as well as walking trails, fishing spots and bird-watching towers. The 1,000-acre park would be nestled between Provo, Orem and Vineyard on land where Ute Chief Colorow Ignacio Ouray Walkara once brought his tribe to hunt and fish, the Daily Herald newspaper in Provo reported last week. A coalition of 25 government entities, civic groups and private landowners are working on a proposal they’re calling the Walkara Way Project. They plan to ask state lawmakers for $5.6 million for the project. The park has been discussed for a long time and would be a great place for families to enjoy nature, said Doug Robins, assistant director of the Provo Parks and Recreation Department. The plans call for 2.8 miles of trails, towers so people can watch bald eagles, and fishing areas and picnic areas. The trails would connect with other regional trail systems. The area where the park and preserve would be created is commonly known as the Powell Slough. Jake Holdaway, whose family has owned much of the land, said his family will get cattle grazing rights for perpetuity. He said that cows are the best way to keeping weeds from overgrowing. Taxpayer money is now used to mow the weeds or spray them with weed killer. Holdaway is planning on building an education center for children.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: Concerns from the Federal Aviation Administration that a five-story hotel planned for the Burlington International Airport could interfere with the airport’s radar system is forcing developers to relocate the proposed hotel. The FAA’s objection came as officials were preparing to begin construction of the hotel, planned for near the entrance to the South Burlington airport. Airport planners are now hoping to build the $14 million hotel just north of the airport’s parking garage on what is now a parking lot. MyNBC5.com reported the new site is larger, allowing for a slightly larger hotel with about 110 rooms, conference space and a limited service bar and restaurant. Airport officials said they hope for expedited approval from the FAA and local design review boards in order to begin construction this summer.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Dominion Energy said a reduction in fuel rates should save its Virginia customers an average of $6 a month later this year under a new proposal. The state’s largest electricity supplier announced Friday that a proposed fuel rate adjustment would result in roughly a 5% reduction in the average residential bill. Industrial customers would see an even greater rate drop of about 10% because the fuel rate makes up a bigger part of a typical industrial bill. The reduction would go into effect May 1 if approved by the State Corporation Commission. Dominion said that improved efficiency at its natural gas plants and increased solar generation are fueling the rate drop.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Spring chinook salmon could return on the Columbia River in the second-lowest numbers in 21 years, according to Washington state Department of Fish and Wildlife. This year’s forecasted return of 81,700 upriver spring chinook is up 12% from last year’s return of 73,100, which was the lowest since 1999, the News Tribune in Tacoma reported Sunday. The record low return was just 12,000 fish in 1995. The projected return this year is just 43% of the 10-year average for chinook returning to hatcheries and spawning areas upriver from the Bonneville Dam. Poor ocean conditions continue to play a significant role in lower projected returns, said Ryan Lothrop, Columbia River policy coordinator for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. New fishing regulations for the Columbia River – from about 6 miles below the The Dalles Dam upstream to the Oregon and Washington state line above McNary Dam – set the season at April 1 through May 5. Anglers can retain either two hatchery steelhead or a hatchery chinook and a hatchery steelhead per day. Hatchery fish have a clipped adipose fin, which is just above the tail fin. Barbless hooks will be required. The expected harvest is about 340 adult chinook above the Bonneville Dam and 2,500 below it. Fishing regulations have yet to be set for this year for spring chinook on the Snake River, but the catch is expected to be similarly constrained.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: President Donald Trump has increased the federal share of costs to help West Virginia recover from floods that ravaged the state in June 2016. Gov. Jim Justice’s office said Friday that Trump approved his request to increase the federal share from 75% to 90% for public assistance projects. A recent award of $131.7 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to rebuild two Nicholas County schools helped the state meet the threshold for a cost-share increase, the governor’s office said. Covered costs include emergency expenses, debris removal and infrastructure repair. The increase falls under a major disaster declaration by former President Barack Obama in 2016 after the floods killed 23 people and damaged hundreds of buildings in the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOnalaska:Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, will stop in Wisconsin for a campaign event in March. The Pences will be in Onalaska, near La Crosse, at noon March 5 for a “Women for Trump” event at the Stoney Creek Hotel and Conference Center, 3060 S. Kinney Coulee Road. They will also appear later that day at an event in St. Paul, Minnesota. Mike Pence held a rally last month at the Wisconsin State Capitol to promote private voucher and charter schools.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: Yellowstone National Park plans to replace dozens of decades-old trailers used by park workers, part of an initiative to upgrade employee housing. About half of the Yellowstone’s 800 employees live in park housing, according to park spokeswoman Morgan Warthin. She described the quality of the accommodations as “fair to poor.” Over the next two years, park administrators plan to replace 64 trailers built between 1960 and 1983 with cabin-style modular houses. The number of new houses has not been determined. They would be placed in already-developed areas. The park also plans to add new housing, rehabilitate historic homes in Fort Yellowstone and other areas, and upgrade 150 nontrailer housing units, including with new flooring and better insulation and heating systems. Warthin told Montana Public Radio that there’s not enough housing, and the housing crunch hurts workforce recruitment as park visitation has jumped 45% since the year 2000. Costs for the work will run into the tens of millions of dollars, with funding coming from 2020 federal appropriations legislation, Yellowstone administrators said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/joe-biden-nancy-pelosi-taiwan-china/index.html", "title": "Biden administration working behind the scenes to convince Pelosi ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNational security officials are quietly working to convince House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of the risks her potential trip to Taiwan could pose during a highly sensitive moment between the self-governing island and China.\n\nSources familiar with the speaker’s plans say she is planning to visit in the coming weeks as part of a broader trip to Asia and has invited both Democrats and Republicans to accompany her. If she goes, she would be the first House speaker to visit in a quarter century.\n\nThe possible trip is highlighting the concerns within President Joe Biden’s administration over China’s designs on Taiwan as Beijing has stepped up its rhetoric and aggressive actions toward the island in recent months, including sending warplanes into Taiwan’s self-declared air defense identification zone several times. US officials have expressed concern that those moves could be precursors to even more aggressive steps by China in the coming months meant to assert its authority over the island.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has only intensified those worries, as Biden and other top officials nervously watch to see what lessons China may be taking from the Western response to Russia’s aggression.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s President Xi Jinping – with whom Biden expects to speak this week – is believed to be laying the groundwork for an unprecedented third term as president in the fall, contributing to the tense geopolitics in the region. Biden’s call with Xi was in the works before Pelosi’s potential visit to Taiwan became public, officials noted.\n\nAdministration officials have shared their concerns not only about Pelosi’s security during the trip, but also worries about how China may respond to such a high-profile visit. With China recently reporting its worst economic performance in two years, Xi finds himself in a politically sensitive place ahead of an important meeting regarding extending his reign and could use a political win, multiple officials told CNN.\n\nWhile Biden’s aides have ideas about how he could potentially respond, they aren’t sure which direction the Chinese leader will choose.\n\nIt is against that highly charged backdrop that Pelosi has proposed visiting Taiwan with a congressional delegation, a trip that she has so far declined to confirm publicly. But that has not stopped China from lashing out, saying a visit would violate US policy toward the island.\n\nChina’s Ministry of National Defense on Tuesday said Pelosi’s trip should be canceled, warning that China’s military would “resolutely defend national sovereignty” if faced with “external forces” encouraging Taiwanese independence.\n\n“China demands the US take concrete actions to fulfill its commitment not to support ‘Taiwan independence’ and not to arrange for Pelosi to visit Taiwan,” Ministry of Defense Spokesperson Tan Kefei said Tuesday in response to questions over Pelosi’s reported trip to Taipei.\n\n“If the US insists on taking its own course, the Chinese military will never sit idly by, and it will definitely take strong actions to thwart any external force’s interference and separatist’s schemes for ‘Taiwan independence,’ and resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Tan added.\n\nBecause Pelosi is in the presidential line of succession, the administration takes extra care for her security when she travels overseas, the White House said Tuesday.\n\nThat includes establishing a footprint on the ground based on the location and environment, sometimes using military resources, according to John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the National Security Council.\n\n“We take those obligations seriously,” Kirby said, even as he reiterated Pelosi has not announced any travel plans to visit Taiwan.\n\nAdministration lays out the risks for Pelosi\n\nBehind the scenes, Biden administration officials have been working to spell out the potential risks of a visit in meetings with Pelosi and her team.\n\nPentagon officials briefed the speaker last week about Taiwan and the heightened tensions in the region, according to people familiar with the matter. White House officials were also present for the briefing.\n\nThe President let slip last week that the US military was opposed to Pelosi visiting Taiwan now, but the White House has refused to expand on his comments. Even Pelosi said during a news conference last week that she wasn’t sure precisely what Biden meant.\n\n“I think what the President was saying is that maybe the military was afraid of my plane of getting shot down or something like that. I don’t know exactly,” she said.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday it was providing Pelosi information about her potential travel.\n\n“I’ll let the speaker talk about her travel plans. Our job is, of course, to make sure she has all the context and information before she travels anywhere. But that kind of rhetoric coming out of the Chinese side is clearly unhelpful and not necessary,” Kirby said on CNN’s “New Day.”\n\n“There’s no call for that kind of escalatory rhetoric,” Kirby added. “Again, none of this has to devolve into conflict. Nothing’s changed about our policies with respect to One China or supporting Taiwan’s ability to defend itself. So, there’s no reason for this to be escalated, even just in rhetoric.”\n\nPotential trip comes at tense moment in China\n\nAdministration officials are concerned Pelosi’s trip comes at a particularly tense moment, as Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party congress. Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks, putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength.\n\nOfficials also believe the Chinese leadership don’t completely grasp the political dynamics in the United States, leading to a misunderstanding over the significance of Pelosi’s potential visit. The officials say China may be confusing Pelosi’s visit with an official administration visit, since she and Biden are both Democrats. Administration officials are concerned that China doesn’t separate Pelosi from Biden much, if at all.\n\nInstead, the politics surrounding the potential trip have become somewhat reversed. A number of Republicans have encouraged Pelosi to go ahead with her plans, arguing it would be a strong stand against China, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n“Nancy, I’ll go with you. I’m banned in China, but not freedom-loving Taiwan. See you there!” Pompeo tweeted this week.\n\nPelosi has long cultivated a tough-on-China stance. She issued a strong statement in June on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre reminding everyone she helped unfurl a banner there two years after the massacre reading, “To those who died for democracy in China.”\n\nBiden looks for stability\n\nBiden, who has sought to stabilize ties with China through regular conversations with his counterpart, is planning a phone conversation with Xi this week in which the issue of Taiwan could likely arise.\n\nHe last spoke to Xi in March, when he worked to convince the Chinese leader not to support Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine. Officials have been watching closely how Beijing responds to the invasion, hoping the mostly united Western response — including a withering set of economic sanctions and billions of dollars in arms shipments — proves illuminating as China considers its actions toward Taiwan.\n\nKirby indicated Tuesday that China is observing the global response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as it plots next steps in Taiwan, saying, “I’m sure they’re watching this in real time” but that there was “no reason for this to devolve into any kind of conflict.”\n\nUS officials believe there’s a small risk China would miscalculate in responding to a Pelosi visit. Biden administration officials are concerned that China could seek to declare a no-fly zone over Taiwan ahead of a possible visit as an effort to upend the trip, potentially raising tensions even further in the region, a US official told CNN.\n\nThat remains a remote possibility, officials said. More likely, they say, is the possibility China steps up flights further into Taiwan’s self-declared air defense zone, which could trigger renewed discussions about possible responses from Taiwan and the US, the US official added. They did not detail what those possible responses would entail.\n\nWhile the administration has not, and does not, plan to officially tell the speaker not to travel to Taiwan, officials have been frank in the briefings about the risks associated with a trip. People familiar with the matter say their hope is to quietly convince Pelosi of the trip’s risks without explicitly telling her not to go.\n\nIn the end, the speaker will make her own decision, Biden officials noted.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Kaitlan Collins", "Kevin Liptak", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}]}

Salmon said in the 27 years he's worked for DRBA, tolls have never decreased.\n\nThe hard truth is the bridge will always need maintenance and DRBA will have to increase rates as necessary to keep the twin spans in shape for travel, Salmon said.\n\nDRBA does not receive tax dollars to maintain the bridge and neither Delaware nor New Jersey is responsible for the bridge or approaches.\n\nRight now, DRBA doesn't have enough revenue to keep up with repairs.\n\nWhen are the public hearings?\n\nThere will be hearings in both New Jersey and Delaware.\n\nDelaware\n\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 5\n\nWhere: Main floor of the Vincent A.

It would make sense that they would, at some point, get in sync with the climate at a larger global scale.”\n\nFor two decades, Heckscher has been studying Delaware’s densest population of veery thrushes, a cinnamon-colored songbird with a spotted chest that migrates every spring from the southern Amazon basin to northern breeding grounds that stretch from Delaware to Canada.\n\nOver the years he has watched and tracked one population of veeries nestling into the forests of White Clay Creek State Park each spring. Even though the species travels thousands of miles for this moment, they only ever raise one clutch, or one successful nest of usually two to four chicks.\n\n“I started to notice that in some years the birds were stopping their breeding season earlier than other years,” the ornithologist, entomologist and environmental science professor said.\n\nHe began to wonder why after a few years of shorter breeding seasons. Did they not have enough food? Was it because the weather was too dry or too hot?\n\nEventually, he started looking at what advantage the birds would have by shortening their nesting season. That’s when he thought to look at tropical storm activity, which occurs along their long migratory route.\n\n“It turns out that in years they stop breeding earlier, there’s more tropical storm activity on their migration route,” Heckscher said. “I thought of that idea, I tested the hypothesis, I looked at the data, but I really wasn’t expecting there to be any relationship there.\n\n\"And it was a really strong relationship.”\n\nNearly 20 years of data showed Heckscher that not only does the length of the veery’s breeding season relate to future tropical storm activity, but the average number of eggs in each nest could also signal whether the season will be normal, slow or overly active. He found that females produce more eggs when an active hurricane season is in store.\n\n“The chances of this relationship being coincidental, in my opinion, are pretty small,\" he said. “We don’t know for sure that the relationship is real, but there is a relationship between what the birds are doing and the following tropical storm season.”\n\nIn late May, NOAA predicted that this year’s Atlantic tropical storm season, which lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30, would be near normal. It called for up to 15 named storms, two to four of which would become major hurricanes.\n\nWhat's in a name? Here's how naming hurricanes works\n\nMeanwhile, the veery thrush data from this spring indicated the season would be a bit more active than normal.\n\nBy their next update in August, NOAA changed its prediction for the season and increased the chances of an above-normal season with up to 17 named storms. As of Nov. 1, there have been 17 named storms and three major hurricanes.\n\nThe birds had it right all along.\n\n“Which is pretty incredible if you think about it because these birds, the timing of their breeding season is determined in May and June, and that storm activity is happening in September, October, November,” Heckscher said.\n\nLast year, Heckscher published a paper on his songbird and hurricane findings, but the data has yet to be used in NOAA’s forecasting. That won’t happen until researchers such as Heckscher can find some missing puzzle pieces.\n\nHis research also will be featured in a Netflix documentary expected to come out next year, he said.\n\nWhile the link between these thrushes and tropical activity is clear, he said, it remains a mystery how the thrushes are able to sense future weather patterns as accurately or better than advanced meteorological super computers.\n\nHeckscher has a few guesses, but it will take more of research and studies to pinpoint how the birds are able to predict weather patterns for their own safety, and whether other migratory species are able to do the same.\n\nHe said there's a possibility that the birds can somehow sense sea-surface temperatures – a huge factor in hurricane development and strength, on their journey north. Or that maybe precipitation or other environmental factors in their wintering grounds could be providing cues that humans haven't yet picked up on.\n\n“Whatever it is, it’s something that they’ve already figured it out by mid-May at the latest, really,” he said. “It’s just opened up so many other questions. How do they know this?”\n\nHow hurricanes form:Infographic: An inside look at the birth and power of hurricanes\n\nDon't let your guard down:Are Category 5 hurricanes such as Dorian the 'new normal'?\n\nHow NOAA predicts tropical storm seasons\n\nUntil researchers can figure out how the veeries predict future weather patterns, public safety relies on the modeling and forecasting provided by federal agencies.\n\nEven after decades of fine-tuning, there always remains a certain level of uncertainty in forecasts, said meteorologist Matthew Rosencrats with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.\n\nNOAA uses a combination of what experts call statistical and dynamical tools, which look at patterns of sea-surface temperatures and upper level winds, as well as computer modeling, to help predict how many tropical storm systems could develop months in advance.\n\nThose forecasts are delivered in July and again in August for a season that peaks around Sept. 10, he said.\n\nWhile Rosencrats said he hasn’t seen Heckscher’s study and data, and researchers would have to pinpoint the physical and biochemical bases that drive the veery’s ability to forecast tropical storms before it could be helpful in a more public way.\n\n“If we could ever figure out the biological and statistical reasoning why, it could be used,” he said. “The wildlife of Delmarva, they’re really important to the whole ecology of the region, to the economy and to tourism.”\n\nFollow reporter Maddy Lauria on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/09/21/new-digs-wilmington-riverfront-reflect-rule-changes/16019045/", "title": "New condos delight those with disabilities", "text": "Beth Miller\n\nThe News Journal\n\nFederal guidelines are pushing to move people with disabilities out of group homes%2C facilities\n\nHomes For Life provides residences for people with cognitive disabilities\n\nState%2C agencies provide support as needed\n\nWILMINGTON – Joe Flacco was there on Day One, present with all the glory a plastic NFL figurine can bear and placed in front of Jeff Jones' living-room television.\n\nThe news here is that Jeff Jones has a living room in his own place – his first place, which at 38 years of age comes none too soon. Jones says he has been waiting for moving day his entire life so, of course, one of his heroes, the Baltimore Ravens' quarterback and University of Delaware alum, would have a prominent role.\n\nJones is one of three young adults who have moved into neighboring condominiums at Justison Landing on Wilmington's riverfront. The furnished units were donated by the Homes For Life Foundation to The Arc of Delaware, a nonprofit that serves as an advocate and resource for those with intellectual and cognitive disabilities.\n\nJones and Alexandra Jahn, 36 – who is moving into a condo next to his – have worked for Bank of America and its predecessor, MBNA America, for 15 years.\n\nDayon Stevens, 28, who is blind, is Jones' new roommate and hopes to find work at one of the many businesses nearby.\n\nAll three arrive in these independent units under a new set of regulations from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that govern how and where federal support for home- and community-based services will be provided for people with disabilities.\n\nThe feds are moving everything toward greater independence – individual choice, community integration, and self-determination – and away from anything that looks like an institution or a sequestered world where only those with certain disabilities reside.\n\nThe rules reflect the mandates of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the 1999 U.S. Supreme Court ruling known as Olmstead, which said people with disabilities must be able to live in the least-restrictive environment appropriate for them.\n\n\"Justison Landing is for people who are quite independent, people who don't need 24-hour support,\" said Jane Gallivan, director of the state Division of Developmental Disabilities Services (DDDS). \"It's an ideal setting and they can take full advantage of the wonderful amenities in that area.\"\n\nIf community integration is the goal, that Flacco figurine is probably near the proverbial end zone.\n\nNew philosophy\n\nThese two-bedroom units are the 26th and 27th residential properties donated by Homes For Life, the foundation created by Micki and Lanny Edelsohn to provide homes for those with cognitive disabilities. Their son, Robert, lives with several roommates in one of the homes on Wilmington's Bancroft Parkway.\n\nThe condominiums – worth about $190,000 each – were deeded to The Arc of Delaware, which serves as a sort of turbocharged landlord, providing extended services to residents of its 82 properties that go far beyond leases and minor repairs.\n\nTenants sign their own leases. A service provider – Community Systems Inc. in this case – supports the residents with assistance according to their needs, and ensures all systems are working well. And the state verifies eligibility for state and federal money, compliance with state and federal requirements, and provides case management and other services.\n\nFederal regulations now require residences to be in community settings wherever appropriate, though precise definitions of what that means still are under construction.\n\nDelaware has until March 2015 to give CMS its plan for how it will award home- and community-based funds and it has until 2019 to comply with the new regulations, Gallivan said.\n\nCMS is providing information on its new regulations little by little, Gallivan said.\n\n\"Once we get as much guidance as possible, we will begin to put a plan together,\" she said. \"They want to know - how are you going to evaluate the settings you have? That's not only for residential, but also for day services.\"\n\nState officials will invite significant public input as the plan is developed, she said.\n\nThe regulations have some non-negotiables already, though.\n\nFor example, one major rule is that no programs that get federal waiver money can be located on or adjacent to the grounds of a public institution, such as the Stockley Center in Sussex County or the Gov. Bacon Center near Delaware City. Those who have lived on those grounds have been moving into community settings for some time, Gallivan said.\n\nThe regulations also govern what happens in those community settings. Residents must have the liberty to choose their day's activities instead of having to follow the dictates of staff.\n\nFor example, \"if I want to hang out in my PJs to watch TV until noon on Saturdays, I should have that option,\" Gallivan said. \"It's my home.\"\n\nIt's not supposed to be an institution.\n\nExciting times\n\nJustison Landing sits along the Christina River, amid a host of urban neighborhood amenities – a major cinema complex, a minor league ballpark, shops, restaurants, many small businesses, parks and room to roam.\n\nThis past week, Jones and Stevens went together to the Polish Festival, where Jones was winning lots of prizes at the arcade, according to Jennifer Tymes, program director for Community Systems Inc.\n\nAlready, Tymes said, Jones had cooked dinner for everyone at his place.\n\nHis mother, Suellen Jones of Bear, helped him move in. It's the first time her son has not lived at home or in a group home, she said, and he is excited.\n\n\"I've been in a group home for 16 years,\" Jeff Jones said with a grin as he unpacked a box. \"I've been bugging them and bugging them and I finally got out. I've been really looking forward to this – being on my own and lots of fun.\"\n\nIt's a bit different from his mom's perspective.\n\n\"It's a little frightening,\" she said, \"but we'll wait and see. ... We'll see how well it works.\"\n\nHer husband helped to persuade her the time was right for their son.\n\n\"We're getting up in years,\" she said, \"and we're not going to be here forever.\"\n\nGetting their own place is a significant milestone.\n\n\"They're graduating,\" said Michelle Thompson, state case manager for all three. \"It's the excitement that they're coming into their own now. ... Seeing their faces when they see their new condos, no less. This is theirs. They've worked hard to overcome all the barriers. They have surpassed everything people have expected of them.\"\n\nThere are fresh memories in Delaware, though, of a recent horror captured on video. The video showed a series of beatings kids delivered to a young man with intellectual disabilities in a Newark neighborhood\n\nIt was a disturbing, frightening incident and a reminder that life in the community is sometimes perilous – never more so than for someone with a disability.\n\n\"We have to have a strong self-advocacy system where we are helping individuals living on their own or semi-independently to know what to do and how to be assertive,\" Gallivan said. \"We have to be cautious. There has to be a balance. With your rights come responsibilities. People do have the right to live in the community and be as independent as possible. But we have to be sure they have the tools they need to deal with situations when they come up.\"\n\nSome will encounter rejection, too, just because they are different or someone judges them to be \"less than.\"\n\n\"There is a lot of misinformation out there and a lot of misconceptions about persons with disabilities – and those with intellectual disabilities in particular,\" said Terry Olson, executive director of The Arc of Delaware. \"We try to educate folks, be positive and supportive, and we try to be a good neighbor.\"\n\nThere are many challenges, costs, and concerns to address.\n\nBut watching Alexandra Jahn twirl excitedly in her new bedroom, talk about where her desk might go and what she might do with the walls, smile and twirl and talk about more possibilities – it made Micki Edelsohn of Homes For Life a bit emotional. Again.\n\n\"As a person, a mom, and a taxpaying citizen, this is a very expensive proposition, caring for a population that is very vulnerable,\" she said. \"But it's up to us as a society to do what we need to do to ensure people are cared for properly and getting the right supports.\n\n\"I will work with the state and anyone who wants to work with me to try and find solutions for all people.\"\n\nContact Beth Miller at (302) 324-2784 or bmiller@delawareonline.com.

It's disappointing. Everyone wants to win opening day.\"\n\nHARPER'S VOICE:In his second season, Bryce Harper is getting vocal about Phillies' future\n\nThe only audible sounds were some fake piped-in cheering (no booing), players calling for fly balls, and a few fans beyond the outfield gates booing when Phillies pitcher Aaron Nola gave up a two-run homer to Jesus Aguilar in the sixth.\n\n\"It was pretty neat, the fans outside center field, yelling and screaming,\" Girardi said with a laugh. \"It's something I won't forget.\"\n\nLEGACY LIVING ON:Related to baseball giant, Hunter puts heart into new Ingram league\n\nIt was hard to tell if there was urgency from the lack of noise in the ballpark, but there should have been among the players.\n\n\"It's a 60-game season and you don't really have time to coast,\" Nola said.\n\nThat's because Major League Baseball announced Thursday that it was adding three more teams to the playoffs, for a total of eight from each league.\n\nThat opened up some hope for a Phillies team that hasn't had a winning season since 2011.\n\nEAGLES TOP 5:Eagles' 5 most important players for the 2020 season: No. 3 Javon Hargrave\n\nBut there are only 60 games in the season, and losing an opener to the Marlins, who lost 105 games last season, was not a good start.\n\nAll of this will take some getting used to, even though there isn't much time for that. Some of that includes social distancing in the clubhouse. Some players, such as shortstop Didi Gregorius and first baseman Rhys Hoskins, wore masks on the field.\n\nThat's something players have dealt with over the past three weeks of summer camp. They also got used to the fake high-fives and the distance hugs.\n\n\"It’s weird because you want to show emotion, you want to give high-fives, you want to give hugs and celebrate together,\" Girardi said. \"But we’ve kind of gotten used to it, we’ve gotten used to the fake high-fives and all of that ... It’s definitely different.\"\n\nHere are some other observations from the Phillies' opener:\n\nNola not great\n\nAaron Nola was starting his third straight opener, but this one didn't go very well for him.\n\nNola gave up a run in the third after Francisco Cervelli singled with one out. That was the first hit allowed by Nola. Miguel Rojas, the designated hitter who was batting ninth, followed with a single to send Cervelli to third. Cervelli scored on Jonathan Villar's sacrifice fly.\n\nBut Nola seemed to tire in the sixth when he surpassed 70 pitches. Jesus Aguilar hit a two-run homer with one out, and Corey Dickerson followed with a double to right. That ended Nola's night.\n\nHe went 5 1/3 innings, giving up four runs on five hits, while striking out seven. Nola threw 79 pitches.\n\n\"I felt good, honestly, throughout the whole game,\" Nola said. \"Just a couple of spots where I was trying to get some balls in the zone, and it hurt me.\"\n\nWhere's the offense?\n\nGirardi set up his lineup with Andrew McCutchen leading off, Rhys Hoskins batting second, Bryce Harper third and J.T. Realmuto fourth.\n\nThey combined to go 1-for-14 with six strikeouts.\n\nThe Phillies' offense came on Gregorius' solo homer in the fifth. The second run scored on an error when Villar, playing center field, dropped a routine fly ball hit by Jay Bruce that would have ended the inning.\n\nInstead, Gregorius, who was on first base with a walk, hustled around the bases and scored while Bruce ended up on second. The error nearly proved to be costly as Scott Kingery followed with a potential home run ball that was just a few feet foul. Kingery then grounded out to end the inning.\n\nRealmuto came up in the eighth as the potential tying run after Hoskins blooped a single into center and Harper walked with two out. Realmuto grounded out to the pitcher.\n\nAs a team, the Phillies had five hits, and Gregorius had two of them.\n\n\"We don't play as many games as we're supposed to,\" Gregorius said. \"All these games count. We don't have a lot of time to catch up, and (we can't) fall too far back.\"\n\nNew rule hurts Phillies\n\nMLB tweaked several rules during the offseason. One of them requires pitchers to face a minimum of three batters. That was done to prevent managers from replacing pitchers after just one batter, which slowed down the game.\n\nSo when Ramon Rosso replaced Nola in the sixth inning, Girardi had no choice but to wait for him to get through three batters. It didn't go well for Rosso, who was making his major league debut.\n\nRosso came on with a runner on second with one out and the Phillies trailing 3-1. He walked his first batter, then uncorked a wild pitch, putting runners on second and third.

These are the first positive cases of inmates at that prison during the pandemic.\n\nThey are also the first results since correction officials announced earlier this week that each of the approximately 900 inmates at the prison will be tested for the virus. The number of infected is expected to rise as more of the inmate population is tested.\n\nThus far, officials have prioritized testing those over 60 years old and those with underlying health conditions that could be fatal in combination with the virus.\n\nOfficials said the virus is present in multiple housing units, making it harder to quarantine inmates that have not been exposed or to know who hasn't been exposed.\n\n\"Because the illness is present in several housing units we know that the number of positive test results will grow,\" said Claire DeMatteis, commissioner of the state's correction system on Thursday.\n\nAbout a quarter of those that have tested positive are showing symptoms as of Thursday morning, officials said. The prison also has 10 correction staff currently positive for the virus, according to state figures.\n\nThe first hints of the outbreak among the prison population at SCI came last week when officials received a positive test from an inmate who had contracted the virus outside before being booked into the facility.\n\nDeMatteis said the prison is working \"aggressively\" to contain the virus.\n\nThat includes moving three dozen inmates over 60 or who have underlying health issues to a vacant building at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna so they will not be exposed.\n\nAfter denying inmates face coverings earlier this year, the prison is also providing masks to all 900 SCI inmates. Programs, visitation and the intake of new prisoners is also suspended for now.\n\nPREVIOUSLY: Officials say prisoners won't get masks or release during COVID-19 fight\n\nOfficials have shuffled some inmates that tested positive to a special COVID-19 unit at Vaughn and said Thursday they are opening a special treatment center at SCI.\n\nThe outbreak at SCI will likely soon be confirmed to be the largest the state has seen at its prisons or any other state-run entity. A total of 128 inmates at Vaughn, the state's largest prison by population, tested positive for the virus earlier this year.\n\nCurrently, there are no active cases of coronavirus among the inmate population there.\n\nMost recently, Joseph Slider, 60, was serving a 20-year sentence when he died of COVID-19 complications in late May. Slider had been at Vaughn since at least February when he was sentenced for killing his ex-wife during drug-induced hallucination.\n\nThe dead in Delaware prisons have averaged 71 years old and were mostly serving life sentences. Six of the seven had chronic health conditions that were compounded by the virus, officials said.\n\nIt's a death rate that is one of the highest in the country, according to statistics compiled by The Marshall Project, a non-profit news publication that has been tracking coronavirus cases and deaths in prisons across the country.\n\nAccording to those statistics, Delaware has the fourth highest rate of death per capita compared to its overall prison population in the country.\n\nCurrently, three positive inmates are being treated in \"stable\" condition at local hospitals, officials said Friday.\n\nWhile the growing outbreak in Sussex will be a primary focus, the correction system is also battling smaller clusters at other facilities. Morris Community Corrections Center currently has three inmates that have tested positive.\n\nThree contracted staffers at Baylor Women's Correctional Institution have recently tested positive as well. Two staffers at a probation and parole check-in center in New Castle County have also tested positive. There are also ten staffers at Vaughn who have tested positive recently.\n\nIn all, 141 inmates across Delaware prisons have recovered from the virus in addition to about 80 workers, according to state officials.\n\nDelaware inmates can contact Reporter Xerxes Wilson through the Getting Out email application by adding xwilson@delawareonline.com as a contact.

The Rams open their 2024 schedule against Holy Cross on Aug. 31 and will be looking to make it four straight winning seasons under coach Jim Fleming. That includes a 13-11 record against conference opponents — it took URI nine years to win that many league games from 2011-19.\n\n“Obviously, I want to put up my numbers but I just want to win,” URI linebacker AJ Pena said. “I want to get that CAA title. That is so important on my mind.”\n\nPena was one of three preseason all-league selections for the Rams, joining defensive lineman Westley Neal Jr. and punt returner Gabe Sloat. Wide receiver Marquis Buchanan was named an honorable mention selection after a breakout 2023 campaign. URI will replace four-year starting quarterback Kasim Hill and a host of experience across the offensive line entering its first game with the Crusaders.\n\n“It’s hard,” Pena said. “I’m not going to lie. We always question how we approach certain things or situations.“We’re just trying to be all-around great at football. That takes caring about other people as well.”\n\nBryant matched the Rams with a 6-5 mark last season and went 4-2 in the Big South-OVC conference. The Bulldogs join a league that put four teams into the FCS playoffs and find themselves playing a more regional schedule.

Bryant will also be breaking in a new quarterback after Zevi Eckhaus announced a transfer to Washington State. The Bulldogs will host URI in the regular-season finale on Nov. 23.\n\n“This spring was probably the most competitive and intense spring we’ve had offensively,” Taglieri said. “Every day was a dogfight.”\n\nReigning cochampion Villanova was selected to top the league with nine first-place votes.

The 2015 matchup, however, comes Sept. 19 at Villanova.\n\nPope Francis is visiting Philadelphia Sept. 22-27 and Villanova had scheduled Parents Day for its Sept. 26 home game against nonconference foe Penn. Knowing there would be significant interest in the papal visit, leaders at Villanova, a Catholic school, decided Sept. 26 was not suitable for a special event such as Parents Day, explained Colonial Athletic Association associate commissioner Scott Meyer.\n\nVillanova will still play Penn in its only nonconference home game Sept. 26. But Parents Day was moved to Sept. 19. Each CAA school is permitted to choose one date on which it is guaranteed a home game, Meyer said, and that was Villanova’s.\n\n“Delaware was the only available home opponent to put there,” Meyer said, citing conflicts caused by CAA schools’ schedules.\n\nThe CAA schedule, in which each of the league’s 12 teams plays eight games, will feature the same opponents in 2015 as in 2014 but at the opposite sites. That means Villanova was locked in to play Delaware, William & Mary, Maine and Richmond at home in 2015.\n\n“It’s a one-year thing,” Meyer added, referring to Delaware-Villanova resuming their season-ending encounters in future years.\n\nThe 2015 game is presently scheduled at Villanova Stadium. The last two meetings in which Villanova was the home team have been played at PPL Park in Chester, Pennsylvania, home of Major League Soccer’s Philadelphia Union, after the conclusion of the MLS season. The MLS season will still be ongoing in September, however.\n\nDelaware-Villanova was actually played in September from 1994 through 1998. Delaware has played Villanova 47 times, more than any other opponent except for West Chester. The Wildcats have won seven of the last eight and lead the series 25-21-1 going into their Nov. 22 encounter in Newark.\n\nNext season, Delaware will play home CAA games against William & Mary (Oct. 3), New Hampshire (Oct. 24), Albany (Nov. 7) and James Madison (Nov. 14). It’ll be the first home CAA game against New Hampshire since 2006, though the Wildcats did visit for a NCAA 2010 playoff.\n\nIn addition to Villanova Sept. 19, the Blue Hens travel to Rhode Island (Oct. 10), Towson (Oct. 31) and Elon (Nov. 21).\n\nDelaware’s three nonconference games in 2015 are at home against Jacksonville (Florida) on Sept. 5 and Lafayette on Sept. 12 and at North Carolina on Sept. 26.\n\nThe Hens’ open date is Oct. 17.\n\nFCS returns to an 11-game schedule in 2015. Twelves games were permitted in 2013 and 2014 simply because of the extra Saturday that fell between Labor Day and Thanksgiving those years.

But the Blue Hens (4-2 overall, 2-1 Colonial Athletic Association) are back on track.\n\nDown 10-0 early and 16-14 through three quarters, the Hens demonstrated the necessary offensive firepower and defensive toughness to rule in the decisive fourth quarter.\n\nThat made them 28-16 winners over Elon, which had risen to No. 5 in the STATS media Top 25 national FCS poll after last week’s 27-24 win at James Madison.\n\n“We felt this would be a very pivotal game in our season,” coach Danny Rocco said.\n\nDelaware took the lead with 7:01 left on Pat Kehoe’s 23-yard touchdown pass to Vinny Papale on third-and-4. It closed a six-play, 68-yard drive that also included a pass-interference penalty against Elon.\n\nAfter the Phoenix were forced to punt after three incomplete passes, Kani Kane’s 2-yard TD run with 4:02 to go closed a six-play, 53-yard march that was all runs, including Kane’s 32-yard gallop.\n\nThe defense then stopped Elon again on downs to lock up the win.\n\nElon lost its starting quarterback to a knee injury in the first quarter, though its backup had seen significant previous duty while doing more running than passing. In addition, the CAA’s leading rusher, Malcolm Summers, didn’t play because of an injury.\n\nBut the Phoenix had plenty of other formidable features, including an offensive line with 133 career starts and a sturdy defense. Yet Delaware, despite three first-half turnovers that could have been its downfall, managed to overcome a shaky start and score a big win.\n\nFive takeaways from Saturday:\n\nSensing the stakes\n\nThe Blue Hens understood the critical nature of this game in perhaps determining their long-term fate, even though many challenges remain.\n\nThe victory should provide confidence moving forward. Delaware has five games left, including three against teams presently in the Top 25.\n\n“It felt that way from really, probably Monday, or Sunday night when we started breaking down film,” senior inside linebacker Troy Reeder said of the game’s huge importance.\n\n“Guys just saw it as what it was. It was No. 5 coming in to play us at home and we love playing at home. I think guys did a really phenomenal job preparing all week and hopefully the rest of our schedule we continue to prepare like we’re playing a top-five team.”\n\nRegaining the run\n\nKane’s 124 yards on 19 carries, Delaware’s first 100-plus effort since Kane’s 106 in the opening-night loss to Rhode Island, highlighted a resurgent day for UD’s running attack.\n\nDelaware averaged 4.7 yards per carry against Elon. The Hens came in averaging 3.0.\n\n“We are physical,’’ Rocco said. “We thought we’d be able to get some movement in there, knock them around a little and sure enough in the fourth quarter that was somewhat the difference in the football game.”\n\nDeJoun Lee, a smaller, quicker, more elusive runner, was again effectively mixed in to complement the powerful Kane.\n\nBut Delaware also had success lining up in its wildcat formation with Joe Walker at quarterback, his old position before moving to wideout. From that, Delaware unleashed a variety of plays.\n\n“We played a complete game up front,” Walker said, crediting the offensive line’s role in the effort. “They went to war every single play.”\n\nHome-field advantage\n\nSaturday’s crowd of 19,924 was the largest in three years, since 19,924 attended the game against New Hampshire in 2015.\n\nCertainly, Family & Parents Weekend always brings a larger gathering and it’s still nothing like the 2000s, when sellouts and 20,000-plus throngs were the norm.\n\nBut it was impressive and added to a great game-day atmosphere.\n\n“There were some times out there today,” Rocco said, “that we had so much energy in that stadium that it was just joyful for me and I’m hoping it was joyful for our fans because there was excitement and energy. Our kids were playing hard, and it was a big factor in the game there at the end.”\n\nRocco mentioned the fanfare that followed Noah Plack and Jack Dinicola stopping Elon’s returnman at the Phoenix 18 on Delaware’s kickoff following its go-ahead TD.\n\n“Our sideline went nuts. The fans went nuts, crazy,” Rocco said. “And this is a kickoff play. It was just all right there for us. I do think that’s what we’ve all been kind of searching for.”\n\nGotta be more careful\n\nDelaware was fortunate Elon didn’t take greater advantage of the Hens’ sloppy start that included three first-half turnovers. Delaware’s 64 yards in penalties were also well above its 41-yards-per-game average.\n\n“That made it more difficult than it needed to be but it gave us that opportunity to rise up and we certainly did that,” Rocco said.\n\nFuture situations may not be as forgiving.\n\nDelaware now goes to New Hampshire, where it hasn’t won in 15 years. Though the Wildcats (1-5, 0-3) are likely to see their string of 14 straight years in the NCAA playoffs end, they are no easy task anywhere.\n\n“I do think this team is getting better,” Rocco said. “I think that we learn from our experiences, we’ve learned from our hard defeats. This team has been through a lot of adversity. This team has been challenged, doubted, disbelieved and we keep coming back every day, going to work, focusing on the next day, staying together, staying united.”\n\nNumbers game\n\nDelaware limited Elon to 289 total yards – they’d averaged 415.4 — after giving up 608 at Richmond and 527 at North Dakota State.\n\nReeder, the CAA’s leading tackler, had 15 more, including five for lost yardage in another inspired effort.\n\nJoe Walker passed for 37 yards, ran for 17, had 25 yards receiving and 84 on kickoff returns. No wonder NFL scouts have taken notice.\n\nThe Blue Hens won despite having no takeaways but making three turnovers.\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

He’s a role model,” former NFA football coach Jemal Davis told The Bulletin in 2014. “Everything that you want in a son, you see in Khaleed. He doesn’t take anything for granted, he’s not critical of anybody, leads by example. Those are the qualities that you want in your leader.”\n\nExum-Strong’s wrestling exploits at NFA included ECC, State Open and New England championships.\n\n“The whole thing about Khaleed - he is like a gladiator,” former NFA wrestling coach Kirk Jenkins told The Bulletin in 2014. “He always lives (for) and rises to the occasion.”\n\nIn 2021, Exum-Strong earned the Northeast-10 Conference Most Valuable Player award after rushing for a league-best 140.6 yards per game and nine touchdowns in NE10 play, as well as a remarkable 7.3 yards per carry for Assumption College (Worcester, Mass.).\n\nExum-Strong finished his career (2017-2021) at Assumption second in school history in both rushing yards (2,862) and touchdowns (35).\n\nCollege hoops bonanza\n\nThe place to be for college basketball fans this fall isn’t the Palestra, Pauley Pavilion, Rupp Arena, Allen Fieldhouse, Cameron Indoor Stadium or the Rose Hill Gymnasium in the Bronx.

Sheehan’s teammate was legendary football, basketball and baseball star Dick Jauron.\n\nJauron also led the Big Blue football team to a state title in 1968 and was selected a Parade High School All-American. Jauron starred at Yale as a running back and safety and was named a First Team All-American in 1972.

It’s Delaware’s first opener against a Colonial Athletic Association rival since starting the 2007 season at William & Mary.\n\nThe anticipation leading to the onset of another UD football season is like the eagerness that accompanies the countdown toward Christmas. That'll be evident in the hundreds who'll flock to a couple Saturday scrimmages in Delaware Stadium, anxious for a sneak peek.\n\nWith that in mind, it’s time for a wish list – 12 things it'd be good to see during this Delaware football season.\n\n1. Give the ultimate tribute\n\nCollege Football Hall-of-Famer Tubby Raymond died last December at age 92. What better way to honor the man whose teams won 300 games as Delaware coach and is likely the state’s most celebrated sports figure than, on the first play of the 2018 season, line up in Raymond’s signature Delaware Wing-T offense. I can see a pulling guard now, and the Rhode Island defense, duped by the Wing-T’s mischievous misdirection, wondering who on earth has the football. Tubby Raymond Field would thus be truly consecrated in its namesake’s spirit.\n\n2. End the postseason famine\n\nThe NCAA established postseason championships for football beginning in 1973. In 2010, when Delaware reached the FCS title game and lost to Eastern Washington, it was the Blue Hens’ 20th postseason appearance in 33 years and seventh title game. Until then, Delaware had never gone more than three years (1983-85) without qualifying. That playoff absence has now stretched seven excruciating years, which once would have seemed as utterly unfathomable as a U.S. presidential candidate likely conspiring with a foreign adversary to get elected. Delaware nearly made the playoffs last year under first-year coach Danny Rocco. The Hens are better suited to land in the postseason this year, and must end that drought to reconnect with a shrunken fan base.\n\n3. Come see\n\nAn opening night sellout may be too much to ask at 22,000-seat Delaware Stadium, which is slated to undergo a much-needed and long-overdue face-lift beginning early next year. There hasn’t even been a crowd of 20,000-plus since the William & Mary game in 2013 (21,010). This year’s home schedule isn’t particularly star-studded and there are only three home games after Sept. 15, which is odd. The Hens should be worth watching, and a 20,000-plus opening-night turnout isn’t a fantasy.\n\n4. Defend at the FargoDome\n\nDelaware will be put to the test in its Sept. 22 visit to North Dakota State, which has won six of the last seven FCS titles. The UD offense will try to run plays in the deafening roar inside the 19,000-seat FargoDome. It’ll be courteously quiet for the Bison offense though, until it makes a big play. Led by what could the best linebacker corps in FCS, Delaware should have a staunch defense after finishing 10th nationally in scoring defense (16.8 ppg) last year. Let’s see it silence the Bison and turn this much-anticipated visit into the trip of a lifetime.\n\n5. Don't miss these two\n\nDelaware’s football history is loaded with individual players who were worth the price of admission. Some of those more recent Blue Hens are in the NFL now. Two who could have a chance to join them are inside linebacker Troy Reeder, the Salesianum graduate in his third season after transferring from Penn State, and safety Nasir Adderley, whose leaping one-handed interception at Towson last year made national highlights.\n\n6. Make passing grades\n\nThe Blue Hens have been the CAA’s worst passing team the last three seasons. Last year’s 124.5 air yards per game was their best average in that span, though it was still paltry. Delaware doesn’t have to exhibit incredible aerial firepower. It must have more explosiveness and better balance with what should be a formidable run game.\n\n7. Seek steady play at QB\n\nWish 6 leads to this one: Delaware needs more consistent and mistake-free play at quarterback, where the addition of position coach Al Wood should be a boost. Wood is a former head coach at James Madison, Buffalo and Florida A&M and has guided quarterbacks in the NFL and at FBS programs. J.P. Caruso is a returning starter and Boston College transfer Darius Wade out of Middletown High arrives with impressive credentials. But don’t rule out dark-horse Pat Kehoe, a fourth-year junior who has appeared in just one career game.\n\n8. Get jolts from Joe, Jamie\n\nWhile it didn’t work out for Joe Walker in 2½ years as starting quarterback, his move to wide receiver opens up a realm of electrifying possibilities for the Blue Hens, who watched him get 165 all-purpose yards last year at Maine – 158 in the first half – while playing a variety of positions. Delaware coaches need to find ingenious ways to unleash his talents. Come to think of it, same goes for Jamie Jarmon, the former Indian River High quarterback standout and minor-league baseball player who is now a senior wideout loaded with potential.\n\n9. Try two-back attack\n\nThe Blue Hens have a slew of formidable running backs, led by last year’s leading rusher Kani Kane, 1,000-yard career rushers Thomas Jefferson and Kareen Williams, impressive 2017 freshman Khory Spruill and newcomers DeJoun Lee and Andre Robinson, a potential Penn State transfer. Not that we’re advocating a full-time return to the Wing-T, but more two-back sets would seem potentially appropriate and tough to defend.\n\n10. Win the close ones\n\nIt’s not always who has the best players or best team. It’s who executes and wins the close ones. Delaware’s 7-4 finish last year was highlighted by dramatic wins against Stony Brook 24-20 and Richmond 42-35 in overtime and lowlighted by the 18-17 loss at Towson and 28-7 defeat at Villanova, the latter two setbacks coming against teams that finished 5-6. There need to be less of the latter and more of the former, though life in the CAA ensures many down-to-the-wire games.\n\n11. Turn over a new leaf\n\nThe best league trip and most potentially pivotal road game that UD fans shouldn’t miss is Oct. 20 at New Hampshire. Durham will remind you of Newark as a splendid college town and it should be particularly eye-catching in late October (The hotels are in nearby Portsmouth, also very appealing). The Wildcats have made 14 straight NCAA playoffs and may be in contention with Delaware for a spot this time. Oh, and Delaware hasn’t won here since 2003, its NCAA title season, which happens to be the last time UNH didn't reach the postseason. If Delaware wants to get back in the playoffs, it may have to win here.\n\n12. Vanquish Villanova\n\nThe only athletic prowess Villanova should be flaunting over Delaware is in basketball. Yet Delaware has lost six straight and 11 of the last 12 football skirmishes against its long-time rival, a run of ineffectiveness nearly as startling as that playoff absence. Come Nov. 17 at Delaware Stadium, where Villanova has not lost since 2004, the Blue Hens need to take care of business in a way they didn’t in 2017. There may be a playoff berth riding on it.\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Last week’s 20-6 loss at James Madison in a first-round FCS playoff game meant Delaware didn’t make it to December.\n\nBut the Hens (7-5) did reach the NCAA playoffs for the first time since 2010, a noteworthy accomplishment.\n\nThat made the season a success, though three losses to end the year, including another exasperating defeat against Villanova, certainly left some a bit unsatisfied, especially considering the experience on this team.\n\nDelaware only won fewer than seven games on five occasions under coach Tubby Raymond from 1966-2001. Times are different now, and the back-to-back seven-win seasons are Delaware’s first since 2010-11. Before that it was 2003-04.\n\nMaking it three straight will be a tough challenge considering the Blue Hens’ youthful makeup in 2019, but the prospect excites coach Danny Rocco.\n\n“There is a certain eagerness with youth that is, I think, contagious,” he said. “There’s a lot of guys that know they have a chance to be the guy. When you turn the clock back a year, a lot of guys probably didn’t feel they had a chance to be the guy, as they looked in their position rooms.”\n\nDelaware will need all the zeal it can muster next year against a 12-game schedule featuring a visit to Pitt, a home game against FCS power North Dakota State and the usually perilous Colonial Athletic Association minefield.\n\nHere are eight questions lingering from this year and pointed toward next season, with a particularly interesting take from Rocco on future UD defenses.\n\n1. Was this a successful season?\n\nFor the most part, certainly.\n\nThe Blue Hens returned to the FCS playoffs and were, until the final regular-season Saturday, in contention for the CAA championship. En route, they scored wins over Top 10 teams Elon and Towson during a five-game win streak.\n\nThey were then dealt a very difficult first-round playoff matchup at James Madison, where the defense was up to the task and the offense wasn’t in a 20-6 JMU win.\n\n“I was really proud of how hard our players played last Saturday,” Rocco said. “We played better on defense. It doesn’t mean we didn’t play hard on offense.”\n\nThe spate of errors that doomed Delaware in a 21-19 season-opening loss to Rhode Island was a disappointment, as was Villanova’s continued dominance in the regular-season finale.\n\nRocco felt a solid foundation was laid for future success.\n\n2. What about the quarterback situation?\n\nPat Kehoe completed just 13 of 32 passes for 116 yards with two late interceptions and was sacked five times while often under a heavy rush at JMU. His 49.3 completion percentage for the season is lowest among CAA starters and he's ninth in QB efficiency.\n\nBut Rocco said the partially torn ACL that Kehoe suffered at New Hampshire on Oct. 20 played a large part in that. It was clear he wasn't the same quarterback in November he was in September.\n\n“Late in the year when people rushed our passer,” Rocco said, “they had no concern about pass-rush lanes because they felt the quarterback was not going to escape.”\n\nKehoe started the season strong and gave the Hens the downfield passing attack they’d lacked.\n\nKehoe was named Colonial Athletic Association Offensive Player of the Week after the Blue Hens’ 40-36 comeback win over Towson. He completed 18 of 32 passes for a career-high 305 yards and four touchdowns.\n\n“Pat will be at his best and I think we all have an image of what that will look like,” Rocco said. “Pat at his best is pretty good and certainly capable of leading this team.”\n\nIn addition, Nolan Henderson came off the bench when Kehoe got hurt against Villanova and showed an ability to extend plays. Rocco called the Smyrna High grad’s showing “very much attention-getting.”\n\nFreshman Anthony Paoletti also made a positive impression, including when it appeared he might be pressed into service at JMU.\n\nRocco said neither Kehoe’s knee or Henderson’s ankle injury, which kept him out at JMU, will require surgery.\n\n3. What about that running game?\n\nDelaware is 11th among CAA teams in rushing offense (105.3 yards per game) and yards per carry (3), awful numbers for a school with a traditionally strong ground attack, though that number is skewed by sacks.\n\nKani Kane being sidelined the last two games with a knee injury didn’t help. Dejoun Lee (4.9-yard average) had a strong debut season. Penn State transfer Andre Robinson, who gained 62 yards on 23 carries, will likely figure in more next season.\n\nIt did seem odd that Delaware never called on seniors Kareem Williams and Thomas Jefferson, though Jefferson was switched to H-back after skipping spring practice with the intent of not returning.\n\nJefferson is Delaware’s 20th all-time leading rusher with 1,802 yards. Williams is 38th with 1,406. And they gained most of those yards from 2014-16, often when opponents knew the Hens were going to run.\n\n“All the conversations were had,” Rocco said, adding that catching, blocking and protecting are as important as running in deciding who plays.\n\nOthers had a “more complete” set of abilities, he said. “Certainly respect the careers both Kareem and Thomas have had here,” Rocco said.\n\n4. Who’ll be the new offensive coordinator?\n\nMatt Simon will not return, Delaware announced Tuesday, and Rocco said he’s mainly combing the FCS ranks for a potential replacement. There are already qualified available candidates with CAA ties.\n\n“Guys that might not be totally married to one system,” Rocco said of the kind of person he’s seeking, “but have a little bit of history of being able to adapt, adjust, use their personnel.’’\n\nHe said he’d also consider those on his own staff, which includes former James Madison, Florida A&M and Buffalo coach Alex Wood, who is quarterbacks coach.\n\nThere certainly could be other staff changes. Cornerbacks coach Nick Rapone left the staff because of family matters. He’s expected to continue coaching elsewhere.\n\n5. Talking about an evolution?\n\nAsked if Colby Reeder would stay at his outside linebacker “Kat” position, where he sometimes lines up as a defensive end, Rocco said more than expected.\n\n“We are really looking at transforming our defense,” he said.\n\nWhile the 3-4 alignment is likely to remain the basis, “more four-down structure is probably likely,” he said.\n\n“It’s personnel driven,” Rocco said. “We are deep in the D-line. We’ve got some really talented, proven players there.”\n\nDelaware had trouble getting to the quarterback this year. But the Hens often went with a four-man line at JMU. They netted three sacks — giving them 16 on the year, ranking 11th of 12 teams in the CAA — while frequently benefiting from the pressure they unleashed.\n\nWhere Reeder ends up remains to be seen, but there’ll be a domino effect, Rocco said, moving from the line back.\n\n6. What position area faces the biggest turnover?\n\nThe secondary graduates all four starters, though cornerback Nijuel Hill was a starter most of last year and part of this year before K.C. Hinton took over. Though Hill struggled in some games giving up long passes, “he didn’t have a bad year,” Rocco said.\n\nJustis Henley and Amonte Strothers are promising cornerbacks who will be redshirt freshmen next year (Henley did play in the maximum four games that allowed him to retain the year of eligibility). Concord grad Brian Dennis is also back.\n\nAt safety, freshman Noah Plack, who played in three games, is joined by Tim Poindexter, expected to return after missing 2018 with a knee injury, Joey Carter, Andrew Pawlowski and C.J. McAnally. Outside linebacker Kedrick Whitehead could be moved to safety.\n\nDelaware also has a promising flock of receivers capable of stepping in for seniors Joe Walker, Vinny Papale and Jamie Jarmon, and tight end Charles Scarff.\n\n7. Which Blue Hens will get NFL looks?\n\nNasir Adderley has been selected for the Senior Bowl and is likely to get drafted. The safety is the only player in FCS with 160-plus tackles and at least nine interceptions the last two years. That kickoff return for a TD at New Hampshire didn’t hurt either.\n\nLinebacker Troy Reeder, fifth nationally with 131 tackles, has certainly earned a chance, too. His year as a Penn State starter helps.\n\nBut others — Scarff, Walker, Papale and linebacker Ray Jones, in particular — could get a chance as well.\n\n8. Outlook for next year?\n\nDelaware loses more than two dozen seniors and two-thirds of its starters, mostly on defense.\n\nBut the offense has some talent to help offset the departures, though improvement on the offensive line is a must. The defense will have to rely on its front and hope a young crew can develop fast behind them.\n\nDelaware won’t likely be viewed as a CAA title contender next year, but will aim to prove otherwise.\n\n“I’m very optimistic,” Rocco said, “though I do recognize the challenges that will be presented to us. But I’ve got a lot of good young talent.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Villanova (4-6, 2-5), a 20-6 loser at Rhode Island Saturday, has won five straight and 10 of 11 over Delaware.\n\nCOLLEGES: Impressive first half pushes Hens past Richmond in hoops\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS: DMA handles Conrad\n\n\"To say that this game wasn't circled on our schedule from the time coach [Danny] Rocco stepped in here since last season ended, I'd be lying to you,\" senior fifth-year center Brody Kern said of Villanova, which no Blue Hens have ever beaten.\n\nMuch of the Colonial Athletic Association showdown was the defensive battle most expected before the Hens took command in the second half and scored a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns.\n\n\"Today our defense was really extraordinary,\" Rocco said.\n\nThe Blue Hens limited Albany to 120 total yards and benefited from four second-half takeaways, with Hodgson Vo-Tech grad Ray Jones, Anthony Jackson and Blaine Woodson intercepting passes and John Nassib recovering a fumble. Eighty Albany yards came on its first series, which resulted in a field goal.\n\n\"We made a couple changes at halftime,\" said Jones, \"and after that we came out and played our game like we're supposed, held them to three points, 120 yards. You really can't do nothing better than that.\"\n\nAlbany's total yardage and six first downs were the fewest against the Blue Hens since Delaware State had 112 and four in a 45-0 loss in 2011.\n\nFreshman Khory Spruill, stepping in when Kani Kane hurt his shoulder early in the third quarter, rushed for a career-best 86 yards on 20 carries for Delaware. He scored the game’s first touchdown with 10:18 left on a 6-yard carry as Delaware took a 15-3 lead. He added a 1-yard TD with 3:11 left.\n\n\"Coach always tells me to be ready to go every game,\" Spruill said. \"I practice with the ones every week so it's really about just being ready when your number's called. Kani went down so I just wanted to make sure I filled his shoes the right way and just step up and not be a freshman, just make plays.\"\n\nJoe Walker had 85 yards on 11 carries for the Hens, who had 305 total yards, with 164 in the second half.\n\nAlbany (3-7, 1-6) lost its sixth in a row and failed to spoil Delaware’s playoff hopes the way the Hens did to the Great Danes in a 33-17 win last year in New York.\n\nDelaware took its first lead 6-3 with 2:28 left in the third quarter on Frank Raggo’s 36-yard field goal. The series featured Walker’s 15-yard pickup on a third-and-6 carry from the Albany 39.\n\nThe lead became 8-3 just 61 seconds later when Christian Lohin blocked an Albany punt and it rolled out of the end zone for a safety.\n\nRaggo’s 29-yard field goal provided Delaware with its only first-half points in the final seconds of the second period, making it 3-3. That 10-play, 60-yard drive was highlighted by J.P. Caruso’s 23-yard pass to Vinny Papale.\n\n\"I really felt if we could get points on that drive we will win this game,\" Rocco said because of how the defense was playing.\n\nCaruso was 7-for-11 passing for 51 yards.\n\nAn earlier second-quarter opportunity was foiled when Walker gained 19 yards on a fourth-and-2 run from the Albany 38 but had the football stripped.\n\nThe Great Danes had scored on their second series, traveling 80 yards on 18 plays before settling for Ethan Stark’s 37-yard field goal with :24 left in the first quarter.\n\nDelaware 22, Albany 3\n\nAlbany 3 0 0 0 – 3\n\nDelaware 0 3 5 14 – 22\n\nFirst quarter\n\nA – Stark 37 FG, :24\n\nSecond quarter\n\nD – Raggo 29 FG, :00\n\nThird quarter\n\nD – Raggo 36 FG, 2:28\n\nD – Safety; Lohin blocks punt out of end zone, 1:27\n\nFourth quarter\n\nD – Spruill 6 run (Raggo kick), 10:18\n\nD – Spruill 1 run (Raggo kick), 3:11\n\nHOW THEY SCORED\n\nFIRST QUARTER\n\nALBANY: K Ethan Stark 37-yard field goal with :24 left.

Trump's victory also comes after he faced two assassination attempts over the summer.\n\nEarly in election night, the nominees picked up their respective strongholds, with Harris winning much of the West Coast and Northeast and Trump clinching victories in the South.

Approximately 60% of Arizona voters live in Maricopa County.\n\nThe Maricopa County results represented 1.1 million ballots, which make up 43.43% of the county’s 2.5 million voters eligible to cast ballots in the election.

While many states, including California, Minnesota and Nebraska, have some form of early voting, this is the last day to cast votes in the 2024 presidential election, including in-person and mail-in ballots. Depending on the state, mail-in ballots must either be postmarked by Election Day or received on Election Day.But counting the votes and certifying the results can take days, or even weeks.\n\nDec. 11, 2024: Certificate of Ascertainment of Appointment of Electors\n\nEvery state appoints a certain number of individuals, called electors, who will cast the state’s electoral votes for president and vice president. State parties choose a slate of potential electors before the general election, following general requirements set by the Constitution and federal, as well as any additional procedures set by the respective state. Then, voters select electors by voting in the general election. Electors pledge to vote according to the statewide or district popular vote.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe executive of each state must issue a certificate of ascertainment naming and appointing these individuals no later than Dec. 11, 2024. The certificates include the names of the electors, the state’s certified election results, the seal of the State, and at least one security feature set by the state.\n\nDec. 17, 2024: Meeting and vote of electors\n\nOn the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December — this year, Dec. 17 — the appointed electors must meet in their respective states to cast their votes for president and vice president.\n\nThey then transmit signed and endorsed certificates attesting to their votes to officials in Washington, D.C., and their state.\n\nDec. 25, 2024: Electoral votes received\n\nThe president of the Senate or the Archivist of the United States should receive the certificates from the electors on the fourth Wednesday in December: this year, Dec. 25.\n\nIf they do not receive the certificates by this date, they will request them from the chief election officer of the state or states.\n\nJan. 3, 2025: 119th Congress convenes\n\nOn Jan. 3, representatives-elect and senators-elect will be sworn into the new Congress. This process happens every two years on this date following federal elections.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, this is also the day that the Speaker will be elected.\n\nJan. 6, 2025: Congress Counts Electoral Votes\n\nJan. 6, 2025, is not just the four-year anniversary of the attack on the Capitol.\n\nIt is the day when the House and Senate will count and tally the electoral certificates in a joint session, starting in the early afternoon. The U.S. Constitution names the vice president as the president of the Senate and formally presides over the receiving and counting of electoral ballots cast in presidential elections and announces the result of the count.\n\nJan. 20, 2025: Inauguration Day\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2025, people will fill the National Mall in D.C. to watch the elected president and vice president be sworn in.

But she doesn't walk ...", "text": "Keith A. Owens\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nAs I watched the opening night of the Democratic National Convention on Monday night, my poor TV almost suffered a meltdown, right there in my living room, from all the excessive glee and exuberance being pumped through the screen. Granted, the entire purpose of these conventions is to exhibit non-stop positivity, but I’ve seen a lot of them, and I don’t recall one quite like this. Maybe not even in 2008, when Barack Obama was the Democratic nominee, and that was one of the most highly charged Democratic conventions I can remember.\n\nAfter just two nights, Chicago’s United Center was already defying the laws of gravity as it levitated into the night sky.\n\nAnd I get it, because if you’re a Democrat — or even a rational Republican who doesn’t want to see the country go up in orange smoke — this has to feel pretty good. Maybe even really good.\n\nWe just need to (please, y’all) keep in mind that even if Vice President Kamala Harris does win this thing — and at this point I feel rather certain that she will, and not by a close margin — the woman does not walk on water. There's a virtual guarantee that within a matter of months, if not weeks, after she is elected as the first female and the first Afro/Asian president in history, she will likely do and/or say something to really tick some folks off, and I don’t mean just Republicans. And that before the end of the end of that first glorious year of reclamation and salvation of democracy, Kamala’s radically historic presidency will no longer feel quite so glorious or shiny and new, and she will simply be the 47th President of the United States, for better, and also for worse.\n\nAt DNC, Joe Biden defiedthe old, stumbling man caricature that forced him from the race\n\nMistakes are a feature, not a bug\n\nDon’t misunderstand; I’m not saying Harris won’t be a great president, because I strongly believe she has that capability, and will likely deliver. But every single one of our great presidents who has done great things has also made some tremendous errors of judgment, and at one time or another has just screwed up.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt barely paid attention to lynchings in the South because of how it might affect him politically until his wife, Eleanor, applied pressure. John F. Kennedy Jr.'s infidelities just about made Bill Clinton look like a choirboy, but more important, he was frustratingly hesitant to get involved in supporting the civil rights struggle for the same reason FDR tried to duck the lynching issue.\n\nLyndon B. Johnson made some rather gross miscalculations when it came to the Vietnam War. And no small number of Democrats are not just frustrated but enraged at how President Joe Biden has handled — or mishandled — the U.S. response to the war in Gaza.\n\nSome of these leaders' reputations were tarnished for years, to come until historians were able to present their presidencies in full and in context — and to remind us that these presidents were humans, with human frailties and flaws.\n\nBack to the happy stuff\n\nBut hey! Sorry for the reality downer. It’s just kinda my job as a journalist. So for the remainder of my time, just to balance things out, I’ll share some of my favorite moments and quotes from the DNC thus far:\n\nU.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, asked voters which of the two candidates they would hire: “Kamala Harris has a résumé,” she said. “Donald Trump has a rap sheet.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, pointed out that Mike Pence is the first vice president in more than 200 years not to support the president he served: “J.D. Vance, do you understand why there was a sudden job opening for running mate on the [Republican] ticket? They tried to kill your predecessor!”\n\nGOP's '#TamponTim'attack will backfire\n\nAnd then there was Hadley Duvall, who became pregnant after being raped by her stepfather after years of sexual abuse. She took strong issue with Trump’s position that she should have been forced to carry the baby to term and that to do so would have been a “beautiful thing.” Her story was one of several jarring accounts demonstrating why women must have the right to choose: “What is so beautiful about a child carrying her parent’s child?” she asked.\n\nAnd finally there was Georgia’s Sen.

After defeating Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump will serve a second term in the White House as the 47th President of the United States.\n\nDespite being president-elect, Trump still faces criminal charges relating to interfering with the 2016 presidential election. What does this mean, and how will his status as a convicted felon impact his presidency? Here's what we know.\n\nPeople are also reading:Debunking false, misleading claims about President-elect Trump | Fact check roundup\n\nWhat does 'convicted felon' mean?\n\nA convicted felon is anyone who has been found guilty of a felony — a category of crime that's more serious in nature and typically comes with greater penalties.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nIn most cases, being a convicted felon has significant implications for U.S. citizens, varying by state. For example, such convictions can prevent individuals from voting and applying for certain jobs and loans.\n\nIs Trump a convicted felon? What was Trump convicted of?\n\nIn a historic six-week trial in May, Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records after high-profile witnesses laid out the evidence that he allegedly covered up hush money payments to a porn star to hide another crime. The jury of 12 made the decision unanimously.\n\nThey alleged Trump falsified the records to conceal unlawfully interfering in the 2016 presidential election through the $130,000 hush money payment, making the falsification charges felonies. The crime carries a penalty of up to four years in prison, but legal experts previously told USA TODAY that Trump is likely to get only probation or a shorter sentence.\n\nThe sentencing was initially scheduled for July 11, but New York's Judge Juan Merchan granted its postponement after Trump's lawyers requested more time to get the decision overturned via the Supreme Court's July 1 immunity decision — which protects Trump from prosecution related to some actions he took as president, as they relate to his interference with the 2016 federal election.\n\nThen the criminal sentencing was pushed back a second time, as Merchan justified its delay to maintain neutrality on the presidential election. Trump is scheduled to appear in court for the highly-anticipated sentencing on Nov. 26.\n\nCan a convicted felon be President of the US?\n\nJust weeks prior to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, people took to social media to question Trump's legitimacy to run for office once more after being found guilty of 34 felony counts in the state of New York.\n\nNeither the 14th Amendment nor any other part of the Constitution bans felons from taking office, an expert told USA TODAY. The section referenced in the post prohibits anyone who took an oath to uphold the Constitution and \"engaged in insurrection\" from taking office, but a Supreme Court decision in March requires Congress to act in order for it to be enforced.\n\nDid Trump vote as a convicted felon?\n\nYes. Trump resides in Florida, where it is usually difficult to vote as a convicted felon. However, for those convicted in other states, it defers to the laws of the state in which the individual was prosecuted.\n\nCNN reports Trump was allowed to vote in Palm Beach under a 2021 New York law granting people convicted of felons the right to vote as long as they aren't incarcerated at the time of the election.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis confirmed Trump's right to vote months ahead of the election. If there had been any issues, DeSantis said he would see that the state clemency board removed any barriers to Trump's ability to vote, according to Politico.\n\n\"The bottom line is that Donald Trump’s vote this November will be one of millions that demonstrate Florida is now a solid Republican state!\" the Florida governor wrote on X in May.\n\nIs Trump the first felon president?\n\nYes, Trump is the first convicted felon to win a U.S. presidential election. The Republican politician attracted even more support after his felony convictions than in the 2016 race, before the trial.\n\n“It is remarkable how intensely loyal his support remains,” said Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to former Vice President Mike Pence. Pence declined to endorse Trump and has criticized him over the Jan. 6 capitol insurrection.\n\nTrump campaign senior adviser Tim Murtaugh said the criminal charges that Trump still faces — which his supporters view as political persecution despite no evidence they are politically motivated — blunted criticism of the former president as a vengeful leader who would seek retribution on his enemies.\n\n“That is precisely what his political opponents are doing to him right now,” Murtaugh said.\n\nTrump is also the first former president to be convicted of a felony and the second convicted felon to run for the presidential office. Over a century ago, Socialist candidate Eugene V. Debs ran for president for the fifth time. Debs was in an Atlanta prison for sedition during the 1920 election, serving a ten-year sentence for speaking in opposition of the country's involvement in World War I, Smithsonian Magazine reports\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry ran for president alongside Trump in the 2016 Republican primary after being indicted two years earlier for abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public official, but he dropped out of the race a few months into the primary.\n\nRead more:14th Amendment doesn't ban felons from taking office | Fact check\n\n7 things you can't do as a convicted felon\n\nThe rights of those convicted of felonies vary by state. In cases like Florida, the state where an individual was convicted can be just as important as the state of residence. Black Law's Dictionary lists the following rights a convicted felon risks losing in the U.S.:\n\nvote\n\ntravel abroad\n\nbear or own firearms\n\nserve on a jury\n\nwork in certain fields\n\nreceive public social benefits and housing\n\nreceive parental benefits\n\n— USA TODAY contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/08/06/kamala-harris-us-presidential-election-odds-2024-tim-walz-vp-donald-trump/74685549007/", "title": "What are Kamala Harris' odds to be next U.S. president after ...", "text": "The race for who will become the 47th president of the United States is on and heating up following the Democratic National Convention that took place last week at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe betting odds have shifted in Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, favor following the DNC and naming Minnesota Gov.

When will Donald Trump be sworn in?", "text": "Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2024 election early Wednesday morning. Now, Americans may be wondering, what is next? As of Wednesday morning, Kamala Harris has not conceded yet, and Trump won't be sworn in for months. Here's a look at the timeline between now and Trump's first day of his second term as the president of the United States.\n\nHas Kamala Harris conceded the presidential race yet? When and where will Kamala Harris deliver her concession speech?\n\nNo, but she is expected to speak at Howard University in Washington, D.C., around 1 p.m. PST. Harris had been expected to address her election night party Tuesday night at Howard University, a historically Black college where she was an undergraduate, USA Today reported.\n\nHowever, Harris ultimately did not speak Tuesday night, and the election results spelled out a clear victory for Trump early Wednesday morning.\n\nPolls showed a neck-and-neck race between Trump and Harris. When did it become clear Trump would win?\n\nAfter Trump won North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — all key swing states that had been considered a toss-up weeks prior to the election — the former president had a clear path to victory. Nevada was also a swing state that went red for the first time in two decades.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nHarris became the Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July following a poor performance against Trump in a June 27 presidential debate.\n\nDuring her three-month campaign, Harris faced the challenges of ties to Biden — whose disapproval ratings in exit polls Tuesday rated about 41% — as well as a short amount of time to campaign.\n\nThe Harris campaign and Democratic Party fundraising committees set fundraising records, including raising more than $1 billion since Harris became the nominee. Many billionaires, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, also supported Harris. Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person, was among those who supported Trump.\n\nWhen will Trump be sworn in?\n\nThe president-elect will be sworn in at his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2024, as specified by the Constitution's 20th Amendment.\n\nThe president-elect becomes the president immediately after being sworn in and moves into the White House after the ceremony, according to CBS News.\n\nWhat will happen between now and inauguration day?\n\nAlthough news media organizations have called the race for Trump and it is unlikely the race results will change, results aren't official. Ballots are still being counted. As a result, we still don't know definitively which presidential candidate won the popular vote or Congressional control, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAfter all the votes are counted and confirmed, the new Congress then meets on Jan. 6 to count the electoral college votes and confirm the new president. It was during this process to certify the election results that Trump's supporters marched on the U.S. Capitol in 2021 after Trump refused to concede defeat to Joe Biden.\n\nNow, President-elect Trump and running mate JD Vance's team will organize the transition of power with Biden’s administration.\n\nThis includes identifying policy priorities and vetting the candidates who will take up key roles in the new administration. Trump has promised some of these roles to Elon Musk, who Trump said would be in charge of a new cost-cutting commission, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump offered a job to reportedly oversee the Department of Health and Human Services and its sub-agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), according to Fortune.\n\nTrump and his team will also begin receiving classified national security briefings, mandatory protection from the U.S. Secret Service and — traditionally — a possible invite to the White House from Biden.\n\nThe outgoing president also typically attends the inauguration as a sign of the peaceful transfer of power. Trump did not attend the ceremony in 2020 but did leave a letter in the Oval Office for Biden — another tradition — that Biden said was \"very generous,\" according to the BBC. Biden and Harris will likely call Trump on Wednesday about his victory.\n\nAfter Jan. 20, if everything goes as predicted, Trump will begin his work as the 47th president of the United States.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/07/president-biden-rose-garden-speech-trump-election/76108284007/", "title": "Biden says 'giving up is unforgivable' after Trump's election win", "text": "WASHINGTON − President Joe Biden vowed Thursday he will ensure a peaceful transfer of power following President-elect Donald Trump's resounding election victory and told his supporters \"a defeat does not mean we are defeated.\"\n\n\"Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,\" Biden said in a short address from the White House Rose Garden. \"We all get knocked down, but the measure of our character – as my dad would say – is how quickly we get back up.\"\n\nBiden, two days after his vice president, Kamala Harris, lost the election to Trump, made it clear to Americans that he accepts the result. Trump famously refused to accept his loss to Biden four years ago.\n\n\"I know for some people, it's a time for victory − to state the obvious,\" Biden said. \"For others, it's a time of loss. Campaigns are contests of competing visions. The country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made. I've said many times, you can't love your country only when you win.\"\n\nHe added: \"On Jan. 20, we'll have a peaceful transfer of power here in America.\"\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nTrump will be sworn in as the 47th president in 78 days. For the past two-plus years, Biden has warned that a second Trump presidency would threaten American democracy. But in his speech, he did not address that concern and instead sought to ease the anxieties of Democrats.\n\n\"We lost this battle,\" Biden said of the 2024 election results. \"The America of your dreams is calling for you to get back up. That's the story of America for over 240 years and counting. It's a story for all of us, not just some of us. The American experiment endures. We're going to be OK, but we need to stay engaged. We need to keep going, and above all, we need to keep the faith.\"\n\nBiden, 81, did not take questions from reporters following his address, which lasted about seven minutes. Following Trump's win, Biden has faced criticism from fellow Democrats for deciding to initially seek reelection despite concerns about his age, only to drop out with less than four months left until Election Day.\n\nBiden called on Americans to \"bring down the temperature\" now that the election is over and said he hopes the 2024 election \"can lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system.\"\n\n\"It is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent, and it can be trusted − win or lose,\" Biden said.\n\nMore:How Kamala Harris lost the election: The fatal flaws in a doomed election bid\n\nIn a stunning political comeback, Trump secured a sweeping victory, winning or holding comfortable leads in all seven swing states, making major gains across the country − including with Latino and Black men − and capturing at least 295 electoral college votes. The number will reach 312 if Trump wins Arizona and Nevada, where he is ahead.\n\nBiden touted his White House record over the last nearly four years as a \"historic presidency,\" pointing to his legislative record that includes historic spending on infrastructure and clean-energy production.\n\n\"Don't forget all that we accomplished,\" Biden said. \"The work we've done is already being felt by the American people, and the vast majority of it will be felt over the next 10 days. The legislation we passed, it's just only now just really kicking in.\"\n\nDuring a phone call Wednesday, Trump agreed to an invitation from Biden to meet with the outgoing president at the White House in the near future. On the call, Biden congratulated Trump on his victory and committed to a smooth transition, Biden said.\n\n\"I assured him that I direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition. That's what the American people deserve,\" Biden said.\n\nIn 2020, Trump did the opposite by pushing baseless allegations of voting fraud to try to overturn the 2020 election, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters.\n\nTrump has not spoken publicly since his remarks early Wednesday morning from West Palm Beach, Florida. The president-elect also hasn't posted on X or Truth Social since winning back the White House.\n\nBiden initially sought reelection and secured the Democratic nomination during the party's primary. But amid growing pressure from top Democrats, he dropped out of the race weeks after a disastrous debate performance. His move paved the way for Harris to secure the nomination but left her with only 107 days to make her case to voters.\n\nMore:'The light of America's promise': Harris concedes to Trump as Democrats enter political wilderness\n\nIn 2020, after Trump lost to Biden, the long-standing tradition of the sitting president hosting the president-elect was not followed.

Josh Shapiro, who made a name for himself as the commonwealth’s attorney general.\n\nMore:Election live updates: Harris to make first campaign stop in battleground state\n\nWho is Josh Shapiro?\n\nShapiro, 51, was elected governor in Pennsylvania, a “must-win” in the 2024 presidential race, in 2022. His current term is set to end in 2027. Shapiro recently emerged into the national spotlight following the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, which took place at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nShapiro previously served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 2005 to 2011 and a Montgomery County commissioner from 2011 to 2017. He then served as the commonwealth’s attorney general from 2017 to 2023 and built a reputation as a legal opponent of Trump in that role.\n\nAs attorney general, he filed challenges to the former president’s policies and battled efforts to overturn Pennsylvania’s 2020 presidential election results. In 2017, He denounced the Trump administration’s proposed ban on travelers entering the United States from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\nShapiro is a staunch supporter of Israel, a position Biden has received backlash over from left factions of the Democratic party. If elected, Shapiro would become the country’s first Jewish vice president.\n\nWill Kamala Harris pick Josh Shapiro as her VP?\n\nWhen the president announced he was ending his reelection bid, Shapiro was quick to praise Biden in a social media post, calling him a “patriot” and “one of the most consequential presidents in modern history.” A few hours later, he released a statement endorsing Harris.\n\n“I will do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States,” Shapiro said.\n\nIn addition to Shapiro, the Harris campaign has requested vetting materials from North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, and Cedric Richmond, a former congressman from Louisiana who served as a top aide in the Biden White House and on his campaign.\n\nThe Harris campaign said on Wednesday that any reporting on developments or updates in Vice President Harris’ running mate search is “premature and speculative.”\n\nRachel Barber is a 2024 election fellow at USA TODAY, focusing on politics and education.

It's meant to keep one state with a large population from having control of the entire election.\n\nTennessee has 11 Electoral College votes, and has had this number since the 1984 election. Three and four are the most common numbers of Electoral College votes with seven states having three and seven states having four.\n\nWhat is the Electoral College?\n\nThe Electoral College is how the president of the United States is elected. In the U.S., there are 538 votes up for grabs between all 50 states and the District of Columbia. To win the election, a candidate needs to secure 270 electoral votes which is the majority of the College.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nAccording to the National Archives, before a general election, each candidate running for president chooses a slate of electors for every state. If the candidate is declared the winner in the state, their slate is then able to cast their vote in the Electoral College.\n\nComplete coverageSee election results across the U.S.\n\nStay in the know:Download our app for breaking election news and alerts\n\nHow are electoral votes determined?\n\nElectoral votes are determined by population. The Census determines how many people there are in a state, which determines how many members of Congress a state has — which is the same number of electoral votes a state gets.\n\nA state with a larger population gets more electoral votes than a state with a smaller population. Thus, California has the most Electoral College votes with 54. Though Washington D.C. doesn't have any members of Congress, it does have three electoral votes.\n\nYour daily briefing:Start your day with the morning’s top news\n\nHow has Tennessee voted in the past?\n\nIn the past 100 years, Tennessee has voted blue 10 times and red 15 times. The last time Tennessee voted for a Democratic leader was in 1992 and 1996 for Former President Bill Clinton.\n\nWhat's the point of the popular vote?\n\nThe popular vote helps determine how many electoral votes each candidate gets. It is not meant to determine who the majority of the country wants, but rather, who each state wants as president.\n\nAfter each state counts the popular vote, determining a winner, the Electoral College members for each state vote will go towards that candidate. The candidate who gets more than 270 electoral votes becomes the next president.\n\nMost states have a winner-take-all policy, but in Nebraska and Maine, the votes are handed out based on which candidate wins each of the state’s congressional districts. In 2020, Joe Biden took one out of the five votes in Nebraska while Trump took one out of the four votes in Maine.\n\nAmerica decides:See Tennessee's general election results\n\nCan there be a tie in the Electoral College?\n\nIt is possible for two candidates to get 269 votes each, but highly unlikely. If it does happen, there is a complicated process that follows.\n\nFirst, the newly elected members of the House of Representatives would gather to vote for the new president. Here, each state’s delegation would get one vote. For example, California’s 52 House of Representatives members would have one vote the same as Wyoming’s single member, according to USA.gov.\n\nThen, the Senate would gather to vote for the new vice president, so theoretically, a Harris-Vance or a Trump-Walz administration could be possible.\n\nIn the Senate, every senator would have their own vote with a simple majority needed to choose a winner.\n\nElectoral College map 2024: How many votes does each state have?\n\nWhen was the last time a state increased the number of Electoral College votes?\n\nThere haven't been any changes to the Electoral College since the 2012 election where 18 states either gained or lost votes.\n\nArizona went from 10 votes in 2008 to 11 votes in 2012.\n\nFlorida went from 27 votes in 2008 to 29 votes in 2012.\n\nGeorgia went from 15 votes in 2008 to 16 votes in 2012.\n\nIllinois went from 21 votes in 2008 to 20 votes in 2012.\n\nIowa went from 7 votes in 2008 to 6 votes in 2012.\n\nLouisiana went from 9 votes in 2008 to 8 votes in 2012.\n\nMassachusetts went from 12 votes in 2008 to 11 votes in 2012.\n\nMichigan went from 17 votes in 2008 to 16 votes in 2012.\n\nMissouri went from 11 votes in 2008 to 10 votes in 2012.\n\nNevada went from 5 votes in 2008 to 6 votes in 2012.\n\nNew Jersey went from 15 votes in 2008 to 14 votes in 2012.\n\nNew York went from 31 votes in 2008 to 29 votes in 2012.\n\nOhio went from 20 votes in 2008 to 18 votes in 2012.\n\nPennsylvania went from 21 votes in 2008 to 20 votes in 2012.\n\nSouth Carolina went from 8 votes in 2008 to 9 votes in 2012.\n\nTexas went from 34 votes in 2008 to 38 votes in 2012.\n\nUtah went from 5 votes in 2008 to 6 votes in 2012.\n\nVirginia went from 11 votes in 2008 to 12 votes in 2012.\n\nDiana Leyva covers trending news and service journalism for The Tennessean.

Jim Pillen to usher a bill through the Legislature to reinstate the state winner system. Although Republicans are in the majority and Pillen was supportive, the effort didn't have the 33 votes it needed to overcome a filibuster, but Pillen and other state Republicans are toying with idea of calling a special session to push it through if they can find the votes.\n\n\"I and other conservatives have worked diligently to assess legislative support for WTA (winner-take-all) in a pre-election special session,\" Pillen said in a statement last week.\n\n\"At this time, I have not yet received the concrete and public indication that 33 senators would vote for WTA,” Pillen said. “If that changes, I will enthusiastically call a special session.”\n\nIn an attempt to sway a handful of Republican state senators to back winner-take-all, South Carolina Sen.

It also happened three times in the 1800s.\n\nThis is often cited by critics as the main flaw of the system.\n\nAdvocates of the electoral college say it forces candidates to seek votes from a range of states, rather than just piling up support in big urban areas.\n\nWhen do electors vote?\n\nThe electors will meet on Dec. 17 to officially cast their votes and send the results to Congress. The candidate that wins 270 electoral votes or more becomes president.\n\nThose votes are officially tallied by Congress on Jan. 6, and the president is sworn in on Jan. 20.\n\nDo electors ever go rogue?\n\nGenerally, the meeting of electors is a ceremonial event where they simply rubber-stamp votes for the candidate who won their respective states.\n\nBut in 2016, seven of the 538 electors recorded their vote for someone other than their state's popular vote winner, an unusually high number. Three of these seven electors voted for Colin Powell, a former U.S. secretary of state, even though they represented states that picked the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. Trump ultimately won that election.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 33 states and the District of Columbia have laws, some of which include criminal penalties, to try to prevent \"faithless\" electors from voting for someone else.\n\nWhat happens if there is a tie?\n\nOne of the flaws of the system is that it can theoretically produce a 269-269 tie. If that occurs, a newly elected House of Representatives would decide the fate of the presidency on Jan. 6, with each state voting as a unit, as required by the 12th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nCurrently, Republicans control 26 state delegations, while Democrats control 22. Minnesota and North Carolina are tied between Democratic and Republican members.\n\nWill the Electoral College system ever change?\n\nCongress tried to repair flaws that were exposed after the 2020 election, when Trump falsely claimed he won. Prosecutors have said he pressured state officials to try to overturn the results.\n\nIn 2022, Congress passed the Electoral Count Reform Act to clarify that each state's governor or other official chosen by the state will certify the state's election results before they are delivered to Congress.\n\nThe new law also aims to prevent a repeat of the 1876 election deadlock, when three states submitted \"dueling slates of electors\"— one slate certified by the state's lawmakers and a competing slate by a state official.\n\nThe law also set a mandatory deadline for certifying results, giving states 36 days after the 2024 election to complete recounts and litigation.Reuters contributed to the reporting of this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/05/who-is-winning-the-presidential-election-michigan-results/75950997007/", "title": "Who's winning the presidential election in Michigan?

This is, of course, the big one, the one consuming almost everyone's attention nationwide, with Harris taking over as her party's nominee this summer and facing Trump. Harris is the first Black woman and first woman of South Asian descent to be a major party's presidential nominee. Trump, meanwhile, is representing his party for the third presidential election in a row. Expect this to be a close one, with vote counting to stretch beyond Election Day itself and Michigan — along with Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania (and maybe even North Carolina) — will play an oversized role in the outcome.\n\nWe are tracking all the votes as they come in, as both candidates vie for the 270 electoral votes needed to be elected the 47th President of the United States.

While results will start pouring in when the polls close, the outcome of any race may not be clear for awhile. It depends on how close the race is and how many voters return their absentee ballots on Election Day. Absentee ballots take longer to process than ballots cast in-person due to the additional steps involved after a voter returns their absentee ballot to verify and log the ballot, and then prepare it for tabulation.\n\nIn 2020, the Associated Press — which tracks races across the U.S. — wasn't able to call President Joe Biden as winning Michigan until 5:56 p.m. ET Wednesday, the day after the Nov. 3, 2020 election. The AP has called races before all of the votes are counted based on an analysis of the votes that have already been reported and other election data. The Free Press relies on the AP's calls.\n\nClara Hendrickson contributed.\n\nLooking for more on Michigan’s elections this year?

They are also wondering when the winner will be announced.\n\nHere's what to know about the polls.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nWhat are the battleground states?\n\nArizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are the seven key battleground states. Neither Trump nor Harris holds a remarkable edge over any of these states.\n\nHow many electoral votes does a candidate need to win?\n\nTo win the presidency, a candidate must receive 270 electoral college votes. Although there are traditionally blue and red states where Harris and Trump are likely to receive at least 200 electoral votes each, neither candidate has a polling lead in enough states to guarantee confidence in reaching the 270 electoral college votes, according to the New York Times. Polls in the closest states are nearly tied.\n\nWhat are the latest Harris vs. Trump polls?\n\nPer USA TODAY, swing state polls published by the New York Times and Sienna College indicate Harris narrowly leading in Nevada, N.C., Wisconsin, and Georgia. In Arizona, Trump was shown in the lead. Trump and Harris were tied in Pennsylvania and Michigan ― two crucial blue-wall states. However, the survey's results in each state were within a margin error of 3.5%. This means the leads should not be taken as a definitive and could very well be statistical errors.\n\nWhen will the results be announced on Election Day?\n\nIf this election is anything like 2020's, final results will not be determined Tuesday night. Per USA TODAY, local and state certification deadlines range from two days to over a month after Nov. 5. Legal challenges may also prolong determining the winner.\n\nSince the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in mail-in ballots, which delayed 2020's election results. In total, it took four days for both votes to be counted and for news outlets to announce President Joe Biden's win. In comparison, the race was called for Trump during the next day's early morning hours back in 2016.\n\nHow can I follow results on Election Day?\n\nFollowing results on Election Day is easy. Just check out the USA TODAY Network Hub, where election results will be recorded as they are received from around the country. The Hub will also feature House and Senate races that will determine which party controls Congress.

For the latest updates on Donald Trump's election victory and remaining House races, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Thursday, Nov. 7.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris conceded her defeat in an address supporters Wednesday afternoon at Howard University, her alma mater in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"When we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris told the crowd, drawing an implicit contrast to former President Donald Trump, who refused to commit to accepting the election's outcome.\n\nHarris called Trump earlier on Wednesday, conceding the historic election after a hard-fought race for the right to lead the nation. She discussed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans with Trump, according to a senior Harris aide.\n\nFoes of Trump, meanwhile, promised to provide his administration no honeymoon. Hours after Trump's victory, advocacy groups were setting their sights on the president-elect, who will take office Jan. 20.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which fought many controversial Trump policies during his first administration, said Wednesday that it already has a battle plan and would take action \"the minute he takes the oath of office.\"\n\nKris Brown, president of the gun-safety group Brady, called Trump's election \"troubling\" but pledged to continue the fight to prevent gun violence: \"Even though we won’t have a friend in the White House, Brady isn’t giving up an inch.\"\n\nSierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous called Trump's first term a \"disaster for climate progress\" and pledged to \"challenge Trump’s dangerous proposals in court (and) keep the pressure on banks and big corporations to clean up their act.\"\n\nThose advocacy groups will be facing a president whose party could emerge with majorities in the the House and Senate. GOP candidates picked up several pivotal Senate seats, including in West Virginia and Ohio, to seize control of the Senate.

But it comes after Trump refused to extend a similar invitation to Biden during the 2020 presidential election. Trump also promoted fraudulent claims that the election was stolen and skipped Biden’s inauguration.\n\n“President Biden expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together,\" the White House said in a statement about the phone call.\n\nTrump Campaign Spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed the call, saying in a statement that “President Trump looks forward to the meeting, which will take place shortly, and very much appreciated the call.”\n\nThe White House has yet to be set a date for Trump and Biden’s encounter. Biden plans to address the country on Thursday to discuss the presidential transition efforts.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump, Zelenskyy speak for first time after election with Ukraine's future in doubt\n\nWASHINGTON − Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday he spoke with President-elect Donald Trump and congratulated him on his decisive election win as the Ukrainian leader seeks continued U.S. support for his country's war against Russia.\n\nZelenskyy, in a post on X, said he had an \"excellent call\" with Trump and \"congratulated him on his historic landslide victory,\" adding that \"his tremendous campaign made this result possible.\"\n\n\"I praised his family and team for their great work,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation. Strong and unwavering U.S. leadership is vital for the world and for a just peace.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has pumped billions of dollars in military support into Ukraine two and a half years after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of the neighboring country. But future U.S. aid for Ukraine is in doubt after the election of Trump, who has a history of flattering statements about Putin and would not say during a September presidential debate whether he wants Ukraine to win the war.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nPelosi: 'We all pray for America's success'\n\nFormer House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., issued a statement Wednesday acknowledging Trump's victory and committing to a peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"We all pray for America's success under the next Administration,\" she said. \"The peaceful transfer of power is the cornerstone of our democracy. After every election, we all have a responsibility to come together and find common ground.\"\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nBernie Sanders blames Democrats for their losses\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-V.T., blasted the Democratic Party for its presidential and Senate election losses on Tuesday night, arguing that it had moved away from its roots supporting America’s middle and lower class.\n\n“It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” said Sanders, the most prominent progressive lawmaker in Congress. He mentioned concerns about access to healthcare, automation eliminating blue-collar jobs and the war in Israel.\n\nThe strong rebuke comes after Sanders endorsed President Joe Biden, and then Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s nominee earlier this year. When Harris unveiled her economic plan earlier this year, Sanders said he was “impressed,” and called it “an excellent start.”\n\nSanders did not mention either Harris or Biden in his statement, instead targeting it at the party’s infrastructure.\n\n“Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign?” Sanders questioned. “Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not.”\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris: 'When we lose an election, we accept the results'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday conceded the 2024 election, promising a peaceful transfer of power.\n\n“The outcome is not what we hoped for, worked for or voted for, but the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting,” Harris said during a concession speech at Howard University, her alma mater, in Washington, D.C. \"The fight for our country is always worth it.\"\n\n\"I am so proud of the campaign we ran,\" Harris told the crowd, to enthusiastic applause.\n\nHarris called on young people to continue to fight to make the “world a better place” while vowing to continue her fight for the freedoms she laid out during her campaign, including abortion rights and gun control.\n\n“While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,” she said. “We will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square, and we will also wage it in quieter ways, in how we live our lives, by treating one another with kindness and respect.\"\n\n\"Do not despair,\" she added. \"This is a time to mobilize.\"\n\nWhen Harris said the country may be entering a dark period, a smattering of attendees responded, \"We are.\"\n\nTrump was announced the winner of the 2024 presidential election in the early hours of Wednesday morning, sweeping many of the key swing states and widening his support among young men, Black men and Hispanic voters to prevail.\n\nAs attendees filtered out, younger Harris supporters and staffers shed tears as her time as a candidate came to a close.\n\n— Rebecca Morin and Francesca Chambers\n\nBiden invited Trump to White House in phone call\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Trump earlier in the day to congratulate the former president on his victory in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nHe also invited Trump to meet with him in the White House. The staff will coordinate a specific date in the near future, the White House said.\n\nIn a stunning political comeback, the former president won all seven battleground states on the road to 270 electoral votes, capturing a decisive victory against Harris.\n\nThe vice president will be delivering remarks at Howard University at 4 p.m., the White House said. Harris also called Trump to congratulate him, according to a senior Harris aide.\n\n-Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTop Harris adviser says VP faced ‘deep hole’ in race against Trump\n\nHarris campaign senior adviser David Plouffe called the vice president’s loss to Donald Trump “devastating\" and pointed to a “deep hole” Harris faced after she replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\n“It was a privilege to spend the last 100 days with Kamala Harris,” Plouffe said in a post on X, commending the “amazing staff” led by campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon “who left it on the field for their country.”\n\n“We dug out of a deep hole but not enough. A devastating loss. Thanks for being in the arena, all of you,” Plouffe said.\n\nPlouffe, who worked as President Barack Obama’s campaign manager in 2008, was among a group of former Obama staffers tapped for top campaign leadership positions after Harris secured the Democratic nomination. Harris mounted a condensed 108-day campaign that ultimately fell well short of victory.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nGeorge W. Bush congratulates Trump\n\nFormer President George W. Bush congratulated Donald Trump and JD Vance on their win and thanked Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their service to the country in a statement Wednesday morning.\n\n“The strong turnout in this election is a sign of the health of our republic and the strength of our democratic institutions,” Bush said. “We join our fellow citizens in praying for the success of our new leaders at all levels of government.\n\nThe former Republican president did not endorse either Trump or Harris in the election. His daughter, Barbara Bush, knocked doors for the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania and his vice president, Dick Cheney, endorsed the Democratic candidate.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nWho will serve in a second Trump administration?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday’s election marked the end of a long, divisive campaign that will see the Republican return to the White House just four years after voters ejected him from the job.\n\nWith the campaign behind him, Trump can now turn his attention to putting together a cabinet and a staff to carry out his agenda.\n\nA familiar cast of characters – some of whom had jobs in his first administration – stand ready to serve. Others − like the many who officials from his first administration who subsequently questioned his fitness for office − not so much.\n\nHere’s a look at who’s in and who isn't.\n\n-Michael Collins\n\nWhat is Project 2025 that outlines extreme positions?\n\nThe controversial conservative playbook Project 2025, a highly criticized \"presidential transition project\" created by the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, could draw intense interest when the Trump administration takes power in January. Harris attempted to tie the former president to the 900-page document that outlines extreme policy positions, such as limiting abortion access and mass deportation, that project supporters hope Trump will implement.\n\nTrump has repeatedly distanced himself from the project, claiming in a July Truth Social post to \"know nothing about Project 2025\" despite many of the project's creators having close ties to the previous Trump administration.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Sam Woodward\n\nWhen will Kamala Harris speak to supporters?\n\nHarris will address supporters at Howard University in Washington, tentatively at 4 p.m. ET, a source familiar with the plans confirmed. She is expected to formally concede the race.\n\nHarris had been set to publicly address her followers at an election night party at Howard, her alma mater, but the vice president stayed at her residence as her path to victory narrowed. Trump secured the 270 electoral votes needed to become the next president after he was projected the winner of Wisconsin around 5:40 a.m. ET.\n\nSpeaker Johnson: Border, inflation issues helped keep House in GOP hands\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday that the narrowly divided House appears set to remain in Republican control, which he credited to widespread support for secure borders and reducing inflation. The House will participate in a unified GOP government with the Senate and White House after victories in critical swing districts in Michigan and Pennsylvania, Johnson said.\n\n“The latest data and trends indicate that when all the votes are tabulated, Republicans will have held our majority, even though we faced a map with 18 Biden-won seats,” Johnson said in a statement. “I look forward to working with President Trump and a Republican Senate to deliver as speaker of the House on the mandate entrusted to us by the American people.\"\n\nRFK Jr. says he wants to clear out FDA departments\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said Wednesday that he plans to clear out \"entire departments\" at the Food and Drug Administration if he has the capacity to do so in the next Trump administration.\n\n\"I can get the corruption out of the agencies,\" Kennedy said in an interview with MSNBC. \"That's what I've been doing for 40 years. I've sued all those agencies. I have a Ph.D. in corporate corruption.\"\n\nThe president-elect thanked Kennedy, who suspended his independent presidential campaign to endorse Trump, during his victory speech. Last week, Kennedy said Trump \"promised\" him control of U.S. health agencies, but a member of the Trump transition team refuted that.\n\n\"He's going to help make America healthy again,\" Trump said about Kennedy early Wednesday morning. \"He wants to do some things, and we're gonna let him go to it.\"\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nWashington Post owner Jeff Bezos congratulates Trump\n\nJeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, congratulated president-elect Trump on his victory over Harris on Wednesday.\n\n“Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities” Bezos wrote in a post on X Wednesday morning. “Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love.”\n\nThe good wishes come a week after Bezos defended the Post’s decision not to issue an endorsement of either presidential candidate – a move that broke with decades of tradition and led to resignations of multiple members of the editorial board as well as the cancellation of over 200,000 digital subscriptions, NPR reported. The editorial board had intended to endorse Harris before Bezos made the decision to nix presidential endorsements, according to the Post.\n\nIn an opinion article, Bezos defended the move, arguing it would help restore public trust by ending a practice he says creates a “perception of non-independence” and bias.\n\n− Chris Cann\n\nMitch McConnell congratulates Trump, grateful filibuster is 'secure'\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell congratulated Trump on his victory in the presidential race on Wednesday, telling reporters at the Capitol that he commended the former president for “running a sharper operation this time.”\n\nMcConnell, who’s been the minority leader of the Senate since 2021 and will be stepping down from his leadership role this month, also said that he “had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor, the majority.”\n\n\"Based on the fact that we haven't got all the results, and we certainly already know we're going to be in the majority, we're hopeful that that might actually grow some,\" he said.\n\nOne of the most gratifying parts of Republicans having Senate control, McConnell said, is that the filibuster “will stand.”\n\n“There won’t be any new states admitted to give a partisan advantage to the other side, and we’ll quit beating up the Supreme Court every time we don’t like a decision they make,” he said. So I think this shifting to a Republican Senate majority helps control the guardrails to keep people who want to change the rules in order to achieve something they think is worthwhile, not successful. And so I think the filibuster is very secure.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNetanyahu, Zelenskyy speak with Trump\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had a \"warm and cordial\" conversation with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday and was among the first world leaders to speak with him after his election victory. Netanyahu said they spoke about Israel's security and \"the Iranian threat.\"\n\nTrump has long been close to Netanyahu and in his first term was widely viewed as one of the most pro-Israel U.S. presidents of modern times. Trump broke with years of U.S. policy when he moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which Palestinians also claim as their future capital. It's not immediately clear how Trump will deal the war in Gaza.\n\nDozens of leaders and U.S. allies released statements expressing well wishes and congratulations after Trump won the election. Among them was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is trying to determine whether Trump's White House will cut back on U.S. military aid for Ukraine or nudge it toward a peace deal with Russia.\n\n\"I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,\" Zelenskyy said. \"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer.\"\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nHistoric comeback for Trump, a once and future president\n\nFour years ago, Trump by most measures was a political pariah. Now he’s a president in waiting. Rising from the ashes after a bonfire of scandal fueled by four criminal prosecutions, two impeachments and a failed insurrection, Trump swept aside dire warnings that he could bring American democracy to an end and instead used the democratic system as the ultimate vindication.\n\nNow he will become the second president in history − the first since Grover Cleveland more than century ago − to serve nonconsecutive terms.\n\nA politician rejected by voters in 2020 and abandoned by many in his party after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump is poised to again become the most powerful man in the world. The convicted felon is now the incoming commander in chief.\n\nWeeks of polling had showed the candidates competing in a razor-close election, but in the end Trump won over enough pivotal states with his focus on inflation and immigration. Harris won much of the West Coast and Northeast and Trump clinched victories in the South. But Trump also picked up North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, pushing him over the threshold of 270 electoral votes to win the race. Read more here on how Trump's historic comeback happened.\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nWhat happens with Donald Trump's criminal cases?\n\nThe election victory will delay and possibly wipe out Trump’s four pending criminal cases, according to legal experts. Trump has made clear he would derail the efforts of Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith in his two federal cases. And action in two state cases in New York and Georgia are likely to be postponed until he is done serving in the White House.\n\n“I think we are in uncharted territory,” said Alexander Reinert, a Cardozo School of Law professor, said of the state cases.\n\nTrump has said he could fire Smith or pardon himself. “It’s so easy − I would fire him within two seconds,” Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Oct. 24.\n\nWhat the election results mean for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for updates and exclusive analysis.\n\nACLU ready to challenge Trump’s `mass deportation’ plan\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which fought many of Donald Trump’s controversial policies during his first administration, said Wednesday that it already has a plan for Trump’s next term. The ACLU was the first group in 2017 to challenge Trump’s ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries, one of 434 legal actions it took against the first Trump administration.\n\nThis time, Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said the ACLU is ready to fight Trump’s vow to seek retribution against his enemies, to launch a “mass deportation” of at least 11 million immigrants living in the United States without authorization and other promises.\n\n“We are ready to take action the minute Trump takes the oath of office,” Romero said in a statement. “When President-elect Trump targets immigrants, dissidents and his political opponents we will challenge him in the courts, in state legislatures and in the streets.”\n\nVance, mom all smiles after victory\n\nVice president-elect JD Vance thanked supporters after he and Trump claimed victory early Wednesday morning. And his mother, Beverly Aikins, returned to Facebook on Wednesday to celebrate her son's win. Aikins took a break from social media in July after seeing \"vitriol and hate\" toward her son, including from critics in Vance's hometown of Middletown, where she still lives.\n\n\"Too big to rig,\" she wrote. \"Popular vote by more than five million. Two hundred seventy seven electoral votes and still counting. Trump Vance 2024.\"\n\n− Victoria Moorwood, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nBomb threats linked to Russia did not alter election, official says\n\nBomb threats believed to be emanating from Russia interrupted voting Tuesday across numerous battleground states, but a top U.S. cybersecurity official said they didn’t have a material impact on the election or voters’ ability to cast their ballots. Jen Easterly, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a midnight press briefing that Tuesday's election did see some \"minor\" disruptive activities, including polling station evacuations and delays.\n\nEasterly and other officials said the hoax bomb threats were sent to at least four states and were all deemed to be \"non-credible.\"\n\n“The point is this did not impact the ability of voters to cast their ballots or for their votes to be counted as cast,” Easterly said, commending the election officials on the ground in the states. “Ultimately they were able to demonstrate extensive resilience based on their preparations for it. … Overall I would call this a good news story for democracy.”\n\nEight states vote to prohibit noncitizen voting\n\nEight states approved constitutional amendments or ballot initiatives Tuesday to prohibit noncitizens from voting, a key Republican priority even though state and federal laws already prohibit it and despite studies showing it almost never happens. All the states adopted the measures by 2-1 margins or better. The constitutional amendments typically approved a very simple change of phrasing about citizens voting to add “only” citizens may vote.\n\nNorth Carolina and Wisconsin were key swing states that each adopted constitutional amendments. Other states were Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina.\n\n“It is illegal for non-citizens to vote in our elections,” Michael Whatley, co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, said when filing lawsuits against states to prevent noncitizen voting. “Yet time and again, we have seen Democrat officials oppose basic safeguards and dismantle election integrity provisions, intentionally opening the door to non-citizen voting in our elections.”\n\nStudies by the Brennan Center for Justice and the libertarian Cato Institute have found noncitizen voting is essentially nonexistent. A Georgia audit of voter rolls this year found 20 noncitizens among 8.2 million registered voters.\n\nCenter for American Women and Politics: `Progress is not inevitable’\n\nHarris’ candidacy demonstrated much of the advantages women have when they run for office, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. She was a formidable fundraiser. She connected with voters on issues important to her and to them. Her identify gave her a unique perspective on overlooked issues, the research center said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nBut the race also exemplified research that shows obstacles female candidates face, primarily unequal expectations. That’s particularly true for women of color, the center said. While women have held nearly every political office in America, they still hold fewer than a third of all political seats at every level of office – and still haven’t reached the highest office in the land.\n\n“Progress is not inevitable,” the center said. “We have made great strides, yes, but there are many steps left on the path to parity.”\n\nCan Trump run again in 2028?\n\nTrump has run for president three times, winning the office in 2016 and now in 2024. So, can he run again in 2028? The 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits one person from serving more than two terms as president.\n\nAll presidents served no more than two terms until Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected president four times from 1932 to 1944. In 1947, two years after Roosevelt's death, a push began in the House of Representative to limit presidents to two terms. After some revisions by the Senate, the proposed amendment was approved and sent out to states, It was rtified on Feb. 27, 1951.\n\n− Chad Murphy, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nFrom pariah to president:From pariah to president: Donald Trump rises from the ashes to reclaim the White House\n\nHow Kamala Harris lost the election\n\nAn appearance on ABC's \"The View\" last month provided a friendly forum for Harris to introduce herself to Americans unfamiliar with her story.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/11/rfk-jr-interview-2024-election/73997266007/", "title": "Robert F. Kennedy on whether he's a spoiler in 2024 presidential race", "text": "Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. appears to be pulling voters from major party candidates President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nKennedy, 70, a longtime environmental lawyer, sat down on June 4 with USA TODAY Senior National Political Correspondent Sarah D. Wire and New Hampshire election reporting fellow Margie Cullen to discuss his ambitions for the race, whether he'll make it on every state ballot and what his father would think of his campaign.\n\nMore:Robert F. Kennedy Jr. doesn't see himself as a spoiler for Democrats or GOP\n\nBelow is a transcript of that conversation that has been lightly edited for clarity. Context has been added to some claims.\n\nWire: I'm going to start with probably the question you've gotten the most from people: an independent candidate has never won. What makes you think you're different and not just a spoiler candidate as some people have said?\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nKennedy: I think that we're in a different time in history than we've ever been before. I'm running against the two least popular candidates who have ever run for president. I'm running at a time when between 70% and 80% of Americans, depending on what poll that you follow, doesn't want a contest between President Trump and President Biden. In polls that pit me against either candidate, I beat them both. There's three polls that have done this. The biggest poll is the Zogby poll, which is the biggest poll done during this election, it's 10 times the size of almost any other poll. 26,000 respondents were surveyed, and I beat Biden in a head to head race 39 states to 11. So in a landslide. I beat President Trump, but [by] a much, much narrower margin. In both cases, President Biden, whether I'm in the race or out, cannot beat President Trump. I, I stay in the race, President Biden loses. If I get out of the race, he loses even worse, he loses two more states, Maine and Virginia. So what I've said to President Biden is that I will do a spoiler agreement with you. And let's co-fund a national poll in October. And whichever one of us does worse against President Trump, that one will drop out, and I'm happy to abide by that poll.\n\nAccording to pollsters, the Zogby poll, commissioned by the Kennedy campaign, has flaws in the sampling and premise that make it unreliable.\n\nWire: But this is not going to be a two man race, you pointed to polls that pit you against two of them-\n\nKennedy: What I would say is there's never been an independent candidate that we know of, that's run before, that's been able, that in head-to-head races, would be beat both other candidates. My challenge over the next five months, is to persuade Americans to vote out of hope, out of inspiration, rather than out of fear. In every poll, I beat President Trump and President Biden in terms of favorability.\n\nOh, there is a big, big majority of Americans who would want to vote for me, but the reason they're voting for President Trump or President Biden in the current polls is because they're so terrified of the other candidate: that if Biden gets elected, it will be the end of the Republic, if Trump gets elected, it will be the end of the Republic. And so they're voting out of fear. And my job is, my challenge is, to persuade Americans to vote out of hope rather than out of fear.\n\nCullen: Along with that, you're on less than a dozen state ballots right now. So is there a path to the presidency if you don't get on the ballot in every state, or on the ballot in enough states to have a chance of reaching that 270 Electoral College votes?\n\nKennedy: We will be on the ballot in every state by mid-July. We're on the ballot in seven states now. And in another 10 states we have enough signatures to get on the ballot, but we're withholding them for strategic reasons that are obvious. And we will, but we've got the four hardest states already. Those are states that everybody said we could not get, which is Texas, California, Florida and New York. The other ones are pretty simple. And the rate that we're getting on, that we get signatures, the return on effort, all the people who are professionals in this area say they've never had an easier task of getting signatures.\n\nFor example in New Hampshire, we got 5,000 signatures in a single day. 3,000 are required. We have not filed in New Hampshire, again, for strategic reasons. We're going to file at the last minute because the DNC is going to try to eliminate our signatures and challenge them and we want to give them less time to do that. But Maine, we have until August to get 4,000 signatures. I think we're more than halfway there. And that's an easy task for us. In New York, we were required 45,000 signatures, we got 137,000. And we threw out 37,000. So we really got over [170,000]. And in Texas, we were required to get about 113,000, we got quarter million. So we're beating out all the metrics, and we're doing things that the DNC and the RNC designed these rules to make sure nobody could do, but we're doing it anyway. And we're doing something that all the pundits, almost all of them said we wouldn't be able to do.\n\nCullen: In New Hampshire, just to follow up quickly since I'm from the New Hampshire paper, when did you get those signatures in one day? And also I know the filing period – it only starts today and ends next Friday. So will you file next week?\n\nKennedy: In New Hampshire? Yeah, we'll file next week. We got them all on a single day on primary day. Oh, and you know, it was snowing that day, if you recall. So it makes it more difficult because you have to ask people to take their gloves off and to stop in the middle of the sidewalk when the snow is coming down on them. And you have to make sure that their hands aren't cold so that they sign their signature legibly. And so under those very difficult circumstances, we were still able to get the signatures in a single day, all of them – double what we needed practically.\n\nWire: What are the big differences between you and Biden and you and Trump? What makes you appealing to folks?\n\nKennedy: I think a number of things, but if you look at President Biden and President Trump, everybody would remark that they're very different candidates, and that their dispositions are different, their personalities, the way they interact with the world. Ideologically, they're very, very different, their rhetoric, their style. But if you look at actually the issues that they're arguing over is a very, very narrow Overton window. And it's mainly culture war issues, its guns, its abortion, its trans rights, it's border security, and are all important issues. But they're not the really existential issues that most Americans are really deeply concerned with right now, the fact that we have these historical inflation rates, young Americans can't get into a home and neither of these candidates have a plan for getting them into a home.\n\nThey presided over this situation that we're in right now where they can't afford a home. Neither candidate can talk about the debt, which is one of the biggest issues, it's $34 trillion. And we're now paying more or are servicing that debt than for our military budget. Within five years, 50 cents out of every dollar that we collect in taxes will go to servicing the debt. Within 10 years, 100%. So it's existential. And President Trump can't talk about it because he ran up the bulk of it. He ran up $8 trillion of debt during his four years in office. After promising he was going to balance the budget. And that's more money spent than every president combined from George Washington to George W. Bush, 283 years of American history. President Biden is racing to catch up with him in his four years, he's now adding every 90 days a trillion dollars to the debt, and it's utterly unsustainable and, I'm the only one with a plan for fixing it.\n\nThe two of them presided over the chronic disease epidemic, which was the greatest expense. It’s now $4.3 trillion. It's five times the military budget. And neither of them has ever spoken of it, neither of them has a plan for dealing with it. I have a plan for ending it overnight. They need everyone talking about the forever wars, because both of them have been supporting and feeding the forever wars. I have a plan for winding down the forever wars. Neither of them have a plan for ending the toxic division in our country, which is more poisonous and more dangerous than any time since the American Civil War.\n\nWire: Can I talk to you about that division for just a moment. You mentioned that you appeal to voters on both sides. But what do you think it is that makes you appealing when your policy stances don't really fit in either party's normal platform? So what is it about you that you think people find the most appealing?\n\nKennedy: What I said when I announced a year ago is that I was going to avoid the little culture wars issues that keep us all at each other's throats. And instead, I was going to focus on the values and the issues that keep us all together. And over the past year, I think I've kept that promise. And I've identified all of these issues that Americans are deeply concerned about. But the Republicans, Democrats don't talk about that. They're not part of the debate. And those issues, again, there's the chronic disease epidemic, there's the fact that kids can't get into houses, there's the national deficit, there’s the polarization, there’s the issue of AI and blockchain, which are again, these are the industries that can pull us out of this, of this debt crisis.\n\nBut, and President Trump and President Biden have them driven out of the country. It's very important to have them here, but it's also important to regulate them so they don't become tools for government or corporate suppression of Americans, but they're instead tools that give us power over our government. On issues like the environment they both, President Trump and President Biden, are focused on one aspect of the environmental issue that is the most divisive, which is climate change.\n\nWire: I hear what you're saying. But you're focusing a lot on the other candidates, and I would love to hear why you think you're the right person.\n\nKennedy: If you ask Americans, what they really care about − those are the issues, the little issues that President Biden and President Trump are using the culture war issues or issues that Americans can get excited and inflamed and they activate the base. Most Americans are more deeply concerned with whether their kids are going to get into a house, they're concerned with the cost of $4 eggs, $4 milk, $6 gasoline. And President Trump and President Biden do not have an answer for that. It's the issues at the core of people's concerns about what's happening to America today, winding down the military, ending inflation, ending this chronic disease that is now debilitating 60% of our kids, almost everybody in our country knows kids who are affected. They're not even talking about them. No solutions, it’s not even on their debating screen. And yet, when I talk to Americans, it's their principal concerns. I think President Trump, President Biden are missing that because they need to inflame their base. They need to get people frightened. They need to keep people angry. And I'm trying to do the opposite. I'm trying to bring people together and get them to look calmly at how do we rebuild America?\n\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 40% of school-aged children and adolescents have at least one chronic condition. While estimates vary, there is no evidence that the majority of children in America have a chronic illness. According to a study by the National Library of Medicine, an increase in ADHD diagnoses could represent an increase in recognition.\n\nCullen: Changing topics a bit: What do you think of Trump's conviction, should he drop out? Should he exit the race?\n\nKennedy: You know, what I've said from the beginning is I think that conviction is going to backfire on the Democratic Party. I think it's a bad strategy for the DNC. I think the DNC feels like it doesn't have a candidate who can win in a fair election. So their strategy is to try to get rid of their opponents using the courts, including me. They're trying to get rid of me by challenging my ballot access, which is not very democratic. And I think the strategy of using Democratic prosecutors to discredit or to convict Donald Trump is going to backfire. I've said that from the beginning, and I think the events have validated that. President Trump, I think within 24 hours, they may have gotten $200 million in small donations. I think that both candidates, incidentally, are doing that. They're weaponizing the court system for political purposes.\n\nMy father, his first week in office at the Justice Department he called all the division heads, he called all the bureau chiefs and he said, there’s one rule here, we never politicize this department. Americans need to have faith that their judicial system and their regulatory and enforcement agencies are, are colorblind when it comes to partisanship. And President Trump laid the precedent by promising to lock up Hillary Clinton to appoint a special prosecutor to put her in jail. This is the kind of thing that happens in third-world countries and banana republics. That happens in tyrannical countries. It happened in Britain prior to the revolution when the king would put his political opponents in Parliament in jail in order to stop them from coming to Parliament. And the framers were very conscious of that. And I'm also conscious that we want a country where people believe that the rule of law applies to everybody. But there's a delicate balance. I was a prosecutor, I was a prosecutor in New York, and there's a delicate balance. And these kinds of cases where you need to be conscious of the optics, about whether that case is going to be perceived by a large block of the American public as politically motivated. And I think in this particular case, which was, there was a lot of indicia that suggested that is what happened. There was the prosecutors had originally rejected the case, it was rejected by federal prosecutors, in 2016, and the current district attorney who brought the case ran on a platform that he was going to prosecute President Trump. So it was politicized from the beginning. And I think it's not only undemocratic, but it also is just going to backfire on the DNC. And I think it's going to make our country more polarized. Even if the DNC succeeded in doing this, what do they get in the long run? They get a result where half of the country is so angry that they're going to be ungovernable. And is that something we really want? Or shouldn't we be concerned about America and not just winning a political contest? Shouldn’t we be concerned about trying to bridge the gap between Americans rather than further inflame it? And I'm no fan of Donald Trump’s by the way, that's why I'm running against him.\n\nWire: You mentioned your father, which kind of segues into, obviously, we saw 15 prominent members of your family endorse Biden. But I'm wondering, what do you think your father would think about you running for president?\n\nKennedy: Well, obviously, I think my father would strongly support me. I can't think of a single issue that my dad felt strongly about that I wouldn't check the same box. I think all the issues that I'm running on are issues that he felt deeply about, about ending war, the addiction to war, about standing up for the First Amendment, the environment, about ending this corrupt merger of state and corporate power that has transformed our agencies into sock puppets for the industries they are supposed to regulate.\n\nPeople have different opinions, and they're entitled to those. When Lincoln died, Seward, who was Secretary of Defense, was in the room when he died said he belongs to the ages. I think the same is true of my father and my uncle, they belong to all Americans and Americans are entitled to have their own version of who my father and my uncle [were], of what they would do on certain issues. And I enjoy hearing those debates all the time. I differ with a lot of people but I spent a life trying to understand my father, reading all the books about my dad, talking to people since I was very, very young and I think I have a really clear understanding of where he came down on issues and I'm very grateful that I share his beliefs and I share his values. And I've tried to live my life with the same kind of commitment to the same values.\n\nCullen: Could you clarify your position on abortion for us? I know it's a hot button issue. And in the past, you kind of walked back on a national abortion ban. So just wanted to clarify.\n\nKennedy: I've been arguably the leading advocate in this country, for bodily autonomy, for medical freedom, for keeping government out of medical decisions of individual Americans. And so my position has been until recently that abortion should be the woman's choice up till right until the ninth, the end of the ninth month. Incidentally, I took that position believing after a lot of discussion that there is no woman who would want to get pregnant, and then carry a baby nine months and get that baby aborted in the last, week of pregnancy. Why would that ever happen, and my understanding was the only reason that would happen was because there was some kind of medical necessity, either the baby was going to live a short and agonizing life and then die because of a disease, a genetic disease, or because the mother's life was at risk.\n\nAnd in those cases, I think is more important than ever to keep government out of the decision. That was the position that some of the advocacy groups took, that there were basically no elective abortions in the ninth month. I was shown a lot of data that showed that actually there are a fair number of elective abortions in the last month.\n\nAnd so I am, in reaction to seeing those data, I changed my position, because I think when it comes to elective abortions, once the baby reaches viability, that the state does have an increasing interest in protecting that life. And I went back to the Roe v. Wade position, which is that in the last trimester, after viability in other words, that the states do have a right to protect the child. And my position has been to try to reduce the number of abortions. My policy is called \"More Choices, More Life.\" We found that 52% of abortions are linked to women who do not feel that they can afford the child, they're the product of affordability decisions.\n\nAnd we have a program to try to make sure that a pregnancy has never terminated because of concerns about affordability of that child and part of that is to use some of the money from winding down the Ukraine war and the military commitments abroad to make sure that we have childcare for every child in this country and that's important for our economy too in rebuilding our economy. Childcare investments create 18 jobs for a million dollars spent. Investments on military create two. All of my investments, my government programs are going to be about enlarging our economy, creating more jobs in order to get ourselves out of the debt crisis.\n\nAccording to a 2023 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that analyzed abortion data in the US in 2021, 0.9% of abortions are performed at over 21 weeks. 93.5% of abortions are performed at 13 weeks or less.\n\nWire: You talked about going back to the Roe v. Wade standard, there are some in Congress who would like to go to either a nationwide standard or to let states do anything they want past a certain number of weeks. Do you lean one way or the other? Do you think that we need a national standard so people can have the same access to health care in one state as they do in another?\n\nKennedy: My position is the same as Roe v. Wade, that I would give national protection to make sure that it's a woman's choice, always a mother's choice up until viability and then at viability recognize that the states have increasing interest in protecting the life of the child.\n\nWire: You said earlier this year that the Trump team had asked you about being their vice president, they've pushed back on that. I was hoping you can maybe help give some clarity to that. Did that conversation occur? And who did you talk with in the Trump world?\n\nKennedy: We were approached multiple times by multiple people. But it's not an argument I care to win. It's just a fact. And in fact, The New York Times has also talked to some of those people. I don't know if they talked to the same people we did, but they have confirmed that that happened. I don't care whether people believe it or not. I didn't say it to make a point. I was just telling something that was true. I have no interest in defending that. It just happens to be true. President Trump knows it. I know it. And that's, you know, we may have to leave it like that.\n\nWire: It's interesting, you talked about polling with in terms of Biden, because it seems at least from social media postings and press conferences that former President Trump is a lot more worried about you. Why do you think that might be?\n\nKennedy: I take more votes away from President Trump than from President Biden. In our own polls, about 57% of my voters, if I leave the race will vote for President Trump. And in the big national poll that Zogby did it confirmed that that President Trump actually if I drop out, he wins two extra states, he wins Maine and Virginia. I think initially that he was much more welcoming to me, but I think he's looking at the same numbers as we are. In terms of the Democrats. I think they're mounting a much more aggressive campaign to keep me off the ballot than the RNC is and it's been publicized that they have a hit squad of people that's run by Mary Beth Cahill [who] used to be my uncle Teddy's Chief of Staff and by Lis Smith and a number of other I would say veteran political, I don't know why you'd call them but people who are experts in negative research and in making sure that opponents are discredited or gotten off the ballot and they're putting a lot more money.\n\nWe see them in court a lot more than we see the Republicans. President Trump has been much more vocal and a lot of his allies in the press are now coming after me. But I don't think the RNC has mounted the kind of campaign that the DNC has actually to try and make it so I can't run it all. And President Trump to his credit has said, although in private discussions his representatives told CNN to keep me off the debating stage, in public announcements from President Trump himself and from his team, they say that they'd welcome me on the debating stage, whereas President Biden has been, has uniformly said he won’t debate if they let me onto the stage.\n\nWire: I would love to ask you one more question before we let you go. I'm wondering if there are any hard feelings from your attempt to run as part of the Democratic Party. Has that changed your opinion of the party?\n\nKennedy: Hard feelings? It's not what happened to me that's changed my impression of the party, I think what everybody sees is that it's become the party of war, it's become the party of censorship. It's kind of abandoned the middle class, it's become the party of this new oligarchy of tech billionaires and I think this happened across the board with both political parties, since the Citizens United case, which was in 2008, when this tsunami of corporate money started pouring into the process. This election is going to cost them $10 billion. Well, you're not going to raise $10 billion from the little people and so the little guy in this country is now, I don't think, even a participant on any level in the political process. It's all about money now.\n\nAnd it's not just the Republicans, which is kind of where the division used to be. Now you look at who the Democratic Party donors are, it's BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard, it's the defense companies, it's the pharmaceutical companies. And that's who runs the DNC. So I don't by the way, I don't walk around embittered about stuff, I don't cart resentments around, I think that those are corrosive. And that's like swallowing poison and hoping someone else will die. Resentments tend to hurt the people who are caring them. So I just take life as it comes.\n\nBut I can see that the party has changed very much from the party that I grew up with. And I think that the major driving force in that is this Citizens United case, which is very, very difficult for us to get away from. Ultimately, we're going to need a constitutional amendment, because I don't think it's compatible with democracy. I think we're headed towards kind of an oligarchy, a feudal model in our country, and a corporate Kleptocracy, I would say, or plutocracy, which is kind of the war, a permanent war party, run by billionaires, and I don't think that's compatible with America's role as the exemplary democracy around the world.\n\nWhile corporations can donate to Democratic groups and candidates, the Democratic National Committee and other organizations are not bound by that funding.\n\nWire: Well, Margaret, do you have any other questions?\n\nCullen: Just one last quick one. If you find yourself behind the polls, would you drop out? Are you trying to make third party candidates more viable?\n\nKennedy: I mean, I'm trying to win the election. I think what's interesting about my polling that everybody has picked up on, all the people who have looked and looked at cross sabs is that the people who are voting for me, the extent they are Democrats and Republicans is pretty even. I may have a slight edge of the Republicans over Democrats right now. That may change who knows. But the big bulk of my supporters are people who had withdrawn from the political process. And it's a large group of people. And we see that every day at my rallies.\n\nI hear it when I walk through an airport, when I walk down the street, people saying I've given up on politics until you came along. And, our donor base, our people we're able to look at this and see most of them have never given to a political campaign before. I think my presence in the race is important. I think we can win the race. And I think it's important that Americans feel that its potential for democracy to work for them, and they don't have to vote for the lesser of two evils. They don't have to hold their nose and vote for a candidate they don't like because they hate the other guy worse. I think it's important to give them an alternative where they can continue to have hope for our democracy, and vote out of inspiration rather than fear.\n\nWire: All right, well, thank you so much for your time. We really do appreciate the chance to sit down with you is there anything else you think we should know we didn't ask about?\n\nKennedy: That's up to you. There's a lot I think you should know but maybe another time.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/politics/donald-trump-jr-meadows-text/index.html", "title": "CNN Exclusive: 'We control them all': Donald Trump Jr. texted ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nTwo days after the 2020 presidential election, as votes were still being tallied, Donald Trump’s eldest son texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that “we have operational control” to ensure his father would get a second term, with Republican majorities in the US Senate and swing state legislatures, CNN has learned.\n\nIn the text, which has not been previously reported, Donald Trump Jr. lays out ideas for keeping his father in power by subverting the Electoral College process, according to the message reviewed by CNN. The text is among records obtained by the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021.\n\n“It’s very simple,” Trump Jr. texted to Meadows on November 5, adding later in the same missive: “We have multiple paths We control them all.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See ex-Trump official's reaction to Trump Jr.'s 'revealing' texts 04:16 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Trump Jr.’s lawyer Alan S. Futerfas said, “After the election, Don received numerous messages from supporters and others. Given the date, this message likely originated from someone else and was forwarded.”\n\nImmediately before his text to Meadows describing multiple paths for challenging the election, Trump Jr. texted Meadows the following: “This is what we need to do please read it and please get it to everyone that needs to see it because I’m not sure we’re doing it.”\n\nThe November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake “Trump electors.”\n\nIf all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6.\n\n“We have operational control Total leverage,” the message reads. “Moral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.”\n\nThe text from Trump Jr. is revealing on a number of levels. It shows how those closest to the former President were already exchanging ideas for how to overturn the election months before the January 6 insurrection – and before all the votes were even counted. It would be another two days before major news outlets declared Joe Biden the winner on November 7.\n\nThe text also adds to a growing body of evidence of how Trump’s inner circle was actively engaged in discussing how to challenge the election results.\n\nOn March 28, Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California, said that Trump, along with conservative lawyer John Eastman, launched an “unprecedented” campaign to overturn a democratic election, calling it “a coup in search of a legal theory.”\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, an attorney for Meadows, declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for the House select committee declined to comment.\n\nForeshadowing the Trump campaign strategy\n\nIn the weeks following the 2020 election, Trump and his allies eventually filed more than 60 unsuccessful lawsuits in key states, failing to convince the courts that his claims about a stolen election were justified, or uncover any evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nThey also called for various recounts based on those same unfounded voter fraud claims. A number of states conducted recounts in the months after the election, though none of them revealed any fraud substantial enough to have changed the outcome of the vote in any state.\n\nWhile Trump Jr. was publicly pushing various voter fraud conspiracy theories and generally casting doubt about the results in states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, his text to Meadows reveals there were other ideas being discussed privately.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump-endorsed candidate asked about January 6. Watch what happened next 01:48 - Source: CNN\n\nSpecifically, Trump Jr. previews a strategy to supplant authentic electors with fake Republican electors in a handful of states. That plan was eventually orchestrated and carried out by allies of the former President, and overseen by his then-attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nIn his text to Meadows, Trump Jr. identifies two key dates in December that serve as deadlines for states to certify their electoral results and compel Congress to accept them. Though the dates are largely ceremonial, in his text Trump Jr. appears to point to them as potential weaknesses to be exploited by casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election results.\n\nSeeking Trump electors\n\nTrump Jr.’s November 5 text to Meadows came as similar notions of faithless electors were starting to percolate publicly on conservative social media. Trump Jr. sent the text to Meadows at 12:51 p.m., just minutes after conservative radio host Mark Levin had tweeted a similar idea and suggested state legislatures have final say on electors.\n\nIf secretaries of state were unable to certify the results, Trump Jr. argues in his text to Meadows that they should press their advantage by having Republican-controlled state assemblies “step in” and put forward separate slates of “Trump electors,” he writes.\n\n“Republicans control Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina etc we get Trump electors,” Trump Jr. adds.\n\nTrump Jr.’s text, however, refers to an untested legal theory that state houses are the ultimate authority in elections and can intervene to put forward a different slate of electors than those chosen by the voters, when in reality this is a ceremonial process and the outcome is essentially a foregone conclusion.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump dangles pardons for Jan. 6 rioters while teasing 2024 run 00:58 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Justice Department and the House committee are both investigating the fake electors plot within the context of what unfolded on January 6 and Trump’s broader effort to overturn the election.\n\nThe strategy floated by Trump Jr. is similar to what was outlined by former Texas Governor and Trump Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who texted Meadows on November 4 suggesting three state legislatures ignore the will of their voters and deliver their states’ electors to Trump.\n\n“HERE’s an AGRESSIVE (sic) STRATEGY: Why can t (sic) the states of GA NC PENN and other R controlled state houses declare this is BS (where conflicts and election not called that night) and just send their own electors to vote and have it go to the SCOTUS,” Perry’s text message read.\n\nA spokesman for Perry told CNN at the time that the former Energy secretary denies being the author of the text. However, multiple people who know Rick Perry previously confirmed to CNN that the phone number the committee has associated with that text message is Perry’s number.\n\n‘We control them all’\n\nTrump Jr. also texts Meadows that Congress could intervene on January 6 and overturn the will of voters if, for some reason, they were unable to secure enough electoral votes to tip the outcome in Trump’s favor using the state-based strategy.\n\nThat option, according to Trump Jr.’s text, involves a scenario where neither Biden nor Trump have enough electoral votes to be declared a winner, prompting the House of Representatives to vote by state party delegation, with each state getting one vote.\n\n“Republicans control 28 states Democrats 22 states,” Trump Jr. texts. “Once again Trump wins.”\n\n“We either have a vote WE control and WE win OR it gets kicked to Congress 6 January 2021,” he texts Meadows.\n\nIn a series of memos in early January, conservative lawyer John Eastman proposed a variation of that idea.\n\nEastman’s memo laid out a six-step plan for Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election for Trump, which included throwing out the results in seven states because they allegedly had competing electors. In fact, no state had actually put forward an alternate slate of electors – there were merely Trump allies claiming without any authority to be electors.\n\nEastman, who has been subpoenaed by the House select committee and is fighting to keep some of his records secret from investigators, was accused by Carter of likely engaging in a criminal conspiracy with Trump to overturn the election.\n\n“Dr. Eastman has an unblemished record as an attorney and respectfully disagrees with the judge’s findings,” his attorney Charles Burnham said in response to the judge’s ruling.\n\nTrump Jr. pushes Meadows to fire Wray and install loyalist at FBI\n\nTrump Jr. ends his November 5 text by calling for a litany of personnel moves to solidify his father’s control over the government by putting loyalists in key jobs and initiate investigations into the Biden family.\n\n“Fire Wray; Fire Fauci,” he texts, referring to FBI Director Christopher Wray and White House coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci. Trump Jr. then proposes making former acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell interim head of the FBI and having then-Attorney General Bill Barr “select Special prosecutor on HardDrivefromHell Biden crime family.”\n\nAs Trump refused to concede in the days and weeks after the 2020 election, rumors swirled that he was still considering firing Wray, along with several other top officials with whom he had grown frustrated.\n\nTrump and his allies sharply criticized Wray for failing to produce information that they claimed would be harmful to the President’s political enemies, including Biden. CNN previously reported that the prospect of Trump firing Wray hung over the FBI for weeks, dating to before Election Day.\n\nWhile Wray remains in his post and Barr resigned in mid-December 2020 without naming a special prosecutor to investigate the Bidens, Trump Jr.’s text underscores just how precarious the situation at DOJ was in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\nThe same is true for Trump Jr.’s recommendation that Meadows replace Wray with Grenell, someone who not only lacked the usual qualifications to lead the FBI but also had a proven track record of doing the former President’s bidding.\n\nAfter serving a controversial three-month stint as Trump’s acting intel chief, Grenell hit the campaign trail in late 2020 to help promote Trump’s unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud and support his legal challenges in a key swing state: Nevada.\n\nOn November 5, Biden held a slim lead over Trump in Nevada but appeared poised to win the state’s six electoral votes. That same day, Grenell and Trump campaign officials announced they were filing a new lawsuit to “stop the counting of illegal votes” but provided no evidence to support their claims of rampant fraud.\n\nThis story has been updated with new details of a text message Trump Jr. sent to Meadows.", "authors": ["Ryan Nobles Zachary Cohen Annie Grayer", "Ryan Nobles", "Zachary Cohen", "Annie Grayer"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/31/business/trump-taxes-questions/index.html", "title": "Unanswered questions about Trump's tax returns | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nAfter years of legal battles, pontificating and theorizing, former President Donald Trump’s tax returns from 2015 to 2020 are now part of the public record. Many critics and political opponents have theorized that Trump fought the public disclosure of his tax returns because they potentially provided evidence of illegal or politically damaging behavior.\n\nIt’s not immediately clear that they do either.\n\nHowever, Trump’s tax returns raise numerous questions about the former president’s finances, his business activities, foreign ties and his charitable donations, among other issues.\n\nWhy did Trump work so hard to keep all of this secret?\n\nTrump broke with decades of tradition in becoming the first elected president since Nixon to refuse to disclose his tax returns to the public When Democratic lawmakers demanded them, Trump fought for years to keep them private, taking the battle to the Supreme Court – a legal fight he ultimately lost.\n\nHe frequently claimed during his 2016 presidential candidacy that he couldn’t release his taxes because they were being audited, a claim that was debunked last week when the House Ways and Means Committee disclosed that Trump’s 2015 and 2016 taxes weren’t audited until 2019.\n\nFor now, the thousands of pages of documents offer only more questions about what Trump’s finances, and may offer potential avenues for new investigations.\n\nWhat was Trump doing with a Chinese bank account?\n\nTrump reported having foreign bank accounts, including a bank account in China between 2015 and 2017, his tax returns show.\n\nThe tax returns do not show what the bank account was used for or how much money passed through it or to whom. The New York Times first reported about Trump’s Chinese account in 2020, and Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten told the Times that the account was used to pay taxes on the Trump International Hotels Management’s business push in the country.\n\nTrump did not report the Chinese bank account in personal financial disclosures when he was president, likely because it was listed under his businesses. Yet he may have still been required to report accounts to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).\n\nWhat’s the scope of Trump’s foreign business operations, and who are his partners?\n\nTrump’s companies and business interests span the globe. On his tax return, Trump listed business income, taxes, expenses or other notable financial items from or in Azerbaijan, Panama, Canada, India, Qatar, South Korea, the United Kingdom, China, the Dominican Republic, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, Grenada, US territory Puerto Rico, Georgia, Israel, Brazil, St. Maarten, Mexico, Indonesia, Ireland, Turkey and St. Vincent.\n\nBut the tax returns don’t explain what business ties he had in those countries and with whom he might have been working while he was president.\n\nUnlike previous presidents, Trump declined to divest his business interests while he was in office. Critics said his many foreign holdings compromised his ability to act independently as a politician.\n\nHis 2020 tax return showed zero charitable donations. Did Trump actually donate his presidential salary to charity, as he promised he would?\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump pledged he would donate the entirety of his $400,000 salary to charity each year. He frequently boasted about donating parts of his quarterly paycheck to various government agencies.\n\nIf he donated his 2020 salary, he didn’t claim it on his taxes. Among the six years of tax returns the House Ways and Means Committee released, 2020 was the sole year in which Trump listed no donations to charity.\n\nThat doesn’t mean his salary wasn’t donated, but it’s unclear if he made good on his promise in 2020.\n\nWhy was Trump loaning money to his adult children? And did Trump claim gifts to his children as loans?\n\nIn each year of Trump’s presidency, Trump claimed that he had loaned three of his adult children – Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric – undisclosed sums of money on which he collected interest.\n\nThe tax returns don’t say how much he lent them or why he gave them loans in the first place.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, Trump claimed he received exactly $18,000 in interest on a loan he gave his daughter Ivanka Trump and $8,715 in interest from his son Donald Trump, Jr.. In 2017 to 2019, Trump said he received exactly $24,000 from his son Eric Trump, and Eric paid him $19,605 in interest in 2020.\n\nThe bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said the loans and the amounts of claimed interest could indicate Trump was disguising gifts to his children. If the interest Trump claims to have charged his children was not at market rate, for example, it could be considered a gift for tax purposes, requiring him to pay a higher tax rate on the money.\n\nHow did Trump’s business operations and income change when he was president?\n\nTrump entered the US presidency with a vast web of business holdings, including hundreds of limited liability companies, corporations and partnerships with operations both domestically and overseas.\n\nThe massiveness and intricacy of his business operations – including companies nested within each other like Matryoshka dolls – brought a level of complexity not seen before in the US presidency and spurred concern about potential conflicts of interest, especially with foreign entities.\n\nFriday’s public release of Trump’s 2015 to 2020 personal and business tax filings may shed some additional light as to how those operations evolved during and shortly after his time in office. But they don’t spell out where money was going and to whom.\n\nWhy didn’t the IRS do its job?\n\nSince 1977, the Internal Revenue Service has had a policy of auditing every president’s personal tax returns while they are in office. But the IRS didn’t do any examination of Trump’s tax returns until the Ways and Means Committee requested an audit in April of 2019.\n\nWhen the committee asked Treasury Department representatives about the apparent lapse, they declined to provide information about the actual operations of the mandatory audit program, according to the committee’s report.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Trump received special treatment or, as the committee noted, the IRS was hamstrung by an acute lack of resources.\n\nThe lack of an audit looks especially suspect after representatives for Trump’s predecessor and successor said they had been subjected to annual audits by the IRS. A Biden White House spokesman told the AP that the IRS audited Biden in both 2020 and 2021. Representatives for former President Barack Obama told the New York Times that the IRS audited him each year he was in office.", "authors": ["David Goldman Allison Morrow Alicia Wallace", "David Goldman", "Allison Morrow", "Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/media/bernard-shaw-obituary/index.html", "title": "CNN anchor Bernard Shaw dead at 82 | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer CNN anchor Bernard Shaw died Wednesday at a Washington, DC, hospital of pneumonia unrelated to Covid-19, Shaw’s family announced Thursday.

He retired from CNN after more than 20 years on February 28, 2001.\n\nDuring his storied career, Shaw reported on some of the biggest stories of that time – including the student revolt in Tiananmen Square in May 1989, the First Gulf war live from Baghdad in 1991, and the 2000 presidential election.\n\n“CNN’s beloved anchor and colleague, Bernard Shaw, passed away yesterday at the age of 82. Bernie was a CNN original and was our Washington Anchor when we launched on June 1st, 1980,” Chris Licht, CNN Chairman and CEO, said in a statement Thursday. “He was our lead anchor for the next twenty years from anchoring coverage of presidential elections to his iconic coverage of the First Gulf War live from Baghdad in 1991. Even after he left CNN, Bernie remained a close member of our CNN family providing our viewers with context about historic events as recently as last year. The condolences of all of us at CNN go out to his wife Linda and his children.”\n\nFuneral services for Shaw will be closed to family and invited guests only, with a public memorial service planned at a later time, his family said.\n\nThe family requested donations to a scholarship fund in lieu of flowers, according to a statement provided by former CNN CEO Tom Johnson. “The Shaw family requests complete privacy at this time,” the family added in the statement.\n\nIn a statement, Johnson said Shaw “exemplified excellence in his life” and will be “remembered as a fierce advocate of responsible journalism.”\n\n“As a journalist, he demanded accuracy and fairness in news coverage. He earned the respect of millions of viewers around the world for his integrity and independence. He resisted forcefully any lowering of ethical news standards or any compromise of solid news coverage. He always could be trusted as a reporter and as an anchor,” Johnson said.\n\n“Bernie was my personal friend and colleague for more than 55 years.

Tami Chappell/Reuters\n\nShaw was born May 22, 1940, in Chicago to Edgar and Camilla Shaw.\n\nHe spent four years in the Marine Corps, during which he was stationed in Hawaii when he sought out TV news legend Walter Cronkite for advice about how to become a journalist.\n\nShaw got his career start as a radio reporter in Chicago, during which he interviewed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who told him, “One day you’ll make it, just do some good,” Shaw recalled.\n\nHis first job in TV was as a political reporter for CBS, helping cover the Watergate scandal. He’d later become ABC’s Latin America correspondent and bureau chief, where he and his team captured the only aerial pictures of the massacre at Jonestown, Guyana.\n\nHe left ABC to take a job with Ted Turner’s Cable News Network, the world’s first 24-hour television news network – a decision he said many of his former colleagues thought was crazy. “I thought it was the last frontier in network television news,” he had said.\n\nTurner remembered Shaw in a statement Thursday evening after learning of his passing.\n\n“Bernie was a pioneer, a consummate professional and one of the most respected journalists in the country. As a masterful mentor whose calm and disciplined demeanor provided the perfect tone for historic coverage that would define his twenty-plus year career at CNN – his legacy will live on in the work and minds of so many journalists around the world,” Turner wrote, expressing condolences to Shaw’s family. “The world has lost a hero for democracy and truth.”\n\n‘Boys of Baghdad’\n\nShaw is often credited with raising CNN’s international prominence and turning CNN into the news leader it is today. He was also known for being cool under pressure – which was exemplified with his coverage of the First Gulf War.\n\nHe and fellow reporters, John Holliman and Peter Arnett, made TV history by broadcasting the night of the first attack in Baghdad in real-time, and would become known as the “Boys of Baghdad.”\n\n“The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated. We’re seeing bright flashes going off all over the sky,” Shaw said, reporting from a Baghdad hotel as bombs rained down.\n\nArnett recalled how in the first moments of the bombing: “I raced for the microphone, and here was Bernie – ‘Atlanta, come to Baghdad, come to Baghdad.’”\n\n“He had the microphone first, the instinct to broadcast, to be there,” Arnett said. “He didn’t hesitate. He scooped the world.”\n\nShaw told NPR in 2014 that “one of the things I strove for was to be able to control my emotions in the midst of hell breaking out.”\n\n“The more intense the news story I cover, the cooler I want to be. The more I ratchet down my emotions, even the tone of voice because people are depending on you for accuracy, dispassionate descriptions of what’s happening. And it would be a disservice to the consumers of news – be they readers, listeners or viewers – for me to become emotional and to get carried away,” he said.\n\nDemocratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman (L), Republican presidential candidate Richard Cheney (R) join moderator Bernard Shaw of CNN on stage for their debate at Centre College's Norton Center for the Arts in Danville, Kentucky 05 October, 2000.

Tannen Maury/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCNN made its debut with Shaw as its Washington anchor at a time when other networks had White males as their lead anchors.\n\nAfter less than a year on air for CNN, Shaw led the network’s coverage of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. When the other networks reported that White House press secretary James Brady had been killed, Shaw held off on reporting until he received official confirmation – which never came and the other networks had to retract.\n\nShaw also earned a reputation for conducting tough interviews. His sharp questioning was on display when, in 1988, he became the first African American journalist to moderate a presidential debate.\n\nIn the second showdown between then-Vice President George H. W. Bush and Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, Shaw asked the candidates to speak about the death penalty.\n\nWhen Dukakis said he was against the death penalty, Shaw asked: “If Kitty Dukakis (Dukakis’ wife) were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?”\n\nThe question was duped a candidate career killer and, some thought, changed the trajectory of the race.\n\nCNN anchorman Bernard Shaw talks to his viewers while on set at the network's Atlanta headquarters on Friday, Nov. 10, 2000.

And to you around the world and across our great land here in the United States, more than your praise I have valued your criticism and your suggestions. Scrutiny can be instructive,” he told viewers.\n\n“Harder than entering this business, is leaving it and leaving CNN, especially after 20 years here. But you know, some roses are so fragrant. And as a gardener, I want to grow and smell them more – when I’m not writing.”\n\nShaw was the recipient of many awards for his journalism including the Edward R. Murrow Award for Lifetime Achievement Award in Broadcasting and was inducted into the Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\n“We were a team. That is the only way the network succeeded. That is the only way the network made history,” he told CNN staff and alumni at the celebration of CNN’s 35th anniversary in Atlanta in 2015. “We succeeded because you made excellence a habit. You did that every day … you soldiered on.”\n\nShaw said he always believed that the “most important chair was not the anchor chair.”\n\n“The most important chair was the chair at the assignment desk. The most important chair was the audio person’s chair, the director’s chair, the editor’s chair, the reporter’s chair.”\n\nHis advice to employees: “Make a promise that when you show up at work as a CNN employee you will work to take excellence one step beyond.”\n\nShaw is survived by his wife Linda and their two children, Amar Edgar and Anil Louise.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/investing/stocks-midterm-elections/index.html", "title": "Why Wall Street shouldn't sweat the midterms | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe midterm elections are a little more than a month away, and if Wall Street had a vote, it’d be for more gridlock.\n\nJust a few months ago, many political observers and Wall Street experts were predicting that the GOP would gain control of the Senate and possibly even the House. The conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that the market prefers when politicians bicker and little actually gets done.\n\n“Should Republicans take the House at a minimum, equities are likely to react positively based on the proposition that continued gridlock in Washington is good for business due to the absence of major tax and policy changes,” Daniel Berkowitz, senior investment officer for Prudent Management Associates, said in a report.\n\nBut the predictions for a divided government are no longer a slam dunk since the Biden administration signed a landmark $750 billion health care, climate change and tax bill.\n\nCongress also approved a bill that would boost US semiconductor production, something the tech sector and broader economy need due to continued snarls in the global supply chain for chips.\n\nSeveral major chip companies, including Intel (INTC) and Micron (MU), have announced big investments to build new US factories, along with the promise of lots of new jobs.\n\nDemocratic voters may also be more energized — and willing to come out in force on Election Day — following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade earlier this year.\n\nGridlock doesn’t actually help much\n\nSo now that Biden and the Democrats seem to have more momentum, should investors be worried that there won’t be gridlock after all? Not necessarily.\n\nTo be sure, the market does like a political party power split. According to data from Edelman Financial Engines, the S&P 500 has had an annualized return of 16.9% since 1948 during the nine years when a Democrat was in the White House and Republicans had a majority in both chambers of Congress.\n\nBut allow us to let you in on a little secret: Stocks tend to go up over the long haul —regardless of politics.\n\nThe average annual market returns since 1948 during periods of full Democratic control —as is the case now, albeit by a razor thin margin in the Senate — is a still solid 15.1%. The markets did perform slightly better when there was a Republican in the Oval Office and the GOP had a majority in the House and Senate, with stocks posting an average 15.9% gain annually in those years.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that when political leaders on both sides of the aisle compromise — as they have been doing a little more frequently as of late — laws that actually help consumers and investors can get passed.\n\nBerkowitz conceded that there may be more short-term volatility leading up to the election. But that could fade.\n\n“It is important to keep in mind that over the longer term, both political parties have presided over significant market gains and losses with no definitive trend other than the markets march higher,” he said.\n\nThe market sell-off this year is not unusual either given the looming elections. Dan Clifton, head of Washington research at Strategas Asset Management, noted in a report that the S&P 500 has declined, on average, by about 19% in midterm election years prior to votes being cast. But the market then tends to bottom by October.\n\nLook to the Federal Reserve instead of Congress\n\nInvestors can breathe a big sigh of relief then, right? Volatility should be set to subside if history is any guide.\n\nNot so fast. Clifton also pointed out that “there were two notable exceptions” to the usual midterm market moves: 1974 and 1978. And those were both years when inflation “was a persistent problem,” just like it is now.\n\nIn other words, investors keeping close tabs on Washington might be better off watching the Federal Reserve as opposed to Capitol Hill and the White House. The Fed’s next scheduled meeting is on November 2, just six days before the midterms.\n\nThe central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a fourth consecutive time. So Fed chair Jerome Powell arguably has more sway over the markets than Biden or any other elected official. Powell’s second term as Fed chair runs through May 2026.", "authors": ["Paul R.

Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMore from the USA TODAY Fact-Check Team:\n\nVivek Ramaswamy claim: Climate change is a hoax\n\n“The climate change agenda is a hoax because it has nothing to do with the climate. … 98% reduction in climate disaster-related deaths in the last century. Eight times as many people are going to die of cold temperatures this year than warm ones.\"\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThis is inaccurate on multiple counts.\n\nThe hoax claim is wrong: The vast majority of climate scientists (97%) agree that human activity is causing climate change, which in turn has caused an increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters.\n\nAnd a decrease in deaths relating to these natural disasters isn’t proof that climate change is a hoax either. Experts previously told USA TODAY that social factors and technological improvements, such as early warning systems and robust building engineering, have saved lives during the growing number of natural disasters.\n\nThese experts also said it’s difficult to accurately measure deaths associated with natural disasters because different parts of the world have different protocols for measuring mortality, numbers can be skewed by few high-mortality eve and high-quality, unbiased data isn’t always easily accessible.\n\nAnd Ramaswamy’s hot and cold stat isn’t exactly clear cut. Though there doesn’t appear to be a clear consensus about the rate at which cold-related deaths outnumber those caused by the heat, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports there are nearly four times as many cold-related deaths, while the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics says there are roughly two times as many.\n\nA study published by the Lancet found that there were roughly 10 times as many cold-related deaths as heat-related deaths, but the findings were solely based on European cities.\n\nOther USA TODAY debunks about the legitimacy of climate change:\n\n-Hannah Hudnall\n\nVivek Ramaswamy claim: Jan. 6 now does look like an inside job\n\nThere is absolutely no evidence supporting this claim.\n\nMore than 1,000 people have been arrested and faced charges stemming from their actions at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, with more than 700 having either pled guilty or been convicted at trial as of Oct. 6.\n\nAmong those convicted of helping plan or incite the activities was then-Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison for helping orchestrate the plot. Stewart Rhodes, who founded the Oath Keepers militia and said the rioters “should have brought rifles,” to the Capitol, was sentenced to 18 years for his role.\n\nFourth Republican debate live updates: GOP debate live updates: What to know as 2024 Republican candidates face off in Alabama\n\nA pair of viral claims about government or law enforcement involvement in the riot have been debunked in recent months. Social media users claimed a video showed a man flashing a badge while inside the Capitol, but USA TODAY reported that the man had been previously identified as an HVAC technician by his own attorney, and the item he flashed resembled the vape he was later filmed using.\n\nAnother viral claim focused on a Trump supporter named Ray Epps, who was accused of being an undercover federal agent before pleading guilty in September to charges stemming from the riot. Numerous outlets have debunked claims that Epps was a government agent.\n\nOther USA TODAY debunks on the nature of the Jan. 6 riot:\n\n-Nate Trela\n\nNikki Haley claim: Every 30 minutes spent watching TikTok makes a person 17% more antisemitic\n\n“For every 30 minutes that someone watches TikTok, every day, they become 17% more antisemitic.”\n\nHaley is significantly misstating the nature of a survey that suggests TikTok is a driver of a surge in antisemitism.\n\nThe study was published Nov. 30 on X by Anthony Goldbloom, the former CEO of data science platform Kaggle.\n\nIt suggests that spending at least 30 minutes a day on TikTok increases the chances by 17% that a person responding to the survey holds antisemitic or anti-Israel views. By comparison, the increase with at least 30 minutes of use per day was 6% for an Instagram user and 2% for an X (formerly Twitter) user.\n\nGoldbloom said this on the TikTok findings: \"This is not surprising when you consider that for every view of a TikTok video with a pro-Israel hashtag in the US, there are 54 views of videos with pro-Palestinian hashtags.\"\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nNikki Haley claim: She quit Boeing’s board over bailout\n\n“When they decided, after COVID, that they wanted to go for a corporate bailout – I’ve never supported corporate bailouts, so I respectfully stepped back and got off the board.\"\n\nHaley, who was elected to Boeing’s board of directors in April 2019, resigned in March 2020, saying in a letter to the company’s management that she could not support its bid for government assistance early in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHaley did, however, support other government funding for Boeing.\n\nShe backed a $900 million package of subsidies for Boeing manufacturing facilities in South Carolina in 2009 while she was a state lawmaker and candidate for governor, according to The Wall Street Journal. And as governor, she signed a law in 2013 to give Boeing $120 million in bond money as part of an expansion, The Post and Courier of Charleston reported.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nRon DeSantis claim: He delivered on all of his campaign promises in Florida\n\n“100% of the things I promised as governor, I delivered on those promises. I beat the Left time and time again.”\n\nThis is false. While DeSantis has followed through on some of his campaign promises since being elected governor in 2018, he has not fulfilled all of them, according to PolitiFact’s “DeSant-O-Meter” scorecard.\n\nHis most prominent broken campaign promises relate to tax cuts. In 2018, DeSantis pledged to work to lower the corporate tax rate in Florida, and while it temporarily dropped from 2019 to 2021 primarily as the result of federal changes, it returned to 5.5% in 2022 – the same tax rate it was before DeSantis took office.\n\nThe governor also failed to follow through on his pledge to lower Florida’s communication services tax, which is assessed on telecommunications, audio and video streaming, direct-to-home satellite and related services. Florida consistently has one of the highest such taxes in the country, a fact which has not changed since DeSantis took office.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nRon DeSantis claim: Haley called for unlimited legal immigration, policy set by corporate CEOs\n\n“Nikki Haley said the other day there should be no limits on legal immigration and that corporate CEOs should set the policy on that.” – DeSantis\n\nHaley responded to this claim by asserting DeSantis was lying. DeSantis – who has previously levied the same attack against Haley – is indeed mischaracterizing her proposed reforms for legal immigration as detailed during a Nov. 2 town hall.\n\n“For too long, Republican and Democrat presidents dealt with immigration based on a quota – ‘We’ll take X number this year, we’ll take X number the next year and the debate is on the number,’” Haley said.\n\n“We need to do it based on merit. We need to go to our industries and say, ‘What do you need that you don’t have?’” she added. “So, think agriculture, think tourism, think tech. We want the talent that’s going to make us better. Then, you bring people in that can fill those needs.”\n\nHaley has previously advocated easing legal pathways for new workers as a way to address labor shortages, The New York Times reported in November.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nRon DeSantis claim: The Biden administration wants to get rid of cash\n\n“So one of the dangers we’re going to face, what Biden wants, is a central bank, digital currency. They want to get rid of cash, crypto, they want to force you to do that.”\n\nThis is inaccurate. Though President Joe Biden’s administration has researched the possible implications of digital currency, no concrete plans to implement such a thing have been made. In March 2022, Biden signed an executive order to promote the development of digital assets and cryptocurrencies, asking federal agencies to evaluate the viability of such a central bank digital currency.\n\nExperts previously told USA TODAY that even if a digital currency were implemented in the future, it would serve as a possible alternative to physical currency, not a replacement. They also said as long as the Federal Reserve retains its independence, politicians would have no direct role in the creation or distribution of physical or digital currency.\n\nUSA TODAY found no record of Biden saying he supports eliminating cash.\n\n-Hannah Hudnall\n\nNikki Haley claim: ‘I never said government should go and require anyone's name on the internet’\n\nIn a Fox News interview on Nov. 14, Haley said, \"Every person on social media should be verified by their name,” but she did not say who should do the verification – government or social media companies.\n\nHaley called it a matter of national security to reduce the influence of foreign “bot” accounts that spread misinformation. In the same interview, Haley said she would require social media platforms to be transparent with their algorithms so Americans can “see why they're pushing what they're pushing.”\n\nOther GOP candidates presented her remarks as saying the government was entitled to know the identities. A day later, Haley walked back her verification stance and said she believed social media companies should be doing the verification.\n\n“I don’t mind anonymous American people having free speech,\" Haley said. \"What I don’t like is anonymous Russians and Chinese and Iranians having free speech.\"\n\n-Nate Trela\n\nRon DeSantis claim: Toddler died after fentanyl exposure at Florida Airbnb\n\n“There was an 18-month-old baby who was crawling on the floor of an Airbnb rental. There was fentanyl residue on the carpet and the baby died.”\n\nThe Florida governor recycled an anecdote he previously brought up during the second GOP primary debate in September.\n\nHe was talking about the 2021 death of 19-month-old Enora Lavenir. She and her family stayed at a rental property in Wellington, Florida, while they visited from France, according to a report from the Palm Beach Post on the wrongful death lawsuit her family filed in March in Palm Beach County.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the home was not properly cleaned after a party was held there in which fentanyl and other drugs were present.\n\nBut official reports have not yet confirmed that. The county medical examiner’s office ruled her death accidental and said it was caused by acute fentanyl toxicity.\n\nIt is not clear how the child ingested the substance, and an incident report from the county sheriff’s office did not indicate how the toddler was exposed to the drug, according to the newspaper report. She was napping on the afternoon of Aug. 7, 2021, when her mother found her unresponsive. She was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nChris Christie claim: Ramaswamy has voted in the Republican primaries for less than 12 years\n\n“I’ve known (Haley) for 12 years, which is longer than he’s even started to vote in a Republican primary.”\n\nThis is true. Ramaswamy said he was a libertarian in college and voted as a libertarian in 2004, but didn’t vote in 2008, 2012 or 2016, according to Reuters. He says he then voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nRamaswamy has said he doesn’t strongly identify with either political party and is merely using the Republican party as a “vehicle” to stand for “America-first principles.”\n\n-Hannah Hudnall\n\nVivek Ramaswamy claim: Nikki Haley was bankrupt when she stepped down from the UN\n\n“Nikki, you were bankrupt when you left the U.N. … And now you’re a multimillionaire. That math doesn’t add up. It adds up to the fact that you are corrupt.”\n\nThis overstates the nature of Haley’s financial situation, according to Forbes. When Haley stepped down as former President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations in 2018, her parents owed over $1 million and were in danger of losing their home, according to Forbes. Haley and her husband then loaned them hundreds of thousands of dollars to help.\n\nThough Haley’s 2018 financial disclosure report showed she was at least $1.5 million in debt, most of that was a $1 million mortgage. Forbes reported that she had nearly $100,000 in her bank accounts and $185,000 coming in each year in salary.\n\nThere are no reports from Forbes or other reputable outlets that Haley declared bankruptcy.\n\n-Hannah Hudnall\n\nRon DeSantis claim: He removed two Soros-backed prosecutors in Florida\n\n“We beat George Soros when we removed two of his radical district attorneys.”\n\nDeSantis has indeed removed two prosecutors that Democratic megadonor George Soros backed. In August, the Florida governor suspended Orlando-area State Attorney Monique Worrell, a Democrat and the only Black woman serving as a local prosecutor in the state, according to NBC News. Worrell was elected in 2020 with donations that included more than $2 million from the Soros-backed Our Vote Our Voice Political Action Committee.\n\nA statement from DeSantis’ office claims Worrell was “neglecting her duty to faithfully prosecute crime in her jurisdiction.” Worrell referred to her suspension as a “political hit job.” DeSantis also dismissed Tampa-area prosecutor Andrew Warren in 2022 for “refusing to enforce Florida law,” according to a statement from his office. Warren, like Worrell, was elected in 2020 with help from a Soros-backed committee.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nNikki Haley claim: Unemployment in South Carolina fell from 11% to 3%\n\n“We moved unemployment from 11% to 3%.”\n\nHaley is slightly overstating how far that rate dropped, according to numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe unemployment rate in South Carolina was 10.8% when Haley was sworn in as governor in January 2011.\n\nBut that rate never reached 3% during her term, BLS statistics show. Rather, it bottomed out at 4.4% in January 2017 when she left office.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nSupport of Israel in war with Hamas unwavering for most candidates\n\nIsrael’s war with Hamas is nearly two months old, with fighting ramping up again after a humanitarian pause that allowed for the release of hostages held by Hamas and prisoners held by Israel.\n\nMost of the candidates on stage tonight have continuously offered support for Israel, which Hamas attacked on Oct. 7. Chris Christie said degrading Hamas’s military capabilities must be Israel’s highest priority in the war. Ron DeSantis has remained staunchly supportive of Israel, calling for defunding the United Nations after it called for a ceasefire without the body condemning Hamas.\n\nNikki Haley has been looking ahead, questioning whether a two-state solution would be viable after the conflict ends.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy remains an outlier among the debate participants, openly questioning how much financial support the U.S. should provide Israel and for how long.\n\nMisinformation about the conflict continues to spread. Here are some claims we have debunked:\n\n– Nate Trela\n\nUS aid to Ukraine divides Republican candidates\n\nNearly two years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, there remain differing views among Republican presidential candidates about continuing U.S. support for Ukraine's defense.\n\nTrump, who is again choosing to skip the debate, has repeatedly suggested the U.S. is providing too much support to Ukraine. He has also refused to say whether he wants Russia or Ukraine to prevail in the conflict.\n\nDeSantis has been skeptical of U.S. support for Ukraine, saying in a March statement that the war is a \"territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia\" and not one of the country's \"vital national interests.\"\n\nIn a Fox News interview, Ramaswamy said the U.S. has done enough to help Ukraine, while Christie has said he supports continuing U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\nHaley, though, has said U.S. support should not come in the form of cash or troops on the ground, but through collaborating with allies to be sure Ukraine has \"the equipment and the ammunition to win.\"\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. lawmakers have been increasingly split over continuing to provide standalone aid to Ukraine and Israel. Some Republicans have called for aid to be tied to funding for border security and cuts to the IRS.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has frequently been the subject of misinformation:\n\n– Chris Mueller & Hannah Hudnall\n\nTalk of Trump indictments, civil trial persists despite absence\n\nFormer President Donald Trump continues to loom large over the four Republican hopefuls on the debate stage.\n\nTrump has not taken part in any debates during this election cycle and is holding a private fundraiser instead of participating in this one. Yet he remains the party’s central figure in light of both his commanding lead in the polls and his unprecedented legal troubles.\n\nMuch of Trump’s focus has been on his civil fraud trial in New York, where prosecutors claim he committed fraud by inflating the value of his assets and are seeking an estimated $250 million in damages, among other penalties. A gag order was restored against the former president who has called the trial a “scam” and a “disgrace” and asserted the judge who ruled he committed fraud knew nothing about him.\n\nThe series of prosecutions against Trump began in March, when he was indicted for allegedly falsifying business records related to hush-money payments intended to silence two women before the 2016 election. Trump also faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and allegedly conspiring to steal the 2020 presidential election, including his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Trump and several allies were indicted in August by a Georgia grand jury that accused them of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, where Trump lost to President Joe Biden by about 12,000 votes.\n\nBoth Trump's candidacy and his legal woes have been the subject of an array of false or misleading claims on social media:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nJan. 6 riot remains part of campaign\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot continues to loom over the field of GOP presidential candidates, even though none of the debate participants had direct ties to the storming of the Capitol or the certification of election results that day.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has won legal battles over the past month to keep from being kicked off the ballot in Michigan, Minnesota and Colorado. Each effort was based on the claim that Trump bore responsibility for the attack on the Capitol and should be disqualified under a post-Civil War-era clause of the 14th Amendment that bars anyone who \"engaged in insurrection\" after taking an oath to uphold the Constitution from holding higher office.\n\nThe candidates participating in tonight’s debate have largely agreed that those responsible for the events at the Capitol should be held accountable, although Ron DeSantis has balked at calling it an insurrection and Vivek Ramaswamy has been circumspect about whether Trump bears any responsibility for what happened.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has brought the events forward again by releasing footage from the Capitol, a process slowed by his decision to blur the faces of rioters. The released video has already been co-opted into the steady flow of misinformation surrounding the riot.\n\nHere are some claims we’ve previously debunked:\n\n– Nate Trela\n\nAbortion sparks debate, misinformation after Roe v. Wade ruling\n\nAbortion rights are likely to be a key issue for voters as the 2024 presidential election nears.\n\nSince the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in June 2022, eliminating the constitutional right to have an abortion, more than a dozen states have banned, or attempted to ban, abortion. Meanwhile, progressive organizations and activists have scored seven straight victories in statewide ballots, most recently in Ohio.\n\nDemocrats have sought to use the issue to mobilize voters ahead of the 2024 election. Republican presidential candidates have generally been opposed to the procedure, but vary in how they would try to regulate it if elected.\n\nTrump has suggested he would work with “both sides” of the abortion issue and has denounced total restrictions on abortions. He criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ signing of legislation banning abortion after six weeks in his state.\n\nAt the third GOP presidential debate in Miami, Haley said she considers herself \"pro-life\" but believes abortion is “a personal issue for every woman and every man,\" while Christie has called for leaving the matter up to individual states.\n\nBusinessman Vivek Ramaswamy has said he does not support a federal ban on abortion and believes the matter is a state issue but lamented the abortion referendum recently passed in his home state of Ohio.\n\nAbortion has sparked a flurry of misinformation online:\n\n– BrieAnna Frank & Hannah Hudnall\n\nElection integrity remains focus for GOP candidates\n\nThe next election is less than a year away, but the fight over the results of the last one continues.\n\nA key issue for the four candidates on the debate stage remains whether they trust the election process in the U.S.\n\nAllegations of voter fraud from Trump and his allies are at the root of two indictments against the former president, who is accused of trying to steal the 2020 election. His claims have resonated throughout the Republican Party and eroded confidence in the process, even as state-level reviews of the 2022 midterm elections found no indication of systemic problems with voter fraud.\n\nSome of the candidates taking part in the debate have made moves in their states to enhance the integrity of elections.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis created Florida’s Office of Election Crimes and Security. A year ago, his administration accused 20 felons ineligible to vote of illegally casting ballots in 2020 and charged them with third-degree felonies.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as governor signed a law in 2011 that requires South Carolina voters to show photo ID.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a bill in 2016 that would automatically register New Jerseyans to vote when they obtain or renew their driver’s license, calling it “a cocktail of fraud,” NJ.com reported.\n\nMisinformation has circulated about the integrity of the elections. Here are some that have been debunked:\n\n– Joedy McCreary", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2018/05/20/ten-point-coalition-indianapolis-donald-trump-ways-stop-violence-crime-prevention/607530002/", "title": "Donald Trump, urban violence and struggle for Ten Point Coalition's ...", "text": "The Rev. Charles Harrison is standing outside a vacant Double 8 Foods store when a man driving north on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street rolls down his window.\n\n“Ten Point Coalition’s stealing money!” the man yells.\n\nHarrison allows a brief smirk. “We’re stealing money, huh?” he says, brushing off a familiar criticism. He watches as the car turns left on West 29th Street and its tail lights fade into the night before shifting his attention toward a dozen or so Indianapolis Ten Point Coalition volunteers, who are arriving for a two-hour faith walk to discourage violence.\n\nHarrison gathers everyone in a circle and prays for “the right words that we might say or we might encourage someone who may be traveling in the wrong direction … and give them hope that their lives may be better.”\n\nAbout a half hour into the walk, one driver notices the yellow-vested faith walkers and taps four honks of approval. Less than a minute later, another driver honks twice. Soon, there’s a third horn. The sounds prompt waves and a few shouts from Ten Point’s volunteers.\n\nThe succession of derision and appreciation from passersby reflects the contradictions that emanate from Ten Point:\n\n► It is a nonprofit organization that takes credit for reducing violence in a few neighborhoods, but it does not have widely accepted proof that its work is responsible for the improvements.\n\n► The leadership consists of black, mostly Democratic ministers who have advanced their mission by linking arms with powerful Republicans in Indiana and Washington, D.C.\n\n► At a time when criticism is mounting against Ten Point at home, it is being hailed nationally as a solution to urban violence.\n\nTen Point on Thursday took the latest step in its paradoxical rise to national prominence when its leaders, including Harrison, traveled to Washington, D.C., for meetings with officials from several federal agencies. The meetings came one week after Ten Point launched a new chapter in Gary, Ind.\n\nIndianapolis is ground zero in a renewed movement of black churches taking back their neighborhoods from systemic violence, said Harrison, a co-founder of the local Ten Point and the Midwest regional director for the national organization.\n\nFor every person standing with Ten Point at press conferences, though, there is a critic who argues there is not enough evidence of success to justify giving more government funding to a group that already has received more than $800,000 from Indianapolis. Some go even further, arguing Ten Point has sold itself out to attract money and influence.\n\nA comprehensive review\n\nTo assess Ten Point, IndyStar reviewed years of grant applications and budget documents submitted to the Central Indiana Community Foundation; receipts and invoices filed with the city of Indianapolis; federal 990 tax forms; and police crime data in the areas where Ten Point is most active.\n\nWhat emerged was a complicated picture. The review found that Ten Point has failed to meet some of the basic expectations of a nonprofit organization while relying almost exclusively on taxpayer-backed funding. Criminal homicides and shootings declined in Ten Point areas, but it’s difficult to attribute that success solely to the organization.\n\nAs rival clergy and CICF raise questions about Ten Point’s effectiveness, the organization has gained support from law enforcement, neighborhood leaders and politicians who insist violence would be even worse in Indianapolis without Ten Point.\n\nThe work is personal for Harrison, who is a father of four, including a teenage son. Harrison lost a brother and nephew to violence.\n\nThe tantalizing prospect of fulfilling his life’s mission has brought Harrison to a distressing crossroad:\n\nHe can continue operating on a shoestring and reaching a few young black men in a couple neighborhoods, or he can pursue money from a white power structure, people who Harrison calls “gatekeepers,” and adapt to their corporate idyll.\n\n“That’s where the tension is and struggle is for us as pastors, ’cause we know that with the success, with more money, more eyes are on us now,” Harrison said. “And we know that people are calling for (more structure). We know that people are calling for that. That’s what they want to see us become and we’re saying, ‘Man, but this has been successful as this church initiative and we don’t want to lose that.’\n\n“If we become and we start looking like some of the other nonprofit organizations, then what becomes of this model?”\n\nCrisis in Butler-Tarkington\n\nIn 2015, as Indianapolis started grappling with what would become the first of three consecutive years of record criminal homicides, Ted Feeney nervously waited to see if his Butler-Tarkington neighborhood would escape unscathed.\n\nBy August, the first two bodies fell in the same week. The next month, the third homicide came after a drive-by shooting sent bullets ripping through a home on Graceland Avenue.\n\nFeeney, then the president of the neighborhood association, and his family were driving from an Indy Eleven soccer game to their home four blocks away from the shooting. Red and blue emegency lights flashed across the sky.\n\nFeeney saw men and women in neon Ten Point Coalition vests bringing calm to a hectic crime scene and consoling neighbors wracked with grief. At that time, Feeney knew very little about the group.\n\n\"I knew they were in the most dangerous neighborhoods in Indy,\" Feeney said. \"But then there was that realization: Hey, they're in my neighborhood now. We have a very big problem.\"\n\nA problem so unchecked that children were caught in the crossfire. One of the drive-by bullets fatally struck 10-year-old Deshaun Swanson.\n\nEven as an outcry rippled across Indianapolis, the violence swelled in Butler-Tarkington. A teenager died the next month. Two more residents died outside the neighborhood borders.\n\n\"I felt very much that my neighborhood was under attack,\" said Feeney, who has since moved out of the area. \"My city was under attack.\"\n\nNeighborhood leaders called for a public safety emergency meeting. Ten Point answered the call.\n\nThe Indianapolis Ten Point model\n\nTen Point occasionally hosts job fairs for ex-felons and organizes daytime marches to raise awareness around an unsolved homicide.\n\nNightly patrols form the core of Ten Point's mission. Small groups of people walk neighborhood streets a couple hours for four nights a week. Ten Point refers to the walkers as volunteers, but they receive stipends of $8 to $12 per hour.\n\nThe walkers are mostly members of the neighborhood, many who may have once contributed to the violence but have since sought redemption. Harrison said the OGs, or original gangsters, add credibility to the message that Ten Point brings.\n\nIt's not a group of preachers and church-goers handing out pamphlets and preaching the word of God. It's people of faith and it's OGs; often, they're one in the same.\n\nThe OGs build relationships with people most likely to become victims or perpetrators of violence, Harrison said.\n\nWhen the patrols began in Butler-Tarkington, for example, the OGs learned of a brewing war between two gangs that had caused much of the recent bloodshed, including, they believed, Deshaun's killing.\n\nTen Point convinced the gangs' leaders to gather for a meeting. There, they agreed to a truce, according to an account provided by Harrison and confirmed by law enforcement sources.\n\nThe group also comforted and guided witnesses who were afraid to talk to police.\n\nFor years, Ten Point reached into different neighborhoods, including the area of 42nd Street and North Post Road, which is still considered by police to be a hot spot for crime.\n\nBut by 2016, after expansions and contractions caused by inconsistent funding levels, Ten Point had settled into Butler-Tarkington and the other neighborhoods in the 46208 ZIP code.\n\nThe number of criminal homicides and non-fatal shootings declined in the area in 2016 and 2017, according to an IndyStar analysis of crime data. IndyStar examined data associated with IMPD's beats and zones in the area, which largely encompass 46208 but also stretch outside of the borders.\n\nFor Harrison and Ten Point's supporters, that's enough to prove that Ten Point is making a difference. It also earned Ten Point a community award issued by the FBI.\n\nFor others, ranging from government officials to public critics, the data is less clear.\n\nThe level of violence declined to an amount seen in the years preceding 2015. Perhaps 2015 simply served as a particularly bad year that would have leveled off without Ten Point's help.\n\nLaw enforcement also poured resources into the area. Federal authorities filed two sweeping drug cases, and IMPD launched three focused beats to reduce crime.\n\n\"As a police chief, it would be great for me to say it was all us. But I don't think that that's what happened,\" IMPD Chief Bryan Roach said.\n\nHe credits Ten Point and other anti-violence groups for working alongside IMPD.\n\nStill, Roach said he couldn't definitively say whether Ten Point's model was any more or less impactful than other nonprofits in town. He's hoping an academic partner can provide more metrics.\n\nHarrison often bristles at such doubt. If success in 46208 belongs to law enforcement, Harrison asked, then why did the rest of Indianapolis see record numbers of criminal homicides in 2016 and 2017?\n\n\"What did you do in these areas that you didn't do in the rest of the city?\" Harrison asked.\n\nBlack Democrats, Republican support\n\nIn some ways, the era of President Donald Trump is an odd moment for Ten Point to be on the verge of a national expansion.\n\nTrump’s most fervent positions, such as building a border wall and imposing tariffs on foreign imports, tend to be responses to the concerns of rural — and generally white — voters. Trump’s reference to “American carnage” in his inaugural address and subsequent statements about urban violence have taken the policy form of stricter sentencing guidelines and other traditionally tough-on-crime measures.\n\nTen Point, meanwhile, is focused on rehabilitating black men who have committed violent crimes — including some who have killed and might have faced longer prison sentences in a different political climate — and dissuading other young men from going down that path.\n\nThe organization's board consists of 12 black clergy members who represent churches across Indianapolis. There were no Trump supporters among the four members of Ten Point’s leadership team who met with IndyStar last fall for a 90-minute discussion.\n\n“Most of us are Democrats,” Harrison said. “Ninety-nine percent of us are Democrats.”\n\nYet, Ten Point finds most of its political support on the other side of the aisle. Republican politicians for the past decade have offered money and praise, putting the organization in a unique position to benefit from Trump’s ascent to the White House.\n\nIndianapolis Ten Point launched in 1999. For the first 10 years, it operated as an extension of the churches whose pastors founded it.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2010, in Republican Mayor Greg Ballard’s early years in office, Ten Point received $294,000 in funding from city grants. That accounted for nearly 90 percent of its budget, according to IndyStar archives and a review of federal 990 tax forms. Indianapolis since 2009 has given Ten Point at least $844,000.\n\nCity funding began in the form of crime prevention grants that were administered through the Indianapolis Parks Foundation. The Ballard administration in 2012 gave Ten Point a more exclusive arrangement, signing a contract that paid the organization $100,000 a year, according to documents released to IndyStar.\n\nCity records do not explain in detail what was required of Ten Point in exchange for the money, but Harrison said the work included conflict mediation, both at crime scenes and among rival gang leaders.\n\nThat deal lasted for four years, including two — 2013 and 2014 — in which Ten Point also received crime prevention grants. Public money typically accounted for between 75 and 95 percent of Ten Point’s budget in those years.\n\nTen Point was popular among Ballard’s public safety officers and was happy to receive funding no matter the source.\n\n“We’re gonna work with whoever’s in the seat, ’cause for us, it’s about bringing down the homicides and we’ll work with whoever we need to work with,” Ten Point board member Charles Ellis said.\n\nMike Pence, Curtis Hill plug funding hole\n\nIf politics were relegated to the background when Ten Point received six-figure contracts under Ballard, though, Harrison brought it to the forefront in 2015 when he considered mounting an independent run for mayor against Democrat Joe Hogsett.\n\nHarrison stayed out of the race and said he voted for Hogsett. But Harrison’s flirtation with a mayoral run set the tone for Ten Point’s relationship with the city to be viewed through a political lens. Hogsett took office in January 2016 and discontinued Ten Point’s contract.\n\n“On day one, the first thing the city did when the Hogsett administration took office was to cut our funding off,” Harrison said.\n\nEllis added: “They see (Harrison) as a threat and as a clear and present danger of what he might do because of the influence that he has in the city. Some of this, too, is, I just think it’s retribution in their minds.”\n\nHogsett administration officials denied those characterizations, noting the mayor has annually increased the city’s crime prevention grant program to $2.5 million in 2018. But, to qualify, nonprofit organizations must apply through the Central Indiana Community Foundation, a third-party organization that administers the grants.\n\nTen Point had been the only crime prevention nonprofit receiving direct funding from the city.\n\n“We want to make sure that we’re fair and honest across the board with every organization,” said the Rev. David Hampton, the deputy mayor of neighborhood engagement under Hogsett. “Everybody has the same opportunity with the same level of matrix and the same accountability that we expect.”\n\nHampton’s role in the Hogsett administration might have exacerbated some of the tensions among Ten Point and its supporters. Hampton is pastor of Light of the World Christian Church and a member of Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis, a coalition of black ministers that has been critical of Ten Point.\n\nHampton said ending Ten Point’s contract with the city had nothing to do with politics or personal conflicts.\n\n“There was never any animosity,” Hampton said. “I think that was all perceived.”\n\nTen Point’s relationship with the Hogsett administration has improved in recent months. Since becoming mayor, Hogsett has spoken at Ten Point's annual fundraiser, visited Harrison's church and met with Harrison for lunch at a Red Lobster. After criticizing Hogsett in previous conversations with IndyStar, Harrison recently struck a conciliatory tone when discussing the mayor’s decision to hire a director of community violence reduction and peacekeepers, who likely will perform work similar to Ten Point.\n\n“If that’s what the mayor wants to do, the mayor has to answer to the public about the violence in the city, not me,” Harrison said. “So, if that’s the direction he wants to go, then certainly we will be supportive of that.”\n\nAlthough Hogsett’s election cut off a direct funding stream for Ten Point, the group remained popular among Republican elected officials. Butler-Tarkington leaders celebrated Ten Point’s work, crediting the group with helping the neighborhood go one year and then two years without a homicide. As Butler-Tarkington became a symbol of success, Ten Point’s profile increased, making Harrison and Ellis go-to voices for media covering the city’s violence.\n\nState officials took notice.\n\nAs speculation swirled in July 2016 that Trump was considering selecting Pence as his running mate, the Indiana governor joined Ten Point on a walk through troubled neighborhoods. Pence made no promise of state money, but foreshadowed future opportunities.\n\n“I think this is a model program where people have really poured themselves into the lives of these communities and made real change,” Pence said at the time. “My hope is that as more and more people around the state and around the country learn about this program, it will inspire more programs just like it.”\n\nA little more than a year later, Pence returned as vice president to host a $250-a-plate fundraiser which, Harrison said, generated more than $100,000. During the same week, Indiana’s Republican attorney general, Curtis Hill, announced his office would provide $500,000 in seed money to expand Ten Point’s model to other cities in Indiana. Soon, Harrison hinted discussions were underway with Jeff Sessions, Trump’s attorney general, for some type of relationship with the federal government.\n\nQuestions about financial oversight\n\nAs Harrison pitches Ten Point's model to state and federal officials, there is disagreement over whether Ten Point has been effective in Indianapolis or even demonstrated that it is a sustainable 501(c)(3) organization.\n\nTen Point defends its work by citing a simple formula as proof that it is making Indianapolis safer.\n\n“How we evaluate success is the reduction of nonfatal shootings and homicides,” Harrison said. “So, in the area where we work in, if we have 10 homicides in the neighborhood, our goal is to reduce that 10 the next year. So, if we reduce it to eight, it’s a reduction.”\n\nAs far as Ten Point is concerned, the drop in homicides in Butler-Tarkington after 2015 is all anyone needs to know. Proponents point to similar parameters. Hill, the state attorney general funding an expansion into the east side and Gary, told IndyStar he defines Ten Point’s success based on the homicide trends in the group’s neighborhoods relative to the rest of the city.\n\n“Ten Point’s objective is to save lives,” Hill said. “So, if you look at the neighborhoods in which it’s operating over the last two years and compare that to the lives that have been lost across the rest of the city, or in some of the hot spots in the city, clearly we’re seeing that the violence is down. That’s a good thing.”\n\nBut others who have examined Ten Point reject its assertion that neighborhood homicide statistics tell the whole story.\n\nPerhaps no organization has spent more time evaluating Ten Point than the Central Indiana Community Foundation. Ballard and the City-County Council in 2013 moved Indianapolis’ crime prevention grant program to CICF in order to strip politics from the award process. CICF reviews nonprofits, including Ten Point, based on several criteria, including program capacity, financial management and whether they use data to track their interactions with people in the community.\n\nCICF awarded Ten Point $50,000 in city-funded crime prevention grants in both 2013 and 2014, but then started rejecting its applications.\n\nA 2016 denial letter provided to IndyStar said \"CICF staff is concerned with sustainability of the organization” because of Ten Point’s lack of outside funding. A 2017 denial letter said Ten Point’s application “was not competitive,” adding the organization “has demonstrated a difficulty with tracking and measuring individual performance outcomes. CICF staff is not confident that (the) organization will have the capacity to report on outcomes.”\n\nTen Point’s applications lacked evidence that the organization is helping the people it claims to serve, according to CICF.\n\n“What I’ve been telling Ten Point is, ‘How do I know you specifically, that your input, produced the direct outcomes?” said Alicia Collins, the director of community collaborations for CICF. “If I don’t have anything on paper, it didn’t happen.”\n\nCICF each year awards crime prevention grants to dozens of organizations for a wide range of programs. In 2016, for instance, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Indiana received $30,000 to conduct a youth mentoring program in an IMPD focus area and Flanner House received $35,000 for a program that seeks to reduce recidivism.\n\nHarrison, though, said those organizations have an advantage in CICF’s application process because their programs have a more transactional nature with participants.\n\n“That’s not what we do. We’re not a mentoring organization,” Harrison said. “And that’s what we said. Our role is to keep peace on the streets. That’s been our conflict with (CICF). I don’t track June Bug and Little Pookie and Big Charles.”\n\nCollins acknowledged Ten Point’s program of giving stipends to volunteers and sending them out on faith walks is unique.\n\nThe City-County Council last year sought to fill in the funding gap between large nonprofits and neighborhood groups when it approved an additional $400,000 in crime prevention grants specifically for organizations that perform street outreach. Ten Point, which was one of 10 recipients, received $50,000.\n\nEven among that group, though, Collins said other organizations have had more success with supplying data. She cited Stop the Violence, another nonprofit that holds faith walks.\n\n“The other organizations, they just do the work,” Collins said. “And I’m not even sure if you would know those organizations, the other nine that are in this space. They do the work. They don’t make the noise or sound the alarm that Ten Point does.”\n\nTen Point’s difficulties in providing detailed information also extend at times to its tax forms. Beth Gazley, director of the master’s program in public affairs for Indiana University’s School of Public and Environmental Affairs, reviewed Ten Point’s tax forms for IndyStar and found what she considered to be a few red flags.\n\nAmong the biggest problems, Gazley said, is that Ten Point’s forms are filled out by the same person who also completes tax forms for Harrison’s church, Barnes United Methodist Church. Ten Point has witnessed little board turnover, lacks a formal conflict of interest policy and has not commissioned an external audit in years — all indications of a lack of financial oversight.\n\n\"I’m surprised the foundation’s giving them any money without an external audit,\" Gazley said. “In my years of fundraising, I can’t recall a single institutional donor that would give us money without seeing the external audit first.\"\n\nGazley also pointed to other minor flaws in the forms, such as some years in which the group failed to calculate its public support percentage, as required by the Internal Revenue Service. Such missteps amount to someone simply not paying attention to the details, she said, which raises another red flag for potential donors.\n\nHarrison said Ten Point is now in the middle of an external audit, in part because it has a recently created executive director position that was paid for by a $50,000 capacity-building grant from CICF that was separate from the city’s crime prevention money.\n\nHarrison also acknowledged Ten Point isn’t as polished as other nonprofits.\n\n“We saw this initially when we started in 1999 as an extension of our ministries. We really didn’t want to get into the nonprofit,” Harrison said. “This is what the church was doing and we didn’t want to look like Big Brothers and Big Sisters because, you know, this is church-driven. This is the black church-driven initiative to try to curb the pattern of violence.”\n\nAnother, perhaps less satisfying, view is that anyone searching homicide statistics and tax forms for insight into the Ten Point model will come up empty.\n\nThe Indianapolis Ten Point Coalition is based on a Boston organization that formed in the 1990s as a response to violent crime. The number of homicides in Boston dropped from 152 in 1990 to 31 in 1999.\n\nThe Boston Ten Point Coalition received national praise for what was dubbed the Boston Miracle. The original Ten Point provided a link between neighborhoods and police, building trust and contributing to a sharp decline in complaints about law enforcement, said Harvard University professor Christopher Winship.\n\nWinship has studied the Boston Ten Point Coalition and written several academic papers on its work. The group’s greatest contribution, he said, was creating what Winship calls an \"umbrella of legitimacy\" for the Boston Police Department.\n\n“The police department became accountable to Ten Point and Ten Point was fair with them,” Winship said. “When they did the right thing, they got their support and when they didn’t, they got criticized.”\n\nThe result, he said, was an improvement in the relationship between Boston police and neighborhoods. While Boston’s homicides plummeted, Winship said, it’s impossible to link that statistic to Ten Point. It also might be unnecessary.\n\n“Part of the issue is, is it the right question? Is our only goal to reduce crime or do we want to have good community-police relations?” Winship said. “It’s always easy to measure homicide rates and a lot harder to measure good community relations.”\n\nHarrison responds to criticism\n\nSuspicion weighs on Harrison. He hears the questions from reporters, foundations, city officials, other black clergy — even the guy driving up Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street and shouting out his window. Questions about how Ten Point handles its money, why it doesn’t have more data to demonstrate results and why it looks so much like what it is: an organization run by unpaid ministers who volunteer in their free time.\n\n“We feel like we have to go through the gatekeepers when it comes to the resources,” Harrison said in an April interview. “Nobody knows better about how to address the violence problem than the people who live in these neighborhoods. And why not empower people in these neighborhoods that have a better sense of how we should address the problem? Why are we not empowering these people to fix the problems in their own neighborhood rather than someone having their model and saying, ‘In order for you to get resources, you gotta do A, B, C and D?’”\n\nYet, Ten Point for months has been courting some of the highest-level gatekeepers: Pence, Sessions and other Trump cabinet secretaries. Ten Point is pursuing a strategy that will invite even more scrutiny — including from other black churches.\n\nSessions’ visit to Indianapolis in November provoked some of the sharpest criticism yet. The Rev. David W. Greene Sr., president of Concerned Clergy, organized a press conference the morning of Sessions’ visit and said what black leaders across Indianapolis were thinking.\n\n“Mr. Sessions’ visit to Indianapolis should be viewed for what it is: a photo op, an opportunity to solicit federal dollars to support a program (Ten Point) that has yet to provide any empirical data that its efforts have diminished crime in our community,” Greene said.\n\nThe Rev. Eugene Rivers, a co-founder of the original Boston Ten Point Coalition and executive director of the National Ten Point Training Institute, dismissed people who criticized Ten Point over its meeting with Sessions, telling IndyStar “those people need to get a life.”\n\n“Listen,” Rivers said, “too many black people who don’t have good jobs or things to do throw racism around like rice at a wedding. That doesn’t help anything.”\n\nRivers’ defense reveals one reason why the organization’s message might appeal to Republicans. At a time when many left-leaning activist groups, such as Black Lives Matter, are arguing that public policies contribute to violence against African-Americans, Ten Point leaders are calling out the violence while using politically charged terms, such as \"black-on-black violence.\"\n\nWinship, the Harvard professor who has studied Rivers’ original Ten Point Coalition, said Ten Point has a history of pursuing relationships with whoever happens to be in power. In Boston, that means Democrats. In Indiana, it happens to be Republicans. There is no apparent partisanship, he said.\n\n“Why talk to Sessions and Pence? Well, because that’s who’s in charge of Washington these days,” Winship said. “It is a dangerous game and, yes, you’re going to end up making enemies by being willing to talk to somebody else’s enemies. But it’s important to understand they are not in the business of doing policy.”\n\nTen Point is in the business of growing — an ambition that is creating tension for Harrison, who thinks his organization can save more lives in more cities, yet also resents the hoops he must jump through to reach those young black men out on the streets.\n\nWhen Harrison isn’t defending himself against his fellow black ministers, who accuse him of aiding racists, he’s navigating a system that he considers to be racist. Ten Point plays by the rules of the white power structure because those are the rules. If that makes him a sellout, then he’s selling out to prevent gun violence from claiming more victims.\n\nThat doesn’t mean he feels good about it. The meetings, the grant applications, the audit, the tax forms — these are constant reminders to Harrison that it’s not enough for black ministers to go out and do what they consider to be good work. They also have to become something they’re not — something they’re not sure they want to be.\n\n“It’s white people telling black people how to fix the problems in our community and they control the resources. So, we’ve got to fit the white model in order to get the resources to be validated,” Harrison said.\n\nHe pounds his fist on the table to emphasize each syllable. His eyes redden.\n\n“Or, the other thing is,” Harrison adds, more softly, “you don’t trust us with the money.”\n\nStephanie Wang contributed to this story.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter James Briggs at (317) 444-6307.

Refresh this page for updates.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., praised Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett as having “met every test” as senators finished their last round of questions.\n\n“You will be confirmed, God willing,” he said.\n\nGraham said he would “hope it’s okay you can be pro-life and adhere to your faith and still be considered by your fellow citizens to be worthy of this job.”\n\n“You can have two glasses of wine tonight,” Graham joked to Barrett, referring to her comments about having a glass of wine after the first night of questioning.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., thanked Barrett for appearing before the committee and apologized for “painful moments” about her children.\n\n“They are innocent victims, and they should not have to go through this,” he said.\n\nThe committee now goes into a closed session tonight as they review Barrett’s background report. They will reconvene Thursday morning to hear from outside witnesses.\n\n— Nicholas Wu\n\nDoes Barrett believe that climate change is a thing?\n\nLater in the hearing, Barrett was again asked about climate change. Sen. Kamala Harris, the California Democrat running for vice president, first posed several other science-based questions to Barrett, including whether she believed smoking causes cancer and whether COVID-19 is contagious. Barrett agreed with both points.\n\nBut as Harris uttered her third question, \"do you believe that climate change is happening and it's threatening the air we breathe and the water we drink,\" Barrett refused to weigh in, calling the issue a \"very contentious matter of public debate.\"\n\n\"I will not express a view on a matter of public policy, especially one that is politically controversial because that's inconsistent with the judicial role,\" Barrett said.\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nBarrett sidesteps question on whether humans cause global warming\n\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett refused to weigh in on climate change her during confirmation hearing Wednesday, explaining to senators her views on the subject aren't relevant to the job she wants serving on the Supreme Court.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked bluntly whether Barrett believed \"human beings cause global warming\" to which Barrett responded: \"I don't think I am competent to opine on what causes global warming or not.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I don't think that my views on global warming or climate change are relevant to the job I would do as a judge, nor do I feel like I have views that are informed enough, and I haven't studied scientific data. I'm not really in a position to offer any kind of informed opinion.\"\n\nBarrett has gotten around directly answering many questions on her views about controversial issues, citing a common ethical practice to not answer questions about issues that could come before the court. The practice was made famous by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and dubbed the \"Ginsburg rule,\" something Barrett has cited repeatedly throughout both days of questioning by senators.\n\nBlumenthal voiced his disappointment in Barrett refusing to weigh in on issues that could impact millions of Americans.\n\n\"There have been a lot of references to the Ginsburg rule,\" Blumenthal said. \"I think this administration has taken the Ginsburg rule to a new level. I hope it won't be known as the Barrett rule of avoiding responses.\"\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nBarrett says landmark case on birth control 'unlikely to go anywhere'\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., pressed Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on whether she shared the judicial philosophy of one of her mentors, the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia. But Barrett insisted she was her own justice.\n\nAsked about Scalia’s view that Griswold v. Connecticut, a landmark 1965 Supreme Court case on contraception, was wrongly decided, Barrett said, “I think that Griswold is very, very, very, very, very, very unlikely to go anywhere.\"\n\nCoons asked Barrett if she agreed with Scalia that \"Griswold was wrongly decided and the state should make it illegal to use contraceptives if they so chose?\"\n\nBarrett said she could not express a view \"with respect to precedent\" but said in order for the decision to be overturned a state legislature would have to pass a state law banning contraceptives – a scenario she said would be \"shockingly unlikely.\"\n\n\"I understand that you'll be your own justice and Justice Scalia's philosophy is significant, but I also think you've made it's clear that it's largely your philosophy,“ Coons said. “I'm trying to help viewers understand what it means to replace Justice Ginsburg with someone who may more closely follow Justice Scalia's approach.\"\n\nCoons argued Barrett’s confirmation “may launch a new chapter of conservative judicial activism” and said he would vote against her confirmation.\n\nAsked by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., whether she was aware of legislative efforts to overturn Griswold, Barrett said she was not aware of any.\n\nHawley called it “demeaning and insulting” Democrats would try to link Barrett to the “worst interpretation” of Scalia’s philosophy.\n\n-Nicholas Wu\n\nBarrett, if confirmed, would make 3 SCOTUS justices who worked on GOP side of Bush v. Gore\n\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court would mean one-third of the high court helped George W. Bush win the presidency 20 years ago.\n\nThat point was driven home Wednesday by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who noted that Barrett would be the third justice to have worked on the Republican side in the 2000 dispute over ballots in Florida that led to the Bush v. Gore case decided by the high court.\n\nIn her Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire, Barrett called it a “significant case on which I provided research and briefing assistance.” She was recruited to work on the case in Florida for a week at the start of the litigation.\n\nThat puts her in powerful company, Klobuchar noted. Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh also traveled to Florida to help the GOP cause. Klobuchar asked if that risked the court's legitimacy, but Barrett didn't bite.\n\n“Asking whether something would undermine the legitimacy of the court or not seems to be trying to elicit a question about whether it would be appropriate for justices who participated in that litigation to sit on the case rather than recuse, and I went down that road yesterday,\" she said.\n\nThe topic arose during Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing process in 2018. Noting Kavanaugh also helped independent counsel Ken Starr investigate President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s and went on to serve in Bush's White House, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called him the “Forrest Gump of Republican politics.” Sen Chuck Schumer, now the Senate Democratic leader, said, “If there was a political fight that needed a political foot soldier … Brett Kavanaugh was probably there.”\n\n– Richard Wolf\n\nBarrett says critique of Affordable Care Act decision was not 'open letter to President Trump'\n\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett, during her third day of confirmation hearings Wednesday, maintained that if confirmed to the Supreme Court she would not have any preconceived plans on how she would view the Affordable Care Act and rule in a case next month that could decide the future of health care for millions.\n\nPiecing together a timeline, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., noted that for years President Donald Trump has made clear his \"obsession to repeal Obamacare\" and highlighted the timing of a legal journal article Barrett authored in January 2017 – the month Trump took office. That article criticized Chief Justice John Roberts for pushing \"the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute\" in a 2012 ruling. Klobuchar asked Barrett whether she was aware at the time of that writing that the president was set on repealing the Affordable Care Act and asked whether the federal appeals judge was aware that the president aimed to nominate judges to the Supreme Court who would overturn the law.\n\n\"I think that the Republicans have kind of made that clear. It's just been part of the public discourse,\" Barrett said. \"All these questions, you're suggesting that I have animus or that I cut a deal with the president and I was very clear yesterday that, that isn't what happened.\"\n\nShe continued, explaining that she was \"aware that [Trump] has criticized the Affordable Care Act\" but her journal article was not a message for the president. \"I want to stress, I have no animus to or agenda for the Affordable Care Act so to the extent you're suggesting this was like an open letter to President Trump. It was not.\"\n\nKlobuchar noted the dozens of times Republicans have attempted to overturn Obamacare and said \"I find it very hard to believe that you didn't understand that when you wrote the article.\"\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nWhitehouse wants changes to SCOTUS financial, ethical reporting\n\nIf Amy Coney Barrett makes the leap from a federal appeals court to the Supreme Court, she will find the ethics and financial reporting rules are easier to abide by.\n\nThat’s because the high court isn’t subject to the same requirements that govern all lower federal courts.\n\n“I think it’s anomalous that the highest court should have the lowest standards,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said during Wednesday’s confirmation hearing.\n\nWhitehouse sought out Barrett as an ally in his effort to change that situation. In doing so, he seemed to throw in the towel on blocking Barrett’s ascension.\n\n“Take a look at that when you get up there,” he said.\n\nGabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, which advocates that justices have term limits and be bound by a code of ethics, notes that there is no formal code of conduct for the Supreme Court, as there is for other federal courts. The justices voluntarily list gifts received on their annual financial disclosure forms, but in lower courts gift rules are set by statute. Appeals courts like Barrett’s keep lists of privately funded judicial seminars, unlike the Supreme Court. And if a justice breaches ethics guidelines, there is no recourse or reprimand, save for impeachment.\n\n– Richard Wolf\n\nBarrett spars with Durbin over gun rights, voting question\n\nDoes Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett put gun rights ahead of voting rights?\n\nYes, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said during Wednesday’s hearing. No, Barrett insisted.\n\nIt’s a line of questioning that stems from Barrett’s dissent on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in which she said a nonviolent felon should not lose his right to own a gun.\n\nShe lost that argument in court, but she was determined not to lose the argument with Durbin, the Senate’s second-ranking Democrat.\n\nWhy, Durbin asked, did she believe owning a gun was an individual right, but voting is only a civic right based on collective action? Why can a felon have a gun but, as is the case in some states, be denied the right to vote?\n\nBarrett has remained calm during most of this week’s hearing, but she clearly took umbrage at Durbin’s conclusion. “I have never denigrated the right to vote,” she said, accusing Durbin of distorting her record. “I think voting is a fundamental right.”\n\n– Richard Wolf\n\nBarrett: No one is above the law\n\nSupreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett agreed under oath that no one person is above the law, even President Donald Trump.\n\nUnder questioning from Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, the federal appeals court judge took a similar stance as other justices on the high court that Trump is not above the law.\n\n\"Would you agree, first, that nobody is above the law. Not the president, not you, not me. Is that correct?\" Leahy asked virtually over video conference.\n\n\"I agree, no one is above the law,\" Barrett stated unequivocally.\n\nShe declined to weigh in when asked by Leahy about whether the president has the \"absolute right to pardon himself for a crime.\"\n\nBarrett explained that the question had never come before her in a court and \"it's one that calls for legal analysis of what the scope of the pardon power is\" and she would need to go through \"the judicial process to decide it.\"\n\nLeahy, unsatisfied by her explanation, said he found the two back-to-back answers \"somewhat incompatible.\"\n\nSupreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored an opinion earlier this year on his and Neil Gorsuch's behalf in which he made clear that Trump is not immune from the law. The case dealt with the president's tax returns, with the high court ruling that Trump could not block prosecutors from gaining access to his financials.\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\nThe witness list for final day of hearings Thursday\n\nRepublicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee released the list of witnesses who will testify on the last day of Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings on Thursday.\n\nThe hearing will feature two panels of witnesses.\n\nThe first panel would include two members of the American Bar Association’s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which evaluates the qualifications of every judicial nominee: Randall D. Noel of Butler Snow, LLP and Pamela J. Roberts of Bowman and Brooke LLP.\n\nThe second panel will include Democratic and Republican witnesses who will likely speak to Barrett’s character or in opposition to her confirmation:\n\nDr. Farhan Bhatti, CEO and medical director of Care Free Medical. Bhatti will discuss the Affordable Care Act\n\nRetired Judge Thomas Griffith of th United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, who has praised Barrett.\n\nKristen Clarke, President and Executive Director, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Clarke will testify about voting and civil rights.\n\nProfessor Saikrishna Prakash of the University of Virginia School of Law, one of Barrett’s professional colleagues\n\nCrystal Good, who fought in court for an abortion at age 16 and who will testify about abortion rights.\n\nAmanda Rauh-Bieri, associate at Miller Canfield, and a former clerk for Barrett.\n\nStacy Staggs will testify about the consequences of overturning the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLaura Wolk, an attorney and one of Barrett’s former law students.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nBarrett says ability to sever a portion of a law – but not the whole law – is 'valuable'\n\nRepublicans sought to assure Americans Wednesday that Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation isn’t likely to eliminate the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTheir principal witness: Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nOn the second day of questioning, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee elicited responses from Barrett indicating that a Nov. 10 Supreme Court showdown over the law is most likely to erase one provision of the law – not the law itself.\n\nSevering an unconstitutional portion of a law rather than the law itself “serves a valuable function of trying not to undo your work,” Barrett told Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the panel.\n\nWhile her mentor, the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, said in 2012 that the entire law should be struck down because he thought two provisions were unconstitutional, she said the new challenge over tax policy involves only one provision.\n\nThe challenge stems from a $1.5 trillion tax cut passed by the Republican-dominated Congress in 2017, which repealed the health care law's tax on people who refuse to buy insurance. That tax was intended to prod them into the health insurance marketplace rather than let them seek emergency care while uninsured.\n\nIn reality, it will be very difficult for Barrett to topple the law because at least five justices on the court are likely to uphold it: the three remaining liberal justices along with Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n– Richard Wolf\n\nDemocrats bringing abortion, health care advocates to Thursday hearing\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, will invite four witnesses to speak at Thursday’s confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nThe witnesses come from health care and legal backgrounds and will likely speak to Democrats’ concerns about the possible overturning of the Affordable Care Act and other issues that could come before the court.\n\nThe four witnesses are:\n\nStacy Staggs, a mother of 7-year old twins with pre-existing conditions. Staggs will testify about the consequences of overturning the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDr. Farhan Bhatti, a family physician and CEO of Care Free Medical, a nonprofit clinic. Bhatti will discuss the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCrystal Good, who fought in court for an abortion at age 16, will testify about abortion rights.\n\nKristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, will testify about voting and civil rights.\n\n-Nicholas Wu\n\nGraham praises Barrett as an icon for conservative women\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., kicked off the second day of questioning in Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings by pushing back against arguments made by Democrats over the past two days and praising Barrett as an icon for conservative women.\n\n\"The hearing to me is an opportunity to not punch through a glass ceiling, but a reinforced concrete barrier around conservative women. You’re gonna shatter that barrier,” Graham told Barrett, who he also hailed as the first “unashamedly pro-life” woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\nHe used part of his 20 minutes of questioning time to respond to Democrats’ allegations Barrett had not been fully candid in her answers, telling Barrett, “I couldn’t disagree more,” and citing previous Supreme Court nominees’ refusal to fully share their legal philosophy.\n\nHe also addressed the 2006 pro-life letter signed by Barrett, saying \"what we tried to do yesterday was turn a pro-life group into a legislative body and tried to get you to rule on their beliefs.\"\n\nBarrett had declined to comment on her beliefs about abortion when pressed by lawmakers about the letter and a 2013 ad, telling lawmakers it would not be “appropriate” for her to comment on issues that could come before the court\n\nBarrett’s family sat in the audience behind her as the hearing went on.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nThird day of confirmation hearings begins\n\nThe third day of Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings started shortly after 9 a.m. EDT with Sen. Lindsey Graham beginning the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting.\n\nBarrett, President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, faced 11 hours of questioning Tuesday. Senators on the committee get more time to ask questions Wednesday.\n\n– Sean Rossman\n\nSenators to grill Amy Coney Barrett on third day of hearings\n\nWASHINGTON – Senators on Wednesday will get to grill Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett again on her career and views that could offer insights on how she would rule on the nation's highest court.\n\nMembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee will get another chance to question Barrett on her views on the law and a number of hot-button issues that could come before the court.\n\nOn Tuesday, Barrett fielded questions from senators for more than 11 hours, where she attempted to differentiate her legal views from her personal beliefs and largely escaped any controversial confrontations with Democrats eager to block her nomination.\n\nBarrett repeatedly refrained from offering her stance on key issues and cases, such those that could decide the fate of abortion, healthcare and gun laws.\n\nThroughout the lengthy hearing, the 48-year-old federal appeals court judge and law school professor from Indiana sought to define herself as someone who puts personal views aside and addresses legal issues with an open mind.\n\n\"I'm committed to the rule of law and the role of the Supreme Court and dispensing equal justice for all,\" she said during Tuesday' hearing.\n\nDemocrats repeatedly highlighted the history of remarks and opinions she's offered over her career that liberals argue endanger the future of a woman's right to abortions and the Affordable Care Act, which provides healthcare for millions of Americans.\n\nA recap of Tuesday:Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett strives to show independence from White House, Republicans\n\nHow it works: How Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation process will unfold\n\n“If I’m confirmed, you would not be getting Justice Scalia, you would be getting Justice Barrett,\" she said in reference to her more outspoken mentor, the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nShe repeatedly stated under oath that she'd offered \"no commitment to anyone, not in the Senate, not over at the White House, about how I would decide any case.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, each senator will be given at least 20 minutes to pepper Barrett with questions. The following day, on Thursday, is scheduled to mark the end of Barrett's public vetting, when senators are scheduled to hear from additional witnesses who know Barrett.\n\nRepublicans are eager to confirm Barrett to the Court before Election Day and have sped along the confirmation process. A final vote by the full Senate is expected before the end of the month.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will not vote on Barrett's confirmation this week but rather will hold it for one week, a common practice by the panel, before an expected vote around Oct. 22. Barrett's nomination is likely to split along party lines, 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats, before the full Senate takes up her nomination.\n\nShe will need at least a majority of the 100-member chamber to be confirmed to the high court, a feat she is expected to cross as Democrats have acknowledged they lack the votes to block her confirmation.\n\n'We wept together': Amy Coney Barrett says George Floyd video was personal for family\n\nMore:Amy Barrett's law review articles show how Supreme Court rulings like Roe v.

For the latest news on the storm please see our live updates file for Monday, Feb. 5.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO − A fierce winter storm fueled by a raging atmospheric river was thrashing Californians on Sunday with intense downpours, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, flooding roadways and prompting a rare warning of hurricane-force winds.\n\nUp to 37 million people, about 94% of the state's population, were at risk for life-threatening floods from the storm, Accuweather meteorologists warned. The atmospheric river − like a river in the sky − is the second to pound the state in recent days, but forecasters said this storm would be the season's most potent, particularly in Southern California.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a rare hurricane-force wind warning for the Central Coast: Wind gusts up to 92 mph were possible from the Monterey Peninsula to the northern section of San Luis Obispo County.\n\nSan Francisco officials sent out alerts about flooded and blocked streets, fallen trees − including a large one that brought down power lines − and a hillside landslide. About 100 miles down the coast in Monterey County, the final round of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament was postponed until Monday, when weather conditions don't look favorable either.\n\nThe storm was expected to head south and hit the Los Angeles area with downpours, flash floods, and high-elevation mountain snow Sunday afternoon into the evening, then to pound Orange County and San Diego on Monday and Tuesday. Los Angeles and Orange were among eight Southern California counties were Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency.\n\n\"All systems are go for one of the most dramatic weather days in recent memory,\" the National Weather Service said Sunday.\n\nThe first storm in the \"Pineapple Express\" soaked the state with 1-6 inches of rain Wednesday and Thursday. The new storm is laden with even more moisture, forecasters said, setting up dangerous and deadly conditions in already-saturated regions.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n∎ Winds exceeded 60 mph in some parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, with gusts above 80 mph in the mountains, strong enough to qualify for a Category 1 hurricane. Some areas received wind gust speeds of 98 mph and 102 mph.\n\n∎ More than 856,00 homes and businesses were without power in California by 9:00 p.m. PST, the majority of them concentrated in coastal regions, according to poweroutage.us.\n\n∎ Firefighters rescued a man stranded on an island in the Ventura River Sunday. The man was trapped with water rising around him, said Jeremy Henderson, a battalion chief with the Ventura City Fire Department. Someone reportedly heard the man screaming for help and called 911.\n\nLocal leaders warn residents to evacuate amid flood, mudslide risks\n\nEvacuation warnings and orders were in effect for Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Ventura, and Monterey counties.\n\nClasses were canceled Monday for schools across Santa Barbara County. The Santa Barbara Airport closed Sunday evening due to flooding on the airfield, it said on its website.\n\n“This storm is predicted to be one of the largest and most significant in our county’s history and our goal is to get through it without any fatalities or any serious injuries,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath urged residents near wildfire burn areas of Topanga and Soledad canyons to follow orders and evacuate ahead of possible mudslides.\n\n“If you have not already left, please gather your family, your pets, your medications and leave immediately,” Horvath said at a Sunday briefing. The county set up shelters where evacuees could spend the night.\n\nIn San Diego, Mayor Todd Gloria said during a news conference Sunday that the storm \"has the potential to drop a significant and unusual amount of rainfall on San Diego.\" He added that the city could receive between 2 to 2.5 inches of rain from Sunday night to Tuesday, with some areas possibly getting half an inch of rain per hour.\n\nGloria noted that the storm would be the city's third rain event in two weeks and reissued an evacuation order for low-lying and flood-prone areas within the city.\n\nMeanwhile, Orange County issued an evacuation warning for Silverado Canyon, Williams Canyon and Trabuco Canyons due to heavy rains, and encouraged residents in the area to evacuate, especially those with disabilities, access or functional needs, and with large animals.\n\nDesert communities on high alert\n\nWhile the heaviest rains in the low and high California desert are expected late Monday through Tuesday, the surrounding mountains will be hit earlier, with heavy rain likely beginning Sunday night, and heavy snows expected Monday night.\n\nAbout a quarter- to a half-inch of rain is expected in the western part of the Coachella Valley on Monday and a total of 1 to 1.5 inches through Tuesday. The east valley is forecast to get three-quarters of an inch of rain.\n\nMount San Jacinto is expected to receive up to 3 feet of snow and San Gorgonio a little more. Chances of rain lessen across the Coachella Valley by Wednesday but intermittent showers could occur through the end of the week.\n\nSouthern California schools brace for severe weather\n\nThe weather service forecast up to 8 inches of rainfall across Southern California’s coastal and valley areas, with 14 inches possible in the foothills and mountains.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued for the majority of Los Angeles County, including downtown and where the Grammy Awards are being held along with the east area, according to the weather service in Los Angeles. The alerts are in effect until 12 a.m. on Tuesday.\n\nBy 5 p.m. Sunday, the weather service said up to 1 inch of rain had fallen. \"Additional rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly,\" the weather service added.\n\nIn response to the dangerous conditions, some schools said Sunday that instruction would move to online classes.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution and with the safety of students, faculty and staff as its top priority, Cal State Fullerton will pivot to remote classes on Monday, Feb. 5, 2024. Staff are encouraged to work remotely,\" the university said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia State University Long Beach also said campus operations would be modified due to the severe weather, adding that \"in-person classes may shift to online instruction or alternative assignments, where possible.\"\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, the Los Angeles Unified School District said it was planning to open schools as usual Monday. The decision would be reevaluated at 6 a.m. Monday, said Superintendent Alberto Carvalho.\n\nTorrential rain could lead to flooding and mudslides\n\nHeavy rain was expected from the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast through Southern California on Sunday into Monday, the NOAA Weather Prediction Center said. Rainfall of 2-5 inches and up to 6-10 inches in some spots was likely, the prediction center said. “This will result in considerable flash, urban and small stream flooding with debris flows and mudslides,” the prediction center said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Sunday that heavy rain would be moving into the area: 3-6 inches was expected for the coasts and valleys and up to 6-12 inches in the mountains.\n\n“Due to the numerous mountains and hills, even just a few inches of rain can cause significant flooding,” AccuWeather Senior Director of Forecasting Operations Dan DePodwin said. “The greatest risk … is expected across the canyons and hills of Southern California, especially in Ventura, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles counties.”\n\nStorm's slow pace makes it more damaging\n\nBy lingering over large parts of California, the storm was drenching terrain that was already saturated from the atmospheric river-driven system that hit much of the state Wednesday and Thursday, increasing the chances of flooding.\n\n“The core of the low pressure system is very deep, and it’s moving very slowly and it’s very close to us,'' said Ryan Kittell, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Los Angeles-area office. \"And that’s why we have those very strong winds. And the slow nature of it is really giving us the highest rainfall totals and the flooding risk.”\n\nHeavy rain is expected in Southern California through Tuesday and there's a chance for showers through Friday, making mudslides and debris flows likely, forecasters say.\n\n“Even if the rain does start to let up on Monday morning, just the sheer amount of rain overnight will cause lingering flooding issues into the morning hours,” Kittell said.\n\nThree children ‘in the eye of the storm’ 400-plus miles away\n\nDoug and Pam Barry were among more than 100,000 Californians without power when an outage hit their Miraloma Park neighborhood in San Francisco on Sunday morning.\n\nThat was far from their biggest concern, though. Their two sons are attending college in Los Angeles and San Diego, respectively, and their daughter Jessica was visiting the youngest son in San Diego when the storm hit. Now she’s hoping her plans to return Sunday to her home in Scottsdale, Arizona, don’t get disrupted.\n\n“We have all three children in the eye of the storm in Southern California,” Doug Barry said. “We texted them yesterday to be careful with the approaching storm. We will get a good storm, but they will have it worse. Rarely do we share the same weather concerns with our children in California who are 400-plus miles away.”\n\nWill harsh weather keep stars from arriving at Grammys?\n\nThose sporting stylish outfits and elaborate hairdos at the Grammy Awards need not fear the wet and windy weather Sunday in Los Angeles, despite the downpour of biblical proportions expected early in the evening.\n\nThe infamous L.A. traffic? That may be another story.\n\nThe traditional red-carpet walk is being held under a roof and tarp outside the Crypto.com Arena in Downtown L.A., where nearly 5 inches of rain are forecast through Tuesday. The National Weather Service's L.A. office is warning of a \"DANGEROUS SYSTEM with major risks to life and property. Substantial flooding.''\n\nThat's bound to make traffic even more of a nightmare than usual, even for the stars. Last year, headliners such as Beyonce and Bad Bunny arrived late after getting caught in traffic, and it wasn't raining.\n\nThough the heaviest rainfall is not expected until 6 p.m. local time, an hour after the Grammys begin, the forecast calls for moderate rain from noon on, in addition to 30-50 mph winds in Los Angeles County.\n\nHeavy snow, powerful winds could lead to whiteout conditions\n\nHeavy, wet snow was expected to spread across the Sierra Nevada on Sunday through Tuesday morning, with snowfall of 2-3 inches per hour, the prediction center said. Wind gusts of up to 60 mph could lead to whiteout conditions in the Southern California mountains, forecasters said.\n\nPalisades Tahoe, a ski resort about 200 miles northeast of San Francisco, said it was anticipating the heaviest snowfall yet this season, with accumulations of 6 inches per hour for a total of up to two feet.\n\nWhat is a Pineapple Express?\n\nA Pineapple Express is the best-known nickname for an atmospheric river, which occurs when the source of the moisture is near Hawaii. When a Pineapple Express hits land in the western U.S. and Canada, it triggers heavy rain and snow. In California, it can lead to several inches of rain in a day.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY; Cheri Carlson, Ventura County Star; Kate Franco and Christopher Damien Palm Springs Desert Sun; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/05/california-weather-floods-mudslides-atmospheric-river-updates/72477613007/", "title": "Atmospheric river hits California with dangerous floods and mudslides", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the California rain event for Monday, Feb. 5. For the latest news on the weather, view our live updates file for Tuesday, Feb. 6.\n\nSAN DIEGO − The tail end of a powerful atmospheric river storm that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of California homes and businesses was deluging the state Monday with more heavy rain, mudslides, flooding, and several feet of snow in the mountains.\n\nThe brunt of the storm's fury Monday centered on the Los Angeles area, where 1.4 million people were under a flash flood warning – including the Hollywood Hills and Beverly Hills. A local state of emergency was issued for the city of Los Angeles by Mayor Karen Bass on Monday afternoon.\n\nAcross Southern California, the heavy winds that blasted the region Sunday were diminishing, but the National Weather Service warned that an unstable weather pattern could generate waterspouts or small tornadoes.\n\nFlash flooding \"is a much greater threat than any weak tornado that the storm may spawn,\" the weather service said, and dangerous flooding was likely across much of the region from the atmospheric river − the equivalent of a river in the sky that is responsible for extreme rain and snow in the West.\n\nAdditional rainfall totals of 5-8 inches were forecast in some areas, which would bring 48-hour totals as high as 14 inches for some locations, the weather service said. A state of emergency was declared in eight Southern California counties.\n\n\"Life-threatening conditions may evolve extremely fast in some communities,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski warned.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ A debris flow caused significant damage to about five homes in Beverly Hills on Monday, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Although no one was trapped, about 10 people have been displaced, the LAFD said.\n\n∎ The Los Angeles Fire Department reported that 1,000 firefighters were responding to 49 mudslides and debris flows, 130 reports of flooding, half a dozen structure fires and other rescues of motorists stranded in vehicles.\n\n∎ Los Angeles recorded more than 4 inches of rain Sunday, breaking the record for the day by more than an inch. It was the most rain in one day in more than 20 years, and surpassed the average for the month of February.\n\n∎ The AT&T Pebble Beach Pro Am golf tournament in Monterey County, which had postponed Sunday's final round to Monday, canceled play Monday and declared Wyndham Clark the winner despite playing only 54 holes of the scheduled 72-hole tournament.\n\n∎ Officials have attributed three deaths to the storm. In Yuba City, 40 miles north of Sacramento, a man was killed when a redwood tree toppled on him in high winds, police said. Two other men were killed by fallen trees Sunday in Carmichael, a suburb of Sacramento, and in Boulder Creek in Santa Cruz County.\n\nSan Diego residents advised to remain vigilant\n\nSan Diego Mayor Todd Gloria issued an evacuation warning for low-lying, flood-prone areas that were battered by heavy rains last week and flooded out two weeks ago. Some areas outside the city saw up to 7 inches of rain in the last two days.\n\n\"I understand the weariness that must come from these repeated warnings,\" Gloria said. \"I recognize that fatigue may be settling in. But I can assure you this decision to issue this warning is not taken lightly. I ask that everyone remain prepared and vigilant.\"\n\nA flood advisory was issued for the entire county coastline and will be in effect until 8 p.m. Monday, according to the National Weather Service. A flood watch for the county will be in effect until Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Gloria's office, nearly 160 households were referred for temporary placement in hotel rooms.\n\nSanta Barbara cancels evacuation orders\n\nEvacuation orders for Santa Barbara County were canceled Monday after the worst of the storm hit the area overnight.\n\nOfficials had made an early recommendation to close schools in preparation for dangerous conditions, according to Camilla Barnwell, director of communications for the Santa Barbara County Education Office. The office said most schools across the county will reopen Tuesday.\n\n\"One or two schools had some debris that needed to be removed,\" Barnwell told USA TODAY. \"The storm just barely lifted yesterday evening so they were out on campuses today assessing the damage... heavy trees coming down, maybe one school (had) some power issues.\"\n\n'Non-stop rain' in Los Angeles as shelters aid city's homeless population\n\nBetween 5 and 10 inches of rain had fallen in the Los Angeles area with more expected, according to the National Weather Service. Dave Bruno, a meteorologist with the weather service in Los Angeles, said Monday was the third wettest two-day period on record in downtown.\n\nShelters were adding beds for the city’s homeless population of nearly 75,000 people.\n\nGeorgia Berkovich, chief communications officer of The Midnight Mission, said there has been \"non-stop rain.\" She added that The Midnight Mission, which is a Los Angeles-based human service organization, has opened its dining room for shelter and provides resources to people, including hot meals and 24-hour restrooms.\n\nAbout 100 people came to The Midnight Mission \"just to get out of the element,\" Berkovich told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Once your clothes are wet it’s over. People are freezing to their core,\" she said. \"So strange in LA we have this great climate but people die of exposure, die on our streets all the time.\"\n\nStorm by the numbers\n\n∎ A rough calculation estimates that 5.6 trillion gallons of water has fallen across California the past two days, according to FOX Weather meteorologist Greg Diamond.\n\n∎ AccuWeather estimates the preliminary total damage and economic loss from the intense storms and record rainfall in California this week will be between $9 billion and $11 billion.\n\n∎ The 11.87 inches that fell in 24 hours at UCLA’s weather station was a 1-in-1,000 year rainfall event. Technically known as a \"1,000-year recurrence interval event,\" according to meteorologist Jacob Feuerstein, a 1-in-1,000-year rain event is a statistical way of expressing the probability of such a huge rainfall occurring in any given year in a given location, according to NOAA.\n\nMud flows through multimillion-dollar homes\n\nSeveral multimillion dollar houses in the Hollywood Hills were damaged as mud, rocks and debris oozed and rolled through the area Monday. Sixteen people were evacuated, city officials said.\n\n“I can’t believe it,\" Keki Mingus of Studio City, California, said, as water rushed down her road around dawn on Monday. \"It looks like a river that’s been here for years. I’ve never seen anything like it.”\n\nWind, snow hammer Mammoth Mountain\n\nThe storm unleashed howling winds and huge snow totals in the mountains. The National Weather Service recorded a wind gust of 125 mph at the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area late Sunday. That same location received a storm total of 39 inches as of Monday morning.\n\nWhere is the storm headed next?\n\nAfter battering California on Monday, the storm's moisture will help fuel heavy snow across the West, and heavy rain in the normally arid Desert Southwest over the next few days, forecasters said. \"Rainfall totals generally between 1-3 inches may lead to some scattered instances of flash flooding,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nFlood watches were in effect throughout portions of southern Arizona and southern Nevada because of the threat of heavy rain and flooding.\n\nClimate change, El Nino conspire to fuel storms\n\nMultiple weather and climate phenomena are conspiring to make these storms particularly damaging. Warm water provides energy to storms, and record-high ocean water temperatures, likely from climate change, are being detected around the world. Additionally, the Pacific Ocean is also seeing the effects of El Nino, where weakening trade winds reduce the upwelling of ocean waters and allow surface waters to bake in the sun and grow warmer still. And California, coming off years of drought and wildfires, is particularly vulnerable to mudslides and flooding.\n\n\"The atmospheric river firehose is aimed at Los Angeles,\" tweeted meteorologist Ryan Maue. \"The onslaught has just begun from this treacherous bomb cyclone.\"\n\n102-mph wind gust recorded in San Francisco Bay area\n\nIn Northern California, the storm swamped streets and toppled trees and power lines across the San Francisco Bay area. A rare hurricane-force wind warning had been posted for the area, and winds exceeded 60 mph with wind gusts recorded as high as 102 mph in Marin County − the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane.\n\nIn nearby San Jose, first responders went door-to-door warning residents of the flood threat and removing unhoused people from riverbeds. They pulled travelers out of the windows of a car stranded by floodwaters and rescued several people and dogs from an island in the Guadalupe River as it became overwhelmed by high waters.\n\nUnited States Weather Alerts\n\nStorm is second to blast state in days\n\nThe storm slammed California just days after much of the state was soaked with up to 6 inches of rain by the first storm in the \"Pineapple Express,\" so-called because moisture builds up in the tropical Pacific around Hawaii and can roll across the ocean and pound the U.S. and Canada's west coasts with heavy rainfall and snow. The current storm is packing more moisture and overwhelming already-saturated regions.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's office said the state had a record number of emergency assets responding to the \"serious storm with dangerous and potentially life-threatening impacts.\" Those impacts included almost 600,000 homes and businesses without power Monday.\n\nLife-threatening flood threat:Heavy rain and powerful winds clobber California\n\nLandslide hits Hollywood Hills\n\nIn the Hollywood Hills the weather serviced warned Monday of an \"extremely dangerous situation unfolding\" with life threatening landslides and flash flooding. Several families had to evacuate when a mudslide caused a gas leak. A neighborhood in Studio City was forced to evacuate after a slide severely damaged multiple homes. In suburban Tarzana, three homes were swamped by debris flow with firefighters aiding the evacuation of residents.\n\nFlooding and small mudslides were also reported across Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Malibu and Beverly Hills.\n\n“Life-threatening flash flooding is ongoing and will continue into the morning hours of Monday,” the weather service said.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath urged residents near wildfire burn areas of Topanga and Soledad canyons to get out ahead of possible mudslides. The county set up shelters for evacuees.\n\n“If you have not already left, please gather your family, your pets, your medications and leave immediately,” Horvath said at a Sunday briefing.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/11/08/mountain-fire-wildfire-southern-california/76125627007/", "title": "Mountain Fire destroys homes, prompts evacuations in California", "text": "Authorities in Southern California on Friday attempted to gain control over a fast-moving wildfire that torched dozens of homes and businesses, shuttered schools and forced over 10,000 people to evacuate.\n\nFueled by strong wind gusts, the so-called Mountain Fire exploded in size after it was first reported Wednesday morning in Somis, an unincorporated community in Ventura County. Inspection teams reported the fire destroyed at least 132 structures, mostly homes, and damaged 88 others as it spread to more populous neighborhoods northwest of Malibu and Los Angeles.\n\nAs of Friday morning, the fire had engulfed 20,596 acres and was 7% contained, according to the the state's wildfire-fighting agency, Cal Fire. Dozens of schools and colleges canceled classes on Thursday and Friday as the fire knocked out power and triggered nearly two dozen road closures. Meanwhile, a pair of water companies issued warnings to residents advising them not to drink or boil water.\n\nMuch of the blaze burned in steep, rugged terrain, hampering firefighters' efforts to quell the flames. Crews also grappled with low pressure as the expansive emergency operation overwhelmed the local water system.\n\nVentura County Sheriff Jim Fryhoff said at a news conference that 10 people were injured, including several from smoke inhalation; none of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening. A firefighter was among the victims, according to Cal Fire.\n\nFryhoff said 400 homes were evacuated on Thursday and 250 residents decided to stay despite evacuation orders, which were active across 12 zones and affected the Camarillo, Ventura, Santa Paula and Fillmore areas. About 800 homes were empty when emergency responders arrived to warn people about the danger.\n\n\"The devastation is absolutely heartbreaking,\" Fryhoff said.\n\nWater providers tell some residents not to drink or boil water\n\nA pair of water companies that service Ventura County warned residents Friday not to drink or boil water, citing damage from the Mountain Fire.\n\n\"Due to the MOUNTAIN FIRE, some structures in the Crestview Mutual Water Company were destroyedby the fire, and some areas in the water system lost pressure,\" read one notice issued to residents who live on 13 different streets in the county. \"These conditions may have caused harmful contaminants, including benzene and other volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), to enter the water system.\"\n\n\"Bottled water should be used for all drinking (including baby formula and juice), brushing teeth, and making ice and food preparation until further notice,\" it added.\n\nThe Pleasant Valley Mutual Water Company issued a similar warning, advising residents on at least five different streets that the water is not safe to drink or boil. Additionally, 180 customers at the highest elevation in the area \"are experiencing no water service until they can receive and hook up a standby generator,\" according to Ventura County.\n\nWhile Santa Ana winds subsided, they could return next week\n\nThe Mountain Fire's explosive growth was fueled by a Santa Ana wind event that brought strong wind gusts to Ventura County and other parts of Southern California this week.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Los Angeles recorded peak gusts of 26 mph in the valleys of southeastern Ventura County. A red flag warning across the mountains of Ventura and Los Angeles counties expired Friday morning.\n\nAs the winds subsided, so did the fire's explosive growth, giving officials hope they could begin to rein in the flames. However, the strong gusts could soon reemerge.\n\nDr. Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Los Angeles, said a weak to moderate Santa Ana wind event is expected early to middle of next week, which could raise fire risk.\n\nMountain Fire triggers flurry of school closures\n\nA number of Ventura County school districts and colleges closed as the Mountain Fire continued to rage and disrupt the lives of thousands of residents.\n\nAmong the closures on Thursday and Friday were Oxnard College, Moorpark College and Ventura College as well as dozens of county school districts. The individual schools under evacuation orders serve well over 70,000 students, according to a list compiled by the Ventura County Office of Education.\n\nWhen the fire erupted early Wednesday morning, several schools were in session and had to evacuate.\n\nStudents, faculty and staff of Camarillo Heights Elementary School had to flee, according to a statement from the Pleasant Valley School District. Oxnard Union High School District closed down eight high schools and transported students from one school to another to be picked up.\n\nJesus Vaca, principal of Somis School, said the 219-student campus was in the \"lucky part of town\" and didn't have to evacuate. However, some students stayed on campus after the school day was over because their family homes are within the evacuation zone.\n\n– Isaiah Murtaugh, Ventura County Star\n\nMountain Fire overwhelms water system, hampers operations\n\nIn addition to the rugged terrain, weak water pressure became an obstacle for fire crews attempting to gain a foothold and halt the fire's spread.\n\nOfficials said the water system was being used to fill hundreds of engines and that every fire hydrant was being tapped. \"There was so much firefighter demand for (fire) suppression that it overwhelmed the system,\" said Ian Prichard, deputy general manager for the Calleguas Municipal Water District, which provides water to roughly three quarters of Ventura County residents.\n\nFirefighters adapted. They went to lower elevations, filled up water tankers and brought that supply to the engines in the hills, Prichard said. However, power outages also hampered their efforts, forcing the use of portable generators. The fire also burned a water pumping station.\n\nFire crews plan to take advantage of the cooler temperatures and lower winds at night by flying helicopters and dropping fire-retardant chemicals, Ventura County Fire Chief Dustin Gardner said at a news conference Thursday. He said he expects crews will spend \"the next four or five days getting this under control.\"\n\n– Tony Biasotti and Tom Kiske Ventura County Star\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom signs emergency declaration in Ventura County\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday announced a state of emergency in Ventura County and said he secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to \"help ensure the availability of vital resources to suppress the fire.\"\n\nNewsom said 3,500 homes structures and businesses were threatened by the wildfire. In response to the Mountain Fire and other blazes across the state, the governor positioned 48 pieces of firefighting equipment, nine helicopters and over 100 personnel throughout 19 counties since Sunday.\n\n“This is a dangerous fire that’s spreading quickly and threatening lives. State resources have been mobilized to protect communities, and this federal support from the Biden-Harris Administration will give state and local firefighters the resources they need to save lives and property as they continue battling this aggressive fire,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nAs of early Friday, over 2,400 personnel have been assigned to Mountain Fire in a large containment effort involving 378 fire engines, 14 helicopters and 17 bulldozers, according to Cal Fire.\n\nRed flag warnings active in Southern California\n\nWhile red flag warnings in Ventura County had expired by Friday afternoon, the advisories urging people not to burn anything outdoors were in place throughout other parts of Southern California.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in San Diego issued a red flag warning for parts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties, citing danger posed by northeast winds and humidity levels of 5 to 10%. \"Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly,\" the weather service warned. \"Outdoor burning is not recommended.\"\n\nAreas under red flag warnings are experiencing \"critical fire weather,\" meaning there's a combination of strong winds, low humidity and warm temperatures that can fuel \"extreme fire behavior.\"\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci and Jorge L.

The warning includes Indio, southeastern Palm Springs and Coachella.\n\n“Life threatening flash flooding of creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses,” is possible according to the warning.\n\nThe extreme weather comes as Tropical Storm Kay trudges northward after making landfall Thursday in Mexico as a Category 1 hurricane. While Kay has weakened to a tropical storm, it is still packing sustained winds of 40 mph. And it is enhancing winds through mountain terrain – similar to a Santa Ana wind event – to much stronger gusts, including a 109-mph blast Friday at Cuyamaca Peak in the San Diego Mountains, the weather service reported.\n\nAs Kay’s rotating winds push warm, dry air from the east, much of Southern and Central California – already baking through a climate crisis-fueled heat wave – will stay under excessive heat warnings through 8 p.m. Friday. And concern is growing the erratic, strong winds will spread already-burning wildfires, including the Fairview Fire, which has killed two people and exploded in size this week, forcing evacuations as it’s burned more than 27,400 acres.\n\n“With the really strong winds, we could continue to see the fires that are already burning continue to burn and spread before the rain actually gets here,” the National Weather Service in San Diego told CNN.\n\nRain from Kay had begun falling Friday in far Southern California, including San Diego, and far southwest Arizona, including Yuma, as flash flooding risks increase.\n\nThe weather service said in a 1:40 p.m. PT update heavy rain continued in the San Diego deserts and rain bands were pushing into Orange and Riverside counties.\n\nThree hours later the Los Angeles office reported light rain over the LA Basin and said isolated stronger storm cells were possible during the evening commute.\n\nWhile the rain could quell the crushing heat – bringing relief to weary residents and power grid operators who’d prepped for rolling outages – it also could trigger debris flows, especially in places just ravaged by fire.\n\nA flash flood warning was also in effect for southwestern Imperial County, where up to 1.5 inches of rain had fallen.\n\nIt wasn’t raining just in California. The weather service office in Flagstaff, Arizona, warned of life-threatening flash floods in Cococino County of “low-water crossings, creeks, normally dry washes and roads.” Grand Canyon National Park is included in the warning, the weather service said.\n\nFlood watches cover more than 6 million people across Southern California, including Palm Springs, Riverside and Barstow; southern Nevada, including Las Vegas; and western Arizona, including Yuma, Lake Havasu City and Kingman.\n\nAnd though the Western US has been plagued for months by drought, getting up to 4 inches of rain in just two days won’t deliver the sort of recovery that’s needed. Indeed, the Imperial Valley region, home to one of the nation’s most productive farm belts and suffering severe drought since early spring, is now bracing for serious damage.\n\n“Imperial Valley farmers are in the middle of preparing their lands for the planting season, so a half an inch to 1 inch of rain will cause damage and delays to their schedule,” said Robert Schettler, a spokesperson for the Imperial Irrigation District.\n\nWhile the damage Kay will leave behind is uncertain, the storm is expected to leave in its trail more moderate temperatures as it turns away from the US West Coast and pushes out into the Pacific on Saturday.\n\nMeantime, wildfires also continue to ravage Northern California, while Oregon faces heightened fire danger as similar strong winds from the east blow in from a separate weather system.\n\nHigh temperature and rain records could fall\n\nWith triple-digit temperatures continuing Friday for much of California, record highs are expected to be set before Kay’s cool-down takes hold.\n\nWeather officials in Los Angeles reported a temperature of 97 degrees Thursday at the Los Angeles International Airport – beating its previous record for the date of September 8, set in 1984. The city of Paso Robles, California, also beat its record for that date, with 108 degrees; its previous record of 106 was set last year.\n\nBehind the heat, fast, heavy deluges also could rewrite record books. Two to 4 inches is expected over 36 hours on Friday and Saturday at Imperial County Airport, which on average gets 2.38 inches of rain each year. If Imperial receives more than 3 inches of rain, it will make this month its wettest September on record; the previous wettest September was in 1976.\n\nIn Palm Springs, which typically sees 4.61 inches of rain annually, 2 to 4 inches are forecast. Three inches at Palm Springs would put this month in the top three wettest Septembers for the city, where the average September rainfall is 0.24 inches.\n\nAnd Yuma could see 1.5 inches – which would make 2022 the wettest September since 2009. The city’s average September rainfall is 0.68 inches.\n\nFire woes impact California and Oregon\n\nThough rain no doubt would aid firefighters working to extinguish wildfires, much damage already has been done: California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday declared a state of emergency for three counties over two blazes.\n\nBeyond the Fairview Fire, the Mosquito Fire in Northern California’s El Dorado and Placer counties has charred 29,585 acres and is 0% contained, according to InciWeb, a national wildfire clearinghouse. The fire threatens more than 3,600 structures, according to a Friday update on the website.\n\nEvacuation orders were issued for parts of Placer County, and some residents of El Dorado County have been ordered to evacuate, officials said.\n\n“Both fires are threatening multiple communities and critical infrastructure, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents,” the governor’s office said in a statement.\n\nOregon, meanwhile, faces strong winds from the east that will increase fire danger across the state due to a weather system separate from Kay.\n\n“A red flag warning … will be in effect this FRIDAY & SATURDAY, due to the expected strong east winds and low humidity. These conditions can cause rapid spread of fire,” the National Weather Service in Portland tweeted.\n\nWind gusts in the region are expected to range from 25 to 50 mph, according to a tweet from the weather service in Portland.\n\nUtility companies Pacific Power and Portland General Electric announced they may proactively turn off power in some high-risk areas to reduce the risk of fire.\n\nThe outages would be implemented “in a limited, high-risk area to help reduce the risk of wildfire and to help protect people, property and the environment,” Portland General Electric said in a release. The move could impact about 30,000 customer meters in the Portland and Salem, Oregon, area, the utility said.\n\nAbout 12,000 Pacific Power customers in Linn, Douglas, Lincoln, Tillamook, Marion and Polk counties have been notified of the potential shut-offs, the provider said in a statement.", "authors": ["Haley Brink Judson Jones Michelle Krupa Steve Almasy", "Haley Brink", "Judson Jones", "Michelle Krupa", "Steve Almasy"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/11/07/mountain-fire-ventura-county/76108490007/", "title": "Southern California wildfire engulfs homes, moving 'dangerously fast'", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news on the Mountain Fire for Thursday, Nov. 7.

Ventura County Fire Capt. Trevor Johnson said suppression efforts are focused on the northeast section of the blaze, close to the city of Santa Paula.\n\nVentura County Sheriff Jim Fryhoff said 10 injuries have been confirmed, including several from smoke inhalation. None appeared to be life-threatening.\n\nMore than 400 homes were evacuated Thursday, Fryhoff said, and 250 residents chose to stay. First responders visited about 800 additional homes where no one was present.\n\n\"The devastation is absolutely heartbreaking,\" Fryhoff said.\n\nTen damage inspection teams were in the field Thursday, officials said. The teams found 132 structures were destroyed — many of them homes — while 88 were damaged. Officials did not say how many additional homes were to be inspected.\n\n\"This is a slow process because we have to make sure that the properties are safe,\" said firefighter Andy VanSciver, a spokesman for Ventura County Fire. He stressed that assessment team members have to ensure gas lines, electrical lines, and other hazards are not harmful.\n\nEvacuation orders will remain in place through Thursday, the county said, adding that at least 800 firefighters from across the state were battling the blaze and more are expected.\n\nWildfire smoke map: Track fires and red flag warnings across the US\n\nFire threatens thousands of homes, other buildings\n\nReporters and photographers with the Ventura County Star, part of the USA TODAY Network, witnessed homes burning throughout the day near Camarillo and Somis.\n\nThe fire was threatening over 3,500 structures, Gov.

She was riding a horse by 6 a.m.\n\n“Then the weather started going south,” said Gurney, 81, who has owned Keenridge Farms since the 1970s.\n\nThe sky grew thick with smoke and flames. The fire came over the hill. Gurney, a two-time Olympian in the equestrian competition of dressage, knew she had to leave.\n\n“There was no choice,” she said. “We just barely beat the fire.”\n\nGurney brought her horses to the evacuation stables at Ventura County Fairgrounds, feeding them hay and handing out pizza delivered by a Good Samaritan. She said she worried about her ranch, concluding at one point it was most likely gone. But she met someone from another ranch who said Keenridge was still standing Thursday morning, offering her a glimpse of hope.\n\n“I hope I will be home tomorrow,” she said.\n\n– Ventura County Star\n\nMilder weather on the horizon\n\nDr. Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service Los Angeles/Oxnard office, said that winds are starting to subside after the agency issued \"particularly dangerous situation\" red flag warnings.\n\nAbout 26 million people across California were under red flag warnings earlier Thursday, with many expiring by 6 p.m. PT. The National Weather Service said warnings remained in place for the mountains until 11 a.m. Friday, when winds are expected to subside. Cohen said onshore winds soon after will bring up relative humidity.\n\nBut a weak to moderate Santa Ana wind event is expected early to middle of next week, Cohen said, which could raise fire risk.\n\nFirefighters battle tough landscape\n\nFirefighters are grappling with treacherous terrain on the northeast part of the blaze, which has become their focus.\n\n“The fire there is in a tricky place,'' Johnson said at a news conference. \"It’s rugged, steep ground that only our finest firefighters can even access to work in there. So we have aircraft working there to pin it down. They’re coming up with multiple options.’’\n\nDrew Smith, assistant chief of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, said the strong winds can carry embers for up to three miles, making it much harder to contain the blaze.\n\n“These fires when we’re on our high-risk days of Santa Ana winds are different from when we have our fires during the summer that are not in a wind-dominated fire environment,’’ Smith said.\n\nFire chief: 'We will stay with our community until the very end'\n\nSome firefighters worked 36 straight hours since the blaze ignited Wednesday, the fire chief said late Thursday.\n\n\"That's a feat of human strength,\" Gardner said.\n\nHe added that first responders will be in the community for the days ahead to assist residents when it is safe to return to their homes.

For the latest news on severe weather across the country, including the Midwest and upstate New York, view USA TODAY's story for Wednesday, July 17.\n\nDamaging thunderstorms and a reported tornado prompted a statewide response in New York late Tuesday, as rain, hail, and heat threatened millions of residents along the East Coast a day after severe weather in the Midwest left one person dead.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches were in effect Tuesday night across several states, including New Jersey, New York, Delaware, and Maryland as the National Weather Service warned of dangerous winds, hail, and tornadoes. Parts of Northern Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma were also under thunderstorm watches.\n\nThe heavy rain Monday left parts of the Midwest at risk of flash flooding. A stretch of Missouri and Illinois was placed under a flash flood warning, hours after the National Weather Service issued a flash flood threat in southern-central Indiana into early Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the weather service, east-central Missouri was also hit with a tornado warning just after noon on Tuesday after radar detected a tornado moving at 15 mph. As of late Tuesday, more than 166,000 customers remained without power across Illinois and Indiana, according to a USA TODAY outage tracker.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency Tuesday as thunderstorms ripped through the state, knocking out power to more than 175,000 customers. The New York State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation was also assembling crews to assist with storm cleanup in Oneida County, where a tornado reportedly touched down and left a trail of damage in its wake.\n\nSevere weather on Tuesday comes after a \"complex of destructive storms\" moved across eastern Iowa into northern Illinois on Monday night, according to the weather Service office in Chicago. Multiple tornadoes were reported along the line of storms as it moved through the Chicago metro, the agency said, adding its staff had to briefly seek shelter from a tornado.\n\nThe weather service confirmed three tornadoes on Monday night. One tornado was confirmed by radar near Sugar Grove, a village about 46 miles west of Chicago, according to the weather service. Another two tornadoes touched down near Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nA 44-year-old woman died in Cedar Lake, an Indiana town around 45 miles south of Chicago, on Monday night after a tree fell on her home amid the severe storms, the Lake County Coroner's Office posted on Facebook.\n\nNo summer relief:U.S. cities with lowest air conditioning rates suffer through blistering heat\n\nFull dam failure in Illinois prevented after residents evacuated\n\nOn Tuesday, officials in Nashville, Illinois, a town about 50 miles east of St. Louis, issued an evacuation order amid the \"imminent failure\" of a local dam, putting the area at risk of flash flooding.\n\nSome residents reported waist-high levels of water inside their houses, according to the Washington County Emergency Management Agency, and one person trapped inside required a rescue. No deaths or injuries were reported as of Tuesday evening, the agency said.\n\nThe \"immediate safety concern\" had passed after there was no additional rain, the agency said Tuesday evening. The Army Corps of Engineers assessed the reservoir and noted that repairs will be required to maintain the integrity of the dam, according to the agency.\n\nThe agency added that the secondary dam reacted and helped prevent a full dam failure. Authorities said residents were allowed to return to evacuated areas but advised people to avoid travel due to flooded roads and decreased visibility.\n\n\"However, there is significant property damage from the flooding,\" the agency said in a statement. \"It could be quite some time before the impacted areas return to normal.\"\n\nThe announcement came after a flash flood warning was issued by the National Weather Service in St. Louis through 10:45 a.m. local time. Forecasters warned that thunderstorms and heavy rain on Tuesday morning could trigger \"life-threatening\" flooding of creeks, streams, highways, streets, urban areas and underpasses.\n\nBy 1 p.m. local time Tuesday, the county's emergency management agency had documented more than 6 inches of rain.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said on X that she was in contact with local officials in Rome and deployed resources from state police and other agencies to support recovery efforts.\n\nRome Mayor Jeffrey Lanigan said the weather disaster was unprecedented for the city but urged residents to be positive.\n\n“Romans are resilient. And we’re going to build back,” Lanigan said Tuesday. “Give us the time and space we need right now and let our guys work, and I promise you Rome will come back even better.”\n\nThe catastrophic storm comes just days after seven twisters touched down in the central and western parts of the state. The National Weather Service is expected to determine on Wednesday whether Tuesday's system was a tornado.\n\nOn Tuesday, the weather service office in Buffalo confirmed that a tornado touched down in Canandaigua — a city about 27 miles southeast of Rochester — on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe EF-0 twister had peak wind speeds of 75 mph and was on the ground for two minutes, traveling 0.7 miles, according to the data released Tuesday afternoon. The tornado had a width of 75 yards and damaged trees and some homes.\n\nTwo confirmed tornadoes near Des Moines, Iowa\n\nThe weather service said Tuesday that an EF1 tornado traveled just over 7 miles through Urbandale, Windsor Heights, and Des Moines, as wind gusts reached 105 mph.\n\nThere were no injuries or deaths from the tornado. But the storm left behind damaged trees, homes, and downed power lines, knocking out electricity and internet for 10,000 people at its peak Monday.\n\nAn EF1 tornado also hit the Quad Cities on Monday evening. The tornado started in Davenport and moved east. It passed through Bettendorf and crossed the Mississippi River, making it to East Moline.\n\nWind speeds were as high as 100 mph, and the tornado traveled 8 miles. The max width of the tornado was 100 yards. It resulted in damage to trees, roofs, and cars.\n\nMonday storms caused by rare, destructive derecho\n\nMonday's series of storms was triggered by a derecho, according to Weather.com. Classified as a \"wide-spread, long-lived wind storm\" by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), derechos can come with fast-moving thunderstorms and showers.\n\nThe storms are rare but can cause destruction comparable to a tornado, according to the National Weather Service. Unlike tornadoes, they generally inflict damage in one direction, on a straight-line path.\n\nA storm must sustain winds of 58 mph or greater and leave a path of damage at least 250 miles long to be classified as a derecho, according to the weather service. Many derechos pack wind gusts that blow at more than 100 mph, toppling power lines and trees and wreaking widespread devastation.\n\nMeteorologists only see around one derecho every one to four years. They usually strike the eastern two-thirds of the country, and 70% happen from May to August, the weather service said.\n\nIntense heat wave threatens East Coast\n\nMeanwhile, scorching heat continued for the third week this month as more than 126 million people remained under heat alerts across the country on Tuesday, according to heat.gov. The Weather Prediction Center said scorching temperatures are expected to continue to grip the East Coast, with major to extreme heat risk possible.\n\nIn Baltimore and Washington, D.C., the weather service warned of a \"dangerously hot and humid\" day; temperatures were expected to reach 102 degrees.\n\nThe weekslong heat wave has already set dozens of records and will challenge more through the week, AccuWeather said.\n\nHurricane Beryl:Beryl produced so many tornado warnings it broke a record\n\nCold front brings heat relief, storm risk this week\n\nA strong cold front pushing across the central to eastern U.S. this week will bring an end to a wave of record-high temperatures in the region, the National Weather Service said Tuesday, though strong summer heat will continue to pose health risks.\n\n\"While record highs may be diminishing on Wednesday, the combination of another day of heat and high humidities will continue to produce life-threatening conditions,\" the weather service warned.\n\nThe cold front could also fuel widespread thunderstorms across the central and eastern U.S., the weather service said, which could cause flash flooding in some towns. The rain will be welcome in large swaths of the region where an unusually dry summer so far has spurred moderate to severe drought conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, the weather service said no relief is in sight for an unusually hot season in the West, where temperatures are expected to reach 5 to 15 degrees above average and little rainfall is expected.\n\n\"Given the dry conditions, hot temps and low relative humidities, fire risks will continue across large portions of the West over the next few days,\" the weather service wrote.\n\nOregon thunderstorms could fan wildfire flames\n\nAt least four wildfires blazed in Oregon on Tuesday as the governor declared a state of emergency ahead of thunderstorms expected in the Portland area into the evening.\n\n\"I urge all Oregonians to take extreme precautions, particularly with lightning in the forecast for this weekend,\" Gov. Tina Kotek wrote in a statement. \"It is incumbent on all of us to keep Oregon green and protect our communities.”\n\nKotek invoked the declaration specifically in response to the Cow Valley Fire, which had blazed through more than 133,400 acres and was only 16% contained, as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Portland also issued a fire weather watch throughout the Willamette National Forest, around 80 miles south of Portland.\n\nForecasters warned that lightning from thunderstorms expected to move over the area on Tuesday night could start fires in the dry environment. Winds from the storm could also spread the flames, the weather service said.\n\nMeanwhile, fires in Arizona had consumed more than 56,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nThe largest, the Freeman Fire, was three-quarters contained on Tuesday after it blazed through more than 32,500 acres.\n\nThe fire was sparked by a lightning strike last Thursday near Oracle, around 30 miles northwest of Tucson, and grew after it merged with another fire sparked by lightning, the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported. Evacuation orders for nearby areas were lifted on Sunday.\n\nSnow in Philly in July?\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, New Jersey issued a daily record report Monday morning saying a “trace” of snow at Philadelphia International Airport on Sunday set a new daily record.\n\nThe \"snow\" was really hail that fell in thunderstorms over the airport, the office stated in a post on X with a #TeamSnow hashtag. The \"trace\" of snow broke a record of 0.0 inches, set in 1870, the weather service office shared X. By Tuesday afternoon, the post had been viewed more than 166,000 times.\n\nUnder a policy of the National Centers for Environmental Information, hail is considered frozen precipitation under the same umbrella as snow, sleet, and graupel, the office stated in a response to its original post.\n\n3 suspected heat-related deaths at Utah parks\n\nEarlier Monday, the San Juan County Sheriff's Office in southeast Utah confirmed that a man and his daughter died late last week after they ran out of water during a hike.\n\nThe sheriff's office said it was notified at 5:45 p.m. on July 12 of a deceased hiker in the Canyonlands National Park. About 15 minutes later, a second deceased hiker was reported in the same area.\n\nThe National Park Service reported that the pair of hikers were a father and daughter \"who had become lost while hiking, according to the sheriff's office. The air temperature at the time of the incident was over 100 degrees, the National Park Service said.\n\n\"Dispatch informed NPS of emergency 911 texts from the hikers, reporting that they were lost and out of water,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement.\n\nThe father and daughter were identified as Albino Herrera Espinoza, 52, and Beatriz Herrera, 23, both from Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\nOn Saturday, the Santa Clara-Ivins Public Safety Department in southwest Utah said first responders were dispatched to the Snow Canyon State Park, where preliminary information showed two individuals \"suffering from a heat-related incident.\" The two individuals had signs of heat exhaustion and were transported to a hospital.\n\n\"While on the scene, a passerby contacted police and reported that a third individual was unconscious a short distance away,\" the department said in a news release. \"The individual was identified as a 30-year-old female.\"\n\nFirst responders determined that the woman was deceased, according to the department. Her death is being investigated by the department.\n\nDozens of heat-related deaths have been reported by state officials and local media this month. Although the death toll is expected to increase as the summer continues, experts previously told USA TODAY that the true death toll is likely higher.\n\nIllinois man dies after truck sinks in floodwaters\n\nOfficials in Rockford, Illinois, are investigating the death of a 76-year-old man who was trapped as floodwaters swept away a pickup on Sunday, the Rockford Register Star, part of the USAT TODAY Network, reported.\n\nThe man was riding in the passenger seat of a Dodge Dakota truck as the woman driving tried to leave a parking lot inundated with flood water, according to the Winnebago County Coroner's Office.\n\nWhen the truck was pulled into a nearby creek, the driver escaped through a window and was rescued, officials said. The man was trapped in the truck as it sank below the water. Local law enforcement tried to pull him out, but could not rescue him.\n\nThe truck was pulled from the creek and the man was pronounced dead around three hours later.\n\nAuthorities have not named either the man who died or the woman who was rescued.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; Kate Kealey, Des Moines Register; Casey Pritchard, Utica Observer Dispatch; Victoria E.

Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for Mariposa County after the fire forced more than 3,000 people to evacuate their homes, a news release from his office said. Activating a state of emergency allows for additional resources to aid response to the fire.\n\nElectricity service in the area stopped Friday at about 4 p.m., “and the fire has been coming towards us faster and faster,” Detamore said.\n\nThe fire had destroyed at least 10 structures and damaged another five, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, said Saturday. At that time, the blaze was threatening 2,000 other structures, Cal Fire said.\n\nIt had burned 6,555 acres by Saturday morning and nearly 12,000 that evening, according to Cal Fire. Fire activity was extreme, and emergency personnel were working to evacuate people and protect buildings, the department said.\n\nEleven fire crews with more than 400 personnel, as well as 45 fire engines and four helicopters, have been assigned to fight the flames, Cal Fire said.\n\nEvacuations have been ordered for certain areas of Mariposa County south and east of the fire, as shown in an online map. The evacuation zones did not include the town of Mariposa.\n\nA Red Cross evacuation center has been established at an elementary school in Mariposa, Cal Fire said.\n\nThe blaze comes as much of the US has been experiencing an extreme heat wave this week, with parts of California seeing temperatures in the triple-digits.\n\nWildfires scorching the western US in recent years have become more common due to worsening drought conditions fueled by climate change. In California alone, more than 2.5 million acres were burned in nearly 9,000 fires last year, according to Cal Fire.\n\nCouple left with ‘just the clothes on their back’\n\nNick Smith told CNN his parents’ home burned down as a result of the fire. His parents, Jane and Wes Smith, lived in their Mariposa home for 37 years, he said.\n\n“It’s pretty sad to see the house that I grew up in and was raised in gone,” he said. “It hits hard.”\n\nA firefighter runs to extinguish flames from the Oak Fire in Mariposa County on Friday. Noah Berger/AP\n\nSmith told CNN that his father is a Mariposa sheriff and was working on the fire when his mother, Jane, had to evacuate. She had time to load their horses and get out of the area, according to Smith.\n\n“They had just the clothes on their back and the shoes on their feet,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, the couple is staying with friends and family. Smith created a verified GoFundMe to support his parents and help them overcome their loss.\n\n“They lived in their home for over 37 years, and now have lost everything,” Smith wrote on the GoFundMe. “37 years of memories, generations of family treasures, and countless more sentimental things. Although these are materials, it is devastating to lose everything literally in the blink of an eye without notice.”\n\nThe blaze is a few dozen miles southwest of Yosemite National Park’s southern edges, though the park is closer when measured by a straight line.\n\nThe Oak Fire is the largest of California’s currently active wildfires of note, which numbered at least six Saturday morning, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe second-largest, the Washburn Fire, has burned in and near southern Yosemite National Park for more than two weeks. It had burned more than 4,850 acres and was 79% contained by Saturday morning, according to InciWeb, a US clearinghouse for fire information.", "authors": ["Jason Hanna Rebekah Riess Sara Smart Andy Rose", "Jason Hanna", "Rebekah Riess", "Sara Smart", "Andy Rose"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/07/10/oregon-wildfire-bootleg-fire-police-arrest-people-evacuation-zone/7929254002/", "title": "Oregon wildfires: Moderate temperatures let crews mop up around ...", "text": "Multiple wildfires are burning across Oregon, particularly in the southern and central parts of the state.\n\nHere's a map of all Oregon wildfires burning and the smoke they're putting up.\n\nHere's a roundup of the most significant fires.\n\nBootleg Fire containment increases as temperatures rise\n\nUpdated 1:30 p.m. Friday, July 23\n\nContainment has increased by 33% this week on the Bootleg Fire, which has now grown to more than 400,000 acres. Over 2,000 personnel remain on the scene.\n\nAfter a few days of humidity with calmer winds, higher temperatures are expected to last through the weekend. Combined with a slight southern shift in wind direction, conditions are likely to become less favorable for ongoing suppression efforts.\n\n“The fire continues to throw challenges at us, and we are going to continue to stay vigilant, work hard, and adapt,” said Joe Hessel, an Incident Commander with the Oregon Department of Forestry.\n\nOvernight, crews built lines to connect the Long Creek and Coyote Creek watersheds on the northeast perimeter, while other nearby units worked to suppress smaller fires that spotted over Forest Service Road 2901 towards the unincorporated Summer Lake community.\n\nOn the southeastern perimeter, more fires spotted into unburnt stands, and crews Friday were holding their lines there. Along southern lines, firefighters are patrolling and mopping up hot spots, while staying prepared to join defensive efforts in areas of growth, should conditions change.\n\nPrevious evacuation notices remain in place, and are joined by Level 3 orders for residences between the Paisley Airport and milepost 82, and from Picture Rock Pass to milepost 77.\n\nAn updated map of the expanding evacuation orders can be found here .\n\nContainment of Jack Fire holds steady\n\nUpdated 1:30 p.m. Friday, July 23\n\nThe 19,949-acre Jack Fire, burning between Roseburg and Crater Lake, is 56% contained. Both acreage and containment of the blaze have remained steady since Tuesday.\n\nCrews have held their lines North of Highway 138 for nearly two weeks now.\n\nFour helicopters are supporting ground crews in areas of concern, totaling 621 personnel on the suppression effort, 120 less than were present Tuesday.\n\nOn the east and southeast perimeters, firefighters continue line construction and reinforcement with mechanical equipment, hand crews, and prescribed burns. The west side is still being patrolled to detect and suppress spotting fires.\n\nThe Dry Creek area and Horseshoe Bend campground remain under watch by structural teams and some closures remain in effect in the Umpqua National Forest.\n\nAll evacuation levels along Highway 138 have been reduced to Level 1: Be Ready.\n\nElbow Creek Fire moving up in priority\n\nUpdated 4 p.m. Thursday, July 22\n\nThe Elbow Creek Fire, blazing in the Umatilla National Forest, is quickly becoming a top priority for firefighters.\n\nThe fire, burning 17 miles northwest of Wallowa on both sides of the Grande Ronde River, is now estimated at 19,993 acres, with 20% containment. There are 416 personnel on the scene.\n\nTwelve crews arrived at the scene Wednesday night and the fire now has resources from Washington, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Michigan, California, Oregon, and Idaho, according to a release from the Oregon Department of Forestry's incident command.\n\nThe most active area of the fire is still in the Elbow Creek Drainage close to where it meets the Grande Ronde River. Steep slopes along the Indian Ridge and Grossman Creek continue to be challenging as firefighters establish hand and dozer lines, officials said.\n\nWater-dispensing helicopters and a retardant-dropping air tanker are being used to aid firefighters in slowing the fire in the Elbow Creek and Sickfoot Creek drainages, fire officials said.\n\nOn Wednesday, firefighters were successful in a burnout operation within Sickfoot Creek and Thursday's goal was to build a fire line around the area perimeter.\n\nUpdates on evacuations and closures can be found on the Wallowa County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.\n\nModerate temperatures let crews mop up around Bruler Fire perimeter\n\nUpdated 11:30 a.m. Thursday, July 22\n\nFirefighters took advantage of the cool marine air and moderate temperatures Wednesday to start mopping up around the perimeter of the Bruler Fire, burning about 9 miles south of Detroit Lake.\n\nThe fire grew to 195 acres but is 12% contained, according to U.S. Forest Service officials. There are 250 personnel on the scene.\n\nHeavy equipment including masticators, feller bunchers and bulldozers were used to strengthen the direct control line on the north side of the fire, allowing crews to place hose and sprinklers. Firefighters were able to create large fire breaks to lessen the chances of the fire spreading beyond primary control lines.\n\nOn Thursday, crews will start building a contingency control line on the west and south sides of the fire. Contingency lines are in place in case a weather event stirs up the fire.\n\nWeather and fire behavior: Temperatures will be similar to Wednesday, in the upper 70s and relative humidities in the 30% range. Winds are forecasted to stay light over the weekend, officials said.\n\nSmoke: Air quality around the communities of Detroit and Sweet Home are still listed as \"good.\" Light winds from the southwest are keeping smoke from the Bruler Fire to the east.\n\nClosures: Large portions of Forest Service lands south of Detroit Lake, west of Highway 22 and north of Highway 20 are closed. Also closed are the Middle Santiam Wilderness, Daly Lake, Tule Lake and the Old Cascade Crest trail system.

There are 416 personnel on the scene.\n\nWhile containment on the fire’s northern side remains secure, entry into the southern tributaries of the Grand Ronde, combined with ongoing thunderstorm warnings could enable fast and unpredictable growth.\n\nOne helicopter is currently supporting ground crews, and there are more aerial resources available.\n\nStructural task forces created defensible space around homes in Troy and Promise, before rejoining the creation of containment lines along the fire’s southern edge.\n\nConditions will remain dry and gusty through tomorrow.\n\nUpdates on evacuations and closures can be found on the Wallowa County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.\n\nCrews make progress on Jack Fire containment\n\nUpdated 2:00 p.m. Tuesday, July 20\n\nThe Jack Fire, 23 miles east of Glide in the Umpqua National Forest, is now estimated at 18,993 acres, with 55% containment. Four aircrafts and 741 personnel remain on the suppression effort.\n\nThere have been 6 reported injuries from the blaze as crews enter their third week of suppression efforts.\n\nToday, crews are continuing mop up along the fire’s northern edge, while fallers remove hazards along roadways to keep them safe for fire personnel and the public.\n\nSouth of Highway 138, crews remove fuels in order to deepen and connect existing lines, while mopping up hot spots within the perimeter. On the southwest sides of the blaze, crews are doing this by burning vegetation, while to the east, they’re using heavy equipment to widen fuel breaks created by roads.\n\nAs containment increases, structural personnel have withdrawn hose lines from around the Dry Creek community, though they continue to patrol the area and mop-up nearby hot spots.\n\nUmpqua National Forest remains closed. Updated closure details and maps can be found here.\n\nBruler Fire remains stable as hazards are removed along perimeter\n\nUpdated 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, July 20\n\nThe Bruler Fire, about 9 miles south of Detroit Lake, is still estimated at 156 acres, with 10% containment. There are 219 personnel on the scene.\n\nTuesday, crews continue to rely on sprinklers lined around the fire’s rim while fallers and masticators remove forest matter that make areas of the perimeter unsafe for ground crews.\n\nFallers on the north side of the fire have finished removing hazardous snags, and they are moving to the northwest side to remove hazards there today. Once each side is safe, engines with hoses will be able to approach the fire’s outer hot spots.\n\nThe area’s large closure remains imperative not only to public safety, but also to crews. When too many ground personnel are tasked with evacuating locals, there are insufficient numbers on areas of the fire that require the most immediate suppression efforts.\n\nTuesday’s higher temperatures and wind speeds aren’t expected to last, with cool and humid weather forecasted to arrive Wednesday.\n\nWhile smoke will remain visible from Detroit and Santiam Pass, the fire is not currently threatening any communities.\n\nAdditional resources are expected to arrive in the coming days.\n\nUpdated information can be found at the Bruler Fire Facebook Page .\n\nThreat of lightning storms prompts request for more resources\n\nUpdated 8:15 a.m. Tuesday, July 20\n\nThe threat of thunderstorms and lightning has prompted officials in fire-ravaged Oregon to ask for help from outside the Pacific Northwest to prepare for additional blazes as many resources are already devoted to a massive fire in the state that has grown to a third the size of Rhode Island.\n\nThe 537-square-mile Bootleg Fire is burning in and around the Fremont-Winema National Forest, a vast expanse of old-growth forest, lakes and wildlife refuges. Evacuations and property losses have been minimal.\n\nBut eyeing how the Bootleg Fire — fueled by extreme weather — keeps growing by miles each day, officials with the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in southwest Oregon are asking for more outside crews to be ready should there be a surge in fire activity there.\n\n“Although the lightning activity predicted for early this week is expected to occur east of us, we are prepared for the worst, and hoping for the best,” Mike McCann, an assistant fire staff, said Monday in a statement released by the national forest.\n\nThe worry is that dry conditions, a drought and the recent record-breaking heat wave in the region have created tinderbox conditions, so resources like fire engines are being recruited from places like Arkansas, Nevada and Alaska.\n\n— Gillian Flaccus, Associated Press\n\nContained La Pine fire leaves several structures damaged\n\nUpdated 2:50 p.m. Monday, July 19\n\nThe 686-acre Darlene Fire, just south of La Pine, is now 85% contained. Several structures, RVs and vehicles were damaged or destroyed by the fire, officials say.\n\nFire movement has been minimal, with the majority of the remaining burn zone reduced to smoldering hot spots. The weekend’s low winds are expected to stay minimal, making further airborne spread of embers unlikely.\n\nCrews are expected to continue to hold their lines, moving inward and extinguishing hot spots as they find them.\n\nOfficials are confident about the trajectory of suppression, and will cease communications and news releases Monday evening.\n\nOfficials ask that returning evacuees be aware of hazards such as burned trees and structural damages.\n\nAll Level 3 evacuation zones have been reduced, but open fires are still prohibited in the area.\n\nElbow Creek Fire spreads into canyons as conditions worsen\n\nUpdated 2:16 p.m. Monday, July 19\n\nA fire burning 31 miles southeast of Walla Walla, Washington, the previously-underestimated Elbow Creek Fire, now exceeds 16,000 acres with 10% containment.\n\nGov. Kate Brown’s Emergency Conflagration Act on Friday ushered in more resources to the fire, currently staffed by 343 personnel.\n\nWinds from the northeast have pushed the fire southwest into the steep rocky canyons of the Grande Ronde basin, making it largely inaccessible to ground crews. In these areas, dozers are being utilized on the canyon rims, where they are the most effective and safe control options.\n\nThe north and eastern perimeters are successfully being held by the quickly-established control lines there.\n\nRed Flag warnings have been issued in the area, as lightning storms are predicted to carry in unpredictable wind patterns.\n\nClosures are in effect for all of the Umatilla National Forest as well as for the Grand Ronde river past Minam State Park.\n\nEvacuation updates can be found on the Wallowa County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page.\n\nBootleg Fire continues rapid spread\n\nUpdated 2:00 p.m. Monday, July 19\n\nThis monstrous wildfire has grown to a third the size of Rhode Island and spreads miles each day, but evacuations and property losses have been minimal compared with much smaller blazes in densely populated areas of California.\n\nThe 476-square-mile Bootleg Fire is burning in and around the Fremont-Winema National Forest, a vast expanse of old-growth forest, lakes and wildlife refuges.\n\nAt least 2,000 homes have been evacuated at some point during the fire and another 5,000 threatened. At least 70 homes and more than 100 outbuildings have gone up in flames. Thick smoke chokes the area where residents and wildlife alike have already been dealing with months of drought and extreme heat. No one has died.\n\nPushed by strong winds from the southwest, the fire is spreading rapidly to the north and east, advancing toward an area that's increasingly remote.\n\nEvacuation orders on the fire's southern edge, closer to more populous areas like Klamath Falls and Bly, have been lifted or relaxed as crews gain control. Now it's small, unincorporated communities like Paisley and Long Creek — both with fewer than 250 people — and scattered homesteads that are in the crosshairs.\n\n“The Bootleg Fire is threatening ranch houses that are in pretty far-flung areas,” a fire official said. “There are no suburbs in that area.”\n\n— Gillian Flaccus, Associated Press\n\nCrews minimize spread of Jack Fire\n\nUpdated 1:40 p.m. Monday, July 19\n\nMost of the Jack Fire’s spread is now under control, with the exception of the southeast corner, towards upper Calf Creek.\n\nBetween Roseburg and Crater Lake, the fire is now estimated at 17,994 acres with 50% containment; 763 personnel remain on the containment effort.\n\nControl lines North of Highway 138, which have held strong, continue to be deepened while crews mop up hot spots along their interior. South of the highway, crews aim to widen existing fuel breaks created by roads with dozers, while creating new handlines to link them.\n\nThough containment has increased significantly, officials say that structures aren’t in the clear yet. 243 buildings- mostly in the Dry Creek community and Horseshoe Bend Campground- are still considered at risk.\n\nFour helicopters are providing water and retardant drops to enable ground crews to deepen containment lines.\n\nThe recent trend of cool, slow winds is expected to carry into the middle of the week, with thicker clouds arriving this evening.\n\nGrandview Fire containment increases as favorable weather arrives\n\nUpdated 10:40 a.m. Sunday, July 18\n\nUsing more accurate mapping information, the Oregon Department of Forestry says the Grandview Fire, located about 10 miles north of Sisters, is now estimated to be 6,032 acres and 43% contained.\n\nOfficials spoke optimistically about progress made against the fire during a community meeting on Saturday. Conditions remained positive for crews fighting against the fire. Temperatures are expected to remain in the lower 90s and winds from the Northwest continue at 5 to 8 mph.\n\nCrews were going to continue \"mopping up deeper into the fire to 100 feet and more,\" added ODF. Its goal is to mop up approximately 300 feet from the established perimeter line's interior.\n\nOn Friday, firefighters successfully extinguished three spot fires that hopped their lines during Wednesday’s dry heat.\n\nAreas under evacuation Level 3 orders reduced significantly on Saturday. Areas remaining under \"go now\" orders are to the north end of Wilt Road, south of the Jefferson and Deschutes county line.\n\nThe Deschutes National Forest, Ochoco National Forest and Crooked River National Grassland have closed all Forest Service roads and trails within the Grandview Fire perimeter.\n\n'Little growth' for Bruler Fire\n\nUpdated 1 p.m. Sunday, July 18\n\nWith continued cooler temperatures, light winds and high humidity, firefighters were able to remove fuels around the Bruler Fire perimeter, burning 9 miles south of Detroit in the Willamette National Forest.\n\nThose favorable temperatures are expected to continue through the week.\n\nThe fire, which ignited July 12, has remained at 156 acres for the past few days. It is now contained 10%.\n\nAdditional heavy equipment, including masticators, dozers and bunchers will began arriving at the fire Monday. The west side of the fire has a large fuel load and this heavy equipment will help to mitigate hazards for firefighters and the public.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, firefighters were able to place a hose around the fire perimeter, line the entire perimeter with direct and indirect lines and place sprinklers on the perimeter of the fire, according to U.S. Forest Service officials.\n\nFirefighters used a type 2 helicopter Friday to drop water on hot spots. Officials say the water will help lessen the chances of a snag causing the fire to escape the primary line.\n\nForest Service officials said sprinklers add water to the dry, dead and down trees and plants, reducing the probability of additional fire-spread in and outside the perimeter.\n\nFirefighters on Sunday were going to continue placing sprinklers around the blaze's perimeter, hoping to bring the indirect line closer to the fire perimeter and keep the fire small.\n\nSmoke: Air quality in and around Detroit and Sweet Home are still considered \"good,\" officials said. Light westerly winds are keeping smoke from the Bruler Fire to the east.\n\nClosures: Forest Service lands south of Detroit Lake, west of Highway 22 and north of Highway 20 are closed to maintain public safety. The closure includes the Middle Santiam Wilderness, Daly Lake, Tule Lake, and the Old Cascade Crest trail system.\n\nOfficials said that the large closure area was necessary to keep firefighters' focus on fire management instead of evacuations should fire conditions suddenly change.\n\n“Thank you to all of our firefighters for their diligence in keeping the fire footprint as small as possible,” Agency Administrator Nikki Swanson said .\n\nA Bureau of Land Management closure area is in place for lands along the Quartzville Scenic Byway/Quartzville Road including Yellowbottom Campground, Old Miner's Meadow Group Site and nearby dispersed camping areas.\n\nBootleg Fire fire grows to nearly 300,000 acres\n\nUpdated 1 p.m. Sunday, July 18\n\nFirefighters used a dozer line and burnout Saturday into Sunday morning to try and minimize Bootleg Fire's fast spread overnight.\n\n\"Red flag weather conditions played a significant role in fire behavior yesterday,\" said a Sunday statement from the Oregon Department of Forestry.\n\nThe blaze grew 17,000 acres from Saturday afternoon to Sunday morning, pushing over Sam's Cain Road and 27 Road. The fire is now just under 300,000 acres at 298,666, an area about the size of Los Angeles.\n\nThe fire, burning 28 miles northeast of Klamath Falls, is still 22% contained.\n\nThe largest wildfire in the U.S. torched more dry forest landscape in Oregon on Sunday, one of dozens of major blazes burning across the West as critically dangerous fire weather loomed in the coming days.\n\nErratic winds fed the blaze, creating dangerous conditions for firefighters, said Sarah Gracey, a spokeswoman for the firefighting operation.\n\n“We’re still facing a lot of weather issues,” she said Sunday. “The winds have been … hampering our efforts most of the time.”\n\nAuthorities expanded evacuations that now affect some 2,000 residents of a largely rural area of lakes and wildlife refuges. The blaze has burned at least 67 homes and 100 outbuildings while threatening thousands more.\n\nOn Sunday, crews were prioritizing the construction of a direct fireline and contingency lines north of the fire.\n\nGroups in charge of protecting structures were focusing on homes located along the 34 and 28 roads.\n\nEvacuations: Authorities expanded evacuations that now affect some 2,000 residents of a largely rural area of lakes and wildlife refuges. But officials say evacuations continue to rapidly change due to the nature of this wildfire.

Kate Brown invoked an Emergency Conflagration Act on Friday morning in an effort to get extra resources to the Elbow Creek Fire that broke out in Wallowa County.\n\nThe fire is estimated to be 10,940 acres in size and is near Troy where there are Level 3 evacuations in place.\n\nBrown's declaration clears the way for the Oregon State Fire Marshal to mobilize firefighters and equipment to help local resources battling the fire, according to a release from the governor's office.\n\nState fire marshal personnel responded with a communications unit and a cache trailer loaded with incident support supplies, tools to enhance defensible space around structures and other provisions firefighters need to inhabit a fire camp.\n\nBrown asked individuals to practice caution with any activities that could spark fires.\n\n\"I also want to urge Oregonians to make sure they and their families are safe by being prepared to respond to wildfires,\" Brown said in a statement. \"Preparedness is more important than ever as fire seasons continue to start earlier and last longer.\"\n\nAir tankers help suppress 135-acre Game Hog Creek Fire\n\nUpdated 4 p.m. Saturday, July 17\n\nTwo single-engine air tankers were used to help suppress the Game Hog Creek Fire in the Tillamook State Forest Saturday after two helicopters were grounded due to mechanical issues.\n\nThe air tankers, belonging to the Oregon Department of Forestry's The Dalles Unit, scooped water from Hagg Lake and dropped it onto hot spots in the steep terrain of the Elk Creek drainage, forestry officials said in a release Saturday.\n\nThe Game Hog Creek Fire, estimated at 135 acres, remains entirely in the 364,000-acre state forest, about 2 miles north of Highway 6. Additional hand crews arrived Sunday, increasing fire personnel to about 100, forestry officials said. The cause of the wildfire is under investigation.\n\nTillamook State Forest is still open, but visitors are likely to see smoke in the area. Highway 6 and 26 to the coast remain open and unaffected by the fire.\n\nClosures: Drift Creek and Idiot Creek forest roads, and the Fear and Loaming mountain bike trail, remain closed due to fire activity. Also closed is Rogers Camp trailhead, which is being used as a staging area for firefighters.\n\nEvacuations: No evacuations are associated with the fire.\n\nGround access to Game Hog Creek Fire remains difficult\n\nUpdated 11:40 a.m. Friday, July 16\n\nThe Game Hog Creek Fire’s perimeter has exceeded 130 acres within the Tillamook State Forest, with about 80 personnel on the scene. Much of the burn remains in steep and inaccessible sections of the forest.\n\nA helicopter staged out of a Buxton Fire Station has been supporting ground crews with water drops, with two more helicopters expected to arrive by Saturday.\n\nAfter jumping containment lines on Tuesday, the fire once again passed lines yesterday to burn three more acres of forest.\n\nBy dropping water on the fire’s interior, officials hope to mitigate the risk of embers arching beyond control lines again, should winds pick up.\n\nA news release today noted that that cool Pacific air has descended into the area, which should give firefighters a chance to strengthen existing lines in the difficult terrain.\n\nTillamook State Forest, as well as both Highways 26 and 6, remain open to the public. The only current closures are the Drift Creek and Idiot Creek forest roads as well as the Fear and Loaming mountain bike trail.\n\nNo evacuation orders have been issued.\n\nCrews make containment progress on Jack Fire\n\nUpdated 10:15 a.m. Friday, July 16\n\nThe Jack Fire is now estimated at 16,764 acres, with 25% containment; 745 personnel are on the containment effort.\n\nFirefighters are working to strengthen lines north of Highway 138 before joining suppression efforts on the southern half of the fire.\n\nAided by aerial water and suppressant drops, hand crews and dozers are working to establish containment lines south of the highway.\n\nHighway 138 remains closed from Steamboat to milepost 55, but returning evacuees will be escorted through the closure by ODOT personnel.\n\nCommunities between milepost 43 and 51 on Highway 138E, including Dry Creek, are on Level 2, “Be Set” order.

Early on, the fire doubled in size almost daily and strong winds from the south on Thursday afternoon yet again pushed the flames rapidly to the north and east.\n\nThe fire has the potential to move 4 miles or more in an afternoon and there was concern it could merge with the smaller, yet still explosive Log Fire, said Rob Allen, incident commander for the blaze. That fire started Monday as three smaller fires but exploded to nearly 5,000 acres in 24 hours and was still growing, fanned by the same winds, Allen said.\n\nFirefighters were all pulled back to safe areas late Thursday due to intense fire behavior and were scouting ahead of the main blaze for areas where they could make a stand by carving out fire lines to stop the inferno's advance, he said.\n\nCrews are watching the fire, nearby campgrounds \"and any place out in front of us to make sure the public’s out of the way,” Allen said. He said evacuation orders were still being assessed.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nCurrent evacuation levels can be found at tinyurl.com/bootlegevac.\n\nDarlene Fire grows and conditions remain dangerous\n\nUpdated 4:55 p.m. Thursday, July 15\n\nThe Darlene fire, just southeast of La Pine, grew to 686 acres Thursday with 1% containment.\n\nWednesday night, 165 personnel on the ground worked late into the night to contain the blaze until there was no apparent growth, extinguishing multiple small spot fires that sparked along its perimeter.\n\nToday, crews are working to strengthen containment lines and watch for spot fires that hop the lines.\n\nOfficials have issued a Red Flag warning through 11 p.m. tonight, due to low humidity, and gusts up to 25 mph.\n\nSouth of La Pine, all residences on Darlene way and Old Ice Cave Road up to the Deschutes/Klamath County line are on Level 3 “Go Now” evacuation order.\n\nAll open fires are prohibited in the Deschutes National Forest, the Ochoco National Forest and Crooked River National Grassland.\n\nAn updated evacuation map can be found here.\n\nWeather conditions help crews on Tillamook State Forest fire\n\nUpdated 3:30 p.m. Thursday, July 15\n\nA wildfire burning in the Tillamook State Forest that jumped containment lines earlier this week continues to be been held from growing by fire crews.\n\nThe Game Hog Creek Fire was estimated to cover about 130 acres due to improved mapping Thursday, according to Oregon Department of Forestry officials.\n\nAbout 80 crew members continue to work on the fire, assisted by helicopters making water drops on the steeper areas.\n\nOfficials say temperatures are expected to drop overnight, keeping moisture in the air, before cooler coastal air arrives Friday. Both conditions are expected to reduce fire activity.\n\nEvacuation levels near Jack Fire reduced\n\nUpdated 10:05 a.m. Thursday, July 15\n\nEvacuation levels in the area of the Jack Fire have been de-escalated, but residents of the Dry Creek community are being told to stay prepared to go, should conditions change.\n\nThe fire's perimeter is now being estimated at 13,907 acres with 20% containment, and there are 776 fire personnel on the scene.\n\n\"Fire crews have made significant progress and the threat level to the areas affected by the fire have diminished,\" said Sgt. Brad O'Dell, of the Douglas County Sherriff’s office.\n\nHighway 138E remains closed from Steamboat to milepost 55, but returning evacuees will be escorted through the closure by ODOT personnel.\n\nODOT is working to clear hazard trees along the highway, and officials say the route might reopen as soon as this weekend.\n\nA live evacuation map can be viewed here.\n\nCrews make progress on fire in Tillamook State Forest\n\nUpdated 9:45 a.m. Thursday, July 15\n\nIn the Tillamook State Forest, spread of the Game Hog Creek Fire has largely been stopped at about 70 acres.\n\nThe fire, which first sparked on July 3, was contained at six acres until Tuesday night, when increased winds cause the blaze to jump over the control lines and spread.\n\nSteep terrain makes some portions of the burn inaccessible to ground crews, but support from a helicopter kept the fire in check while more control lines were built yesterday.\n\nIf conditions remain favorable today, crews hope to begin mopping up hot spots in the burn’s interior.\n\nThe fire remains entirely within the state forest, about 22 miles northwest of Forest Grove, and shows no signs of threatening highways 6 or 26, according to fire officials.\n\nBootleg Fire roars to 227,000 acres\n\nUpdated 9:04 a.m. Thursday, July 15\n\nThe Bootleg Fire burning northeast of Klamath Falls grew again on Wednesday, reaching 227,234 acres and eating into the Gearhart Mountain Wilderness and north towards Lake Henry.\n\nHigh winds and extremely dry fuels led to the rise of multiple pyrocumulus clouds over the fire, according to the National Weather Service in Medford, and the extreme weather isn't expected to change any time soon, officials said.\n\n“This fire is going to continue to grow – the extremely dry vegetation and weather are not in our favor,” Joe Hessel, Incident Commander for ODF Team 1 Incident Management Team said. “We are going to continue to prepare lines, protect structures, and move resources as we can around the fire’s edge.”\n\nThe fire is 7% contained. Fire crews are also dealing with the smaller 2,000 acre Log Fire just north of the main fire.\n\n\"Please send positive thoughts and well wishes to the firefighters right now,\" NWS said. \"It's a tough time for them right now.\"\n\nWith continued west winds predicted, firefighters will continue to work to hold the fire to the 34 Road to prevent further eastern and southern spread.\n\n\"Heavy beetle killed timber and active fire behavior will present challenges in keeping the fire north and west of this road,\" officials said Thursday.\n\nEvacuations are changing rapidly in Lake and Klamath Counties. A live evacuation map can be found here.\n\nCrews make progress on Bruler Fire near Detroit\n\nUpdated 10:35 a.m. Wednesday, July 14\n\nFire crews have taken advantage of mild weather and are taking a big swing at stopping the Bruler Fire in its tracks on Wednesday.\n\nThe fire located 8 miles south of Detroit Lake and 7 miles west of Highway 22 in the Quartzville Creek Recreation Corridor is still listed at 90 acres, showing little growth since Tuesday.\n\nA helicopter dropped water on the fire to cool the interior while ground crews attacked the fire directly, digging handline for containment, fire crews said. Lines were further strengthened by two dozers, working to keep the fire within a small footprint.\n\nRead more:Fire crews make progress on 90-acre Bruler Fire south of Detroit Lake\n\nGrandview Fire slows but conditions to worsen today\n\nUpdated 10:16 a.m. Wednesday, July 14\n\nFirefighters have made positive progress in containing the Grandview Fire, as winds Northeast of Sisters slowed overnight and Wednesday morning. But a Red Flag Warning has been issued for today and tomorrow, as humidity is expected to drop and winds from the West are expected to reach 20 mph.\n\nThe current estimation of the fire’s perimeter is 5,971 acres with 10% containment. Firefighters have secured the eastern edge of the fire, but predict challenges there from the increase in wind later today and tomorrow.\n\nA different nearby fire, the Darlene Fire near La Pine, pulled retardant dropping air tankers away from the Grandview Fire, but they were replaced with critical support from three smaller air tankers out of Burns.\n\nThere are still structures at risk, but successful containment lines on the fire’s south-eastern edge and the arrival of more structural task forces from Washington aim to mitigate their risk of ignition proactively while holding off the easterly spread of flames.\n\nFire jumps control lines in Tillamook State Forest\n\nUpdated 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, July 14\n\nA wildfire that originally started in early July has jumped control lines and spread late Tuesday in the Tillamook State Forest.\n\nThe Game Hog Creek Fire is estimated to cover 70 acres and is burning near Highway 6, about 22 miles northwest of Forest Grove, according to Oregon Department of Forestry officials.\n\nThe fire started July 3 in the state forest with crews containing the blaze to 6 acres with full control lines established. Officials say winds kicked up late Tuesday, spreading the fire in steep and inaccessible terrain.\n\nGround crews were able to respond and worked overnight to contain the spreading fire. About 100 personnel are currently on scene.\n\nJack Fire's growth continues slowly along North Umpqua\n\nUpdated at 5:11 p.m. on Tuesday, July 13\n\nFire crews have been able to hold the Jack Fire from major growth the past few days, as the fire reaches 13,795 acres with 15% containment.\n\nHowever, State Highway 138 remains closed from Steamboat to milepost 55.\n\nThe steady growth is “within the planned control lines,” along which firefighters have been doing controlled burns to reduce fuel loads and to slow the fire from spreading, fire crews said in a Tuesday update.\n\nThe fire continues to be most active south of Highway 138, where crews have established anchor points and are holding their lines, issuing prescribed burns as needed to prevent further eastward spread of the flames towards Dry Creek. North of Highway 138, fire crews are holding their control lines firmly, officials said.\n\nNo structures have burned thus far, and task forces have burned fuels around at-risk structures to mitigate their chance of ignition, should the fire approach them.\n\nCurrent evacuation orders are at level 3 (evacuate now) in the entire Dry Creek Community, on the Illahee Road, and in the Apple Creek, Horseshoe Bend and Eagle Rock campgrounds.\n\nEvacuations can still be viewed here.\n\nDarlene Fire brings evacuations to La Pine\n\nUpdated at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, July 13\n\nA new wildfire has popped up and grown to around 500 acres near La Pine in Central Oregon, bringing evacuations to the area on Tuesday.\n\n\"Extreme fire behavior,\" wrote Central Oregon Fire information. \"Large air tankers and SEATs supporting fire suppression.\"\n\nA map and evacuation areas of the fire can be found here.\n\nEarlier updates\n\nGrandview Fire near Sisters grows to 5,723 acres, but progress made\n\nUpdated at 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday, July 13\n\nOfficials reported positive progress on the wildfire burning north of Sisters Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Grandview Fire was estimated to cover 5,723 acres Tuesday with 5% containment.\n\nCrews have established containment lines on the south and east end of the fire, areas closest to populated areas.\n\nOfficials say persistant north and east winds pushed the fire to the southwest into Stevens Canyon on Monday.\n\nThe Red Cross has established a shelter for residents displaced by the fire in the gym at Sisters Middle School, 15200 Highway 242.\n\nBootleg Fire shows major growth again, surpasses 200,000 acres\n\nUpdated at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, July 13\n\nThe Bootleg Fire burning northeast of Klamath Falls showed significant growth again, roaring to 201,923 acres.\n\nThe fire grew mostly toward the southeast, toward the Gearhart Mountain Wilderness and doesn't appear to have moved toward populated areas.\n\nHowever, officials haven't sent out an update since the fire showed the large amount of growth.\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nBruler Fire ignites south of Detroit Lake, estimated at 60 acres\n\nUpdated at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, July 13\n\nA new wildfire ignited Monday afternoon in Willamette National Forest south of Detroit Lake.\n\nThe Bruler Fire is burning in the Quartzville Creek Corridor northeast of Foster Lake, eight miles south of Detroit Lake.

An evacuation map can be found here. Sisters Middle School has been set up as a temporary evacuation point and shelter, according to the Deschutes County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe fire was reported at 1:30 p.m. Sunday burning on the Crooked River National Grassland and rapidly spread through grass and juniper.\n\n\"Numerous resources were mobilized to the fire, including wildland engines, dozers, resources from structural agencies, and contract crews,\" Central Oregon Fire information stated. \"Single-engine air tankers (SEATs) and large air tankers continued to drop retardant on the fire until dark.\"\n\nFirefighters worked through the night on the blaze. The cause of the fire is under investigation.\n\nJack Fire's growth slows down in North Umpqua Canyon\n\nUpdated at 9 a.m. on Monday, July 12\n\nThe Jack Fire's growth slowed over the weekend somewhat, as the blaze burning east of Roseburg near the outpost of Steamboat is now listed at 12,000 acres with 15% containment.\n\nTemperatures moderated into the 80s with limited winds, fire officials said, which likely helped fire crews make progress.\n\nHighway 138 remains closed from Steamboat to milepost 55.\n\nFire crews have gotten in a strong defense line and are mopping up flames on the western and northwestern side of the fire near Steamboat. Crews have also burned out vegetation on the east side of the fire near Dry Creek in an attempt to stop the fire there.\n\nThe most active area of the fire is south of the river and Highway 138, where the flames continue to spread.\n\n\"Firefighters have established locations that are suitable for containment lines while providing for firefighter safety,\" a news release stated. \"Crews working on all sections of the fire face steep terrain and poison oak-related difficulties.\"\n\nNo homes or structures are listed as having been lost so far, but there have been eight injuries on the fire.\n\nEvacuations can still be viewed here.\n\nBootleg Fire's growth moderates, now 150,000 acres\n\nUpdated at 9 a.m. on Monday, July 12\n\nThe Bootleg Fire burning northeast of Klamath Falls slowed down, if only for a day and only because it had been doubling in size for an entire week, on Sunday.\n\nOregon's first megafire of the 2021 fire season is now mapped at 153,535 acres and is moving gradually east, away from the most populated areas but toward popular recreation areas such as Summer Lake, Gearhart Mountain Wilderness and the North Fork Sprague River, a stream protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.\n\nThe fire has destroyed seven homes and 43 structures so far.\n\nThe latest evacuation map can be found here.\n\nBootleg Fire roars to 143,000 acres, homes lost in still-growing inferno\n\nUpdated at 3:15 p.m. July 11\n\nThe Bootleg Fire burning in southern Oregon exploded for the fifth day in a row Saturday afternoon, leading to the rare step of police citing and arresting people attempting to enter or stay in the evacuation zone northeast of Klamath Falls.\n\nThe fire was mapped at 143,607 acres Sunday morning after the fire burned through homes north of Beatty, brought life-threatening risk to firefighters and spewed hazardous smoke across southern Oregon. Pictures from the area showed darkened skies similar to those witnessed during last September's Labor Day Fires.\n\nThe fire is threatening approximately 1,200 structures and is 0% contained. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Forestry officials reported 926 personnel are tackling the wildfire with three hotshot crews, six type two initial attack crews, 10 type two crews, 10 helicopters, six dozers, 83 engines and 25 water tenders.\n\nConditions aren't expected to improve, with the National Weather Service in Medford warning of yet another day of explosive growth given temperatures near 100 and extreme drought.\n\n“The fire behavior we are seeing on the Bootleg Fire is among the most extreme you can find and firefighters are seeing conditions they have never seen before,\" fire incident commander Al Lawson said.\n\n\"Conditions today were so extreme that firefighters needed to disengage and move to predetermined safety zones,\" he added. \"Fire managers evaluated conditions and looked for opportunities to reengage firefighters safely.\"\n\nThe fire grew both to the east and north on Saturday. It moved through the Sycan Estates, crossed the East-West road and burned an additional 8 miles along a high-voltage powerline, forestry officials said. Some structures have been lost, but no fatalities have been reported.\n\nFire conditions became so unsafe that the Klamath County Sheriff’s Office said it took the rare step of \"citing or arresting those who remained in or were trying to re-enter the Level 3 evacuation areas in the Bootleg Fire Area,\" the agency said in a news release.\n\n\"We understand the frustration of the community as the fire continues to grow,\" the Sheriff’s Office said. \"We also need to ensure our firefighters are able to engage safely so that they can return home at the end of this assignment to their families.”\n\nThe current evacuation map can be seen here, and is likely to expand, officials said. A map of all wildfires and smoke in Oregon can be found here.\n\nMeteorologists said they didn't expect smoke from Bootleg to impact the Willamette Valley or northwest Oregon over the weekend, although that could change by early next week. Southern Oregon, however, was already seeing decreased air quality, including unhealthy air at Crater Lake National Park and a lake that appeared shrouded in smoke.\n\nContainment efforts will continue through Sunday and more crews will be added to the night shift because weather conditions are better for fighting fire and building containment lines, officials said. After Saturday's fire growth, crews are looking for new locations for safe and effective containment lines around the fire perimeter.\n\nFirefighters will get little relief from the weather, which is expected to remain in upper 90s to 100s through the middle of next week.\n\nThe fire behavior is so extreme there is fear of the fire creating a pyro-cumulus cloud that can create its own weather and could include lightning strikes and wind in an area suffering from extreme drought.\n\nIn addition to homes in the fire's path, the blaze is also heading toward landmarks such as Summer Lake and the Gearhart Mountain Wilderness.\n\nThe sole good news reported Sunday morning was that on the south and west side of the fire, lighter winds and fuels allowed firefighters, structure protection teams and air support to be successful in minimizing fire growth toward the south toward communities such as of Klamath Forest Estates, Moccasin Hills and Tablelands. Western movement of the fire toward Chiloquin was also minimal.\n\nEvacuations for Bootleg Fire\n\nLevel 3 (Go now): Klamath County, north of the town of Beatty.

In the late afternoon, the service's Los Angeles office tweeted out a warning about \"DANGEROUS LIFE THREATENING FLASH FLOODING'' in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.\n\nThe canyon communities under evacuation orders around Montecito are below hillsides burned bare in recent years by wildfires. There were also evacuations in the city of Santa Barbara.\n\nShowbiz personalities like Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres and former sports stars Troy Aikman and Jimmy Connors were among the celebrities impacted by the 2018 disaster in Montecito, now also home to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\n\nThe death toll from the onslaught of violent storms sweeping California rose to 14 on Monday as two major episodes promised more devastation and up to a foot of rain. The death toll does not include a 5-year-old boy who was swept away by floodwaters and whose fate remains unknown.\n\nThe weather service warned that parts of the Sacramento area, which has been battered by high winds and overwhelming rains, could see 12 inches of rain by Wednesday night.\n\nSanta Cruz County has also taken a big hit: Mudslides closed both southbound lanes of scenic Highway 17 and the Browns Valley Road Bridge collapsed into the small river beneath it.\n\n\"Two of the more energetic and moisture-laden parade of cyclones ... are aiming directly for California,\" the weather service forecast said. \"The cumulative effect of successive heavy rainfall events will lead to ... rapid water rises, mudslides and the potential for major river flooding.\"\n\nThe first episode hit the state early Monday and was expected to dump up to 5 inches of rain on the central California coast, the weather service said. Another, due Tuesday, will primarily target locations farther south into Southern California.\n\n\"Flooding from Northern to Central California is expected to be widespread, even catastrophic in some locations around the coastal mountains and the northern and central Sierra,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Joe Bauer said. He said more than a dozen monitored river locations are forecast to be above flood stage.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, citing \"emergency conditions resulting from successive and severe winter storms, flooding, and mudslides,\" declared a federal emergency late Sunday, ordering federal assistance to supplement state, tribal and local response efforts.\n\nNEWSOME DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY:California Gov. Newsom asks Biden administration to declare federal emergency ahead of brutal storms\n\nOther developments:\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service issued an avalanche warning until Wednesday for the greater Lake Tahoe area. Parts of the eastern Sierra Nevada are also under avalanche warnings.\n\nResidents of Santa Cruz, Santa Clara and Solano counties in the greater San Francisco Bay Area and Monterey in central California are under evacuation orders or warnings.\n\nNearly 140,000 homes and businesses across the state were without power early Monday, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us.\n\nThe Los Angeles area braced for up to 8 inches of rain in foothill areas. High surf was expected through Tuesday. Wind gusts could exceed 60 mph at the coast and 70 mph in the mountains, prompting the weather service to post a wind advisory for portions of southwest California through 10 p.m. Monday.\n\nWHAT IS AN 'ATMOSPHERIC RIVER'? These rivers of water vapor can extend thousands of miles.\n\nVehicles submerged in water, sinkhole swallows 2 cars in Los Angeles\n\nThe major storm will affect southern California through Tuesday and is expected to bring heavy rain, damaging winds, and a slight chance of thunderstorms, the weather service in Los Angeles warned Monday.\n\nWidespread and significant flooding is expected on urban roads and rivers, the weather service said. Storm conditions will also cause hazardous driving conditions and potential power outages.\n\nThere is a potential for as much as 8 inches of rain in the Los Angeles foothill area late Monday and Tuesday. The weather service also issued high surf advisories along the coast.\n\nVehicles were seen submerged in water Monday in some parts of the city. A sinkhole swallowed two vehicles in the Chatsworth area, in northeast Los Angeles, late Monday. Authorities said two people escaped by themselves and firefighters used ropes and an aerial ladder to rescue two others who had minor injuries.\n\n18 people rescued from Ventura River amid flash flood warning\n\nEighteen people were rescued after being trapped on an island in the Ventura River in western Ventura County on Monday afternoon amid heavy rain and flooding.\n\nThe Ventura County Fire Department reported that of the 18 victims, one person required medical attention for minor injuries, seven people were rescued using a ladder, seven others were rescued by the aerial team and four people were able to walk out.\n\nThe county was hit with severe flooding and mudslides due to continuous heavy rain from the latest atmospheric river. A flash flood warning was issued for all of southern Ventura County, which is expected to last through Tuesday as another storm front moves into the area overnight.\n\nFlash flood warning in Santa Cruz and surroundings\n\nThe weather service's Bay Area office issued a flash flood warning through 3:45 p.m. PST for Santa Cruz and surrounding communities, home to more than 260,000 people and 75 schools. The bureau also tweeted a video showing Highway 101 -- a major artery -- \"has turned into a moving river'' and advising motorists not to drive into flood waters.\n\nEvacuation orders were issued in Santa Cruz County for about 32,000 residents living near rapidly rising rivers and creeks, according to Melodye Serino, the deputy county administrative officer.\n\nParts of the community of Felton in the Santa Cruz Mountains were inundated when the San Lorenzo River crested over its banks Monday morning, leaving cars partially submerged.\n\nSchool teacher Nicole Beardsley, who grew up and lives in Felton, told the San Francisco Chronicle she was heading for work when she came to a submerged car on a flooded section of road and turned around.\n\n“I’ve never seen the river this high before,” Beardsley told the newspaper. “I’ve seen it come up to the bridge there and the road wasn’t drivable, but it wasn’t up this high.”\n\nSome residents took a relaxed attitude to the turmoil.\n\nNicole Martin, a third-generation owner of the Fern River Resort in Felton, said her clients sipped coffee, sat on cabin porches amid towering redwood trees and were “enjoying the show” as picnic tables and other debris floated down the river.\n\nSurging waters halt search for boy swept away into river\n\nThe life of a 5-year-old boy who was carried away by floodwaters hung in the balance Monday after rescuers in central California had to call off the search for him around 3 p.m. when conditions on the surging Salinas River became too dangerous to continue.\n\nThe boy’s mother was driving a white truck when it became stranded in floodwaters just before 8 a.m. near Paso Robles, according to Tom Swanson, assistant chief of the Cal Fire/San Luis Obispo County Fire Department.\n\nSwanson said bystanders pulled the mother out of the truck but the boy was carried out of the vehicle by the water and swept downstream.\n\n6 feet of snow forecast in Sierra\n\nThe Sierra Nevada will likely see heavy snow exceeding 6 feet across the higher elevations before the snow tapers off Wednesday morning, forecasters said. The state Department of Transportation warned motorists to stay off mountain roads after closing a stretch of U.S. 395 in Mono County, along the Eastern Sierra, because of heavy snow, ice and whiteout conditions.\n\nMammoth Mountain, an Eastern Sierra ski resort, already has received nearly 10 feet of snow, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nWhy could the latest storm be so damaging?\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had sought the federal emergency designation earlier Sunday, said the death toll from almost two weeks of storms had reached 12. And he warned that the worst impacts of the storms might have been felt yet.\n\n\"California is in the middle of a deadly barrage of winter storms and we are using every resource at our disposal to protect lives and limit damage,\" Newsom said.\n\nAccuWeather experts say the unrelenting \"atmospheric rivers\" have saturated much of the state and bloated rivers and streams, leaving the state susceptible to \"extreme and historic levels\" of storm damage.\n\nA CLOSER LOOK:Graphics show how the coastal state has been drenched\n\nHOW AN ATMOSPHERIC RIVER DEVELOPS:Graphics show atmospheric river soaking California's Bay Area\n\nAtmospheric rivers are ribbons of water vapor in the sky that can extend thousands of miles from the tropics to the western U.S. At 250 to 375 miles wide, they provide the fuel for massive rain and snowstorms that can cause flooding along the West Coast.\n\nOn Sunday alone, one thunderstorm moving into the Sacramento region was producing up to a half-inch of rain per hour.\n\nSacramento County struggles to recover\n\nIn the state capital, tens of thousands of electricity customers remained without power Monday, down from more than 350,000 after gusts of 60 mph knocked trees into power lines, according to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. Sacramento City schools were closed Monday because six campuses had no electricity.\n\nThe weather service posted a flood advisory for much of the Sacramento Valley, northern San Joaquin Valley and surrounding foothills. The Sacramento County Office of Emergency Services ordered residents of Wilton, about 20 miles southeast of downtown Sacramento, to evacuate Sunday night. Wilton is home to about 6,000 people.\n\n\"Flooding is imminent. Out of an abundance of caution, residents must leave now before roads become impassable,\" the office of emergency services said in its evacuation order.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/20/hilary-california-live-updates/70635871007/", "title": "Tropical Storm Hilary updates: Floods and rescue across region", "text": "Editor's note: For the latest news on Hilary and the storm's path please follow our live updates file here\n\nMARINA DEL REY, Calif − Tropical Storm Hilary drenched Southern California from the coast to inland mountains and deserts Sunday evening, prompting rescues from swollen rivers and forcing some of the nation’s largest school districts to cancel Monday classes\n\nHilary brought intensifying rain to the region, with some mountain and desert areas seeing more than half an average year’s worth of rain come down in just one day, including the desert resort city of Palm Springs, which saw nearly 3 inches of rain by Sunday evening. Hilary was toppling trees and causing mudslides in the San Diego area.\n\nHilary was the first tropical storm to cross into California from Mexico since Nora in 1997, the weather service office in San Diego said Sunday night. If Hilary had come in off the ocean in a landfall in California, it would have been the first tropical storm to do so since 1939.\n\nOne person drowned Saturday in the Mexican town of Santa Rosalia when a vehicle was swept away in an overflowing stream, The Associated Press reported. Rescue workers saved four other people, said Edith Aguilar Villavicencio, the mayor of Mulege township.\n\nMud and boulders spilled onto highways, water overwhelmed drainage systems and tree branches fell in neighborhoods from San Diego to Los Angeles. Dozens of cars were trapped in floodwaters in Palm Springs and surrounding desert communities across the Coachella Valley. Crews pumped floodwaters out of the emergency room at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who is traveling to Hawaii on Monday to survey damage from devastating wildfires in Maui, urged \"everyone in the path of this storm to take precautions and listen to the guidance of state and local officials.\"\n\nTropical Storm Hilary tracker:Follow the storm’s path as it heads toward Southern California\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾ Thousands of Southern California residents were without power on Sunday as storm conditions took down power lines. Over 7,000 Imperial Irrigation District customers in the eastern Coachella Valley and Imperial County service area were without power while over 31,000 Southern California Edison customers lost power areas in or near Los Angeles county.\n\n◾ The National Weather Service extended its flash flood warning for the Los Angeles area until 3:00 a.m. local time. The agency warned some parts of the area would experience life-threatening flooding as the fire department conducted water rescues for cars stuck in flooded roads.\n\n◾ The Los Angeles school district, the second largest in the nation, said all its schools will be closed Monday. The San Diego school district, which planned to begin its fall term Monday, said it will delay the start of classes to Tuesday.\n\n◾ The city of Palm Springs declared an emergency, \"due to unprecedented rainfall in flooding of local roadways and at least one swift water rescue.\" The declaration, according to spokesperson Amy Blaisdell, opens up access to extra resources, such as funds for repairs from storm damage and more flexibility with emergency purchases.\n\n◾ In Southern California, at least two debris flows have been reported over roadways in San Bernardino, and rocks have been reported on roads in three locations in Kern, the National Weather Service said. Two semi-trucks were reported flipped along Interstate 8 in Imperial, the weather service added.\n\n◾ Hilary’s rainfall is an extreme, record-breaking event, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “There’s a very clear link between increases in extreme precipitation and global warming,” Swain said. In a warmer world, “the atmosphere’s capacity to hold water vapor increases exponentially.”\n\n◾ California Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency, and authorities issued an evacuation advisory for Santa Catalina Island, 23 miles off the coast.\n\n◾ As the storm rolls north, portions of Oregon and Idaho could see as much as 3 to 5 inches of rain, producing some \"significant\" flash flooding, the National Weather Service said.\n\n'Walls were moving quite a bit'\n\nLouis Brown, a security guard at Ralph’s grocery store in Marina del Rey, California, surveyed the customers at about 8 p.m. Sunday night. “Last night it was chaos, havoc,’’ Brown told USA TODAY. “It was packed until 1 o’clock, and I could see the fear in their eyes and their soul.’’\n\nHe was referring to the customers stocking up on food before the storm arrived. And less than 24 hours later? “Nothing,’’ he said, looking around the store. “No chaos.’’\n\nWith the initial hurricane having weakened to a tropical storm, Brown presumed those panicked shoppers survived Hilary as did he -- without incident.\n\nRain fell for most of the day, but 17-year-old Michael Gatto said he still rode his skateboard to work at Local Pizza a block from Venice Beach.\n\n“I did it on purpose so I could tell people that,’’ he said.\n\nHe said business was slow but picked up toward the end of the day. One of his last customers of the night was Andrea Iucci, who said he was in town from Amsterdam and visiting with his wife and two children. Originally, Iucci said, they planned to vacation in Maui. But the deadly fires in Hawaii prompted them to head to Los Angeles.\n\nOn Sunday, their third day in Los Angeles, they experienced not only the storm but also the earthquake. He said they were on the top floor of a nearby hotel when the earthquake with a 5.1 magnitude hit.\n\n“The walls were moving quite a bit,’’ he said. “But it’s OK. As long as everyone’s safe.\"\n\nSenior community impacted by flooding in Coachella Valley\n\nAbout 60 homes at the Canyon Mobile Home Community in Cathedral City have been impacted by flooding, according to Cathedral City Councilmember Nancy Ross, who also lives in the 55 and older community of 350 homes.\n\n“On the (most impacted streets), there was in several locations at least three feet of rushing water that was like a river and had a current of its own, it’s frightening,” Ross said. “And that rushing water by nature just wanted to follow a straight path up into people’s driveways and into their garages, and so many people flooded.”\n\nRoss says damage to the roughly 60 impacted homes includes water flooded into garages or homes, and water under the mobile homes. Ross and her husband spent the afternoon checking on neighbors and attempting to keep nearby culverts clear of debris.\n\nThe Cathedral City Fire Department also came to the park Sunday afternoon to help evacuate several people out of their homes who couldn’t get past the rushing water in the road.\n\n“It’s a senior citizen mobile home park, many of our people are in their 80s. They just don’t deserve to be in such a vulnerable situation, that’s for sure,” said Ross.\n\n— Erin Rode, Desert Sun\n\nMudslides and debris flow through mountain and desert areas\n\nBy Sunday evening, Hilary had moved over San Diego and was headed north into inland desert areas.\n\nResidents of the Coachella Valley had previously expressed anxiety and fear over the storm as many spent the past few days preparing by filling up sandbags as a precaution. And as Hilary closed in on the area Sunday night, the heavy rain turned roadways into rivers and filled up the local wash.\n\nCities within the desert region are at risk of dangerous flooding due to their location and environment. Surrounded by several mountain ranges, waterways in the area can be overwhelmed by the heavy rain and can cause waters to quickly rise.\n\n“This entire valley is basically a giant river bottom,” Palm Springs resident Carley Pinkney told the New York Times.\n\nIn an area where residents are accustomed to intense heat and the blaring sun during this time of year, Hilary is bringing record rain. Palm Springs set a daily record for rainfall on Sunday, recording more than two inches as of 5 p.m., according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“Usually, when the weatherman says rain, they’re wrong because we get rain like one and a half days a year,” resident Michael Matera told the Times.\n\n“When it rains, it just sits there, like it’s in a bowl,\" he added.\n\nIn the San Bernardino Mountains, AccuWeather storm chaser Aaron Rigsby said a large mudslide moved boulders and trees onto the roadway in Forest Falls. Images and videos of the mud slide showed debris flowing in muddy waters, completely covering roads.\n\nSan Bernardino County declared a local emergency Sunday afternoon and the sheriff's department issued evacuation orders for several communities, including Forest Falls.\n\nSouthern California cities see impacts of Hilary\n\nThe full strength of the tropical storm had yet to reach the city of Diamond Bar in Los Angeles County Sunday evening, but the environment is already seeing some effects.A large tree broke off onto one of the city’s major streets on Sunday afternoon. A police car blocked off the route as it covered one whole side of the street that was near a business center.After spurts of rain were scattered throughout the day, the rain began to pick up in the afternoon, as some streets began to see some flooding.\n\nMeanwhile, in San Diego County, strong winds and moderate rain toppled trees, moved boulders, and flooded roadways. San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria declared a state of emergency on Sunday as the storm's center closed in on the region.\n\nThe weather service in San Diego issued several flash flood and tornado warnings Sunday afternoon for the eastern part of the county. During a live broadcast, the agency said it was watching \"one of the remnant eyewall bands moving through the county,\" bringing the heaviest rain.\n\n\"This is the type of rain that can cause urban flooding, mud debris, even sometimes flash flooding,\" the agency said. \"... Never before has there been a tropical storm level system intact moving through San Diego County.\"\n\nSeveral roadways were closed or blocked off due to rock slides and rising waters. Crews from the California Department of Transportation were working on Interstate 8 near In-Ko-Pah near the U.S.-Mexico border after boulders had moved into the road.\n\nEarthquake shakes Southern California amid Hilary threat\n\nAn earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1 jolted parts of Southern California Sunday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, as residents in the region braced for Tropical Storm Hilary.\n\nThe earthquake was centered about four miles southeast of Ojai, California, about 80 miles northwest of Los Angeles. It struck shortly after 2:40 p.m. local time at a depth of approximately 9 miles, the USGS said.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, several aftershocks with magnitudes up to nearly 4 were recorded in the area, according to the USGS. The U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said no tsunamis were expected.\n\nTo the best understanding of geoscientists, the earthquake is coincidental, and not related to heavy rainfall in the Los Angeles area, Daniel L. Swain, a climate scientist at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles, told USA TODAY on Sunday.\n\nCanceled flights, closed amusement parks, rescheduled MLB games\n\nCanceled and delayed flights, closed amusement parks, and rescheduled baseball games are among the early impacts of Hilary's approach to the U.S.\n\nSouthwest has canceled more than 700 flights scheduled for Sunday and nearly 190 flights set for Monday, according to FlightAware, which tracks flight status in real-time. Other major carriers like United, American, Delta, and JetBlue were impacted as well.\n\n\"As California’s largest carrier, we’ve made proactive adjustments to our flight schedule throughout the weekend and have communicated with affected customers,'' Southwest told USA TODAY in a statement.\n\nAmusement parks like LEGOLAND California and Knotts Berry Farm closed their doors Sunday, as did the San Diego Zoo and SeaWorld in the same city. Disneyland in Anaheim is shutting down early, at 9 p.m. PT.\n\nMajor League Baseball moved up three games scheduled Sunday in Southern California ballparks. Each of the games – Arizona at San Diego, Tampa Bay at the Los Angeles Angels, and Miami at the Los Angeles Dodgers — were turned into split doubleheaders Saturday to avoid issues with the storm.\n\n'Glassy' waves draw surfers to Venice Beach\n\nMore than a dozen surfers and one pelican braved the extraordinary weather conditions at Los Angeles’ famed Venice Beach with distinctly differently goals Sunday afternoon.\n\nFor the surfers, this was the perfect storm to ride out the waves, and they were not going to be deterred by a sign saying swimming was prohibited. After all, they were technically not breaking any rules.\n\nDamien Rho, an 18-year-old lifeguard from Santa Monica, arrived with his surfboard and a good bit of knowledge about the last time a storm like Hilary hit these shores.\n\n“It’s not every day you get a hurricane out here. You gotta get out here. When is the last time, 1939?” Rho said, getting the year exactly right even if Hilary has actually been downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nRho said the increasingly large waves were “glassy,’’ a surfer term for smooth water.\n\nTwo other surfers said these were the best conditions they’d seen at Venice in weeks, brushing off safety concerns by saying it was more dangerous to drive the highway to the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThe pelican seemed unimpressed and eventually flew away. Apparently, the fishing wasn’t nearly as good as the surfing.\n\nDisaster relief funding running low, FEMA head warns\n\nAhead of Tropical Storm Hilary and other weather disasters, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, warned that her agency is running low on cash to respond to the deadly events in the future.\n\n“We do still anticipate that we will have a shortage of funding at our current spending levels by mid-September,” Criswell said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” If needed, Criswell said, FEMA will push back recovery projects into the next fiscal year to ensure there is enough funding for any “immediate lifesaving needs.”\n\nFEMA’s disaster relief funding shortfall is against the backdrop of numerous weather disasters that have resulted in hundreds of lives lost and billions of dollars in damage, including deadly wildfires in the Hawaiian island of Maui that have claimed over 100 lives alone.\n\nHomeless vulnerable as Hilary advances\n\nVolunteers have been driving the streets of Los Angeles passing out tarps and plastic bags to people without homes so they can try and keep themselves and their belongings dry. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department warned those without a place to stay to move away from riverbeds and other likely flooding locations.\n\nIn Venice Beach, west of downtown Los Angeles, Bobby Geivet arrived at about 6:30 a.m. with a cooler, weathered guitar, a tarp and a plan. Geivet, 45, said he’s homeless but not defenseless against the storm. He tied his tarp between two palm trees and anchored it by using a stone to pound makeshift stakes into the ground. He said he planned to set up a hammock underneath the tarp.\n\n“I like to be high and dry,\" he said. “It’s going to be wet, but I want to be as dry as I can.\"\n\nJoshua Tree National Park closed because of flooding concerns\n\nCoachella Valley could see year's worth of rain over a few days\n\nTropical Storm Emily takes shape but may not last long\n\nWhat began as a large area of low pressure off the Cabo Verde Islands has become well-defined enough to earn a name and designation.\n\nTropical Storm Emily, with maximum sustained winds of almost 50 mph, was heading west-northwest in the Atlantic Ocean at nearly 10 mph Sunday. However, Emily is expected to weaken and lose its status as a tropical storm in the coming days.\n\nContributing: Eve Chen, Ken Tran, Claire Thornton, and Dinah Pulver, USA TODAY; Kate Franco, Palm Springs Desert Sun; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}]}

But that ...", "text": "Jackson County, Oregon CNN —\n\nFirst came Chrissi DelaCruz’s tough breakup with her boyfriend of nine years.\n\nThen, her sister died.\n\nThe pain and loss led DelaCruz to traditional talk therapy. She also relied on alcohol.\n\nBut nothing really worked.\n\n“I was feeling pretty sad and lonely and disconnected and was feeling pretty lost and hopeless in what I needed to do next in my life,” the 37-year-old told CNN.\n\nHer next option would be a remedy the commercial real estate professional never imagined she’d end up advocating – and one that, while considered a therapeutic and healing drug by a growing number of health care professionals, has come under fire in Oregon ahead of next week’s election.\n\nPsilocybin, also known as “magic mushrooms,” is a psychedelic used for centuries in ceremonies by traditional cultures, and interest in it by the modern medical and scientific community has grown since the ’50s.\n\nChrissi DelaCruz, a commercial real estate professional from California, went on a psilocybin retreat. CNN\n\nDelaCruz signed up to try psilocybin to treat her mental health challenges in Jamaica – where using psychedelics is legal – on a retreat run by a company founded by an attorney in Oregon, where voters more than two years ago legalized its use on a protracted timeline, with licensing procedures set to launch in January.\n\nAs that date approaches, though, ballot measures Tuesday in roughly a third of the state’s counties and cities propose banning the psychedelic over concerns of a fraught rollout and problems it could stoke, from the substance’s effect on users to possible community consequences.\n\nOpposing the bans and trying to educate voters about psilocybin are Oregonians – including the operator of the Jamaica center, Silo Wellness – who want to set up facilities in the state where it could be used under the strict guidelines already in place.\n\nBefore her Jamaica retreat, DelaCruz also wasn’t sure about psilocybin, even as Silo Wellness pledged an experience with psychedelics that would help find “peace and purpose.”\n\n“I was totally nervous,” she admitted. “I didn’t know what to expect.”\n\nHow brain systems ‘move and groove together’\n\nScientists are still exploring the how and the why behind the connection between psychedelics and improved mental health. What is known is that just like common antidepressants called SSRIs, psilocybin attaches to receptors in the brain that trigger the release of serotonin, the “feel good” hormone.\n\nBut unlike antidepressants, which take at least a week to work and have to be taken daily, a psilocybin “trip” may improve mood in just one or two sessions. A single treatment with psilocybin reduced negative mood in people with treatment-resistant depression within three weeks, new research found.\n\n“One of the most interesting things we’ve learned about the classic psychedelics is that they have a dramatic effect on the way brain systems synchronize, or move and groove together,” Matthew Johnson, a professor in psychedelics and consciousness at Johns Hopkins Medicine, told CNN earlier this year.\n\nA common theory is the drugs somehow break down the brain’s typical boundaries, so parts of the brain that don’t normally connect to each other suddenly do. At the same time, areas of the brain locked into a cycle of depressive thoughts quiet. This may create a type of expanded consciousness, experts say, that appears to allow the depressed person to break free of self-criticism and see new possibilities.\n\nPsilocybin can be taken in a pill form, smoked, ground and mixed with other foods, put into a smoothie or liquid, or even infused into chocolates and other sweets. A typical dose is a 25-milligram pill, which creates the full-blown psychedelic experience.\n\nDuring most psilocybin studies, trained counselors are present to establish a supportive setting, set expectations and stop the trip from turning “bad,” which might feel like losing oneself or going crazy. They also help the person undergoing the experience organize and retain their new outlook on life via talk therapy.\n\nDelaCruz and about a dozen others who met medical qualifications for the Silo Wellness retreat convened online regularly beginning two months before arriving in Jamaica in June to begin the five-day experience.\n\nIt included two psilocybin dosing sessions, dubbed “ceremonies.”\n\nDelaCruz had it “in a powder form that was mixed with, like, a juice,” she said.\n\nAfter 15 or 20 minutes, it took effect.\n\n“It’s almost like I could see the life in everything around me,” she recalled. “It sounds weird, but it’s like (I could) feel what it really is like to feel alive.”\n\nOne of the sessions was “very hard” and “very emotional,” she said. But despite the increased anxiety and discomfort, it also was very effective.\n\n“The biggest change was, I have more trust and confidence in myself through these ceremonies, therefore that allows me to reflect that back in my actions and in my thoughts and how I affect other people,” DelaCruz said.\n\n“That proved to me that everything that I need to heal is within myself.”\n\n‘There’s no magic here’\n\nThe process, according to Silo Wellness CEO Mike Arnold, isn’t fun.\n\n“(It) can be very, very uncomfortable most of the time, and you have to put in the work, too. So, after you’re done with it, even if you have a great session and you feel like you’re connected to nature and everything’s beautiful and easy … still, you gotta put in the work afterward.\n\n“Like, there’s no magic here.”\n\nArnold founded Silo Wellness in 2018 after having what he described as a life-changing experience with psilocybin, then started the retreats in Jamaica.\n\nHow psilocybin may rewire the brain\n\nIn addition to a strict intake process that screens for underlying medical issues that might be worsened by psilocybin – such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder – medical professionals on-site throughout the retreat keep close watch over participants before, during and after the ceremonies, he said.\n\n“I think drugs are not the answer to anything,” Arnold said, but “certain molecules can be a tool to finding the answers if used appropriately and responsibly and safely.”\n\nPlanning for centers to take root in Oregon\n\nIn 2020, Oregon became the first US state to legalize psilocybin for personal use for those over age 21. More than 1.2 million residents, or 55.7% of voters, voted in favor of legalizing it, with most of those opposed living in the rural eastern and southern parts of the state.\n\nYet unlike cannabis, which in Oregon and other states can be used at home, psilocybin must be administered at licensed “service centers” under the direction of trained “facilitators,” who must meet criteria including age and residency and pass regulations exams and background checks but need not have a medical background. Not required to be on hand in Oregon are counselors or therapists who support talk therapy and could help avert a “bad” trip.\n\nThough the vote was two years ago, the application process to become a service center or facilitator is slated to start in January, and participants would have to complete a “preparation session” before receiving any psilocybin and have a designated driver after treatment. The rules also require any center to have a safety and security plan in place for each client and allow for, but do not require, a “client support person” to be present during the session.\n\nEven under the tight rules, Arnold wants to bring Silo Wellness’s Jamaica retreat model to Oregon and has identified New Frontier Ranch in rural southern Jackson County as an ideal setting. He’d grow the mushrooms on-site in a small, indoor, lab-like space – separate from living quarters – where a bathtub-sized container could supply his retreats for an entire year.\n\nFarmer Jason Lampman wants to open a psilocybin \"service center.\" CNN\n\nFarther north, in McMinnville, Oregon, farmer Jason Lampman is eyeing the potential on a much smaller scale. He’s hoping to make his 1-acre orchard a psilocybin “service center” and treat people on-site, growing the mushrooms in a retrofitted shipping container and hosting clients for a few hours each in a yurt.\n\n“There are laws and rules that are written out,” Lampman said. “This is safe, (and) it is extremely expensive to get into this and there are very strict rules.”\n\nLampman estimates he’ll spend nearly $50,000 to get licensed and trained, in addition to building infrastructure to comply. He hopes he’ll be able to recoup the investment swiftly and add to profits from his other small crops, like hemp, hazelnuts and apples.\n\nAsked if he worries about giving doses of psilocybin on the same property where his wife and their three toddlers live, Lampman pointed directly across the street to his neighbor’s lush vineyard.\n\n“There’s a winery right there,” he said. “People can drink as much alcohol as they want and drive down this road. I think that’s a way more concerning conversation that I’m gonna have.”\n\nFor some, this brings back bad memories\n\nWhile Oregon legalized psilocybin use more than two years ago, roughly a third of the state’s counties and cities are now proposing ballot measures Tuesday to ban the psychedelic in their communities.\n\n“We just want to say no; we want to opt out for a while,” said Stayton Mayor Henry Porter. “The health, safety and welfare of the community, that’s my main responsibility.”\n\nAfter seven terms as mayor and more than three decades as a high school civics teacher, Porter’s worry is rooted in the lingering unknowns surrounding psilocybin, he said, adding he fears the January start date for state applications is too soon.\n\n“I don’t know what it does. I don’t know how it would be controlled. I don’t know how to keep kids away from it,” he said. “I guess it’s the fear of things we don’t understand.”\n\nA neighbor of New Frontier Ranch, where Arnold hopes to set up his retreat, echoes a similar concern.\n\n“I don’t really know a lot about it. … That’s part of the problem,” said Mary Anne Crandall, who supports a local ban on psilocybin following the rocky 2015 cannabis rollout. She and others in Jackson County recalled promises by lawmakers and cannabis advocates that legalization of that drug would eradicate cartel influence and stop illegal grows.\n\nInstead, Crandall said, “it’s made it worse,” adding they’ve seen an influx of human trafficking and a depletion of water resources.\n\nStill reeling, “we feel like we don’t have a voice in what’s going on” now with psilocybin, Crandall said.\n\nOregon officials did not respond to CNN’s specific questions about human trafficking and water use in the marijuana industry but recently started requiring those working on grow farms to report suspected human and sex trafficking.\n\nMeantime, Angela Allbee, who helps manage the Oregon Psilocybin Services Section of the state’s public health division, acknowledged “many lessons learned” from the state’s cannabis rollout and touted the robust rulemaking and feedback processes implemented this time around for psilocybin.\n\nA rush to educate voters\n\nIn the lead-up to Tuesday’s election, Mike Arnold and other psilocybin advocates are urgently educating voters on the industry as he envisions it.\n\n“These folks are scared and they’re concerned and rightfully so because they had experiences with another ballot measure that promised good things that didn’t necessarily deliver,” he said.\n\nArnold is confident the rollout for psilocybin will not be a repeat of cannabis in Oregon – in part, he argued, because of where the profit is made.\n\n“It comes down to the economic basis of the two industries: Cannabis is a product, a commodity,” he said. “And psilocybin is a service industry.”\n\nIt’s a service Chrissi DelaCruz views not only as mind-altering but also life-changing.\n\n“There were a lot of different reasons (I went on the Jamaica retreat), and it was not to just go and trip out and have a good time,” DelaCruz said. “I was battling internally.”\n\n“It was a big release for me, and there definitely was a lot of processing and healing that I was able to do during the ceremony and then especially afterward, too,” she said.\n\nSince the retreat, DelaCruz has reconciled with her longtime partner and no longer finds herself incessantly seeking external validation. She’s also reduced her reliance on alcohol.\n\n“And that’s just because I feel better without it now,” she said.", "authors": ["David Culver Jason Kravarik", "David Culver", "Jason Kravarik"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/tech/tiktok-teens-study-trnd/index.html", "title": "TikTok may push potentially harmful content to teens within minutes ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTikTok may surface potentially harmful content related to suicide and eating disorders to teenagers within minutes of them creating an account, a new study suggests, likely adding to growing scrutiny of the app’s impact on its youngest users.\n\nIn a report published Wednesday, the non-profit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that it can take less than three minutes after signing up for a TikTok account to see content related to suicide and about five more minutes to find a community promoting eating disorder content.\n\nThe researchers said they set up eight new accounts in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia at TikTok’s minimum user age of 13. These accounts briefly paused on and liked content about body image and mental health. The CCDH said the app recommended videos about body image and mental health about every 39 seconds within a 30-minute period.\n\nThe report comes as state and federal lawmakers seek ways to crack down on TikTok over privacy and security concerns, as well as determining whether the app is appropriate for teens. It also comes more than a year after executives from social media platforms, TikTok included, faced tough questions from lawmakers during a series of congressional hearings over how their platforms can direct younger users – particularly teenage girls – to harmful content, damaging their mental health and body image.\n\nAfter those hearings, which followed disclosures from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen about Instagram’s impact on teens, the companies vowed to change. But the latest findings from the CCDH suggest more work may still need to be done.\n\n“The results are every parent’s nightmare: young people’s feeds are bombarded with harmful, harrowing content that can have a significant cumulative impact on their understanding of the world around them, and their physical and mental health,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the CCDH, said in the report.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson pushed back on the study, saying it is an inaccurate depiction of the viewing experience on the platform for varying reasons, including the small sample size, the limited 30-minute window for testing, and the way the accounts scrolled past a series of unrelated topics to look for other content.\n\n“This activity and resulting experience does not reflect genuine behavior or viewing experiences of real people,” the TikTok spokesperson told CNN. “We regularly consult with health experts, remove violations of our policies, and provide access to supportive resources for anyone in need. We’re mindful that triggering content is unique to each individual and remain focused on fostering a safe and comfortable space for everyone, including people who choose to share their recovery journeys or educate others on these important topics.”\n\nThe spokesperson said the CCDH does not distinguish between positive and negative videos on given topics, adding that people often share empowering stories about eating disorder recovery.\n\nTikTok said it continues to roll out new safeguards for its users, including ways to filter out mature or “potentially problematic” videos. In July, it added a “maturity score” to videos detected as potentially containing mature or complex themes as well as a feature to help people decide how much time they want to spend on TikTok videos, set regular screen time breaks, and provide a dashboard that details the number of times they opened the app. TikTok also offers a handful of parental controls.\n\nThis isn’t the first time social media algorithms have been tested. In October 2021, US Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s staff registered an Instagram account as a 13-year-old girl and proceeded to follow some dieting and pro-eating disorder accounts (the latter of which are supposed to be banned by Instagram). Instagram’s algorithm soon began almost exclusively recommending the young teenage account should follow more and more extreme dieting accounts, the senator told CNN at the time.\n\n(After CNN sent a sample from this list of five accounts to Instagram for comment, the company removed them, saying they all broke Instagram’s policies against encouraging eating disorders.)\n\nTikTok said it does not allow content depicting, promoting, normalizing, or glorifying activities that could lead to suicide or self-harm. Of the videos removed for violating its policies on suicide and self-harm content from April to June of this year, 93.4% were removed at zero views, 91.5% were removed within 24 hours of being posted and 97.1% were removed before any reports, according to the company.\n\nThe spokesperson told CNN when someone searches for banned words or phrases such as #selfharm, they will not see any results and will instead be redirected to local support resources.\n\nStill, the CCDH says more needs to be done to restrict specific content on TikTok and bolster protections for young users.\n\n“This report underscores the urgent need for reform of online spaces,” said the CCDH’s Ahmed. “Without oversight, TikTok’s opaque platform will continue to profit by serving its users – children as young as 13, remember – increasingly intense and distressing content without checks, resources or support.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/tech/social-media-lawsuits-teen-suicide/index.html", "title": "Their teenage children died by suicide. Now these families want to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChristopher James Dawley, known as CJ to his friends and family, was 14 years old when he signed up for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Like many teenagers, he documented his life on those platforms.\n\nCJ worked as a busboy at Texas Roadhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He loved playing golf, watching “Doctor Who” and was highly sought after by top-tier colleges. “His counselor said he could get a free ride anywhere he wanted to go,” his mother Donna Dawley told CNN Business during a recent interview at the family’s home.\n\nBut throughout high school, he developed what his parents felt was an addiction to social media. By his senior year, “he couldn’t stop looking at his phone,” she said. He often stayed up until 3 a.m. on Instagram messaging with others, sometimes swapping nude photos, his mother said. He became sleep deprived and obsessed with his body image.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, while his family was taking down their Christmas tree and decorations, CJ retreated into his room. He sent a text message to his best friend – “God’s speed” – and posted an update on his Facebook page: “Who turned out the light?” CJ held a 22-caliber rifle in one hand, his smartphone in the other and fatally shot himself. He was 17. Police found a suicide note written on the envelope of a college acceptance letter. His parents said he never showed outward signs of depression or suicidal ideation.\n\n“When we found him, his phone was still on, still in his hand, with blood on it,” Donna Dawley said. “He was so addicted to it that even his last moments of his life were about posting on social media.”\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, the mother of CJ. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nNow, the Dawleys are joining a growing number of families who have filed recent wrongful death lawsuits against some of the big social media companies, claiming their platforms played a significant role in their teenagers’ decisions to end their lives. The Dawleys’ lawsuit, which was filed last week, targets Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The suit accuses the two companies of designing their platforms to addict users with algorithms that lead to “never-ending” scrolling as part of an effort to maximize time spent on the platform for advertising purposes and profit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the platforms effectively exploit minor users’ decision-making and impulse control capabilities due to “incomplete brain development.”\n\nDonna Dawley said she and her husband, Chris, believe CJ’s mental health suffered as a direct result of the addictive nature of the platforms. They said they were motivated to file the lawsuit against Meta and Snap after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked hundreds of internal documents, including some that showed the company was aware of the ways Instagram can damage mental health and body image.\n\nIn public remarks, including her testimony before Congress last fall, Haugen also raised concerns about how Facebook’s algorithms could drive younger users toward harmful content, such as posts about eating disorders or self-harm, and lead to social media addiction. (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a 1,300-word post on Facebook at the time claiming Haugen took the company’s research on its impact on children out of context and painted a “false picture of the company.”)\n\n“For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,” said Donna Dawley, adding she felt compelled to “hold the companies accountable” after she heard how Instagram is designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. “How dare you put a product out there knowing that it was going to be addictive?Who would ever do that?”\n\nCJ Dawley died by suicide at the age of 17. His parents allege his social media addiction contributed to his death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nHaugen’s disclosures and Congressional testimony renewed scrutiny of tech platforms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. A bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate in February that proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harm. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nSome families are now also taking matters into their own hands and turning to the courts to pressure the tech companies to change how their platforms work. Matthew Bergman, the Dawleys’ lawyer, formed the Social Media Victims Law Center last fall after the release of the Facebook documents. He now represents 20 families who have filed wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies.\n\n“Money is not what is driving Donna and Chris Dawley to file this case and re-live their unimaginable loss they sustained,” Bergman said. “The only way to force [social media companies] to change their dangerous but highly profitable algorithms is to change their economic calculus by making them pay the true costs that their dangerous products have inflicted on families such as the Dawleys.”\n\nHe added: “When faced with similar instances of outrageous misconduct by product manufacturers, juries have awarded tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages and imposed billion-dollar punitive damage awards. I have every reason to anticipate a jury, after fairly evaluating all the evidence, could render a similar judgment in this case.”\n\nCJ's parents, Chris and Donna, are now suing Meta and Snap over CJ's death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Snap spokesperson Katie Derkits said it can’t comment on active litigation but “our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one to suicide.”\n\n“We intentionally built Snapchat differently than traditional social media platforms to be a place for people to connect with their real friends and offer in-app mental health resources, including on suicide prevention for Snapchatters in need,” Derkits said. “Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our community and we are constantly exploring additional ways we can support Snapchatters.”\n\nMeta also declined to comment on the case because it is in litigation but said the company currently offers a series of suicide prevention tools, such as automatically providing resources to a user if a friend or AI detects a post is about suicide.\n\nTech companies under pressure to make changes\n\nAlthough alarms have been raised about social media addiction for years, Haugen’s testimony – coupled with concerns around kids’ increased time spent online during the pandemic – has made the issue a national talking point. But change hasn’t come fast enough for some families.\n\nJennifer Mitchell, who said her 16-year-old son Ian died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat, is also working with the Social Media Victims Law Center to file a lawsuit against Snap. She said she hopes it will make more parents aware of the dangers of social media and encourage lawmakers to regulate the platforms.\n\n“If we can put age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes and to purchase a gun, something needs to be something done when it comes to social media,” she told CNN Business. Snapchat’s age requirement for signing up is 13. “It’s too addictive for kids.”\n\nIn August 2019, Mitchell had just landed in Alaska on a business trip from Florida when she received a series of voice messages saying her son died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She said police later told her they believed Ian was recording a video at the time of the incident.\n\n“After trying to get into some of his social media accounts, we found video of him [taken] on Snapchat that looked like he was playing Russian roulette with the gun,” Mitchell said. “We don’t know who he was sending it to or if he was playing with someone. The phone was found not too far from his body.”\n\nSnap declined to comment on the incident.\n\nIan's mother said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat. Courtesy Jennifer Mitchell\n\nThe emergence of wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies isn’t limited to teenagers. In January, Tammy Rodriguez filed a lawsuit, alleging her 11-year-old daughter Selena struggled with social media addiction for two years before taking her own life in July 2021. (Instagram and Snapchat, the two sites her daughter is said to have used most, require users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with many social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Selena Rodriguez had spent more time on those social networks during the pandemic and started communicating with older men on the platforms. She responded to requests to send sexually explicit images, “which were subsequently shared or leaked to her classmates, increasing the ridicule and embarrassment she experienced at school,” the suit alleged.\n\n“Throughout the period of Selena’s use of social media, Tammy Rodriguez was unaware of the clinically addictive and mentally harmful effects of Instagram and Snapchat,” the lawsuit said. It also cited the lack of sufficient parental controls at the time as a contributing factor, an issue that has been a focus of some recent criticism among lawmakers.\n\nBoth Snap and Meta declined to comment on the case but referenced their resources to help its users struggling with their mental health.\n\n“If a person walks into a bad neighborhood and is assaulted, that’s a regrettable incident,” said Bergman, who is also representing the Rodriguez family. “But if a tour guide says, ‘Let me show you around the city or I’ll show you the top sites,’ and one of those [spots] is a very dangerous neighborhood where a person is assaulted, the tour guide appropriately has some responsibility for putting the tourist in harm’s way. That’s exactly what these platforms do.”\n\n“It’s not random that teenage girls are directed toward content that makes them feel bad about their bodies. That is the way the algorithms work; it’s by design,” he added.\n\nA long and uncertain legal road\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, believes these wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies could hold up in court despite inevitable challenges.\n\n“The problem, at least in the traditional notion in the law, has been that it’s difficult to prove addiction that then leads to taking somebody’s life or doing serious damage to somebody that’s self-inflicted,” he said. “But judges and juries in certain situations might be more open to finding liability and awarding damages.”\n\nHe said Haugen’s “damning” testimony before Congress and the “seemingly troubling” data companies collect about young users, as revealed in the documents, could potentially support a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, depending on each case.\n\nIf you suspect someone may be suicidal: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any ﬁrearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3. Call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). 4. Take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.

However, Tobias said because families are now targeting how the platforms are designed, it “might persuade a court to distinguish the new allegations from other actions by defendants that judges found immune.”\n\nIn the months following the leaked internal documents, Instagram has rolled out a handful of safeguards aimed at protecting its young users, including a tool called Take a Break, which aims to encourage people to spend some time away from the platform after they’ve been scrolling for a certain period. It also introduced a tool that allows parents to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits, and brought back a version of its news feed that sorts posts in reverse chronological order rather than ranked according to the platform’s algorithms.\n\nLast month, dozens of attorneys general wrote a letter to TikTok and Snap calling on the companies to strengthen the platforms’ existing parental tools and better work alongside third-party monitoring apps, which can alert parents if children use language that suggests a desire for self-harm or suicide.\n\n“Your platforms do not effectively collaborate with parental control applications or otherwise provide an adequate opportunity for parental control within the platform,” the letter said. “We ask that you conform to widespread industry practice by giving parents increased ability to protect their vulnerable children.”\n\nSnap told CNN Business in a response it is currently working on new tools for parents that give more insight into what their teens are doing on Snapchat and who they’re talking to. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has expanded its safety features over the years. In 2019, TikTok introduced a limited app experience called TikTok for Younger Users which restricts messaging, commenting and sharing videos for users under age 13. In 2020, it rolled out the ability to disable direct messaging for users under the age of 16.\n\nBergman said he anticipates a “long fight” ahead as he plans to “file a lot of cases” against social media companies. “The only thing that’s certain is the level of opposition that we’re going to face from companies that have all the money in the world to hire all the lawyers,” he said. “They want to do everything they can to avoid standing up in a courtroom and explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the life of CJ Dawley.”\n\nDonna Dawley said the last time she saw her son, on the day of his death, he was looking down at his phone, appearing sad. “I just wish I would have grabbed him and hugged him,” she said.\n\n“[This lawsuit] is not about winning or losing. We’re all losing right now. But if we can get them to change the algorithm for one child – if one child is saved – then it’s been worth it.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/13/tech/social-media-guide-for-parents-ctrp/index.html", "title": "A guide to parental controls on social media | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA little over a year ago, social media companies were put on notice for how they protect, or fail to protect, their youngest users.\n\nIn a series of congressional hearings, executives from Facebook (FB), TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram faced tough questions from lawmakers over how their platforms can lead younger users to harmful content, damage mental health and body image (particularly among teenage girls), and lacked sufficient parental controls and safeguards to protect teens.\n\nThose hearings, which followed disclosures in what became known as the “Facebook Papers” from whistleblower Frances Haugen about Instagram’s impact on teens, prompted the companies to vow to change. The four social networks have since introduced more tools and parental control options aimed at better protecting younger users. Some have also made changes to their algorithms, such as defaulting teens into seeing less sensitive content and increasing their moderation efforts. But some lawmakers, social media experts and psychologists say the new solutions are still limited, and more needs to be done.\n\n“More than a year after the Facebook Papers dramatically revealed Big Tech’s abuse, social media companies have made only small, slow steps to clean up their act,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate’s consumer protection subcommittee, told CNN Business. “Trust in Big Tech is long gone and we need real rules to ensure kids’ safety online.”\n\nMichela Menting, a digital security director at market research firm ABI Research, agreed that social media platforms are “offering very little of substance to counter the ills their platforms incur.” Their solutions, she said, put the onus on guardians to activate various parental controls,such as those intended to filter, block and restrict access, and more passive options, such as monitoring and surveillance tools that run in the background.\n\nAlexandra Hamlet, a New York City-based clinical psychologist, recalls being invited to a roundtable discussion roughly 18 months ago to discuss ways to improve Instagram, in particular, for younger users. “I don’t see many of our ideas being implemented,” she said. Social media platforms, she added, need to work on “continuing to improve parental controls, protect young people against targeted advertising, and remove objectively harmful content.”\n\nThe social media companies featured in this piece either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment on criticism that more needs to be done to protect young users.\n\nFor now, guardians must learn how to use the parental controls while also being mindful that teens can often circumvent those tools. Here’s a closer look at what parents can do to help keep their kids safe online.\n\nInstagram\n\nAfter the fallout from the leaked documents, Meta-owned Instagram paused its much-criticized plan to release a version of Instagram for kids under age 13 and focused on making its main service safer for young users.\n\nIt has since introduced an educational hub for parents with resources, tips and articles from experts on user safety, and rolled out a tool that allows guardians to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits. Parents can also receive updates on what accounts their teens follow and the accounts that follow them, and view and be notified if their child makes an update to their privacy and account settings. Parents can see which accounts their teens have blocked, as well. The company also provides video tutorials on how to use the new supervision tools.\n\nAnother feature encourages users to take a break from the app, such as suggesting they take a deep breath, write something down, check a to-do list or listen to a song, after a predetermined amount of time. Instagram also said it’s taking a “stricter approach” to the content it recommends to teens and will actively nudge them toward different topics, such as architecture and travel destinations, if they’ve been dwelling on any type of content for too long.\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook’s Safety Center provides supervision tools and resources, such as articles and advice from leading experts. “Our vision for Family Center is to eventually allow parents and guardians to help their teens manage experiences across Meta technologies, all from one place,” Liza Crenshaw, a Meta spokesperson, told CNN Business.\n\nThe hub also offers a guide to Meta’s VR parental supervision tools from ConnectSafely, a nonprofit aimed at helping kids stay safe online, to assist parents with discussing virtual reality with their teens. Guardians can see which accounts their teens have blocked and access supervision tools, as well as approve their teen’s download or purchase of an app that is blocked by default based on its rating, or block specific apps that may be inappropriate for their teen.\n\nSnapchat\n\nIn August, Snapchat introduced a parent guide and hub aimed at giving guardians more insight into how their teens use the app, including who they’ve been talking to within the last week (without divulging the content of those conversations). To use the feature, parents must create their own Snapchat account, and teens have to opt-in and give permission.\n\nWhile this was Snapchat’s first formal foray into parental controls, it did previously have a few existing safety measures for young users, such as requiring teens to be mutual friends before they can start communicating with each other and prohibiting them from having public profiles. Teen users have their Snap Map location-sharing tool off by default but can also use it to disclose their real-time location with a friend or family member even while their app is closed as a safety measure. Meanwhile, a Friend Check Up tool encourages Snapchat users to review their friend lists and make sure they still want to be in touch with certain people.\n\nSnap gives parents the ability to see which new friends their teens have added and allows them to confidentially report concerning accounts that may be interacting with their child. It is also working on a tool to give younger users the option to notify their parents when they report an account or piece of content.\n\nThe company told CNN Business it will continue to build on its safety features and consider feedback from the community, policymakers, safety and mental health advocates, and other experts to improve the tools over time.\n\nTikTok\n\nIn July, TikTok announced new ways to filter out mature or “potentially problematic” videos. The new safeguards allocated a “maturity score” to videos detected as potentially containing mature or complex themes. It also rolled out a tool that aims to help people decide how much time they want to spend on TikToks. The tool lets users set regular screen time breaks, and provides a dashboard that details the number of times they opened the app, a breakdown of daytime and nighttime usage and more.\n\nThe popular short form video app currently offers a Family Pairing hub, which allows parents and teens to customize their safety settings. A parent can also link their TikTok account to their teen’s app and set parental controls, including how long they can spend on the app each day; restrict exposure to certain content; decide if teens can search for videos, hashtags, or Live content; and whether their account is private or public. TikTok also offers its Guardian’s Guide that highlights how parents can best protect their kids on the platform.\n\nIn addition to parental controls, the app restricts access to some features to younger users, such as Live and direct messaging. A pop-up also surfaces when teens under the age of 16 are ready to publish their first video, asking them to choose who can watch the video. Push notifications are curbed after 9 p.m. for account users ages 13 to 15, and 10 p.m. for users ages 16 to 17.\n\nThe company said it will be doing more around boosting awareness of its parental control features in the coming days and months.\n\nDiscord\n\nDiscord did not appear before the Senate last year but the popular messaging platform has faced criticism over difficulty reporting problematic content and the ability of strangers to get in touch with young users.\n\nIn response, the company recently refreshed its Safety Center, where parents can find guidance on how to turn on safety settings, FAQs about how Discord works, and tips on how to talk about online safety with teens. Some existing parental control tools include an option to prohibit a minor from receiving a friend request or a direct message from someone they don’t know.\n\nStill, it’s possible for minors to connect with strangers on public servers or in private chats if the person was invited by someone else in the room or if the channel link is dropped into a public group that the user accessed. By default, all users — including users ages 13 to 17 — can receive friend invitations from anyone in the same server, which then opens up the ability for them to send private messages.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/health/abortion-misinformation-social-media/index.html", "title": "Doctors worry that online misinformation will push abortion-seekers ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter a US Supreme Court draft decision on Roe v.

Physicians and poison control officials say they’re worried that people seeking abortions will turn to ineffective and dangerous methods shared online, potentially delaying or preventing safe, proven abortion care.\n\nSocial media companies told CNN they’re taking a range of actions, including reviewing some abortion-related posts, elevating content from verified sources, and labeling or removing certain posts.\n\nThis type of abortion misinformation is “scary,” said Trebach, an emergency medicine physician and a medical toxicologist in New York City. Some herbs people described may not do anything at all. Others could have a range of medical effects or even be deadly.\n\nTrebach said the online posts he saw came from unverified sources and described substances he learned about only in toxicology training. In the US, many herbs and supplements are regulated as food, not drugs, meaning there isn’t safety or efficacy data to back their use. Negative effects from an herb can’t always be treated easily, he said.\n\n“At the end of the day, nothing – no plant, no herb, no tea, no tincture – is going to be safer or more effective than the current medical standard of abortion, the current medical therapies that we have,” he said. “Nothing is a fair substitute for that.”\n\nJulie Weber, board chair of the American Association of Poison Control Centers, said centers have not seen an increase in exposure calls about people attempting abortions, but they’re preparing for it. People can call the association at 1-800-222-1222 or reach experts at poisonhelp.org if they have questions about a substance and its potential effects.\n\n“When I hear or start seeing questions on social media, I hear of people talking about alternative medications or herbal products or supplements, I do get concerned,” Weber said. “And I am concerned with this, and we do want to get that message out there that this is not necessarily a safe alternative or one that’s even going to be effective.”\n\nTech companies respond\n\nAndrea Miller, president of the advocacy group National Institute for Reproductive Health, has seen abortion misinformation online and said some of it might be coming from “well-intentioned people who are outraged and fearful and want to help right now, but they may inadvertently be sharing information that isn’t accurate or directing people to nefarious resources without realizing it.”\n\nMiller also worries that some posts may be designed to misinform and confuse.\n\n“There has been a calculated, pernicious misinformation campaign that has been many decades in the making from those who are opposed to reproductive freedom, and we anticipate that that is going to be ratcheted up significantly now,” she said.\n\nOne TikTok video – with hashtags such as #womenshealth and #womensrights – listed a range of fruits, herbs and other “DIY” methods that it claimed could induce abortions. It got more than 244,000 likes before CNN flagged it and it was removed by the platform last week.\n\nTikTok says it’s removing videos about abortion that violate its policy against medical misinformation, although it allows other content on the topics, such as videos discussing access to the procedure, according to a spokesperson. The short-form video platform is also redirecting searches for certain hashtags such as #herbalabortion and #naturalabortion to its Community Guidelines rather than showing results.\n\nSimilar posts with misleading, potentially dangerous claims about inducing an abortion have also been shared on Twitter and Facebook, although most appeared to have less reach and engagement than on TikTok.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said that posts about abortion may be reviewed by its third-party fact-checking partners, and content that is rated “false,” “altered” or “partly false” by fact checkers will have its distribution reduced. Facebook pages, groups or accounts that repeatedly share content debunked by fact checkers may also have their reach reduced or lose the ability to advertise or monetize, according to the company.\n\nTwo posts listing potentially harmful claims about self-induced abortion that CNN flagged to Facebook had not been labeled by fact checkers, which choose which content to review, as of Wednesday.\n\nTwitter says it is working to “pre-bunk” misinformation by elevating reliable sources, including on its Trends and Twitter Moments features, according to a spokesperson. Twitter’s rules generally do not prohibit discussion of abortion, contraception or related topics; under the platform’s misinformation policy, it takes action against misleading information related to Covid-19, civic integrity, synthetic and manipulated media, and crisis situations, but the policy does not mention abortion.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the platform had not labeled or removed several posts flagged by CNN that contained advice on using herbs or large doses of medication that toxicologists said could be ineffective or harmful.\n\nMiller advises people seeking abortions or information about the procedure to approach the issue in the same way they would any other health concern: “That is to make sure that they are seeking it out from reputable sources, or if they think ‘hey, that’s an intriguing post, that’s an intriguing thing, I might want to check that out,’ make sure to do some additional research if you’re not confident of the source, even if it’s one of your closest friends and you’re not sure where they got it and they’re not sure where it came from.”\n\nDistraction from truthful information\n\nDoctors CNN spoke with said they’re worried that videos containing abortion misinformation imply there are no paths to legal abortion – which could distract from safe, available options and create more confusion.\n\n“I feel like nowadays, we are lucky that we do have very safe medication abortion options for people, and I’m worried that if people are circulating misinformation, then people will not know that there are ways that they can access safe methods,” said Dr. Jody Steinauer, director of the UCSF Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health.\n\nAlthough there are medications that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to allow abortion to take place at home, some people may assume they can’t access them, Dr. Nisha Verma, a fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and an ob/gyn with a specialty in complex family planning.\n\n“Some people may also turn to unsafe abortion methods when they feel they have no other option or based on information they are gathering on social media,” Verma said.\n\nPosts and content on topics that inspire emotion are much more likely to go viral on social media. And that can be dangerous when they contain false or misleading claims.\n\n“Misinformation can be harmful because it may lead people to try to end their pregnancies in an unsafe way, potentially exposing them to serious bodily harm. While people can self-manage their abortions in a safe way, spreading misinformation about unsafe methods of abortion is incredibly dangerous,” Verma said.\n\nHowever, without a federal constitutional right to an abortion, access to abortion differs from state to state. The Biden administration is working across multiple federal agencies to respond to the Roe v. Wade reversal.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Justice Department announced a task force aimed at identifying ways to protect reproductive rights in the wake of the Supreme Court decision that struck down the federal right to abortion. And last week, President Joe Biden signed an executive order aimed at protecting access to reproductive health services. The order attempts to safeguard access to medication abortion and emergency contraception, protect patient privacy and launch public education efforts. It also aims to bolster the security of and the legal options available to those seeking and providing abortion services.\n\nLosing valuable time\n\nEven before the Supreme Court decision, there was evidence that some people tried to self-manage abortions with things like herbs, physical trauma and uterine trauma, said Jenny Higgins, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n“We, of course, know those techniques are ineffective and, in some cases, also harmful,” Higgins said.\n\nWhen it comes to methods circulating on social media, she said, her bigger concern is that they will use up valuable time.\n\n“Someone might look into alternatives such as herbs, spend time trying to gather information, procure that substance, take the herb, take it again, take it again, and by then, they are later in gestation and maybe even less likely to be able to access effective methods,” Higgins said.\n\n“There’s a real-time constraint here,” she said. “The later people are in gestation, the more effort that needs to be involved in the abortion.”\n\nBeing on the border of 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy can make a big difference in whether someone can safely use FDA-approved abortion drugs, she said.\n\nThe available methods for self-managed abortion today are very different from in the pre-Roe era.\n\n“I want people to understand that now we have the very same pills, the very same FDA-approved pills that are used in standard abortion care can be ordered online,” she said. “There are self-managed techniques that are extremely safe and effective.”", "authors": ["Naomi Thomas"], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2024/07/28/can-you-fly-with-covid-2024/74501280007/", "title": "Can you fly with COVID? What to do if you test positive.", "text": "Jennifer Jolly\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nI just tested positive for COVID-19. Should I travel anyway?\n\nVariations of that question are spiking on Google Search ( as we experience a significant surge in both summer travel and new coronavirus cases.\n\nIf you travel for work or pleasure and haven’t yet dealt with the question of whether to fly with COVID-19, chances are at some point you will.\n\nPresident Joe Biden just tested positive while campaigning in Las Vegas. Several Tour de France riders are also dealing with the latest bout of COVID-19. And I picked it up earlier this month during a recent cross-country trip, testing positive just two days before I was supposed to fly to Alaska to help my parents − ages 79 and 85 − move out of their recently sold family home.\n\nEthically, I didn’t feel right about getting on a plane knowing I had COVID-19 and certainly couldn’t show up to my parent's house with the virus. But the last-second scramble to rebook the trip, with our dog, my husband, and my parents still needing my help, was super-stressful.\n\nEnjoy your worry-free vacation: Best travel insurance policies\n\nShould I fly if I just tested positive for COVID?\n\nTechnically, you can fly sick − no one is going to stop you at the gate and swab your nose − but you shouldn’t.\n\nJust because the airlines no longer require you to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test ahead of your international flight, as they sometimes did during the earlier years of the pandemic, doesn’t mean travel should be a germ free-for-all.\n\n“I suggest that you not fly,” Vicki Sowards, director of nursing resources at Passport Health, wrote via email. “You can expose the other travelers on your flight, and the process of traveling can contribute to fatigue and an increase in symptoms.”\n\nIf you know you have COVID-19, or think you might, you should not get on a plane, according to health experts, the CDC, and everyone who weighed in on my social media pages this past week.\n\n“Should you travel if you have COVID? Absolutely not. Other people are immunocompromised, so essentially, you could kill innocent people,” says 56-year-old Nick Longo from Corpus Christi, Texas. Longo travels outside America “at least once a year” and flies within the U.S. frequently. “Do I think a lot of people are flying with it right now? Yes. People who don't care about others are (flying).That's why it spread.”\n\nMike Hensley, 54, of Northern California, agrees.\n\n“It's a simple answer,'' he wrote. \"No. You should not travel. That's how viruses spread quickly. But yes, I am sure people are traveling while positive because they think it's a seasonal allergy or cold, have convinced themselves they don't feel that bad, or are already on the upswing (and don't know/care about how viruses work) or are simply just selfish and don't care about the people they are exposing.”\n\nI’ve been on a dozen planes over the past few months, and anecdotally, it’s true that a lot of people are sniffling, sneezing and coughing − with nary a mask in sight.\n\nAnother traveler told me she knew three people who flew to Europe from California even though they had COVID-19. She and her parents, on the other hand, changed their travel plans last month when they came down with the virus, delaying their flight until they had tested negative for three days.\n\nShould I wear a mask on the plane?\n\nThe CDC, World Health Organization, Mayo Clinic and many other medical professionals agree masks help lower the risk of respiratory virus transmission, especially in tight quarters, like planes, trains, buses and automobiles. Officials say N95 masks are the most effective.\n\nAnecdotally, there seems to be a lot of people choosing to fly unmasked − either knowing they have COVID-19 or not testing to find out when they have symptoms. There’s no doubt people are tired of masks and the pandemic, and many are likely treating COVID-19 like the seasonal flu or a cold − something they’ll just have to deal with when they get it.\n\nSome people even wrote on my social media pages that when it comes to travel, they are not concerned about passing the virus on to others because they feel it's a risk people knowingly take when they get on a plane these days.\n\nThat last sentiment struck a nerve with me because I suspect that's how I contracted COVID-19 two Julys in a row, right after cross-country work trips that coincided with peak summer travel and virus spikes.\n\nWhat should you do if you are COVID-positive right before a planned trip?\n\nEven though I’m vaccinated and received my last booster in December 2023, I have some risk factors and got so sick from COVID-19 last summer that I couldn’t do much of anything for about two weeks.\n\nI initially thought I was experiencing seasonal allergies and waited a few days before testing. By the time I did, I was already pretty sick. I had extreme headaches, head and chest congestion, muscle aches and fatigue, and I lost my sense of taste and smell for almost two months.\n\nThis summer was different. Even though I barely had a tickle in the back of my throat, I was tired and achy and knew something was off, so I took a test right away. When it came back positive, I started on Paxlovid immediately and pushed the trip to Alaska back.\n\nI didn’t fly until my test was negative, and I still wore a mask the entire time I was on the plane. (I didn’t eat or drink the entire flight.) I will continue to wear one indoors until every last symptom (I still have slight sniffles) goes away, even though I’ve now met the latest guidelines of having two negative tests 48 hours apart. It’s not worth the risk of getting my parents − or anyone else − sick.\n\nI admit, I’ve gotten much more lax about masking up on planes this past year. I often feel a little self-conscious being one of the only people wearing one, but getting sick isn’t worth it. I plan to wear one on all upcoming flights.\n\nWhat are the latest CDC guidelines?\n\nI have several friends who, as long as they are feeling well enough, are expected to put on a mask and go back into the office for work, even with COVID-19. What exactly are the rules now?\n\nThe latest CDC guidelines, updated in March, say you can go back to your normal activities if you meet two requirements:\n\nYou have been fever-free for at least 24 hours (without the use of fever-reducing medications) .\n\nYour symptoms are improving overall.\n\nYou might still be contagious, however, and the CDC recommends that for at least five days after resuming your routine, you:\n\nUse masks.\n\nWash your hands frequently.\n\nPractice physical distancing (especially from people with risk factors from respiratory illness).\n\nTake additional steps for cleaner air.\n\nIn addition to the CDC guidelines, the FDA recommends “2 negative antigen tests for individuals with symptoms or three antigen tests for those without symptoms, performed 48 hours apart” before you go back to being around people.\n\nTravel insurance:What are the most affordable options?\n\nWhat if I can’t afford to quarantine or be sick away from home?\n\nThe costs of flight changes, extended stays, and even additional time away from work add up. Does that mean you should stop traveling? No, but you should have a COVID-19 plan that protects others, Richard Martinello, medical director of infection prevention at Yale New Haven Health in Connecticut, told Outside Magazine recently.\n\nMartinello urges people to consider the moral and ethical ramifications of putting other people in harm’s way, “like not drunk driving,” he said. “Putting yourself in prolonged close contact with fellow travelers when you are knowingly sick, whether with COVID or any other contagious virus, is irresponsible. You never know who you’re sitting next to on a plane. If they’re immune-compromised, even a cold could push them over the edge to serious illness.”\n\nBe sure to check your airline’s COVID-19 policies before you buy your ticket. Many still waive change fees for travelers who need to reschedule because they have the virus. For even more protection, book a ticket that can be changed or credited if you have to cancel your flight, and look into travel insurance.\n\nI almost always fly Alaska Airlines and usually pay a little extra to make my trip 100% refundable, no matter what. I didn’t do that for this latest flight (to save $280 for my husband and me) and ended up paying one $37 change fee for the difference in ticket prices between the day I was supposed to fly and the day I did. Many airlines will also give you full credit for a future flight if you have to cancel because of illness.\n\nHow can I stay safe while traveling?\n\nPassport Health’s Vicki Sowards says being prepared is vital. She urges travelers to get vaccinations like COVID-19 boosters before travel and pack a first aid kit, including any medications they use when they’re ill.\n\n“You want optimal health when going on the ‘trip of a lifetime,’” she said. Because COVID-19 spreads through airborne particles and droplets, “take a mask and sanitizer on the plane, just in case you have a seatmate or other traveler close by who is coughing and appears to be ill. Use hand sanitizer before eating or when you know you will be touching your face.”\n\nJennifer Jolly is an Emmy Award-winning consumer tech columnist and on-air correspondent.

The stranger, who said he lived in England, entered a group chat that included her daughter and members of the band, according to the mother. They struck up a friendship in a private thread. He asked for nude pictures; her daughter obliged.\n\n“I went through every chat they ever had but the most disturbing thing, beyond the nudes, was that he asked her to send a picture of our house,” said the mother, who, like otherparents of young Discord users, asked to remain anonymous, citing concerns about their family’s privacy. “My daughter went on Zillow, found our home and sent it, so he knew where she lives. He then asked what American school buses looked like, so she took a photo of her bus and sent it.” He then requested pictures of her friends, and she sent those, too.\n\nThe mother worried the Discord user was manipulating, tracking and planning to exploit her daughter. After shutting down her daughter’s Discord account, an effort she said took six weeks for the company to complete, she installed outdoor security cameras around the home. The mother never reported the incident to Discord, and the conversations are no longer available to flag because the account was deleted. “There’s lots of things we should have done in hindsight,” she said.\n\nIn recent months, large social media companies have faced renewed scrutiny from lawmakers over the negative impacts their platforms can have on teens. Executives from Facebook (FB), Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat’s parent company were called to testify before the Senate after leaks from a Facebook (FB) whistleblower pointed to Instagram’s potential to harm one’s mental health and body image, especially among teenage girls.\n\nLawmakers are now weighing legislation to protect kids online – a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate last month which proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harms. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nDiscord, however, has not been part of that conversation. Launched in 2015, Discord is less well-known among parents than big names like Instagram, even as it surged to 150 million monthly active users globally during the pandemic. The service, which is known for its video game communities, is also less intuitive for some parents, blending the feel of early AOL chat rooms or work chat app Slack with the chaotic, personalized world of MySpace. While much of the focus from lawmakers with other platforms has been on scrutinizing more sophisticated technologies like algorithms, which can surface potentially harmful content to younger users, parents’ concerns about Discord recall an earlier era of the internet: anonymous chat rooms.\n\nDiscord is less well-known among parents than big names like Instagram, even as it surged to 150 million monthly active users globally during the pandemic. Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDiscord’s users, about 79% of which are located outside of North America, engage in public and private chats or channels, called servers, on varying topics, including music interests, Harry Potter and Minecraft, and homework help. Some, like a room for memes, can have hundreds of thousands of members. But the vast majority are private, invite-only spaces with fewer than 10 people, according to Discord. All servers are private by default, and only channels with more than 200 members are discoverable in its search tool if the administrator wants it to be public, the company added.\n\nStill, it’s possible for minors to connect with people they don’t know on public servers or in private chats if the stranger was invited by someone else in the room or if the channel link is dropped into a public group that the user accessed. By default, all users – including users ages 13 to 17 – can receive friend invitations from anyone in the same server, which then opens up the ability for them to send private messages.\n\nCNN Business spoke to nearly a dozen parents who shared stories about their teenagers being exposed to self-harm chats, sexually explicit content and sexual predators on the platform, including users they believed were older men seeking inappropriate pictures and videos.\n\nOne mother from Charlotte, North Carolina said her 13-year-old daughter’s mental health was impacted after a Discord chat room involving her interests took a turn. “The group eventually started talking about cutting themselves, shared tips on how to hide it from parents, and suggested advice on how to run away from home,” the mother told CNN. “I later found out she was actively engaging in self-harm and had planned to run away to Alabama to visit a friend she made on Discord.”\n\nA father outside Boston, who initially didn’t think much of his 13-year-old daughter downloading Discord last summer “because she’s a gamer,” later discovered she had been talking with a man in his 30s who was looking for photos of her and wanted to engage in “naughty cam” activities, in messages reviewed by CNN Business.\n\nThe father said he also later learned some of his daughter’s classmates actively use Discord throughout the day unbeknownst to the school.\n\n“The school actively blocks apps such as Snapchat and Instagram when they log onto the school network on school devices, but teens are using other platforms like Discord that aren’t on their radar,” the father said. “It is the wild west of social media.”\n\nCNN Business reported several of these cases to Discord – with the parents’ permission – ahead of this article’s publication. After launching a series of investigations, the company said it took action against some accounts but said it does not publicly comment on specific cases or user accounts.\n\nMany of the parents CNN Business spoke with said they did not enable any of the offered parental controls at the time, mostly because they were in the dark about how the platform works. If enabled, those parental control tools, including one that prohibits a minor from receiving a friend request or a direct message from someone they don’t know, likely could have prevented many of these incidents. Some parents also expressed frustration with how Discord responded to their incidents once they were reported and struggled with the fact that audio chats on Discord don’t leave a written record and can prove to be more difficult to moderate.\n\nData on the frequency of such incidents is hard to come by. One recent report from Bark, a paid monitoring service that screens more than 30 apps and platforms, including emails and personal messages, for terms and phrases that could indicate concerns for the nearly 6 million children it protects, said Discord ranked among the top five apps or platforms for content flagged by its algorithms for severe violence, bullying, sexual content and suicidal ideation.\n\nIn its most recent transparency report, Discord said it removed more than 470,000 non-spam accounts between January and June 2021, a significant rise from 266,075 account deletions during the second half of 2020. “Exploitative content made a particularly large contribution to this overall rise,” said the report, which describes it as an umbrella category which encompasses sexually explicit material. The category went from around 130,000 removals in the second half of 2020 to 238,000 in the first half of 2021, and the removal of exploitative content servers – which Discord defines as non-consensual pornography and sexual content related to minors – nearly doubled to more than 11,000.\n\nHowever, Discord told CNN Business that child sexual abuse material and grooming — a term that refers to an adult forging an emotional connection with a minor so they can manipulate, abuse or exploit them — makes up a small percentage of activity on the service.\n\nIn response to questions about the incidents parents shared with CNN Business, John Redgrave, the company’s VP of trust and safety, said “this behavior is appalling, unacceptable, and has no place on Discord.”\n\n“It’s our highest priority for our communities to have a safe experience on the service, which is why we continuously invest in new tools to protect teens and remove harmful content from the service, and have built a team dedicated to this work,” Redgrave said in a statement. “We also invest in education, so that parents know how our service works and understand the account controls that can contribute to a positive, safe experience for their teens.”\n\nRedgrave added: “We built Discord to foster a sense of belonging and community, and it’s deeply concerning to our whole company when it is misused. We must and will do better.”\n\nBut some experts argue the concerns that parents raised with Discord are innate to its design model.\n\n“With Discord, you subscribe to channels and engage in private chat, which is a veil of privacy and secrecy in the way it is constructed,” said Danielle Citron, a law professor at University of Virginia who focuses on digital privacy issues. While some larger social networks have faced scrutiny around harassment and other issues, much of that activity is “public facing,” she said. “Discord is newer to the party and so much of it is happening behind closed doors.”\n\nA gaming tool goes mainstream\n\nDiscord started with aspirations to become a game developer studio called Hammer & Chisel but shifted to focus on its communication tool after a multiplayer game it created never caught on. Its use of voice-over-video and screen sharing was a draw for gamers, allowing them to interact with friends or others while playing video games. In June 2020, the company announced a rebranding effort to grow beyond gaming; now about 80% of active Discord users report they either use the service mainly for non-gaming purposes, or use it equally for gaming and other purposes, according to the company.\n\nThe company, which employs 600 people globally, said it makes its money through a subscription service called Nitro, which provides an enhanced Discord experience, such as customizing profiles with unique tags, accessing animated emojis, uploading large files and “boosting” users’ favorite servers. In September 2021, Discord announced it raised $500 million in a funding round, placing its valuation at around $15 billion. Earlier in the year, the Wall Street Journal reported it walked away from a deal to be acquired by Microsoft for at least $10 billion. The company is widely expected to be moving toward a potential initial public offering.\n\nLike other social platforms, Discord said it saw a jump in usage as people were stuck at home during the pandemic, going from 56 million monthly active users in 2019 to 150 million in September 2021. Like other platforms, it has also had to confront extreme content, including from far right and conspiracy groups. And while users must be 13 years of age or older to join, problems exist with age verification, just as on other platforms.\n\nAmanda Schneider said an older man pursued an inappropriate relationship with her 13-year-old son on Discord. \"It was just awful; there was no help at all.\" Courtesy Amanda Schneider\n\nSimilar to Reddit, there are moderators for channels who are responsible for enforcing the company’s community guidelines and their own chat room rules. They are directly able to investigate a situation and then warn, quarantine, or ban users from channels. Discord also has an in-house Trust & Safety team of full-time employees who investigate and respond to user reports. According to Discord, they can rely on a mix of proactive and reactive ways to keep the platform safe, including automated search tools that scan photos and videos for exploitative content.\n\nThe company said it’s made an increased effort around boosting its safety protocols across its platform in the last year, working to scale reactive operations and improve methods to proactively detect and remove abuse. It continues to roll out more account controls through its Safety Center, which includes the ability to block offensive users, restrict explicit content, control who messages you and set up server rules and permissions within communities. It has also partnered with ConnectSafely, a nonprofit dedicated to internet safety, to create a parent’s guide to Discord of recommended safety settings for teens, and is hosting “listening sessions” with National Parent Teacher Association chapters to increase awareness and usage of Discord’s safety features and practices.\n\nDiscord said parents can request that their child’s account be deleted by sending an email associated with the account to confirm they are the child’s guardian. This process may require some back and forth with the Trust & Safety team to help the parent through the process, according to the company.\n\nDiscord also said it plans to turn off the default option for minors to receive friend invitations or private messages from anyone in the same server as part of a future safety update.\n\nThe company recently updated its terms of service and privacy policy to take into account the off-platform behaviors committed by its users to assess violations of its community guidelines, including for sexualizing children. (Other large platforms, including Twitter and Twitch, began taking into account a user’s activity off their platforms several years ago, such as being affiliated with a violent organization, as part of their efforts to crack down on abusive behavior.)\n\nBut problems persist. Many of the parents CNN spoke with said they believe Discord is not doing enough to protect its young users.\n\n‘There was no help at all’\n\nOne mother from Los Angeles who submitted a report to Discord said the company was unable to help her after a man struck up a conversation with her 10-year-old daughter who started sending her links to BDSM pornography. (Discord requires users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with other social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.) The mother received an automated email from its Trust and Security team.\n\n“We’re sorry to hear that you came across this type of content, and we understand that this can be extremely concerning,” said the Discord response, reviewed by CNN Business. “Unfortunately, we’re unable to locate the content with the information you’ve provided. We understand this may be uncomfortable but, if possible, please send us the message links to the reported content for the team to review and take appropriate action.”\n\nAfter the mother sent Discord the requested links more than a year ago, the company never responded. Although the company told CNN Business it does not comment on specific reported cases, it said it reviews all reports of inappropriate content with a minor, investigates the behavior and takes appropriate action.\n\nRich Wistocki teaching people about social media safety practices. As with other social platforms, parents with kids on Discord should abide by age restrictions and enable parental controls, he said. Courtesy Rich Wistocki\n\nAmanda Schneider, who lives outside Phoenix, said she was also disappointed with how the platform handled her concerns when she said a man in his late 20s pursued an inappropriate relationship with her 13-year-old son, asking the teenager to masturbate and tell him about it afterward.\n\n“Discord told me I couldn’t do anything unless I had specific links to the text thread that showed my son verifying his age — such as typing ‘I am 13,’ which was shared through a voice [chat] — and the other person verifying his age before an incident happened,” said Schneider.\n\n“It was just awful; there was no help at all,” she said. After she reported the incident to law enforcement, she learned he was a registered sex offender and had been arrested, according to Schneider.\n\nThe company told CNN Business the reason it requires links to the chat and cannot use screenshots or attachments to verify content is to prevent users from potentially falsifying information to get others in trouble. It added that parents have the ability to use its report form to flag specific users to the Trust & Safety team.\n\nAccording to Citron, the law professor at the University of Virginia, voice-to-voice chats on Discord make reporting even harder for parents. “Unlike text conversations, predators thrive in the voice space because there isn’t a record,” she said. “When a parent goes to report that a kid has been engaging with someone [inappropriately] or that they’re being groomed by a sexual predator, there’s often no proof [because audio isn’t saved].”\n\nDiscord said its rules and standards around audio are the same as its text and image policies. But it told CNN Business that like other platforms, audio presents a different set of challenges for moderation than text-based communication. Discord said it does not store or record voice chats, but its team investigates reports of misuse and looks at information from text-based channels as part of that process.\n\nWhat parents can do\n\nSome parents like Stephane Cotichini, a professional video game developer, believe Discord can be a positive platform for young users if the right parental controls are in place. His teenage sons who use the site for gaming have a handful of Discord’s features enabled, such as restricting direct messages to only friends.\n\n“I know Discord can be problematic, but it’s important for me as a parent to not simply prohibit these things because of the dangers but teach my kids about how to navigate them and balance limiting it,” he said. “To my knowledge, I’ve never had an issue with any of my boys.”\n\nCotichini, who uses Discord to chat with his own team at work, said the platform is a valuable place for other gamers to drop into his servers and weigh in on what they’re developing in real time. He also attributes the platform to encouraging his sons’ love of gaming; two have already made their own programs, including one who won an award at the XPrize Connect Code Games Challenge in 2021.\n\nThe Discord app as seen on an iPhone Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\n“If at a young age I can get them to spend a percentage of their time creating content as opposed to consuming, I feel like I’m somehow succeeding,” he said.\n\nAs with other social platforms, parents with kids on Discord should abide by age restrictions and enable parental controls, said Rich Wistocki, a former detective in Illinois who now runs Be Sure Cyber training to help parents, school administrators and law enforcement learn more about the dangers of social media. In the event of an incident, he said parents should take screenshots of the chat, pictures, video, user ID and save links to the text in the channel when reporting it.\n\n“Parents often don’t think these things will happen to their kids,” he said. “More can be done to prevent these incidents from continuing.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/business/tiktok-search-engine-misinformation/index.html", "title": "TikTok's search engine repeatedly delivers misinformation to its ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen a TikTok user searches the social media app for information on top news stories, ranging from Covid-19 vaccines to school shootings, nearly 20% of the videos presented as search results contain misinformation, according to a research report published Wednesday.\n\nResearchers at NewsGuard, a journalism and technology tool that tracks online information, searched TikTok and Google this month for information on major news topics such as the 2020 presidential election, the Russia-Ukraine war and abortion to compare the misinfomation delivered by their search engines.\n\nTikTok, whose users are predominantly teenagers and young adults, “repeatedly delivered videos containing false claims in the first 20 results, often within the first five,” the report states. “Google, by comparison, provided higher-quality and less-polarizing results, with far less misinformation.”\n\nA Google spokesperson declined to comment on the report when contacted by CNN.\n\nThe researchers searched terms such as “mRNA vaccine” and “2022 election,” as well as controversial news topics like “Uvalde tx conspiracy.” They analyzed 540 TikTok results and found that 105 videos, or 19.4%, contained false or misleading claims, the report says.\n\nAccording to the report, a search on TikTok for information about politics, including the 2020 presidential election and the January 6, 2021, US Capitol insurrection, often included misinformation as well as references to QAnon conspiracy theories. For example, a search for the question “Was the 2020 election stolen?” yielded six videos that contained false claims in the first 20 results, NewsGuard found.\n\nNewsGuard researchers also found that TikTok’s search engine “is consistently feeding millions of young users health misinformation, including some claims that could be dangerous to users’ health.” For instance, a search for “does mugwort induce abortion” receives over a dozen results that advocate for unproven herbal abortion methods.\n\nTikTok recently began removing abortion-related videos that violate its policy against medical misinformation, including those that share potentially dangerous advice about how to self-induce an abortion.\n\nIn response to the NewsGuard report, a TikTok spokesperson told CNN that its community guidelines “make clear that we do not allow harmful misinformation, including medical misinformation, and we will remove it from the platform. We partner with credible voices to elevate authoritative content on topics related to public health, and partner with independent fact-checkers who help us to assess the accuracy of content.”\n\nTikTok ties to China under scrutiny\n\nTikTok removed more than 102 million videos in early 2022 for violating its guidelines, according to its Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. But less than 1% of those videos were removed for violating the company’s “integrity and authenticity” guidelines, which include misinformation, according to NewsGuard’s review.\n\nNewsGuard’s report was released amid bipartisan concerns in Washington about the possibility that US user data could find its way to the Chinese government and be used to undermine US interests due to a national security law in that country that compels companies located there to cooperate with data requests.\n\nUS officials have expressed fears that China could use Americans’ personal information to identify useful potential agents or intelligence targets, or to inform future mis- or disinformation campaigns.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, TikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas declined to commit to cut off flows of US user data to China, instead promising that the outcome of its negotiations with the US government “will satisfy all national security concerns.”\n\nTikTok does not operate in China, Pappas said, though it does have an office in China. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, whose founder is Chinese and has offices in China.\n\n“I was surprised that TikTok is so much worse even than Google and worse, as a general matter as a platform, than Facebook or Twitter when it comes to this stuff,” Steven Brill, founder of NewsGuard, told CNN.\n\nBrill said the report’s findings are especially concerning due to the company’s ties to China and how easily children can access the app’s content.\n\n“We should take this as a warning. If I had kids of TikTok age, I would certainly want to know what they’re using as a search engine,” Brill said. “I’d be upset enough if they were relying too much on Google and coming up with reports in school that were based on what they were reading on Wikipedia.

What to know.", "text": "Johnny C. Taylor Jr.\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr. tackles your human resources questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society and author of \"Reset: A Leader’s Guide to Work in an Age of Upheaval.”\n\nHave a question? Submit it here.\n\nQuestion: My employer has utilized some of my photos on their social media and website to promote their business. I was never notified or asked for permission. Should they be allowed to use my images without my permission and compensation? – Marvin\n\nAnswer: Your employer may be able to use the images found on your social media platforms. In the age of Facebook, Instagram and X, formerly Twitter, it’s a common practice for individuals and organizations to repost others’ photographs and images. Unfortunately, laws have not kept up with our social media era and the ability to share, remix, or modify online content.\n\nNo federal law prohibits an employer from using an employee’s photo for business purposes. However, many states have statutes commonly known as “right-of-publicity” or “right-of-privacy” laws. In some states, they may be addressed as “unfair competition” or “personality rights.” These state laws prevent using an individual’s name, image, voice, photo, or “likeness” for commercial purposes without prior consent from the individual. I recommend you review your state laws to see if the use of your social media photos falls under its statutes.\n\nSocial media platforms are not considered public domain, and the use of your photos could also be limited by copyright laws or the platform’s terms and conditions. Even under a platform’s terms and conditions, it likely cannot stop your employer from using or reposting your photos. Copyright laws protect the photographer and will likely not apply to photos you appear in unless they are selfies.\n\nLegal remedies aren’t always the most prudent or practical solution to disputes between two parties – in this case, you and your employer. Indeed, if you have a problem with your employer using your photos, you can always let them know. They should be willing to respond to a respectful and reasonable request. If you are concerned that it may be a thorny or contentious issue, you should probably start by speaking with your HR team. I hope you find an amicable agreement with your employer to protect your privacy.\n\nPerformance reviewIs there any recourse for a poor job review with no prior feedback? Ask HR\n\nI was let go from my last job because I could not see well enough at night to drive safely. My job was from 8 a.m. to 4:40 p.m. most days. Everyone in my department was expected to be available to work at night if called upon. I informed the company during my interview that I could not see to drive at night. They could not find any fault with my work, so they used my inability to drive at night as cause for my termination. Is this a case of discrimination? – Powell”\n\nAnswer: Losing a job is never easy, and it can be incredibly disheartening when you feel as though you were performing well and the termination was unjustified. To answer your question, it could be a case of discrimination, but it will depend on the facts and circumstances.\n\nUnder The Americans with Disabilities Act, employers with 15 or more employees must engage candidates and employees in an interactive process to determine if they are “qualified individuals,” meaning “an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.” This means that if driving at night was an essential function of your job, you may not be eligible for an accommodation, and they could terminate you.\n\nSuppose your former employer is subject to ADA regulations. In this case, they should have used the information you provided about driving at night as a catalyst for going through the interactive process to identify if you were eligible for a reasonable accommodation. For example, if night driving occurs just three or four times per year, maybe a reasonable accommodation would be for your company to provide you with an Uber or Lyft on those rare occasions when they need you to work until dark.\n\nDetermining whether a reasonable accommodation exists would likely include obtaining medical documentation from you or your physician. There are some cases when a specific accommodation may not be suitable due to cost or the impact on the workforce, but your company (not you) bears the burden of proving an accommodation is a burden.\n\nYou may want to contact your Human Resources department for additional information and to see if the ADA applies to your previous employer. If you feel your employer missed steps, consider speaking to legal counsel or your local Department of Labor for additional insight.\n\nDrug testingShould I get paid for time spend getting a test?

Read more.\n\nSome 45,000 union workers could walk off the job at seaports on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts on Oct. 1, cutting off vital trade arteries just weeks ahead of the nation's presidential election.\n\nA JPMorgan analysis projected that a strike could cost the U.S. economy $5 billion daily.\n\nThe strike could hit 36 ports that handle about one-half of U.S. ocean imports. That could affect availability of a range of goods from bananas to clothing to cars shipped via container, while creating weeks-long backlogs at ports. It could also stoke shipping cost increases that may be passed on to voters already frustrated with housing and food inflation, according to logistics experts.\n\nWhat's behind the potential port strike?\n\nThe International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) union representing workers at ports from Maine to Texas and the United States Maritime Alliance employer group appear to have hit an impasse over pay. The current six-year contract expires at midnight on Sept. 30.\n\nA strike at all East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports would be the first for the ILA since 1977.\n\nThe White House said it is not trying to help broker a deal, as it did last year during West Coast talks, and a Biden administration official has said the president would not use his federal powers to block a strike.\n\nA widespread and lengthy strike could cause shortages and cost increases across a broad range of industries.\n\nWhat do port workers do?\n\nLongshoremen, also referred to as stevedores, handle cargo from incoming ships. They mostly work on container ships, but also do some work with car carriers and cruise ships.\n\nThey operate cranes that pluck containers from ships to \"lashing,\" securing cargo containers to prevent them from falling off during transit, and process paperwork.\n\nPorts handled $38B in vehicle imports last year\n\nPorts covered by the contract handled $37.8 billion worth of vehicle imports during the 12 months ended June 30, 2024, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The Port of Baltimore, Maryland, leads the nation in car shipments.\n\nAuto parts are also a key import on the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico, with shipments from Europe more difficult to reroute than those from China, logistics experts said.\n\nThe ports also lead the U.S. in shipments of machinery, fabricated steel and precision instruments, coming in at $97.4 billion, $16.2 billion and $15.7 billion, respectively, S&P Global Market Intelligence data showed.\n\nUS agriculture exports, imports at risk in port strike\n\nAbout 14% of all U.S. waterborne agricultural exports, by volume, would be at risk from a strike. Over a one-week period, the potential value of those exports is estimated at $318 million, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nAdditionally, 53% of U.S. waterborne agricultural imports by volume are vulnerable to a strike, leading to a potential economic impact of over $1.1 billion per week, the Farm Bureau said.\n\nThree-quarters of the nation's banana imports from countries like Guatemala and Ecuador land at ports on the East and Gulf Coasts, said Jason Miller, interim chair of Michigan State University's department of supply chain management.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. imports coffee and cocoa in large volumes and exports cotton.\n\nA strike also would affect container exports of soybeans, soybean meal and other products and would have a significant impact on chilled or frozen meat and eggs, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.\n\nThe $18-billion-a-year U.S. beef and pork export market and the $5.8 billion poultry and egg export sector relies on refrigerated containers that cannot sit idle for long.\n\nAbout 45% of all waterborne U.S. pork exports and 30% of beef exports were shipped via East Coast and Gulf Coast ports in the first seven months of this year, said U.S. Meat Export Federation spokesperson Joe Schuele.\n\nMore than a quarter of all U.S. egg and egg product exports and around 70% of all poultry meat exports are shipped from ports along the East and Gulf Coasts, according to Customs data and the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council.\n\nThe affected ports also handle more than 91% of containerized imports and 69% of containerized exports of U.S. pharmaceutical products, according to Everstream Analytics.\n\nMore than one-third of containers departing the U.S. with lifesaving medications leaves from the port in Norfolk, Virginia, while nearly one-third of containerized pharmaceutical imports enter the country through the port in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nRetailers rushing shipments of holiday goods\n\nRetailers account for roughly half of all container volumes. Many U.S. retailers already have rushed in shipments of year-end holiday goods.\n\nThe ports that would be affected by a potential strike bring over half of the nation's knitted and non-knitted apparel, valued at $32.8 billion combined, as well furniture valued at $23.4 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThough the Gulf Coast ports of Houston and New Orleans are major oil and gas shipment hubs, those commodities would remain largely unaffected by a strike involving more labor-intensive container cargo. The same applies to coal exports from Norfolk, Virginia, experts said.\n\nThe ILA, however, has pledged to handle military cargo and to work passenger cruise ships during a strike.\n\nOne-week shutdown could lead to six-week recovery, Maersk estimates\n\nIn broad terms, a strike would raise costs for shipping while also imposing lengthy delays.\n\nThe top five ports in the negotiating group - New York and New Jersey; Savannah, Georgia; Houston; Norfolk; and Charleston - handled more than 1.5 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) valued at $83.7 billion in August, according to John McCown, senior fellow at the Center for Maritime Strategy. About two-thirds of that cargo was inbound, while the remainder was outbound, he said.\n\nTrade disruptions from a work stoppage would begin immediately, causing supply chain problems, logistics experts warned.\n\nAnalysts at Sea-Intelligence, a Copenhagen-based shipping advisory firm, estimated that it could take anywhere from four to six days to clear the backlog from a one-day strike.\n\nMaersk, one of the largest providers of ocean transportation and a member of the employer group, warned that a one-week shutdown could require up to six weeks of recovery time, \"with significant backlogs and delays compounding with each passing day.\"\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles, Karl Plume and Tom Polansek in Chicago, Marcelo Teixeira in New York and David Shepardson and Jarrett Renshaw in Washington; Editing by Anna Driver, William Maclean and Deepa Babington)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/19/boeing-strike-union-vote-proposal/75755136007/", "title": "Boeing strike: Union to vote on contract proposal with 35% pay hike", "text": "David Shepardson\n\nReuters\n\nStriking machinists at Boeing, will vote Wednesday on a new contract proposal that includes a 35% pay hike over four years that could end a costly five-week-old strike, the company and union said Saturday.\n\nAround 33,000 of Boeing's unionized West Coast workers, most in Washington state, have been on strike since Sept. 13. The work stoppage has halted production of the plane maker's best-selling 737 MAX and its 767 and 777 widebodies, putting added pressure on the company's already fragile finances.\n\nThe latest offer includes a $7,000 ratification bonus, reinstated incentive plan and enhanced contributions to workers' 401(k) retirement plans including a one-time $5,000 contribution plus up to 12% in employer contributions, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 751 said.\n\nBoeing said Saturday it looks \"forward to our employees voting on the negotiated proposal.\" Still there is no guarantee workers will approve the proposal after they overwhelmingly rejected an initial proposal. \"The future of this contract is in your hands,\" the union told workers Saturday.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond:Retailer set to return after partnership with The Container Store\n\nBoeing on Oct. 8 withdrew its enhanced offer that included a 30% wage increase over four years, after talks also attended by federal mediators broke down. The union has been seeking a 40% hike and restoration of a defined benefit pension, which was not offered in the new contract proposal.\n\nIn September, nearly 95% of the West Coast workers rejected Boeing's contract offer of a 25% pay rise over four years that had been endorsed by union officials, prompting the strike.\n\nThat earlier deal also had a $3,000 signing bonus which some Boeing workers told Reuters was too low, given that prior deals had bonuses of at least $5,000.\n\nLabor Secretary Julie Su joins Boeing strike negotiations\n\nThe union said on Saturday in a social media post that with the help of Acting U.S. Secretary of Labor Julie Su they had received a \"negotiated proposal\" and telling striking workers it \"is worthy of your consideration.\"\n\nOn Monday, Su was in Seattle for her first in-person effort to help reach a new Boeing contract and returned on Thursday night to resume efforts after a trip to Detroit.\n\nWhile some reaction on social media sites on Saturday morning were favorable to the new deal, it's not yet clear how the workers will vote.\n\nA spokesperson for the White House said “President (Joe) Biden believes the collective bargaining process is the best way to achieve good outcomes for workers, and the ultimate decision on a contract will be for the union workers to decide.”\n\nLast Friday, Boeing announced it would cut 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its global staff and take $5 billion in charges, continuing a year of tumult for the company since a new Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 airplane suffered a mid-air emergency.Boeing announced a window for up to $25 billion in stock and debt offerings over the next three years on Tuesday, as well as a $10-billion credit agreement.\n\nBoeing has been facing ongoing pressure since a door panel flew off a new 737 MAX 9 jet in midair in January prompting the Federal Aviation Administration to bar the plane maker from increasing production. The FAA opened a new safety inquiry into Boeing on Friday.\n\nIn July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and agreed to pay at least $243.6 million after breaching a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement.\n\nThe labor strife is expected to have a negative impact on October's employment report, which will be published days before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.\n\nEconomists estimate that the strike and rolling weekly furloughs of non-striking workers as well as temporary layoffs at Boeing's suppliers subtracted as many as 50,000 jobs from nonfarm payrolls this month. The economy added 254,000 jobs in September and the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% from 4.2% in August.\n\nReporting by David Shepardson in Washington; additional reporting by Mrinmay Dey and Allison Lampert.

He said the company has been losing $400 million a week since the strike began Sept. 15.\n\nWhile he declined to assign a total dollar value to the negotiated UAW package, Lawler did estimate an $850 to $900 added cost per unit in labor costs.\n\n\"The company will be profitable moving forward. there's no doubt about that,\" Lawler said during a news media call. \"This is an increase in costs for us. This is something we're going to have to work on. We're going to have to find efficiencies throughout the system ... to help mitigate the impacts of higher labor costs.\"\n\nFord faces serious costs related to quality, too, he said, and those costs need to be addressed and contained as quickly as possible. Ford has consistently spent the most on warranty and quality costs in the industry, billions more than competitors. During the third quarter specifically, Lawler said, 50,000 vehicles were put on quality hold, and that hurt the bottom line financially. Ford executives said they’ve spent more than $1.1 billion more on warranty costs than the same time last year.\n\nPaying people more during periods of inflation is essential or it creates hardship, Lawler said, adding: \"You, as a company, need to find a way to operate more efficiently, increase productivity and eliminate waste.\"\n\nFord Pro, the unit that focuses on business clients, is thriving, he said. \"And we're leaning into Ford Blue.\"\n\nThe Ford Blue unit, which oversees gasoline-powered vehicles, diesel and hybrid, is generating enough revenue to pay for the company's transition to electric vehicles. During third quarter, the Ford Blue unit delivered $1.7 billion in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), up 17% from a year ago. Meanwhile, Ford e recorded an EBIT loss of $1.3 billion\n\nLawler said adoption of electric vehicles is slower than expected but it is growing. Buyers seem to be shifting more quickly to hybrid vehicles, which do offer 25% efficiency on emissions, Lawler said.\n\nFord said electric vehicle customers in North America are unwilling to pay premium prices, limiting price and profitability.\n\nAs a result, the automaker is reevaluating its speed of investment in electric vehicles, though it is \"not moving away\" from its next generation of electric products, he said. But the company is \"going to be very thoughtful\" about balancing consumer demand and volumes produced.\n\nLawler estimated the delay of an estimated $12 billion in capital investments related to electric vehicle production. Ford is studying commitments in Michigan and Kentucky, assessing how best to move forward.\n\n\"When you look at the quarter, you can see the strength that's in there,\" Lawler said. \"It is the cost and quality that we need to continue working on. ... We're very focused on improving that but it's going to take us some time.\"\n\nThe raw numbers\n\nFord failed to beat Wall Street expectations with its third quarter earnings, showing revenue growth of 11% to $44 billion from the same period in 2022; a net income of $1.2 billion compared with a year-ago loss of $827 million, and EBIT of $2.2 billion.\n\nFord Blue again illustrates the company's ongoing strength with gas and hybrid vehicles, with higher revenue. Ford Model e reported 44% higher shipments of electric vehicles, 26% revenue growth and an operating loss \"exacerbated\" by electric vehicle price pressure, the company said in a news release. Ford withdrew its 2023 guidance with pending ratification of the tentative labor agreement with the UAW.\n\nThe company touted its success with commercial customers through its Ford Pro division, which generated $1.7 billion in (EBIT) on $13.8 billion in revenue, which was up 16%, Ford said in its news release.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley told industry analysts in a call that quarterly results are \"mixed\" as \"cost and quality remain a drag on the business.\" Recent hires and promotions are tasked with transforming industrial processes, he said.\n\n\"We’re ... radically changing how we work with a series of actions that put the right people with the right capabilities in the right places across the organization, so that our promise isn’t masked by cost and quality issues,\" Farley said in a news release.\n\nHe said holding Super Duty production for quality review cost the company more than $1 billion — but noted it was worth it.\n\nQuarterly earnings highlights\n\nFord reported in its earnings statement:\n\nCash flow from operations was $4.6 billion in the quarter, $12.4 billion through the first nine months of 2023.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow for the same periods was $1.2 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively.\n\nFord had $29 billion in cash and $51 billion in liquidity at the end of the third quarter. That included a $4 billion line of credit that the company secured in August in anticipation of business uncertainties.\n\nUAW deal pending\n\nThe UAW strike affected two weeks of the third quarter.\n\nFord reached a tentative agreement the day before earnings. It is the first automaker to do so during this 2023 contract period. Ford has sustained financial damage with the closure of the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Chicago Assembly Plant in Illinois and the Kentucky Truck Plant (KTP) in Louisville. The strike on the Detroit Three automakers began Sept. 15.\n\n\"Once KTP went down, the strike was living on borrowed time,\" said Marcus Hudson, Calderone Advisory Group's executive managing director who has automotive and manufacturing expertise. \"Hourly wages at Ford in North America are roughly $6 billion. ... A 30-day strike at KTP would cost $1.2 billion plus all the back pay the union would get. That’s more than the union is seeking in the first year.\"\n\nFord workers have left the picket line, awaiting review of the agreement prior to the union's ratification vote.\n\nThe cost to the company shouldn't be considered noncompetitive, Hudson said, because nonunion automakers tend to match hourly wages to keep members from organizing with unions and retain a skilled workforce that can be hard to find. Analysts will be watching to see whether auto suppliers that want to cut costs will take jobs to Mexico, Canada and China, he said.\n\nFord earnings pre-strike vs. post-strike\n\nLast quarter, Ford earnings beat Wall Street expectations by increasing revenue 12% to $45 billion from the same period in 2022; a net income of $1.9 billion, and EBIT of $3.8 billion.\n\nThe company touted its success with commercial customers through its Ford Pro division, which produced 22% revenue growth and EBIT that more than doubled to nearly $2.4 billion, Ford said in its news release.\n\nFarley compared the Ford Pro success to running a stand-alone company like John Deere. The gasoline-powered division known as Ford Blue generated $2.3 billion.\n\nGM bruised but fine\n\nGM reported earlier this week the UAW's ongoing strike cost it about $200 million in lost revenue in the third quarter from its Wentzville Assembly, Fairfax Assembly and Lansing Delta Township Assembly plants. The UAW is also striking 18 of GM's parts distribution centers across the nation. GM, too, was hit hard by costs associated with warranty repairs, as well as costs related to its self-driving Cruise subsidiary\n\nThe automaker reported a $2.2 billion gain in revenue to $44 billion compared with the year-ago quarter. But net income slid to $3.1 billion compared with $3.3 billion in the year-ago period. For the third quarter, GM reported that its EBIT fell 17% to $3.6 billion compared with $4.3 billion a year ago.\n\nMeanwhile, Stellantis will report its third-quarter shipments and revenue Oct. 31. Jeep plants and Chrysler, Ram, Jeep and Dodge parts warehouses have been on strike as contract negotiations continue.\n\nCaution from Wall Street\n\nJeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones, recommended on Oct. 12 that investors hold on purchasing Ford stock because of ongoing supply chain disruption, high costs associated with the company's \"weaker than average\" credit ratings that may hurt profits and investments, and the cost of spending on electric vehicles to meet stricter regulations on emissions and mileage. None of these things changed with the recent earnings report.\n\nOne of the concerns, in addition to getting factories up and running after being shut down, is getting 20,000 people back to work seamlessly, Lawler said. He noted that suppliers lost workers during the uncertainty and the supply chain has been directly affected in unpredictable ways.\n\nMore:Stellantis workers after 5 weeks on UAW strike: 'Enough is enough.

Wednesday, ending a five-week strike of the agriculture and construction machine maker.\n\nAbout 61% of voters approved the agreement, which includes boosts to hourly wages and retirement benefits. The company will also maintain the health insurance program, in which workers do not pay premiums.\n\nThe vote comes after the 10,100-member union rejected two previous contracts proposed by Deere and the UAW, setting off the first strike of the company since 1986.\n\n\"UAW John Deere members did not just unite themselves,\" UAW international President Ray Curry said in a statement. \"They seemed to unite the nation in a struggle for fairness in the workplace. We could not be more proud.\"\n\nAbout 61% of voters approved the latest agreement, according to UAW Local 450, which represents about 1,000 workers at the company's Ankeny plant. Workers had rejected two previous proposals over the last six months.\n\nThe local also announced that workers would return to their shifts beginning at 10:30 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nSince Oct. 14, about 10,100 workers in Iowa, Illinois, and Kansas had been on strike. The workers voted down previous six-year contract proposals on Oct. 10 and Nov. 2.\n\nAfter the first rejection, in which nine out of 10 members voted against the contract, the company doubled its wage offer to 10%, boosted retirement benefits and preserved the pension program it had previously planned to cut for new hires.\n\nAfter workers rejected that proposal, company and union officials met to hammer out another contract. The third deal was almost identical to the second, except Deere executives amended elements of the company's incentive program.\n\nUnion leaders hope the changes will make performance targets more attainable for employees, allowing them to earn bonuses in their weekly paychecks more quickly and often.\n\nRatification meetings across Iowa were more subdued Wednesday than they had been before the first two votes when some UAW members admonished union leaders for failing to extract more concession from the company.\n\nMore:UAW members weigh consequences as they consider whether to reject John Deere's third offer\n\nBig profits. Big concessions.\n\nThe strike came as Deere celebrated the prospect of record profits, with executives projecting in August that the company would earn $5.7-$5.9 billion for the fiscal year that ended Nov. 1 — a 62% bump over 2013 earnings, the company's previous record year.\n\nExecutives will reveal whether they actually hit those targets Nov. 24, when they host an investor call.\n\nJohn May, the company's CEO, earned $15.6 million in 2020, a 160% increase over his 2019 pay. The increase coincided with his promotion to the top spot, and was still lower than the $21.7 million that then-CEO Samuel Allen received the year before.\n\nMore:Iowa Poll: Majority of Iowans support Deere workers over the company as strike enters second month\n\nNevertheless, May's big pay bump was a rallying point among UAW members, with some displaying signs asking for their own 160% raise. Employees also said they were willing to hold out for more money because they had worked through the height of the pandemic, when some other companies slowed or halted production, and knew Deere was struggling to hire in a tight labor market.\n\nIn the first contract introduced in early October, Deere offered 5% and 6% pay increases and re-introduced quarterly cost-of-living adjustments, a feature of previous Deere-UAW contracts that the company had eliminated in 2015. Deere also offered workers $3,500 bonuses if they ratified the contract.\n\nThe company proposed a boost to the pension program that would have given a 25-year employee about $100 extra every month upon retirement. Deere also offered lump-sum payments of $20,000-$50,000 for workers when they retire, depending on their length of service. At the same time, the company proposed to eliminate the pension program for workers hired after Nov. 1.\n\nAfter members rejected the contract, Deere upped its offer. Employees would get 10% pay bumps and ratification bonuses of $8,500. The company also promised to preserve the pension program for future workers and boost payments to retiring employees, giving a 25-year worker about $250 extra every month.\n\nThe company threw in a second lump-sum payment for those workers: $2,000 for each year at the company as of 2021. Union leaders told employees that the money is supposed to pay for health insurance until they qualify for Medicare.\n\nUnder the contract approved Wednesday, workers on the lowest end of the pay grade, like those in foundry support, will see an hourly wage increase to $22.13 from $20.12. The skilled trades positions at the top of the pay grade, like electricians, will see hourly boosts to $33.05 from $30.04.\n\nMembers split on what to do\n\nOutside of the Palace Theatre at Adventureland Park, where Des Moines Works employees voted Wednesday, members were divided on whether to extend the strike.\n\nChuck Smith, a welder, declined to say which way he voted. But he told the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, that the company can afford to pay rank-and-file workers better, even though a Deere spokesperson said the company had \"economically exhausted\" its offers last week.\n\nMore:Timeline shows key dates in the John Deere strike\n\nSmith pointed out that even in 2015, a down year by Deere's standards, the company earned a profit of $1.9 billion. \"Look at what they're paying executives,\" he said. \"Look at what they're giving their CEO. It's corporate greed.\"\n\nBut Bob Loney, a maintenance welder, warned that workers may regret a longer strike. Loney has been with the company since before October 1997, when the union and Deere agreed to cut benefits and wages for new employees. That means he is in line for a better retirement plan than most employees at Des Moines Works.\n\n\"They're going to push too hard,\" he said of the co-workers voting against the contract. \"And Deere's going to push back harder.\"\n\nDustin Garland, a machinist on the company's cotton pickers, voted for the contract because he was pleased that Deere preserved the health insurance program in which he pays no premium.\n\nGarland picked up a part-time job at Amazon.com's Bondurant fulfillment center during the strike, a job he doesn't like as much as his work at Deere.\n\nForklift driver Randy Oldham, meanwhile, said he approved the contract Wednesday because he knows how miserable strike duty in December and January would be.\n\n\"I'm an old man,\" he said. \"And I don't want to be picketing in the cold.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2024/09/27/port-workers-strike-supply-chain-impact-higher-prices/75384739007/", "title": "Port strike would snarl supply chain, bring high holiday prices", "text": "Update: US port workers and operators reach a deal to end East Coast strike immediately on Oct. 3. Read more.\n\nAmericans could face high prices and shortages again this holiday season but this time, it would be because of a worker strike instead of a global pandemic.\n\nAs of Thursday, the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) said labor talks with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) remain at a standstill, and about 45,000 of its union workers at 36 East coast and Gulf Coast ports are ready to walk on Oct. 1 for the first time since 1977. The ILA is looking for higher wages and protections against automation.\n\nA strike could lead to shortages of certain items and boost prices for voters already frustrated with housing and food inflation, experts said. The ports handle about half of U.S. ocean imports, including food, clothing, auto parts, cars shipped via container and holiday toys, experts said.\n\n“A supply chain disruption would undoubtedly lead to price increases across the board and would impact consumers’ ability to find the toys they are looking for in the weeks and months ahead,” said Greg Ahearn, president and chief executive of The Toy Association.\n\nCapitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates\n\nDiversification didn’t work\n\nAfter clogged post-pandemic ports on the West Coast kept more than 150 container ships waiting to dock in February 2022, according to the Department of Transportation, companies began shipping more of their wares through the East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, experts said.\n\nSimultaneously, to cut their reliance on China, which was slow to reopen and faced more intense government scrutiny after the pandemic, companies began sourcing from different countries, especially southeast Asia, said Chris Tang, distinguished professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who specializes in supply chain management.\n\nMany companies shipping goods from southeast Asia use East Coast ports because they’re closer, he said.\n\n“Because of these changing dynamics, the East Coast (strike) impact is more pronounced,” Tang said.\n\nWhat products will be affected?\n\nAside from holiday goods, experts said other items that may experience shortages and higher prices include:\n\nSeafood, like cod fish from Iceland or Canada and shrimp from Thailand and Ecuador. “Those aren’t as easy to transport by train because they’re refrigerated and perishable,” Tang said. “And air ship is very expensive.”\n\nElectronics, like cell phones and computers, now come from southeast Asian nations like Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand instead of China and are routed through East Coast ports, Tang said.\n\nPharmaceuticals, although these are easier “to ship by air because they are a higher value product, but there could be drug shortages if negotiations can’t be settled within a month or so,” Tang said.\n\nCars and auto parts. The Port of Baltimore, Maryland, leads the nation in car shipments. European cars come through this port and may experience a shortage, experts said. Auto parts from Europe often pass through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, too.\n\nMachinery parts. The East Coast ports also surpass others in the U.S. in shipments of machinery, fabricated steel and precision instruments, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nBananas. Three-quarters of the nation’s bananas enter through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, said Jason Miller, interim chair of Michigan State University's department of supply chain management. “There is (zero) chance of shifting all these imports through the West Coast, and the low dollar value per unit of weight for bananas means putting them on planes isn’t economical,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post. “Moreover, you can’t frontload a perishable product.”\n\nCan companies reroute shipments?\n\nJonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy for the National Retail Federation trade group, said some companies prepared early by:\n\nTaking cargo in earlier than normal\n\nRerouting some shipments to West Coast ports\n\nHowever, those steps are limited. “Retailers can’t bring everything in,” he said.\n\nSome companies may face inventory space constraints, while perishable food products and other goods don’t have any good alternative routes, Tang said. The Panama Canal operations are recovering from droughts, Red Sea ships have been attacked by Houthi rebels, and the Cape of Good Hope takes much longer, he said.\n\nBesides, “given the long lead time for toy products, significant quantities are already in transit with shipping logistics having been in place for months,” Ahearn said. “This makes it extremely difficult to rework scheduled shipments or product already undefined to the U.S. market through the East Coast or Gulf ports.”\n\nFlashback:Black October is here: Transport delays, labor shortages slow supply chain as holiday shopping begins\n\nIf there’s a strike, length is important\n\nThe period that follows a strike can also be disruptive, some experts said.\n\n“It’s not just about shut down but also about the recovery period, and how long it takes to get things up back and running,” Gold said.\n\nGenerally, one strike day would take three to five days to catch up, and “the longer the strike goes, the more that’s compounded,” he said.\n\n“In 2002, when we had an 11-day lockout on the West Coast because of labor negotiations, that cost (the economy) a billion dollars a day and took six months to recover and get stuff out,” Gold said. “Trade is higher now than in 2002 so it could take even longer.”\n\nBack then, the Bush administration invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to force the ports to reopen. The Act allows the federal government to seek a court injunction against a strike to allow both parties to continue negotiations during an 80-day cooling off period.\n\nWill the Biden administration help?\n\nThe Biden administration has declined to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act. Instead, White House officials encouraged ongoing discussions despite pleas for help from retail, agriculture, commerce, auto care, toy and other groups for months.\n\n“It’s an election year so Biden may intervene to help (Democratic presidential nominee Kamala) Harris,” Tang said. “On the outside, he may not say it but behind the scenes, he might help negotiations because it’s important to Harris. Any chaos could affect the election.”\n\nCharacterizing US supply chains and the economy as \"more resilient than they were when we came into office,\" White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said, \"the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force is up and running – and is prepared to respond swiftly to help minimize potential disruptions in the event of a prolonged strike by engaging extensively with the ports, state and local officials, industry, labor, ocean carriers, rail and trucking companies.\"\n\nNo matter what, the story ends with higher prices\n\nIf port workers strike, Americans may see price increases soon, experts said.\n\nIf port workers agree to a deal, “labor costs go up,” Tang said. “So down the road, consumers still pay a higher price. Consumers will have to learn to adjust and adapt, but unfortunately, things will be more expensive.”\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Ford employs the most hourly workers in the United States and as a result pays more for health care. So any costs that GM negotiates in what is seen as a master contract with the Detroit Three directly impacts Ford disproportionately, labor analysts say.\n\nInitially, GM proposed raising the share of their health care costs that hourly workers pay from 3% to 15%, but the UAW screamed no way. The union argued that, for years, workers have conceded pay raises and other benefits to protect health care costs for workers in physically demanding jobs. GM has said that it has agreed to leave workers' share of health costs as they are, a big win for the union.\n\nThe autoworker insurance deal is among the best remaining in the country. The average worker today pays 28% of health care costs, the Center for Automotive Research says.\n\n“Health care is a major issue,” said Marick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University who specializes in labor management. “That is sacrosanct as far as the UAW is concerned. Any company that tries to make a significant change in health care to shift the cost to employees is inviting a strike.”\n\nWhile GM employs the most people in the United States among the Detroit Three, Ford has the most U.S. hourly workers of any automaker, foreign-owned or domestic. The UAW represents 46,000 GM workers, 55,400 Ford workers and 47,400 Fiat Chrysler workers, according to company websites.\n\nEach company makes billions in profits. All said prior to the contract talks that costs must be contained and health care was a high priority. Salaried workers at the companies, by comparison, pay much more. At GM, 33%. At Ford, 30%. At FCA, 35%.\n\nTemporary workers make up 7% to 10% of GM's workforce over the course of a year, accounting for about 4,100 workers at the end of 2018. Ford had about 3,400 temps at year's end, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles had 4,800, the UAW said. Temp workers don't get vision or dental benefits and have deductibles.\n\nFord and FCA include temp workers in their official hourly employee total. GM does not include temp workers in the tally posted on the company site. They are separated, which is why there's sometimes a discrepancy in GM strike worker totals.\n\n'More competitive'\n\nGM is entering week five of a national strike affecting 55 company sites in 10 states.\n\nAfter a contract with GM is ratified, the union will focus on negotiating a deal with the other two Detroit companies. One upside of being the target chosen by the labor union to go first during collective bargaining means GM sets the pattern for key issues such as wages, health care and temporary workers in the four-year contract.\n\nIn response to the probability of GM agreeing to hold worker health care costs flat, Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said, “We are focused on reaching a fair agreement with the UAW that allows Ford to be more competitive so we can continue to preserve and protect good-paying manufacturing jobs and maintain our track record of investing in our U.S. plants.\"\n\nWhile companies may tweak the contract to tailor it to their needs, deviating too much from the master deal raises the strike threat.\n\n“There are frequently changes after the pattern is set because ‘pattern’ does not mean three identical contracts, but it does mean basic principles are carried over,” said professor Harley Shaiken, a labor expert who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley. “Health care is a critical issue. I think you’ll see something similar to what takes place at GM. And it certainly affects Ford.”\n\n“They start far apart and move toward the middle and hope it’s where both sides can live with it,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of Industry, Labor & Economics at the Center for Automotive Research. \"But not every issue gets cut down the middle. Collective bargaining is the art of compromise. And compromise means you don’t get what you want but you get what you need.”\n\nAside from wages, health care is the biggest and most burdensome cost, Dziczek said.\n\n“Automakers estimate spending at about $1 billion a year on worker health care,” not including retirees, she said. “Cost increases are beyond anyone’s control. And despite being large purchasers of health care, the companies don’t have enough sway to move the market — to have pricing power or any control over the rising costs.”\n\nWith health care a top priority of the union and viewed as untouchable, it leaves less money for companies to negotiate for other things, industry observers noted.\n\n“They could be getting bigger wage gains and other benefits if they weren’t dedicating so much of their bargaining power to having no change in health care,” Dziczek said.\n\nBut one very important thing to remember, she said, is that each company has different pain points. Fiat Chrysler, for example, has a larger share of temporary workers than the other two. So changes to that policy will impact FCA more, since it pays the most workers $15-19 an hour with fewer benefits.\n\nFCA also has a larger share of permanent production workers hired after 2007, called “in-progression,” which means they made about $17 an hour to start, growing to $28 an hour after eight years. The UAW has said it wants to condense that timeline.\n\nSo-called \"legacy workers,\" people hired before 2007, earn $28-33 an hour. Skilled trades, about 15% of the Detroit Three workforce, earn $35-36 an hour plus overtime.\n\nOn Sept. 15, about 46,000 GM UAW members went on strike nationwide after GM made an offer to the union two hours before the 2015 contract expired at midnight Sept. 14. The talks continue.\n\nHealth care costs have been identified as an issue of concern for years.\n\nSince 2007, automakers have spent money studying how to improve health care outcomes and lower costs but changes have been limited.\n\n“This is an emotional benefit,” Dziczek said. “People don’t want to see any change.”\n\nBut some simple changes may yet be part of the package negotiated in 2019. Small actions, like making sure a family has a primary care doctor rather than just going to the emergency room can make a huge difference in cost. And active management of chronic conditions related to diabetes, asthma or heart health can save millions.\n\n\"You’d get better outcomes and save costs,” Dziczek said, wondering what kinds of small changes might be included in a tentative agreement apart from cost share. “We don’t know.”\n\nNot 'cookie cutter'\n\nEvery small change has the potential to free up money that workers want for other things.\n\nAnd any changes at the federal level may not be implemented before the next UAW contract expires in 2023, Dziczek noted.\n\nMost foreign-based automakers have considered Detroit 3 wages and benefits the UAW sets nationally, but in recent years some nonunion automakers have shifted to setting wages based on regional market rates, analysts noted. They cite a leaked 2006 Toyota memo that discussed needed wage reductions and suggested hiring more temporary workers to replace $25 an hour workers at Toyota plants in North America.\n\nProtecting health care costs can be used to effectively organize foreign-based company autoworkers in the future, Masters predicted. So this is a key strategy for the UAW if it's going to grow its manufacturing membership.\n\nTemp workers may go years with lower wages and fewer benefits, doing the same job as someone paid nearly twice as much. This has been a sticking point with UAW members.\n\n“All these issues, it’s all about the nuance, and both sides benefit from pattern bargaining, on wages and healthcare benefits and everything,\" Dziczek said. “Pattern is never a cookie cutter.”\n\nShe emphasized, “Anything that raises labor costs in the U.S. is going to affect Ford disproportionately.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, UAW leaders have said the union planned in the spring to start with Ford rather than GM, because Ford was viewed as a friendly negotiator that would be less likely to fight. Plant closings that, in the UAW's view, violated the union contract, and perceived arrogance from CEO Mary Barra made GM an easy target driven by anger.\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard at 313-222-6512 orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.

The work stoppage will affect every major U.S. cargo port from Maine to the Texas Gulf Coast – three dozen ports that handle around half the goods that reach America by sea, including up to three quarters of the nation's banana imports.\n\nThe scene at the Delaware port:'We sacrificed our families': The Wilmington port workers' strike has begun\n\n\"This is going down in history,\" ILA president Harold Daggett shouted in the early morning hours Tuesday in front of a crowd of striking New Jersey dockworkers, on a video posted to the union's Facebook account. Some workers carried signs that said \"Machines don't feed families.\"\n\nCapitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates\n\n\"Nothin's gonna move without us – nothing,\" Daggett said.\n\nThis is the first such strike on the East Coast since 1977, when an ILA strike jammed up cargo imports on the East Coast for 44 days.\n\nThe work stoppage comes after a long dispute between the longshoremen's union and port operator group The United States Maritime Alliance, over wages and the use of automation at the ports. Each side blamed the other for not negotiating in good faith.\n\nIn an American economy increasingly reliant on imported goods, a lasting strike could cost more than $500 million a day to the United States economy, according to an analysis by think tank The Conference Board. A lasting strike is expected to cause cost hikes in a country barely recovering from post-COVID inflation, and clot up the delivery of cars, electronics, pharmaceuticals, fresh produce and seafood, coffee, liquor, holiday toys and Ikea furniture.\n\nThe ILA has said its workers will continue handling military ship cargo, and that the strike would not affect cruise ships. For weeks as the strike deadline loomed, retailers and ports have scrambled to expedite shipments ahead of the busy holiday season.\n\nBut in the end, the deadline came and went. The ports are shut. The cargo will not move. The dockworkers are on strike. Here's what we know about the labor strike at the East Coast's largest ports.\n\nPrevious:East Coast port workers on verge of strike for first time in 47 years. What to know\n\nWhy are ILA workers striking?\n\nThe ILA has long signaled it was prepared to strike over a new contract, arguing that dockworkers who stepped up to work during the pandemic didn't see a fair share of port operators' windfall profits during the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic – and that their expiring contract didn't keep up with recent ballooning inflation.\n\n\"The last agreement between USMX and the ILA predates the COVID-19 pandemic and the severe inflation that happened,\" said Rutgers University professor and port labor expert William Brucher. \"So the value of the wage increases that they negotiated were worth much less.... In fact, you could argue that they've they've since fallen behind.\"\n\nWorkers at East Coast ports have said that they're ill-paid compared with a newer contract signed by their counterparts on the West Coast, represented by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. Under the West Coast contract, longshoremen top out at a reported base pay of nearly $55 an hour, compared with $39 an hour for East Coast employees, according to the contract set to expire Oct. 1.\n\nUnion president Daggett signaled his union had sought a $5 increase in hourly rate each year, over the six-year life of the contract.\n\nAnother sticking point is the use of new technology and automation, which union leaders fear would cost hours and jobs. Contract negotiations broke down in June over an automated port gate in Mobile, Alabama, that the union alleged had violated the current ILA agreement.\n\n\"We will never allow automation to come into our union and try to put us out of work as long as I’m alive,\" said union president Daggett in a July statement.\n\nUSMX filed a labor complaint in September saying the union refused to negotiate. The union said management refused to give them a fair offer.\n\nOn Monday morning, the final day of the union contract, ILA president Daggett said USMX was blocking the path to settlement by \"refusing ILA’s demands for a fair and decent contract and seems intent on causing a strike at all ports from Maine to Texas.\"\n\nThat strike has now arrived.\n\nHow long will a strike last? Will President Biden stop a port strike?\n\nThe union has signaled it's prepared to dig in for a fight. But both sides have a strong incentive to put an end to a labor strike, said Rutgers labor studies professor Brucher.\n\nOn the one hand, workers have a lot of leverage because of the size and power of the ILA to shut down cargo shipments across the Atlantic.\n\n\"The threat of consumer disruptions – and the disruptions to the operations of companies like Amazon, Walmart, Target, all of your major retailers – creates a lot of pressure on the shipping companies, constituted as USMX for purposes of bargaining, to substantially increase their offer,\" Brucher said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden helped the labor union's leverage by saying Sunday that he has no intention to interfere in contract negotiations by invoking the 1940s-era Taft-Hartley Act to mandate a \"cool-off period,\" Brucher said.\n\n\"Biden is, and I think this is without hyperbole, the most pro-labor president in decades – you could argue going back to Franklin Roosevelt, or if not Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy in the 1960s,\" Brucher said. \"So you know, the union's in a very strong position. And Biden is not indicating that he's going to reverse course.\"\n\n\"It’s collective bargaining. I don’t believe in Taft-Hartley,” the president said Sunday. His administration has urged both sides to come to an agreement.\n\nBut even if the union is in a strong negotiating position, workers also have a simple incentive to want a deal, Brucher noted: the state of their own finances as they go without work.\n\n\"A long work stoppage does drain resources. Workers do start to worry,\" Brucher said. \"Eventually they wonder if they're getting ahead.\"\n\nThe last ILA strike on the East Coast, in 1977, ended after 44 days. In 2002, President George W. Bush invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to halt a management lockout of West Coast port workers.\n\nPort operator Enstructure wrote last week they'd \"continue to provide support services for our customers until regular operations resume.\"\n\nWhat are the probable effects of an East Coast port strike?\n\nBroad swaths of the economy would be drastically snarled up by a lasting East Coast port strike, according to industry observers – particularly among holiday goods that have yet to arrive on these shores. The East Coast and Gulf ports handle more than half of the country's container volume, and a quarter of the United States' international trade overall.\n\nA one-week strike could cost as much $3.78 billion in fallout, according to think tank The Conference Board, amounting to $540 million per day.\n\n“A port strike would paralyze US trade and raise prices at a time when consumers and businesses are starting to feel relief from inflation,” wrote Conference Board economist Erin McLaughlin in an analysis released Monday.\n\nAside from holiday goods, experts said other items that may experience shortages and higher prices include:\n\nSeafood, like cod fish from Iceland or Canada and shrimp from Thailand and Ecuador. “Those aren’t as easy to transport by train because they’re refrigerated and perishable,\" UCLA professor and supply chain expert Chris Tang told USA TODAY on Friday.\n\nElectronics, like cell phones and computers, now come from Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand instead of China and are routed through East Coast ports, according to Tang.\n\nPharmaceuticals. Though air shipping is possible, drug shortages may result if negotiations can’t be settled within a month or so, Tang said.\n\nCars and auto parts. The Port of Baltimore leads the nation in car shipments. European cars come through this port and may experience a shortage, experts said. Auto parts from Europe often pass through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, too.\n\nMachinery parts. East Coast ports surpass others in the U.S. in shipments of machinery, fabricated steel and precision instruments, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nBananas. Three-quarters of the nation’s bananas enter through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, according to Michigan State University's Jason Miller. “There is (zero) chance of shifting all these imports through the West Coast, and the low dollar value per unit of weight for bananas means putting them on planes isn’t economical,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post. “Moreover, you can’t frontload a perishable product.”\n\nImported wine and liquor. Imported wine and spirits come largely from Europe, and flow through East Coast ports.

In a later statement, the union said it was ending the strike \"in the interests of the company and passengers.\"\n\nThe walkout, which began Sept. 15, was the longest in more than four decades initiated by pilots at Air France, union official Guillaume Schmid said. The 81-year-old company today conducts about 1,500 flights each day, and last year had 77.3 million passengers, making it one of Europe's biggest carriers.\n\nAir France, in its own statement, said service would \"progressively\" start returning to normal on Tuesday, meaning that flights already canceled between now and then won't be reinstated. The company hailed the end of the strike, saying it \"will have been costly and damaging. It has only lasted too long.\"\n\nAlexandre de Juniac, chairman and CEO of parent company Air France-KLM, said management team members \"are aware of the trauma that our customers, employees and partners just lived through,\" according to the statement. It said full service was likely to resume late this week.\n\nAt the center of the standoff are Air France's ambitions to develop a low-cost affiliate, Transavia, to tap into new markets in both France and elsewhere in Europe and better compete at a time when budget airlines have cut into the market share once dominated by giant European carriers like Air France.\n\nThe pilots union said it didn't oppose those plans to build the new business, but rejected the labor conditions that management had planned. They started the strike two weeks ago out of concerns that management was looking for a way to outsource their jobs to countries with lower taxes and labor costs.\n\nIn a tactical retreat, the carrier's management offered Wednesday to scrap a central part of the plan to shift most of its European operations to Transavia. But the pilots remained unsatisfied, saying the contracts sought for the low-cost carrier's operations in France alone were insufficient.\n\nAir France, in its statement, \"confirmed its decision to continue its accelerated development of Transavia in France, without delay\" - which suggested that issues remain unresolved. The carrier said it is sticking to plans to create 1,000 jobs in France through Transavia carrier, including 250 pilot positions.\n\nSeveral would-be passengers interviewed by The Associated Press expressed frustration and anger during the strike; some grumbled about the tendency of many French workers to strike — and snarl services in the process. Union official Schmid said pilots decided to end the strike because \"it was necessary to get out of the media pressure.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters Sunday, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said: \"This strike was misunderstood, it was corporatist. It was selfish.\"\n\n\"It inconvenienced hundreds of thousands — millions — of consumers. It inconvenienced other Air France staffers who made a number of sacrifices over the years. This strike costs a lot in terms of the company's image,\" he said. \"And it has left a trail of division, fracture within its ranks.\"\n\nAir France-KLM had said previously that the walkout cost up to 20 million euros ($25 million) a day, which could put the total financial bite as high as 300 million ($382 million), though Air France wasn't providing specifics yet. The French state holds a 16% share of the company, and appoints three board members, a spokeswoman said.\n\nValls, a Socialist, appeared to side with management, saying the Transavia plan was \"indispensable\" - and sought to parlay Air France's woes as a metaphor for France's need for reforms more broadly. Valls has been criticized on France's vocal political left in recent weeks for cozying up to business leaders amid the country's persistent economic slump.\n\n\"We are in a competitive universe, the low-cost one, and it needs to be faced with the proper weapons,\" Valls said. \"It shows our country needs reforms at every level, and it's true especially in the transportation sector.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/01/east-gulf-coast-strikes-economy-jobs/75455934007/", "title": "Port strike at East Coast, Gulf ports could upend economy for holidays", "text": "Update: US port workers and operators reach a deal to end East Coast strike immediately on Oct. 3. Read more.\n\nDockworkers at ports from Maine to Texas are officially on strike after the clock struck midnight with no new labor deal in hand.\n\nThirty-six East Coast and Gulf Coast ports shut down as 45,000 union workers walked off the job after labor negotiations over higher pay and protections against automation stalled between the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance, or USMX. The strike only exacerbates some temporary port closures in places like Florida, the Carolinas and Georgia in the wake of Hurricane Helene.\n\nThe ILA strike is the first at these ports since 1977 and has the potential to cost the economy up to $5 billion a day, upend holiday shopping for millions of Americans and dictate whether many small- and medium-size businesses and farmers turn a profit or lose money this year, experts said.\n\n“Every idle day that a ship does not get into the port costs money and sometimes a lot of money ... that ultimately gets passed onto consumers,” said Stamatis Tsantanis, chairman and chief executive of shipper Seanergy Maritime and United Maritime, in a statement.\n\nLength matters\n\nNow that the strike is on, experts will turn their focus to how long the strike may last. Each day of the strike could cost the economy up to $5 billion a day as imports and exports are blocked, some economists estimated.\n\n“It’s not just about the shutdown but also, about the recovery period and how long it takes to get things up back and running,” said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation.\n\nFor each day of the strike, it takes about three to five days to clear the backlog and resume normal operations, he said. “The longer it goes, the more it gets compounded,” he said.\n\nA port closure in 2002 went for 11 days before the Bush administration invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to force the ports to reopen. The Act allows the federal government to seek a court injunction against a strike to allow both parties to continue negotiations during an 80-day cooling off period. It took six months to recover from those 11 days, Gold said.\n\nDespite many industry groups calling for intervention, the Biden administration said it doesn’t intend to invoke Taft-Hartley. Instead, it encouraged continued negotiations and said in a statement that it would carefully monitor supply chain disruptions and “respond swiftly to help minimize potential disruptions in the event of a prolonged strike by engaging extensively with the ports, state and local officials, industry, labor, ocean carriers, rail and trucking companies.\"\n\nThe state of work in America: Sign up for USA TODAY's The Daily Money newsletter for exclusive financial content.\n\nWhat to expect:A port strike could cost the economy $5 billion per day, here's what it could mean for you\n\nWhat’s affected by the strike?\n\nImports: With about half of U.S. ocean imports passing through the East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, a wide range of products are affected, including produce, cars, auto and machinery parts, clothing, pharmaceuticals, wine and spirits, holiday goods like toys, and seafood, experts said.\n\n“Any strike that lasts more than one week could cause goods shortages for the holidays,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund. “Retailers are running lean currently so inventory would get drawn down, and prices of shipping, and goods prices would go vertical for a period of time. We could get the kind of inflation for 6 months similar to or worse than peak inflation levels a year ago.”\n\nSmall and medium-size businesses could suffer most, some said.\n\n“Large businesses with dedicated procurement departments and considerable access to capital have been preparing for this strike for some time and many have ordered excess materials which they were able to finance with lower-cost debt,” said Ben Johnston, chief operating officer at small business lender Kapitus.\n\n“Small businesses, however, are less likely to have been able to order early and in bulk and are less likely to obtain the capital required to order larger quantities of supplies in advance,” he said.\n\nExports: Businesses that sell products to international markets would suffer, experts said. For example, agricultural exporters of soybeans and poultry won’t be able to send their goods overseas and could end up losing market share, or worse, lose money because their goods are perishable, they said.\n\nJobs: Companies keeping lean inventories to keep costs low might have to shut down assembly lines amid a prolonged strike, for example, Gold said. This would come at a time when the job market is already cooling.\n\nWhat are port workers demanding?\n\nThe ILA is seeking a 61.5% pay increase over six years, according to CNBC. It also wants protections against automation.\n\n\"They (USMX) don’t care about us,\" said ILA President Harold Daggett in a post on Monday. \"They would love to see automation up and down the whole East and Gulf Coast, trust me when I tell you that if it was up to them, we would have no jobs.\"\n\nOn Monday, USMX said in a statement it had offered to increase wages by nearly 50%, triple employer contributions to employee retirement plans, \"strengthen our health care options, and retain the current language around automation and semi-automation.”\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

John Lawler, Ford chief financial officer, is scheduled to discuss the company's growth plan at the Barclays Global Automotive and Mobility Tech Conference later Thursday morning.\n\nFord did not specify how higher labor costs would impact consumer costs, but Ford spokesman Ian Thibodeau told the Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, that the cost is not simply transferred to the retail price.\n\nMeanwhile, the labor costs Ford revealed do not include details related to the contract negotiated this year with the Canadian union Unifor. That breakout data was not being released at this time, Thibodeau said.\n\nThe 120-year-old automaker withdrew its 2023 financial guidance in late October during the UAW strike of certain U.S. operations and now the company is providing updated financial expectations.\n\nFord said it anticipates full-year 2023 adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $10 billion to $10.5 billion. \"That would include $1.7 billion in strike-related lost profits — $1.6 billion of that from the fourth quarter — owing to interruptions in production of high-margin trucks and SUVs and, in turn, vehicle wholesales about 100,000 units lower than planned,\" Ford said in its release.\n\n\"Ford generated $4.9 billion of net income and $9.4 billion in adjusted EBIT through the first three quarters of the year, prior to full effects of the work stoppage,\" the company said.\n\nFull-year 2023 adjusted free cash flow is expected to be between $5 billion and $5.5 billion, Ford said.\n\nLawler plans to explain Thursday why Ford is optimistic about monetizing new services.\n\n“This industry is going through the biggest technology-led transformation we’ve ever seen and some companies, new and old, are going to be left behind,” Lawler said in the release. “Ford+ is the right strategy to win ‒ we’ve got a highly talented team that allocates capital with great discipline so that we’re executing with consistency, generating strong growth and profitability, and are less cyclical.”\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley has said previously the company is committed to electric vehicles but is pushing hard to provide hybrid vehicles to consumers apprehensive about the move away from gasoline-powered vehicles.\n\nGetting control of other costs\n\nWhile Ford has cautioned investors about the increase in labor costs, investors have expressed concern about the Dearborn automaker's warranty repair and recall costs that have diverted billions annually. Ford spends far more money than its competitors on what analysts have called unforced errors. Ford CEO Jim Farley has said he is focused on improving quality problems, having implemented new review processes and hiring new people to address the concern.\n\nThe targeted strike against Ford, General Motors and Stellantis began Sept. 15 and ended in late October. Ford was the first to reach a tentative agreement; Ford employees voted to ratify the historic contract in mid-November with 69.3% support.\n\nWhat's in the UAW contract\n\nThe Ford-UAW agreement includes: cumulatively raising the top wage by more than 30% to more than $40 an hour; raising the starting wage by 68%, to more than $28 an hour; and reinstating major benefits lost during the Great Recession, including cost-of-living allowances (COLA). The deal also kills different pay rates, or tiers, for workers and improves retirement benefits for current retirees, workers with pensions and those with 401K plans.\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain and UAW Vice President Chuck Browning posted a letter on the union website that said:\n\n\"Our lowest-paid members will see a 150% raise through this agreement. That’s not a typo. Temps hired this year at $16.67 will earn over $40 per hour in base wages by the end of this agreement, over $42 an hour with estimated COLA.\n\nLower-tiered members at Sterling Axle (in Sterling Heights) and Rawsonville (in Ypsilanti) will see immediate raises ranging from 53% to 88%. A member with three years' seniority at those facilities will, upon ratification, go from $18.96 to $35.58.\n\nWith COLA, by 2028, we’ll have a top rate of over $42 an hour for production, and over $50 for skilled trades, an over 30% raise. By the end of this agreement, our starting rate will be pushing $30 an hour with COLA.\"\n\nFord said it plans to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results and provide initial guidance about its financial expectations for full-year 2024, on Feb. 6.\n\nUAW COLA demands:UAW demands cost-of-living salary adjustment as Americans feel pinch of inflation\n\nGM impacted, too\n\nBy comparison, General Motors’ new labor costs would increase by $9.3 billion compared with 2019 contracts, GM spokesman Jim Cain told the Free Press on Thursday.\n\nThe $9.3 billion in additional costs through 2028 is for agreements with the UAW and Unifor, and translates to about $575 per vehicle over the life of the deals, he said. GM did not separate the costs, Cain told the Free Press.\n\nThe Detroit Three automakers employ more than 140,000 UAW members: about 57,000 at Ford, 46,000 at General Motors and 43,000 at Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler, Ram, Dodge and Fiat.\n\nThe UAW said this week it is currently working to organize 13 additional auto companies in the U.S.\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: 313-618-1034 or phoward@freepress.com.

A record of 9-0 would be unprecedented for Cleveland.\n\nHere are eight reasons for the scorching start:\n\n1. New Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson gets buy-in\n\nA honeymoon phase for coach Kenny Atkinson is not surprising, yet no one envisioned it being historically good. He is off to the best start ever for a new Cavs coach, and he's one of just four coaches in NBA history to go 8-0 in a first season with a team. Monty Williams (Pelicans, 2010-11), Flip Saunders (Detroit Pistons, 2005-06) and Larry Brown (Denver Nuggets, 1976-77) are the others.\n\nWhen a new coach takes control, there is a natural adjustment period as he incorporates his schemes and philosophies. The Cavs are learning Atkinson and vice versa, but they're simultaneously winning. He has received instant buy-in from the players.\n\n“Nobody on this team is stubborn,” small forward Isaac Okoro said. “We all want to learn. We all want to get better. We all want to get to the Finals, have a championship. So when Kenny came in, we were ears open, ready to learn, knowing that he's a great offensive coach.”\n\nAtkinson is encouraged by the Cavs' collective confidence and camaraderie, a benefit of inheriting a roster virtually identical to the one the Cleveland had last season when it advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals before falling 4-1 to the eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics. He likes the mental toughness his team showed during a stretch of eight games in 13 days.\n\n2. The new Cleveland Cavaliers offense is working\n\nAtkinson's offense has been a noticeable upgrade from what the Cavs had been running in previous seasons under the guidance of his predecessor, coach J.B. Bickerstaff.\n\nCavs players took to it right away. Atkinson observed them implementing the spacing prioritized in his system during open gyms this past summer. Increased pace, ball movement and 3-point shooting are other areas of emphasis they have embraced.\n\nAtkinson isn't satisfied, though. He wants improved offensive rebounding and off-ball screening. He doesn't want to rely heavily on pick-and-roll because physical defense in the postseason can shut it down to a large degree. Creating good offense no longer appears to be an uphill battle like it was at times in previous seasons.\n\nThe Cavs rank second in the NBA in both points per game (122.3) and offensive rating (121 points per 100 possessions).\n\n“The thing with basketball, when you touch the ball, you're having fun,” center Jarrett Allen said. “And this offense, everybody touches the ball. Everybody feels like they're contributing.”\n\nMore on Kenny Atkinson:New Cavs coach is a 'high energy' hoops addict, his former Golden State Warriors boss Steve Kerr says\n\n3. The Cavaliers are doubling down on defense\n\nBickerstaff gave the Cavs an excellent defensive blueprint during his four-plus seasons as their coach, and Atkinson has stressed the importance of maintaining it. The Cavs have tallied 10 or more steals in six of their eight games.\n\n“We're getting stops, we're turning teams over, we're playing with pace, we're getting in transition and we're getting easy baskets,” Okoro said.\n\nAtkinson estimated 60% of his first training camp with the Cavs focused on defense.\n\n“That's been our identity this past four years that I've been here, so I feel like that shouldn't change … with a new coach,” forward Evan Mobley said. “[Atkinson has] done a great job with definitely keeping that an emphasis and keeping us up to par on the defensive end.”\n\nThe Cavs are tied for eighth in the NBA in fewest points allowed per game (109.1) and rank fifth in defensive rating (108.3).\n\n4. The Cavs have a healthy core four\n\nThe “core four” formed by guards Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland, Allen and Mobley has been healthy. Each of them missed time last season with multiple injuries.\n\nMitchell leads the Cavs with 23.1 points per game on 48.3% shooting from the field (40.3% on 3-pointers). He's followed by Garland (20.5, 52.5%, 44.8% on 3s), Mobley (17.6, 53.8%, 40% on 3s) and Allen (15, 68.6%, no 3s attempted).\n\nAllen is the leading rebounder (11.6 per game), and Mobley (8.1) is next. Other team-high averages of note are held by Garland (6.5 assists), Mobley (1.8 blocked shots) and Mitchell (1.5 steals).\n\nAlthough the “core four” has been healthy, other Cavs have dealt with injuries.\n\nStarting small forward Max Strus suffered a sprained ankle before the season began is expected to be sidelined for at least four more weeks. His replacement in the starting lineup, Dean Wade, missed Monday's game with an illness, and key backup guard Caris LeVert has been sidelined the past two games with right knee soreness. Okoro started at small forward Monday.\n\n5. Cavs forward Evan Mobley continues to develop\n\nMobley is being used differently by Atkinson because the Cavs know unlocking the 7-footer's offensive potential is necessary for their championship aspirations to become realistic.\n\nMobley has been ordered to handle the ball more, push it down the court in transition and shoot more 3-pointers.\n\n“When you look at bigs in this league, it's just evolved, right?” Atkinson said. “Your traditional big, you're just putting him down on the block or playing playing him in pick-and-roll all the time. [Mobley] is more of a hybrid, kind of a wing big.”\n\nMore on Evan Mobley:Cavaliers believe young big man can break out in Kenny Atkinson's offense\n\n6. Cavaliers All-Star Donovan Mitchell continues to lead\n\nMitchell's “calm confidence” has been a guiding light for the Cavs, Atkinson said. If you saw his game-winning shot with 0.3 seconds left Saturday in Milwaukee, you know it came after the play nearly broke down twice. He's the reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week for a reason.\n\nBut immediately after Mitchell's heroic moment, he shouted out Okoro for diving to secure an offensive rebound and call timeout with 1:25 remaining. Mitchell contended he would not have had a chance to hit a clutch shot in the waning moments if not for Okoro's hustle. Mitchell empowering his supporting cast continues to be a pertinent theme.\n\n“That's just who Donovan is. He's selfless,” Okoro said. “He always wants to give credit to everybody else but himself. But he's the leader of his team. I mean, he's the engine. He starts us. So having a guy like that just gives us confidence. He's always willing to pass the ball up, willing to do the little things for us, too. So it gives guys like me, Caris, Dean, role guys, it just give us more confidence.”\n\nMitchell explained a group effort allowing the Cavs to prevail in a variety of ways is what stands out to him amid the 8-0 start.\n\n7. Cavs role players step up, especially with Max Strus injured\n\nLeVert has been vital off the bench, averaging 12 points on 61.4% shooting from the floor (52.4% on 3s), 4.3 assists, 1.8 rebounds and 1 steal.\n\nRounding out the 10 players who have received significant time in Atkinson's rotation are point guard Ty Jerome (9.4 points per game), guard Sam Merrill (7.8), Wade (6.9), forward Georges Niang (5.8) and Okoro (5).\n\nMore on Cavs depth:Cleveland Cavaliers bench being led by Caris LeVert and Ty Jerome\n\n8. Cavs receive some breaks early in their 2024-25 schedule\n\nThis isn't meant as a knock on what the Cavs have accomplished at this stage, but they have received some notable breaks with the schedule through the first eight games.\n\nThey beat the Toronto Raptors (2-6), Pistons (3-5) and Washington Wizards (2-4) before passing a tough test on the road against the New York Knicks (3-3).\n\nThen they defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (4-3), Orlando Magic (3-5) and the Bucks (1-6) twice.\n\nLike the Cavs, the Knicks, Lakers, Magic and Bucks were playoff teams last season.\n\nStill, the Cavs faced the Magic without Orlando's best player, All-Star forward Paolo Banchero (torn right oblique), and they had their Monday rematch against the Bucks without Milwaukee's top player, eight-time All-Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (strained right adductor). The Magic and Bucks missing those players would be akin to the Cavs missing Mitchell.\n\nThe bottom line is good teams routinely take care of business against inferior opponents. Cleveland has made a habit of it so far.\n\nAnd the scheduling conversation can't be had without giving the Cavs credit for twice winning the second game of a back-to-back on the road. It happened at Washington on Oct. 26 and at Milwaukee on Saturday.\n\nNate Ulrich can be reached at nulrich@thebeaconjournal.com.

He has 39 points tonight.\n\nWith 12.2 seconds left, Jarrett Allen put one off the glass and in to make it a 115-111 Cavs lead. After nearly an entire half of misses, Darius Garland almost single-handedly led the Cavs back.\n\nDame Lillard hits 3 to give Bucks the lead\n\nDame Lillard is just ice cold in crunch time. Lillard hit a step-back 3 from the corner to give the Bucks a 111-108 lead.\n\nDarius Garland followed with a layup to give him 36 points, making it a one-point score, before a huge backcourt violation call on Lillard gave the Cavs the ball again.\n\nDarius Garland gives Cavs the lead with layup; Cavaliers-Bucks score\n\nDarius Garland has had his best game of the season.\n\nAfter a transition layup to tie it, Garland just navigated through traffic and got a bucket to fall in the paint, and the Cavs have regained the lead, 108-106, with 2:19 to go.\n\nThis game's intensity picked up quickly.\n\nEvan Mobley somehow gets 2-and-1 over Brook Lopez to fall; Cavs tie Bucks late in fourth quarter\n\nEvan Mobley just pulled off a ridiculous 2-and-1, drawing the fall from Brook Lopez and also getting the basket to fall. Mobley then made the free throw to make it a 106-104 score. Mobley has had some highlight-reel plays tonight.\n\nAt the other end, a turnover led to a fast break, and a shifty Darius Garland layup has tied it 106-106.\n\nBucks lead Cavs midway through fourth quarter\n\nThe Cavs can't buy a bucket.\n\nMilwaukee leads 106-101, even briefly pulling away with Lillard off the floor.\n\nDarius Garland has hit the 30-point mark to keep the Cavs within shouting distance.\n\nBucks take the lead over Cavs entering fourth quarter\n\nThe Bucks have overtaken the Cavs. Pat Connoughton put in an easy layup in the closing seconds, the Bucks have the lead, 91-89, entering the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter a dynamite first half, the Cavs totaled only 16 points in an ice-cold third quarter, and it was just enough for Milwaukee to catch back up.\n\nCavs, Bucks score: Milwaukee comes back to tie Cleveland late in third quarter\n\nDame Lillard is a one-man wrecking crew right now.\n\nLillard is up to 31 points and seven assists, and as the Cavs raced to cover him, he found an open Brook Lopez for a 3 that tied it 86-86.\n\nIt's now 89-89 with 1:47 left in the third quarter. The Bucks have mounted a double-digit comeback, and it's a new game now.\n\nCavaliers-Bucks score: Milwaukee races back, cuts into Cleveland lead\n\nThe Bucks are making this one a game even without their star.\n\nNearing the midway point of the third quarter, the Bucks cut the Cavs lead to 81-76 before Georges Niang hit a key 3 from the corner to halt the momentum a bit.\n\nDame Lillard has a team-high 26 points, only bested by Darius Garland's 27. The Cavs offense has missed a few beats in this third quarter.\n\nCavs-Bucks score: Cleveland pours in 73 points in first half to lead Milwaukee\n\nThe Cavs offense is firing on all cylinders.\n\nDarius Garland has a game-high 22 points on 8-for-11 shooting from the floor, along with five assists. Evan Mobley has 14 points and three rebounds. Donovan Mitchell has 13 points. Jarrett Allen (six rebounds) and Sam Merrill both have 10 points.\n\nFor the Bucks, Dame Lillard has a team-high 17 points on 4-for-8 shooting.\n\nThe Cavs lead 73-60 at halftime.\n\nDarius Garland has 20-point first half; Cavs, Bucks score update\n\nDarius Garland nailed a 3-pointer with under three minutes to go, which gives him 22 points in this half along with five assists. It's been an exceptional half for him, and the Cavs lead the Bucks 71-53 late in the half.\n\nDonovan Mitchell dominated the first quarter, Evan Mobley took over in the second quarter and Darius Garland is now carrying the Cavs offense late in the first half.\n\nCavaliers-Bucks score: Evan Mobley has block, huge dunk in second quarter\n\nEvan Mobley has taken over the second quarter.\n\nMobley put together a nice inside move, which led to a dunk. The next time down the floor, he got a layup to fall. At the other end, he blocked a shot, ran down the floor and then threw down a thunderous dunk.\n\nAnd to cap it all off, Mobley shortly thereafter buried a 3-pointer from the elbow. He's got 14 points already, and the Cavs have pushed their lead out to 45-36.\n\nCavs lead Bucks 35-31 at the end of the first quarter\n\nThe Bucks took their first lead of the game when Andre Jackson Jr. made a 3-pointer with 31 seconds left in the first quarter.\n\nHowever, the Cavs quickly countered. Donovan Mitchell made a 3-pointer with 12 seconds remaining, and fellow guard Ty Jerome recorded a steal off Damian Lillard and a layup to give the Cavs a 35-31 lead at the end of the first quarter.\n\nMitchell led the Cavs with 13 points through one quarter.\n\nBucks' 3-pointer barrage reduces Cavs' lead to 28-24 with 2:09 left in the first quarter\n\nThe Bucks trailed by 12 points after Cavs point guard Darius Garland used a nifty drive, pump fake and pivot for a layup against Andre Jackson Jr.\n\nHowever, the Bucks fired back with 3-pointers on four consecutive possessions to cut the Cavs' lead to 28-24 with 2:09 remaining in the first quarter. Pat Connaughton and Lillard each made a 3-pointer, and AJ Green made two during the sequence.\n\nCavs jump out to 16-8 lead vs. Bucks\n\nMitchell and Garland each started the game 2-of-3 from 3-point range. Mitchell had eight points and Garland six to help the Cavs jump out to a 16-8 lead with 7:59 left in the opening quarter.\n\nWith a tick under eight minutes left in the first quarter, forward Evan Mobley made a layup but then missed a free throw as the Cavs led by eight points.\n\nBelow is some pregame information.\n\nBucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo ruled out Monday night vs. Cavs\n\nBucks eight-time All-Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (strained right adductor) won't face the Cavs on Monday night, Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers told reporters during his pregame media availability.\n\nMax Strus injury; Cavs injury report\n\nMax Strus is set to miss at least six weeks with an ankle injury. Dean Wade has been in the starting lineup in Strus' place at small forward. However, Wade (illness) and guard Caris LeVert (right knee soreness) have been ruled out for Monday night's game. With Strus and Wade sidelined, Isaac Okoro started at small forward.\n\nThe Cavaliers bench has been outstanding, particularly LeVert, and a huge reason behind Cleveland's red-hot start.\n\nHow can I watch/stream/listen to Cavs-Bucks game?\n\nMonday night's game can be watched on the FanDuel Sports Network and NBA TV. It's being broadcast over the radio on WMMS 100.7 and WTAM 1100.\n\nBronny James returns to Northeast Ohio, talks about school days, Swensons\n\nLeBron's son and Los Angeles Lakers rookie Bronny made his return to Northeast Ohio on Oct. 30 against the Cavs. Ahead of Cleveland's win over LA, Bronny reminisced about his days at Old Trail School and even weighed in on his go-to Swensons order.\n\nBronny's return:'Real special': Bronny James eager for dual homecoming with LeBron James in Lakers vs Cavs", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2022/11/05/bucks-vs-timberwolves-at-the-target-center-game-score-updates-november-4-2022/69619156007/", "title": "Giannis' triple double leads Bucks to best start in franchise history", "text": "MINNEAPOLIS – Records continue to be set in the Mike Budenholzer and Giannis Antetokounmpo era in Milwaukee, the latest being the mark for the best start in the 55-year history of the franchise with a 115-102 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves Friday night at the Target Center.\n\nThe Bucks are now 8-0, and remain the only unbeaten team in the NBA.\n\nAntetokounmpo recorded the 30th triple-double of his career with a 26-point, 13-rebound, 11-assist effort and Jrue Holiday added 29 points, eight rebounds and six assists. The Bucks were 17 for 38 (44.7%) from behind the three-point line.\n\nWhile winning eight straight might not feel that unique since Budenholzer took over in 2018 – it’s the fifth time the Bucks have done that – doing it to start a season is.\n\n\"Great to be a part of it, for sure,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"You can never take it for granted. I'm very, very happy to be a part of it and being able to have a team that we're able to start the season 8-0. But at the end of the day I'm happy that we are building good habits.\n\nAll things Bucks: Latest Milwaukee Bucks news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\n\"I've talked about this in the past and I'm going to keep talking about it: 8-0 is great. But like, I'm just proud of how the team is playing and how we're defending together, how we're moving the ball, how we're getting open shots, how we're being unselfish and how we're building good habits and hopefully, you know, those habits can carry over to the next game (Saturday) and the 74 games that we have left, plus playoffs.\"\n\nBobby Portis said there is no satisfaction in the accomplishment because it would imply settling, and Mike Budenholzer smiled and said, \"I think we just want to keep playing. Maybe we can keep it going so you can keep asking me (about it).\"\n\nBut, this team climbed over the 1970-71 and 2018-19 squads for the best start to a season, and both of those teams are just two of the five to ever win at least 60 games in franchise history. The Bucks are also just the 31st team in league history to start at league at least 8-0.\n\n\"That's awesome,\" said Wesley Matthews. \"Obviously you play every game trying to win it and so far we've been able to do that. Keep playing the right way, keep building on all our wins, keep building on good habits, learn from things we need to correct and look forward to the next one.\n\n\"I think one of the biggest things is we're able to flush the game that we just had and get ready to go into the next one. We've got a young team, a team that is playing fearless and has got good defenders, great youth, they've got scoring, so we're going to have our hands cut out for us (Saturday) especially after a late game, late travel. But hey, it's the NBA, gotta love it.\"\n\nAdded Jrue Holiday: \"Starting out with that confidence, I feel like we're building the right habits, playing the right way, winning in different ways, if it's blowouts, close games or fighting back, grimy games. It feels good to be 8-0.\"\n\nThe team record for consecutive regular season wins is 20, set in the 1970-71 championship-winning season.\n\nThe record for consecutive wins to start a season is 24, set by the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors. They are also the last team to start a year with eight straight wins.\n\nBattle of the bigs vs. Rudy Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns\n\nMinnesota made the biggest acquisition of the offseason in trading four players, first-round pick Walker Kessler, four future first-round picks and one first-round pick swap to the Utah Jazz for center Rudy Gobert. The Timberwolves believed the three-time Defensive Player of the Year can team with Karl-Anthony Towns to create mismatches and form a formidable pair on both ends of the court.\n\nIt’s been a slow go for the 7-foot duo, and the Timberwolves, as they adjust to one another. But if there is an example they’d like to follow it was across the court from them in the Bucks’ own 7-footers in Brook Lopez and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Since Lopez’s arrival in 2018, the Bucks have featured the pair as one of the best offensive and defensive teams in the league.\n\nGobert and Lopez are imposing shot blockers, but while Lopez adjusted his offensive game to include a reliable three-point shot Gobert remains a “traditional” big in the post. Towns and Antetokounmpo are different as well, as Minnesota’s three-time all-star is a career 39.6% shooter from behind the three-point line whereas Antetokounmpo is a tornado in the paint. And Antetokounmpo is, of course, a former Defensive Player of the Year.\n\n\"It was going to be physical,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Obviously, you're going to the defensive rebound, big bodies, you gotta box 'em out, you gotta keep 'em out of the paint. But I think, you always have effort. No matter what we do offensively, defensively our effort is high. Being able to box out, being able to defend, being able to get deflections, being able to jump vertical to get some blocks, it's always going to be there. I think Bobby and Brook and everybody did a great job just in keeping those guys -- not only those guys, the three-mans -- (Anthony Edwards) wanted to get in the paint. Everybody was aggressive to score and I think everybody did a good job just trying to make it as tough as possible for them in the paint.\"\n\nThe four shared the court Friday night, and it felt every bit like the heavyweight fight it appeared to be on paper. Rudy Gobert didn’t score in the first half and attempted just two shots. Lopez was just 1 for 3 in the half, as the two big men quite literally beat on one another inside. Antetokounmpo was just 2 for 5 but scored 12 points thanks to a 7-for-8 effort from the free throw line while Towns scored 12 on 5-of-10 shooting.\n\nMinnesota tried to get Gobert more involved offensively to start the second half, but he was never a factor on that end, finishing with seven points on six shots. He even resorted to taking a three-pointer, just his second of the season, which hit nothing. Lopez came into the game averaging 14.7 points per game – his highest number since 2016-17 – but he finished with seven on 2-of-6 shooting.\n\n\"It's a huge challenge,\" Budenholzer said. \"Those are two of the best bigs in the league paired together, so I thought the effort and the focus on the boards, keeping Towns off the free throw line is important. Just trying to make them earn everything, make it hard on them. Between Bobby, Brook and Giannis; but the guards are getting back in there and helping on the boards and doing things too so, it feels like a very positive team effort against those two guys.\"\n\nBut while the Bucks kept up the heat on Towns, who scored 22 points on 19 shots before fouling out with 1:54 to go in the game, Antetokounmpo took off in the fourth quarter. He scored nine points in about a two-minute stretch to end a Timberwolves rally and stretch a 97-89 Bucks lead to 108-91. Minnesota pulled its starters with 1:26 to go, trailing 111-99.\n\nAnd this isn't to discount the work 6-10 Portis did, either, for the Bucks. He would sub for Lopez or Antetokounmpo and scored 18 points on 7-of-14 shooting and pulled in eight rebounds while handing out five assists. He also was on the floor with his teammates to finish the Timberwolves out. The partisan crowd certainly noticed, as Fiserv Forum-like chants of \"Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!\" rang through the stadium at times – especially when he and Towns were hit with double technical fouls.\n\n\"Space 'em out, shoot the ball, spread 'em out,\" Portis said of trying to get Gobert and Towns moving. \"Make 'em come out to the three-point line, get 'em out the out the rim, get 'em out the paint, put some pressure on the rim to give (Antetokounmpo) driving lanes, get to the rim, bring Rudy out of the paint, stretch 'em out.\"\n\nDid you notice rookie MarJon Beauchamp?\n\nBeauchamp provided a lift off the bench for the Bucks, scoring 14 points on 6-of-10 shooting and pulling down five rebounds. He had some mistakes, as one might expect in just his fifth game of the season, but he stepped into two corner three-pointers and contributed two strong finishes at the basket in the fourth quarter to help the Bucks stave off a late flourish by the Timberwolves. He also drew Towns' fifth personal foul with 5:39 to go in the game.\n\n\"It feels good,\" he said. \"I feel like I'm getting more comfortable with the team and what my job is to do. Yeah, it felt good. I just gotta keep going and keep learning.\"\n\nMore:The Bucks are on the verge of history but remaining focused on the process of winning\n\nMore:Milwaukee Bucks' Grayson Allen picks up shooting tips from viral Internet star\n\nPat Connaughton trying to be patient with calf injury\n\nThe Bucks have been without key bench player Pat Connaughton due to a right calf strain. He missed the team’s preseason game in Chicago on Oct. 11 with the injury, and on Oct. 16 the team said it anticipated him being out about three weeks.\n\nThe three-week mark is Sunday but head coach Mike Budenholzer said earlier in the week Connaughton might need some five-on-five work before he can return to action but nothing had been set yet.\n\nThe team heads out on its first extended road trip of the season Nov. 6-12.\n\n“I’d say it’s a unique injury for me because usually when I have an injury, I just fight through it,” Connaughton said Friday night. “I’d argue the reason this injury became an injury is because I tried to fight through it, right? And so for me, I gotta be careful on when I start feeling good not trying to fight through it again. The goal is to obviously make sure it doesn’t linger for the whole year. I’ve been feeling really good. Sometimes try to push it to where it comes up sore the next day.\n\n“The best way to describe it is, they want my right calf to feel like my left calf a.k.a feel like nothing. And unfortunately it hasn’t felt like nothing in certain instances. What I’ve realized is a lot of it is because I play so much on my toes and I do so many explosive things it’s not just about getting the injury to be healed; instead (it’s) about introducing the strength with that explosiveness and the force that’s going to be put through that same muscle 700 times a night. So, it’s a little frustrating for me to be honest, as far as the amount of time it’s taken. But I’m trying to have the point of view of, what I’m being told, not to push too hard so that it’s something I’ve got to deal with the next three months on and off.”\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo appears on injury report with knee soreness\n\nThe day before heading to Minneapolis, Antetokounmpo popped up on the injury report for the first time this season with left knee soreness. He managed soreness in that knee in the early part of last season.\n\n“There’s a ton of experience and historical (data); I mean you’re always still very concerned and you don’t want to assume anything,\" Budenholzer said pregame. “He understands that there’s a lot of things he’s got to do to kind of try and do everything he can to keep the knees healthy.\n\n\"The medical group does an amazing job of trying to do preventive (work) and if it gets to where it is bothering him there’s other things they do. So certainly, we’ve been down this path with him but you always gotta be very diligent and do the work. He’s incredible with how he works and the medical group is equally as incredible and so we do our best to keep him as close to – I don’t know that any NBA players are 100% after probably the first day of training camp – but to keep him close.”\n\nDuring his warmup routine on Wednesday before playing Detroit, Antetokounmpo paused the workout and held the knee for a moment before resuming. He would flex the leg later in the warmup and during his 32-point effort against the Pistons.\n\n5 numbers\n\n0: Points that Gobert had at halftime.\n\n6: Consecutive games Antetokounmpo had scored 30 or more points heading into Friday night, matching a career-high. That came to an end when he scored 26 on 7-of-17 shooting. He was just 10 for 20 from the free throw line.\n\n9:10: Tip-off Friday night, the Bucks’ latest start to date. Before heading to the West Coast in February, the Bucks will play three games in the 9 p.m. hour in the Central Time zone. The next one is in Dallas on Dec. 9.\n\n30: Career regular season triple-doubles for Antetokounmpo after Friday night's game. He is alone in 17th place in NBA history. He had been tied with Grant Hill.\n\n\"He picked his spots well,\" Budenholzer said of his star. \"I thought he played with the pass. I thought there was a lot of bodies in the paint, they were throwing a lot of people at him and he was generating a lot of great looks for us. Then he got a little bit more aggressive, got to the free throw line a lot, kind of kept us in a good place to close out the game.\"\n\n50: Percent the Bucks had shot from behind the three-point line deep into the third quarter (15-for-30), helping them run out to a 22-point lead in the quarter. They finished with a season-high 17 made threes on 38 attempts, which was a season-best percentage (44.7%).\n\n\"I think all the shots that we've been taking have been good shots,\" Holiday said. \"Just staying consistent. Going through the season there's going to be lulls, but I think you stay in there, the way Giannis plays we get these wide open shots, man. They're gonna fall.\"\n\nPlay of the game was a collective rebounding effort by the Bucks\n\nIn the box score, Lopez collected a defensive rebound on a missed Gobert shot, and then Lopez hit a three-pointer coming down on the other end for a 74-58 lead with 8:05 to go in the third quarter. But it was so much more than that, and indicative of the collective effort the Bucks made in overwhelming the Timberwolves inside. Gobert was pestered into missing the layup, and then Grayson Allen and Holiday fought him for the rebound. Holiday actually saved it to Lopez. Then, pushing back the other way, the Bucks shared the ball to find the best shot — which would be their 14th of the game to that point.\n\nVideo of the game is Jrue Holiday's no-look pass to Bobby Portis\n\nAbout halfway through the second quarter, Bobby Portis missed a contested 12-footer in front of the Timberwolves bench, but Lopez tapped the ball out to Holiday. He collected it for a moment and Minnesota forgot about Portis, who was picking himself off the ground. Portis cut to the basket and Holiday made sure it looked good by looking off the defense and delivering the eyes-free assist.\n\nWho do the Bucks play next?\n\nThe Bucks headed right to the airport late Friday night to get home as they play the Oklahoma City Thunder (4-4) Saturday at Fiserv Forum at 7 p.m. The eternally rebuilding Thunder is led by 24-year-old guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and had won four straight before losing to Denver on Thursday night.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/grizzlies/2022/04/12/memphis-grizzlies-franchise-records-2022-set-during-historic-regular-season-nba-playoffs/7287556001/", "title": "All the Memphis Grizzlies records set in a dominant 2022 NBA season", "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies weren't just the most exciting team in the NBA in 2022.

Nonetheless, these Lakers have offered promising signs they can hoist their 17th NBA championship trophy and their first since 2010.\n\nLeBron James and Anthony Davis have been the NBA’s most dominant duo so far. The team has also found role players to fill nearly every need, including 3-point shooting (Danny Green), defense (Avery Bradley) and playmaking (Rajon Rondo, Alex Caruso). The team has leaned on a head coach (Frank Vogel) that has earned his star players’ respect because of his preparation.\n\nBecause of this cast, the Lakers entered the season expecting to be a championship contender after missing the playoffs for six consecutive seasons during the worst stretch in franchise history. Yet, the team did not think it would go this smooth.\n\nThe Lakers went 14-1 in November, their best record in a month since going 15-1 in March 2000, three months before Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant won their first of three NBA titles together.\n\nIt seems unrealistic the Lakers can top their NBA-record 33-game winning streak from 1971-72. Not even the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors, 2013-14 Miami Heat or 1995-96 Chicago Bulls could surpass that feat. And as with most teams in this load-management era, the Lakers will prioritize maximizing health over chasing regular-season records.\n\nMore:Where does Anthony Davis rank among MVP contenders? Will Cavaliers trade Kevin Love?\n\nNonetheless, the Lakers have outlined a blueprint on how to excel with their star talent while minimizing the drama that often comes with it.\n\nJames has averaged 25.8 points and a league-leading 10.8 assists, and is hungry to return to the playoffs after missing last season for the first time since 2006. And Davis has averaged 27.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.6 blocks in his first season with the Lakers. Together they have early signs they can become an even better pairing than James had with Dwyane Wade in Miami and Kyrie Irving in Cleveland.\n\nLike during his first season with Wade, James has mostly deferred to Davis on offense. Unlike his first season with Wade, James has maintained his hierarchy as the team’s leader. Like during his time together with Irving, James and Davis give opponents fits because it becomes impossible to contain both of them. Unlike during his time together with Irving, James and Davis have not clashed at all.\n\nTheir supporting cast has also offered the best version of themselves. Green has help propel the Lakers in 3-point shooting percentage from 29th last season (33.3%) to fifth (37.1%). Seven years after his disastrous lone season here , Dwight Howard has become the only player in the NBA to average at least seven rebounds while playing fewer than 20 minutes per night. Even with previous injuries to Kyle Kuzma, Bradley and Rondo, James, Davis and their supporting cast have filled in the gaps nicely.\n\nThe Lakers have done all of this under Vogel, who has navigated some anticipated speed bumps. Though the Lakers hired Vogel after passing on James’ preferred candidate (former Cavs coach Ty Lue), James has bought into Vogel much quicker than it took with Miami’s Erik Spoelstra and Cleveland’s David Blatt. After accepting the Lakers’ suggestion on having Jason Kidd and Lionel Hollins as lead assistants, Vogel has leaned on their expertise instead of becoming threatened they could take his seat. Instead of just rolling out the ball for his talented players, Vogel has also convinced his players to buy in with defensive effort.\n\nThe result: the Lakers are off to their best start in over three decades.

Detroit is 2-19 and on an active 18-game losing streak, the longest in franchise history, through the first 21 games, which equates to a little over a quarter of the schedule.\n\nIf they play the rest of the season on their current pace, Detroit would finish with an 8-74 record, passing the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers, who went 9-73. The Pistons would join that 76ers team as the only NBA teams ever to finish with single-digit wins over the course of an 82-game regular season.\n\nJUST NEED TO BE BETTER:Detroit Pistons need more 'fight' and 'anger' to end embarrassing skid; 'look in the mirror'\n\nThe Pistons are also on pace for the worst winning percentage in NBA history, winning just 9.5% of their games so far.

Since then, the Pistons have dropped games in every way imaginable, from collapsing and surrendering a lead late to being blown off the court due to effort issues.\n\nMental mistakes and effort are the two biggest issues new head coach Monty Williams said he is working to fix. Williams has tinkered with the lineups in search of new answers to snap the skid, but nothing has worked yet. He said after the loss last night he will start shortening the rotation and hinted at more opportunity for Jaden Ivey, who has been primarily used off the bench to this point.\n\nA big factor in the historically bad start has been injuries. Bojan Bogdanovic returned to the lineup Saturday and played the last two games, which led to more competitive contests, but Detroit still lost both games. Both of Detroit's free agent acquisitions from the summer, Monte Morris and Joe Harris, have either missed most or the entire season so far due to injuries.\n\nGAME RECAP:Detroit Pistons go cold late, fall to Memphis Grizzlies, 116-102, for 18th straight loss\n\nMorris hasn't played yet this season because of a right quad strain and will continue to be out for weeks. Harris played in the first seven games but has been out since with a right shoulder sprain, and the team has yet to provide an update on his timetable to return.\n\nYes, the disastrous start has the Pistons sitting at the very bottom of the NBA rankings, but they have competition for the worst record in the NBA this season. The Washington Wizards and San Antonio Spurs are both 3-17, 1½ games ahead of Detroit, and have dealt with their own disheartening losing streaks. The Wizards have lost 12 of their last 13 games, with the only win coming over the Pistons, and the Spurs have lost 15 straight games and have a league-worst -11.9 net rating, despite drafting one of the most heralded prospects in league history, Victor Wembanyama.\n\nDespite the worst-possible start, sources with the team told the Detroit Free Press that Pistons ownership is reluctant to hit the panic button and make a snap decision like making changes in the front office and will give time to the roster to find its footing with a majority of the season still ahead.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/columnist/jeff-zillgitt/2024/05/28/boston-celtics-chasing-record-setting-18th-title-nba-finals/73874288007/", "title": "Boston Celtics chasing record-setting 18th title in NBA Finals", "text": "Four.\n\nEighteen.\n\nThose are the two numbers on which the Boston Celtics are focused.\n\nFour more victories earn the Celtics their 18th NBA championship which would break a tie with the Los Angeles Lakers for most in league history.\n\nThe Celtics are in the NBA Finals for the first time since losing to the Golden State Warriors in 2022 and are trying to win the franchise’s first title since 2008. This is the second-longest stretch in team history without a championship, short of the title-less window between 1987 and 2007.\n\nThis Finals appearance is made possible by a strong effort in the Eastern Conference playoffs, eliminating Miami in five games, Cleveland in five games and Indiana in four games. Boston finished off the Indiana Pacers with a 105-102 victory in Game 4 on Monday.\n\nIndiana was in three of the four games, but Boston had too much offense and too much defense in the final minutes. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum were fantastic, Derrick White and Jrue Holiday form the best two-way backcourt in the league and Al Horford, starting for the injured Kristaps Porzingis, is experienced and reliable.\n\nThe Celtics are 12-2 in the postseason and have won seven consecutive games, and 11 of 12 in the playoffs. They have handled business despite a hiccup or two.\n\nBut this is where the Celtics were supposed to be. They are the No. 1 seed in the East, finished with a league-best 64 victories and they were expected to be in this position.\n\nOf course, getting to the Finals is simply not enough, not for the franchise and not for this team. \"I don’t know if celebrate is the right word,\" White said after eliminating the Pacers.\n\nHe’s right. For this team, winning the East is just a step.\n\nThrough various ownership groups, the Celtics are committed to contending. This ownership group, led by Wyc Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca, are invested. Owners have given president of basketball operations Brad Stevens room to maneuver via trades and money to spend, and Stevens has assembled a team that finished with the NBA’s best regular-season record at 64-18 and have the best starting five in the league when Kristaps Porzingis (injured calf but expected back soon) is in the lineup.\n\nJayson Tatum made All-NBA this season, Jaylen Brown made it last season and was named Eastern Conference finals MVP and Holiday and White were All-Defensive selections this season.\n\nThis is Boston’s reality: anything short of a championship will be a disappointment.\n\n\"Our mindset is very clear,\" Horford said. \"We need to finish.\"\n\nThe Celtics will play either the Dallas Mavericks or Minnesota Timberwolves in the Finals, and the Mavs are the likely opponent given their 3-0 series lead.\n\nSince Brown was drafted in 2016 and Tatum in 2017, the Celtics have reached the conference finals six times, including this season. In the five previous conference finals, they caught the Cleveland Cavaliers LeBron James 2.0 in 2017 and 2018, lost to the Heat in the grueling 2020 Orlando bubble, got to the Finals in 2022 and lost to Miami last season. They also lost to Milwaukee in the second round in 2019 and Brooklyn in the first round in 2021.\n\nThey’ve been through different coaches. First Brad Stevens, then Ime Udoka and now Joe Mazzulla. When Stevens moved to the front office, he has tinkered with the roster. The White, Holiday and Porzingis acquisitions made the Celtics even better.\n\nFinishing the deal has been a problem, and it’s a narrative that has built and built and now envelops this team. It’s not easy. Great teams and great players have fallen short.\n\nThis is the Celtics’ best, most talented team of the past eight seasons. Do they have what it takes to win an NBA title?

New president of basketball operations Trajan Langdon and the remade front office will be tasked with righting the ship for the young team built around former top pick Cade Cunningham.\n\nThe 2024 draft class doesn't have a headlining prospect like Victor Wembanyama last year as the clear crown jewel of the draft there for the Atlanta Hawks, who hold the No. 1 pick, and the class is generally seen as weak compared to past years.\n\nHere is a look at what the latest mock drafts say the Pistons will do just hours before the draft begins.\n\nTHE DECISION:5 players in 2024 NBA draft who fit Trajan Langdon's vision for Pistons\n\nAll things Pistons: Latest Detroit Pistons news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nDetroit Free Press: C Donovan Clingan, UConn\n\nThe Free Press' Pistons expert Omari Sankofa II has the Pistons selecting championship center Donovan Clingan, viewed as the top rim protector in the class, with the No. 5 pick. The 7 feet 3 center with a 7-7 wingspan would provide competition for the starting role at center with Jalen Duren, while elevating the team's defense.\n\n\"Langdon has hinted the team is likely to trade down, should the right opportunity present itself,\" Sankofa wrote. Should they land and then keep Clingan, a positional battle would play out between him and Jalen Duren, who is entering his third season after averaging a double-double last season. After a 14-win season, the Pistons should feel comfortable allowing the best player to earn the starting job.\"\n\nUSA TODAY: F Cody Williams, Colorado\n\nUSA TODAY's Jeff Zillgitt has the Pistons taking a swing on Cody Williams at five. Williams, the younger brother of current Thunder standout Jalen Williams, is just 19 and has the potential to slot into the 3-and-D role largely absent from the Pistons last season. Cody Williams shot over 40% from 3 in his lone college season but on just 1.7 attempts per game and has a wingspan over seven feet.\n\n\"Williams’ perimeter defense and scoring ability make him a prime candidate for a top-10 pick,\" Zillgitt wrote. \"Can get to the rim with ease, and finishes with power although listed at 6-6, 178 pounds. Has 3-point range, and his mid-range game is solid at the college level.\"\n\nESPN: F Matas Buzelis, G League Ignite\n\nJeremy Woo and Jonathan Givony have Matas Buzelis going to Detroit in ESPN's final mock draft. Buzelis, linked to the Pistons heavily predraft by draftniks, projects to be a 3-and-D player with playmaking ability but questions about his shot exist. Woo and Givony also said other teams are looking at the Pistons as a potential trade-down spot, and that the Pistons worked out Williams and Clingan, and also hosted Kentucky guard Rob Dillingham on a visit.\n\n\"Buzelis worked out for most of the teams in this range, including the San Antonio Spurs and the Charlotte Hornets, both selecting behind Detroit at No. 6 and No. 8,\" Woo wrote. \"He remains viewed as a strong candidate for the Pistons, whether it's at this spot, or in trade-back scenarios.\"\n\nTRADE TALK:The Pistons are open for business: 3 salary dumps for Trajan Langdon to pursue\n\nThe Athletic: F Matas Buzelis, G League Ignite (trade)\n\nIn his final mock draft, The Athletic's Sam Vecenie has the Pistons executing a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies to move down four spots to No. 9 while picking up a \"lightly protected\" future first-round pick and still landing Buzelis, who is 6-9. In his introductory news conference, Langdon said trading down was an option.\n\n\"He fills a long-term positional need at the four for the Pistons, who could sign a bigger forward in free agency and let Buzelis develop at his own pace into the long-term answer at the position,\" Vecenie wrote on Buzelis.\n\nYahoo! Sports: F Matas Buzelis, G League Ignite\n\nYahoo's Krysten Peek also landed on Buzelis as a high upside fit in Detroit that could help in the two biggest areas of need down the line: shooting and defense.\n\n\"Buzelis has great size and can play multiple positions with how well he can handle the ball and take players off the dribble,\" Peek wrote. \"Many around the league believe Buzelis is a lock at No. 5 to Detroit, where he can bring in some additional size and floor spacing along the perimeter.\"\n\nThe Ringer: G Dalton Knecht, Tennessee\n\nThe Ringer's Kevin O'Connor has the Pistons taking sharpshooting guard Dalton Knecht with the fifth pick. Knecht was one of the best scorers in college basketball last year, but is on the older side for a prospect (23 years old).\n\n\"The Pistons ranked 26th in 3-point percentage and 27th in 3-point attempts last season,\" O'Connor wrote. \"Knecht would immediately help; he’s a knockdown shooter who also has some on-ball chops that would make him a seamless fit next to Detroit’s existing core pieces.\"\n\nBleacher Report: C Donovan Clingan, UConn\n\nBleacher Report's Jonathan Wasserman also landed on Clingan for the Pistons at five, saying he is the best player available who gives the roster flexibility and a defensive upgrade. He also noted Memphis trying to trade up into the top five for Clingan.\n\n\"For the Detroit Pistons, drafting the best player available will be the priority, particularly with Trajan Langdon taking over, considering the current roster's young prospects aren't 'his guys'.\" Wasserman wrote. \"Clingan would give Detroit a surefire defensive anchor and some potential trade flexibility with Jalen Duren, who's been up and down to start his career.\"\n\nLike our work?

The numbers: 20 turnovers, leading to 27 points for the Utah Jazz; 7-for-21 shooting in the fourth quarter, including 1-for-10 from behind the arc; six offensive rebounds given up in the final period for nine second-chance points in a 119-111 loss.\n\nAnd, of course, the number not on the box score: 25. As in the consecutive losses for the Detroit Pistons, one short of the NBA's single-season record, held by the 2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers and the 2013-14 Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nNo. 25 came against a Utah Jazz team, on the second night of a back-to-back, with four of its top six scorers out for a variety of injuries.\n\nAll things Pistons: Latest Detroit Pistons news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nDoes this one feel different?\n\n“Yeah,” Cunningham said a second time, after taking in the box score.\n\nSomehow, as Cunningham's pauses indicated, the Pistons keep finding new ways to bottom out.\n\nGORED:Owner must resolve Pistons future: When is this historic losing enough?\n\nThe Jazz arrived in Detroit clearly in a holiday spirit, as they did their best to gift-wrap a win to a Pistons team that hasn't won since before another holiday — Halloween — can set the NBA record for consecutive losses a day after Christmas and is on pace to win just six of 82 games this season.\n\nUtah’s top scorer, Lauri Markkanen, sat out after his team lost in Cleveland to a squad without its top three players (Darius Garland, Donavan Mitchell and Evan Mobley) a night prior.\n\nUtah's second-highest scorer, Jordan Clarkson, also sat out with an injury. The Jazz's No. 5-6 scorers — Talen Horton-Tucker and Keyonte George — were out, too. That left a starting lineup including just two players scoring double figures this season — Collin Sexton and John Collins — neither averaging more than 15 points. In short, a rebuilding team also missing its top talent.\n\nBut the gap in execution between the two lottery-bound teams was clear. Take turnovers: The Jazz are the only team in the league averaging more per game than the Pistons. And yet, the ailing Jazz committed just 12. That, along with Utah's 23 second-chance points off 15 offensive rebounds, was the Pistons’ undoing, despite shooting 50% overall.\n\nFans at Little Caesars Arena booed in the first half as the Pistons gave up a brutal 26-5 run. They also booed at the end of the game and chanted \"Sell the Team,\" when it became clear the franchise was knocking on history’s doorstep.\n\n[ MUST LISTEN: Make \"The Pistons Pulse\" your go-to Detroit Pistons podcast, available weekly anywhere you listen to podcasts (Apple, Spotify) ]\n\nIf the Pistons don’t beat the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, they’ll tie the single-season record. If, after Christmas, they lose to the Nets at LCA, they’ll own it.\n\nYes, they’re aware.\n\n“It’s definitely on my mind,” Cunningham said after Thursday's loss. “That’s history that nobody wants to be part of. We’re trying to build something that’s sustainable. It’s not like we’re just trying to just go out there and win one game. We want to win multiple games. To be on the wrong side of history, nobody wants to be there. That is definitely an extra edge that we have to have, and we should’ve won this game. We didn’t, so gotta come back next game and be locked in. I gotta come in and be locked in and more solid down the stretch for us.”\n\nCunningham criticized himself during the post-game availability. He led all scorers with 28 points and added 10 assists and seven rebounds. He also turned the ball over six times; it was his 13th game with at least five, covering nearly half the Pistons' 28 games. Defensively, it was one of his worst efforts of the season.\n\nA lot of failures — from the front office, coaching staff and players — have led the team to this point. And the No.1 overall pick in 2021 shouldn't be immune to that criticism. Although he has been the team’s best player this season, he still entered Friday leading the NBA in total turnovers. Depth is one thing; they need their franchise player to step up consistently.\n\nMonday brought a career-high 43 points, albeit in a loss to the Atlanta Hawks; Thursday brought a 2-for-9 performance in the fourth quarter.\n\n“We had a shot to win it,” Cunningham said Thursday. “Down the stretch, we weren’t solid enough. Me personally, I mean, six turnovers kills us. We had 20 as a team, gave up 27 points off of it. That kills us. I didn’t keep anybody in front of me today. That killed us. We’ve gotta be better. I’m sick right now. Sick.”\n\nUtah was credited with 15 steals, but not because of their defensive prowess. The Pistons, for the umpteenth time, were just plain sloppy. They had baffling passes and were loose with their handles, issues that have plagued the team since their narrow opening loss in Miami. They’ve made little progress in that area since.\n\nThose consistent miscues have been a big factor in the skid. The team has long been out of answers for them.\n\n“It’s just carelessness,” head coach Monty Williams said after his 28th game with the franchise. “That’s the only way you can sum it up. It’s the same story — playing in a crowd, not being sure about where we need to go with the ball and being strong with the ball. It’s not gonna change. That’s a lot of turnovers for any game. You wanna stay around 12, 13. We kinda corrected it the last couple of games, but timely live-ball turnovers, and that many points off of turnovers, you lose by eight and give up 27 points off of those turnovers, it’s unexplainable.”\n\nOnce again, Detroit fell apart when Cunningham and Bojan Bogdanovic — whose quiet eight points on 3-for-12 shooting were 14 below his season average — headed to the bench. Williams had been staggering the two players' minutes, understanding that the team falls apart when the bench takes over. But he checked them out toward the end of the first quarter, and Detroit never regained its momentum, despite leading by eight points midway through the opening 12 minutes.\n\n“We weren’t getting much bench production to begin with,” Williams said. “It has hurt us. We’ve tried to stagger those lineups to get those guys back in the game. It puts a lot of pressure on those guys to have to come back in and save the day. It’s on me to figure it out.”\n\nThe NBA's 2022-23 trade deadline was Feb. 9. The Pistons beat the San Antonio Spurs in double overtime Feb. 10. Since then? Four wins and 49 losses. It’s an unfathomably bad stretch of basketball, and one that has seemingly ingrained itself onto the psyche of the team.\n\nSHAWN WINDSOR:The Pistons are bereft of hope. No place in professional sports is worse.\n\nThis team, in its fourth season under general manager Troy Weaver, shouldn’t be this bad. But it is.\n\nWorse, the Pistons appear no closer to solving their issues as their losing streak captures national attention — \"Pistons\" was a trending topic on social media Thursday night — and threatens to reach infamy even before 2024 arrives.\n\nAnd yet, at least one Piston believes.\n\n“Yeah, we’re not '2-26 bad,' ” Cunningham said Thursday. “No way are we that bad. So, yes, I think we can turn it around. I think we can play a lot better brand of basketball than we’re playing right now. Not as far as the system that we’re playing or any of that, but just executing our game plans, taking care of the ball, keeping guys in front of you.\n\n“It has nothing to do with the system. That’s just individual, that’s the players. We have to be better about that. Tonight, I was the head of that snake by far. Six turnovers, couldn’t keep nobody in front of me.”\n\nContact Omari Sankofa II at osankofa@freepress.com. Follow him @omarisankofa.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/22"}]}
