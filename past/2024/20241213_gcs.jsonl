He monitored more than 450 YouTube channels for images of weapons and tracking when new types appeared in the war and who was using them.\n\nA year later, The Guardian reported that Higgin’s work was being “cited by human rights groups” and had “led to questions in Parliament”. And he did it all “largely unpaid, from a laptop more than 3,000 miles away from Damascus, in his front room in a Leicester suburb”.\n\nHe told the paper: “Before the Arab spring I knew no more about weapons that the average Xbox owner. I had no knowledge beyond what I’d learned from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rambo.\n\n“My wife sees me doing all this work and thinks I should be getting paid for it. But I’m doing it because I see stuff that isn’t being reported in the mainstream media and want to record it.”\n\nBellingcat has since developed into an international organisation that “uncovered evidence that Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad fired chemical weapons at his own people” and “identified the Russian intelligence agents alleged to have poisoned MI6 double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia”, NPR reported.\n\nIt was also the first media organisation in the world to name the suspected assassins behind the 2020 poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nIn an interview with the Washington D.C.-based broadcaster last year, Higgins said the process of deciphering what is happening using OSINT was about “piecing together a variety of clues that were available online”. And he is now not alone in his efforts to pull together the evidence.\n\nGrowing field\n\nSince the Cold War, the US and its Nato allies have tracked Russian troop and equipment movements “using expensive and often exotic means of keeping tabs on other people’s territory such as spy satellites and surveillance flights”, The Economist said.\n\nBut now, “journalists, academics, think-tankers, activists and amateur enthusiasts” are increasingly joining Higgins and his Bellingcat colleagues in using “their own tools” to “reveal goings on in inaccessible places”, the paper added.\n\nUnder the pseudonym Intel Crab, University of Alabama student Justin Peden “has become an unlikely source of information about the unfolding Ukraine-Russia war”, Rest of World said.\n\n“From his dorm room, the 20-year-old sifts through satellite images, TikTok videos, and security feeds, sharing findings like troop movements and aircraft models with more than 220,000 followers on Twitter,” the site continued. “His posts have reached 20m people and his follower count has increased by over 50,000 people over the past month”, making him “one of the most prominent OSINT figures on Twitter”.\n\nAnother prominent OSINT researcher is Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert who leads a team of analysts at the Vermont-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n\nOn 24 February, he tweeted that Google Maps showed a traffic jam had formed on a road near Ukraine’s border in “exactly” the same place he had seen a Russian formation days earlier. Hours later, Vladimir Putin announced that a Russian invasion was under way.\n\nOSINT requires constantly searching for “hints”, as well as “knowing where to look”, The Economist said. A common tactic is known as “tipping and cueing”, where “clues gleaned from one sensor” are used to “guide a sharper one that can see what’s what”.\n\nOther discoveries are far simpler. Maxar, a space technology company, made “headlines across the globe when it released images of a Russian military vehicle convoy, stretched out over the road to Kyiv for 40 miles, within hours of their collection”, Buzzfeed News reported.\n\nThere is also a “small army of OSINT enthusiasts who log the activity of military and other interesting planes” using publicly available flight tracking websites “and post their findings to social media”, the site added.\n\nOSINT researchers are increasingly “doing the sort of thing that armies do before wars”, The Economist said. And modern armed forces increasingly “appreciate the role that open sources have begun to play in crises”.\n\nSeeing not understanding\n\nYet for all the information OSINT can provide, it “is not a panacea”, said The Economist. As armed forces have become more aware of its influence, they have begun to use the work of online sleuths “to their advantage”.\n\n“An army might, for instance, deliberately show a convoy of tanks headed in the opposite direction to their intended destination”, the paper reported, “in the knowledge that the ensuing TikTok footage will be dissected by researchers.”\n\nSome analysts already “believe that OSINT work is being utilised by the Ukrainian military”, Rest of World said, and are becoming increasingly concerned about the “potential impact” of their work on the conflicts they study.\n\n“In the midst of a very active conflict, there’s also an informational tussle that’s going on online as well,” Ciarán O’Connor, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told the site. “For accounts that wield enormous followings, if they post and get it wrong, there’s a good chance that it spreads very quickly.”\n\nOthers are concerned that observers are becoming over reliant on OSINT, creating a false impression that they know exactly what is happening on the ground.\n\n“People seem to think that OSINT will present them with the full scale of the build-up” to a future conflict, Konrad Muzyka, a defence analyst focusing on Russia and Belarus, told The Economist.\n\n“I am under no illusion,” he warned. “We are only seeing a fraction of what is really going on.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Richard Windsor", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/10"}]}

Here's bigger picture", "text": "North Jersey has been on edge as mysterious drones reportedly fill the skies — and our imaginations and social media feeds.\n\nWith purported sightings from Wyckoff to Wantage, and the Raritan River to Rockaway Township, authorities have felt compelled to issue both warnings and public assurances in recent days.\n\nWhere's the frenzy coming from? Many North Jersey residents are looking at the sky and seeing lights that sincerely unnerve them. But psychologists and social scientists say there are other factors that have to be taken into account: our human tendencies to follow a crowd and social media's ability to amplify fears and narratives.\n\nAs authorities scramble to identify the source, if any, of the objects, the drone story is reverberating in an era of declining trust in institutions and a desire for security in uncertain times.\n\n\"It is making people anxious,\" said Richard Waldron, a Closter-based psychologist. \"It's kind of like a Peeping Tom, and it gets everybody's vigilance up — they become hypervigilant to it.\"\n\nLarge drones over NJ and a fixed-wing aircraft\n\nReports of unidentified drones have spread on social media since mid-November. What began in Morris County as a few scattered sightings quickly became a viral sensation, prompting authorities at Picatinny Arsenal, a military research facility in Rockaway and Jefferson townships, to issue warnings against flying drones over its airspace.\n\nThe FBI said last week that it was investigating the drone reports as well as what it described as a \"possible fixed-wing aircraft\" along the Raritan River, whose branches flow near the military arsenal and President-elect Donald Trump's golf course.\n\nBut the reports have spread well beyond those potential targets to small towns across New Jersey. Just check your local Facebook group.\n\nIn a study by scientists at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken in 2009, near the dawn of the social-media era, researchers found that people's perceptions of online information can be swayed by its apparent popularity.\n\nThe research by the school's Center for Decision Technologies made use of the online publishing platform Digg.com. By manipulating the number of \"upvotes\" a post had, the scientists found they could increase the number of real-life readers who rated articles positively. It worked regardless of the nature of the content, the authors said in \"2,377 People Like this Article: The Influence of Others’ Decisions on Yours.\"\n\nMore:Is it a drone? A plane? Our experts weigh in on recent lights in North Jersey's night sky\n\nThe popularity of a narrative becomes its own validation and can transform anecdotal accounts into ironclad evidence, said researchers Yasuaki Sakamoto, Jing Ma and Jeffrey Nickerson. \"Although people may not be explicitly processing the information about others’ choices, they may be unconsciously influenced by it,\" they wrote.\n\nIt's not a stretch to imagine that the more people see posts about drones flooding the skies, the more likely they are to interpret inconsistent information — maybe those lights are just a plane? — as proof of a trending phenomenon.\n\nStill, social media doesn't have to be a negative influence. It can connect us to knowledgeable sources.\n\nCivil Air Patrol weighs in\n\nIn Rockaway Township, for example, Chris Thomas took to Facebook recently to educate fellow Morris County residents on the difference between drones and planes, which can be admittedly difficult to distinguish in the dark skies that accompany a new moon.\n\nPut simply, drones typically have two front lights of one color and two back lights of another, which flash together. Airplanes, on the other hand, have distinct red and green lights on either wing and white strobes that are absent on drones.\n\n\"People see strobe lights in the sky and often assume it's a drone, but 99% of the time, it's an airplane,\" Thomas said.\n\nBut Thomas, who serves as an aerospace education officer in the U.S. Civil Air Patrol and is a certified drone pilot, admits the discussion isn't so cut and dried these days.\n\nJust ask his wife, who said she has seen one of the mysterious drones.\n\n“We are in a debate over whether a blinking light in the sky was a drone or another type of aircraft,” Thomas said. “But I'm very skeptical as to the possibility of a drone anywhere around us.\"\n\nThough he may be a skeptic, quick, blurry videos posted online will continue to gain traction for a while because there's something deeper going on, said Waldron, the Closter psychologist.\n\nAmerica has communal PTSD\n\n\"If you go back for a bunch of years, everybody thought this country, up until 9/11, was relatively safe. That got shattered,\" Waldron said. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were followed by the financial crisis, then COVID and a wild political cycle, he said.\n\n\"The country has been going through its own communal post-traumatic stress disorder,\" Waldron said.\n\n\"I am 73 years old, and there has been no time in my lifetime like this,\" he added. \"This is a whole new thing. I study all this, and this is just new territory — very unknown and very, very scary in many ways.\"\n\nWe expect what we read to be true. The American Psychological Association noted on its website in March that \"detecting false information is difficult. When we encounter new information, we tend to focus on understanding it and deciding what to do next, rather than evaluating it for accuracy. It takes effort to compare new information with what we already know; when new information is false but plausible, we can learn it as fact.\"\n\nThe APA said people are also more likely to trust information from \"in-group sources rather than out-group ones\" — say, neighbors or Facebook friends. People are also more likely to believe information that stirs anxious or angry feelings.\n\nThis may be a unique moment, but the tenor of the time reminds Waldron, a history buff, of the disillusionment that followed the assassinations of 1960s leaders even as the Vietnam War was picking up steam. The collective trust in government and media that helped people feel secure began to erode. Then an infamous conspiracy theory emerged.\n\nThe official investigation into President John F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone when he shot the president. Many doubted this conclusion, and rumors spread of groups like the CIA, the Mafia or even Cuba working to take Kennedy down after the Bay of Pigs invasion.\n\nContrast that with a present era marked by its own political instability, unreliable information and rapid societal changes. Stepping out to look for drones in the sky seems like a harmless pastime.\n\nHow many are truly filling the sky? Today's leaders could do better by making more definitive statements, Waldron added.\n\n\"It would be nice to get out ahead of it and have somebody speak with authority with actual information,\" he said. \"That would make people feel better. But to say, 'We don't know,' that's not going to help people go to sleep between 2 and 5 a.m. up in Morristown.\"\n\nGene Myers covers disability and mental health for NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY Network.

He said the North would finalize a plan by mid-August to fire four mid-range missiles hitting waters 30 to 40 kilometers (19 to 25 miles) away from the island.\n\nThe plan will then go to the commander in chief of North Korea's nuclear force and \"wait for his order,\" Kim was quoted by KCNA as saying. He called it a \"historic enveloping fire at Guam.\"\n\nThe statement only served to escalate tensions in a week that has seen a barrage of threats from both sides. While nuclear confrontation still seems incredibly remote, the comments have sparked deep unease in the United States, Asia and beyond.\n\nA day after evoking the use of overwhelming U.S. military might, Trump touted America's atomic supremacy. From the New Jersey golf resort where he's vacationing, he tweeted that his first order as president was to \"renovate and modernize\" an arsenal that is \"now far stronger and more powerful than ever before.\"\n\nIt was a rare public flexing of America's nuclear might. And Trump's boasting only added to the confusion over his administration's approach to dealing with North Korea's expanding nuclear capabilities on a day when his top national security aides wavered between messages of alarm and reassurance.\n\nNorth Korea unimpressed\n\nIf Trump's goal with two days of tough talk was to scare North Korea, Kim, the commander, put that idea quickly to rest. He called Trump's rhetoric a \"load of nonsense\" that was aggravating a grave situation.\n\n\"Sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him,\" the KNCA report quoted him saying.\n\nKim said the Guam action would be \"an effective remedy for restraining the frantic moves of the U.S. in the southern part of the Korean peninsula and its vicinity.\"\n\nGuam lies about 2,100 miles from the Korean Peninsula, and it's extremely unlikely Kim's government would risk annihilation with a pre-emptive attack on U.S. citizens. It's also unclear how reliable North Korea's missiles would be against such a distant target, but no one was writing off the danger completely.\n\nThe new specificity from Pyongyang about its plans for a potential attack came as Trump and his top national security aides delivered contrasting messages over North Korea's expanding nuclear capabilities.\n\nFirepower\n\nAs international alarm escalated, Trump dug in on his threats of military action and posted video of his ultimatum to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe suggestion that Trump has enhanced U.S. nuclear firepower was immediately disputed by experts, who noted no progress under Trump's presidency. Still, Trump tweeted,\n\n\"Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!\"\n\nThe tweets did little to soothe concerns that Trump was helping push the standoff with North Korea into uncharted and even more dangerous territory. While the prospect of military action by either side appears slim, given the level of devastation that would ensue, Trump's talk Tuesday of \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\" compounded fears of an accident or misunderstanding leading the nuclear-armed nations into conflict.\n\nThis week, an official Japanese report and a classified U.S. intelligence document, the latter reported by The Washington Post, combined to suggest the North was closer to being able to strike the United States with a nuclear missile than previously believed. The U.S. document reportedly assessed that the North had mastered the ability to fit a nuclear warhead on its long-range missiles.\n\nMixed messages\n\nAfter North Korea issued its own warning that suggested it could attack Guam, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to calm the sense of crisis.\n\nSpeaking earlier Wednesday on his way home from Asia, he credited Trump with sending a strong message to the North Korean leader on the \"unquestionable\" U.S. ability to defend itself, so as to prevent \"any miscalculation.\" Tillerson insisted the U.S. isn't signaling a move toward military action, while it pursues a policy of sanctions and isolation of North Korea.\n\n\"Americans should sleep well at night,\" Tillerson told reporters. He added, \"Nothing that I have seen and nothing that I know of would indicate that the situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours.\"\n\nNo sooner had Tillerson ratcheted down the rhetoric than Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ratcheted it back up.\n\nEchoing Trump's martial tone, Mattis said North Korea should stand down its nuclear weapons program and \"cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people.\" As seldom as it is for a president to speak of using nuclear missiles, the reference to the \"destruction\" of a foreign people is equally rare.\n\nCharles K. Armstrong, director of Columbia University’s Center for Korean Research, described the current war of words between the U.S. and North Korea as the most dangerous stand-off between the two adversaries since the mid-1990s when the Clinton administration threatened to attack Pyongyang over its efforts to build a nuclear bomb.\n\nBut Armstrong said that the mixed messages from Washington this week – in particular Trump’s threats of “fire and fury” and Tillerson’s call for negotiations – could be confusing to North Korea’s volatile leaders and possibly lead to a confrontation now.\n\n“A generous reading is that Trump and Tillerson are playing good cop and bad cop,” Armstrong said. “I’m not sure if that’s deliberate. But it might be effective. What concerns those of us who look at this situation is whether there is someone in charge who knows the nuances.”\n\nArmstrong said the first step to deescalate the already tense situation is open up some lines of communication. “We have to be careful that the North Koreans are not pushed into a corner where they feel threatened,” he said. “Bellicose rhetoric from Washington is not helpful.”\n\nDelicate situation\n\nArmstrong said the situation between the two longtime adversaries is particularly delicate now because of how each side views threats from the other.\n\n“For North Korea’s leaders, the only way they feel they can build security for themselves is to say that they have capacity to harm the U.S.,” Armstrong said. “Of course the U.S. believes the opposite. What North Korea believes will offer security is what the U.S. believes would lead to conflict.”\n\nJohn McCreary, a former senior level expert with the Defense Intelligence Agency who now writes a daily threat-analysis blog called “Night Watch,” said one of the most profound and unpredictable problems in the current standoff is that North Korea could misinterpret statements by the Trump administration or even a simple Pentagon reconnaissance flight as a potential threat that required a military response.\n\n“The real danger of the situation is the North Koreans are so insular, so isolated that they don’t know how to read our moves,” McCreary said. “Moves that we see as precautions they will interpret as offensive threats.”\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, has its own worries about how to interpret North Korea’s military decisions, especially the test-firing of missiles.\n\n“As soon as they determine that a U.S. attack is inevitable, they will attack,” said McCreary, who has visited North Korea several times. “And we don’t know what goes into that decision.”\n\nMcCreary feels the key to finding a solution lies with the Chinese, in part because China could lose billions in investments in Korea if war breaks out.\n\nBut the “wild card” in this diplomatic chess match is Kim Jong-un, McCreary added.\n\n“I think Kim Jong-un will back down if we don’t do anything dumb,” said McCreary, adding that “the Chinese have to persuade the north Koreans to talk.”\n\n“Somebody has to blink,” McCreary said. “And I think it has to be the North Koreans.”\n\nIt is unclear, however, how serious to take all the war talk. Markets weren't rattled by the back-and-forth threats. Trump had no meetings on his schedule Wednesday. There were no indications from the Pentagon of urgent planning or new assets being hastily deployed to the Pacific region. And Tillerson even made a pre-scheduled refueling stop in Guam, the target of the North's purported military designs.\n\nTrump's alarmist tone sparked criticism among his political opponents in the United States and concern among allies and partners in Asia — the very nations the United States would need to work with to avert a military showdown with North Korea.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said \"reckless rhetoric is not a strategy to keep America safe.\" Fellow Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said the situation needs diplomacy, \"not saber rattling.\"\n\nChina, North Korea's increasingly alienated ally, cautioned all sides against \"employing words or actions that could sharpen differences and escalate the situation.\"\n\nOne regular critic of Trump's foreign policy stood up for the president. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican hawk, said he felt Trump wasn't bluffing with his threat of \"fire and fury.\" Trump has \"basically drawn a red line\" by saying Pyongyang can't ever have a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the U.S., Graham said.\n\n___\n\nRecord staff writer Mike Kelly and Associated Press writers Foster Klug, Kim Tong-hyung and Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, Christopher Bodeen in Beijing, Deb Riechmann and Lolita C.

Lynch also sat for the anthem all of last season, but never gave a reason for his decision.\n\nIn Miami, Dolphins receivers Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson kneeled behind teammates lined up standing along the sideline. Defensive end Robert Quinn stood and raised his right fist.\n\n\"If you continue to misinterpret what we're doing, reach out to me, take a look at my website, take a look at my Twitter, all my social media platforms,\" Stills said. \"I think you'll get a better idea of why we're doing what we're doing and maybe you can come to the other side and start supporting us.\"\n\nStills said \"it would take a lot\" for him to stop protesting.\n\n\"A good first step for us as a league would be acknowledging what they're doing to Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid,\" Stills said. \"You can't say as a league you support the players and their protests and then blackball the players who initially started the protests. To come to the drawing board and talk about solutions, we need to start there as a league, and then we can start drawing up other solutions to some of these other problems.\"\n\nKaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, began the movement in 2016 and was joined by teammate Eric Reid. Both are unemployed — Kaepernick didn't play last season, either — and have pending collusion grievances against the NFL.\n\nKaepernick tweeted support for Stills and Wilson.\n\nWilson said he feels more free to express himself with the Dolphins than he did with the Kansas City Chiefs, but didn't elaborate.\n\n\"You get a lot of backlash for doing this,\" Wilson said. \"Nobody wants to bring the negative attention to themselves, but when you have a platform like this and you're able to speak on certain situations, you want to do that. We're not harming anybody.\"\n\nWriting on Twitter from his New Jersey golf resort, Trump said Friday players \"make a fortune doing what they love,\" and those who refuse to stand \"proudly\" for the anthem should be suspended without pay.\n\nQuinn had a powerful message for critics.\n\n\"It's not a protest. It's an awareness,\" he said. \"I think 'protest' segregates this country. The awareness we're trying to raise — this country preaches freedom and unity. That's all I'm trying to do. If you believe in something, no matter the consequences you stand by it. I want heaven here on Earth. I believe we preach too much negativity throughout this whole world. I think the message that needs to be spread is peace, love and happiness.\n\n\"Hearing the slander that we're protesting the flag, that's not it. It's not a protest. It's no disrespect to any servicemen or women out there. They salute with their hand over their heart, I hold my fist up. How can you look at that any different? That salute is just as meaningful to them as my fist in the air.\"\n\nThree Seahawks players, Branden Jackson, Quinton Jefferson and Duane Brown, left the field following team introductions and before the start of the anthem Thursday night.\n\n\"I think there are a lot of people that are supportive of the players and then there are a couple of people that have been very vocal against it. Those people have power,\" Brown said. \"We'll see what happens.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Steven Wine and Tim Booth contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFLfootball and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/monmouth-county/2020/08/07/donald-trump-nj-fundraiser-stanley-chera-covid-19-coronavirus/3317404001/", "title": "President Donald Trump holding NJ fundraiser in Long Branch on ...", "text": "LONG BRANCH - President Donald Trump on Sunday is coming to the area for a fundraiser less than three months away from Election Day.\n\nTrump, 74, has long had connections to the Jersey Shore and particularly to Long Branch. His daughter, Ivanka, is married to Jared Kushner, one of Trump's senior advisers and son of Charles Kushner, a longtime Long Branch real estate developer who later served a 14-month prison sentence on charges of illegal campaign contributions, witness tampering and tax evasion.\n\nKushner at the Jersey Shore:See what the Trump in-laws own in Monmouth County\n\nAnd he was also close friends with real estate mogul Stanley Chera, who died of complications due to COVID-19 in April. The Sunday fundraiser is being held at Chera's home in Elberon, near the Deal boundary.\n\nAccording to the official presidential schedule, Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks at a \"fundraising committee reception,\" as well as speak with supporters at a roundtable discussion that costs $250,000 per person.\n\nBarnegat Bay: Boat flotilla supports Trump, law enforcement\n\nTrump held a fundraiser at Chera's house during his 2016 presidential campaign. Since then, his only visit to the Jersey Shore was a January rally in Wildwood with U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-New Jersey, shortly after Van Drew switched parties from the Democrats.\n\nKushner and Ivanka Trump have visited the area multiple times during Trump's presidency.\n\nReport:Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner spotted eating ice cream in Deal\n\nReport:Ivanka Trump was spotted shopping in Ocean\n\nHere's what you need to know about the Trump fundraiser this weekend:\n\nWhen?\n\nThe fundraiser is scheduled for Sunday. According to the official presidential schedule:\n\n4:15 p.m. Trump departs his golf course in Bedminster via helicopter.\n\nTrump departs his golf course in Bedminster via helicopter. 4:45 p.m. He arrives at Elberon Park.\n\nHe arrives at Elberon Park. 4:55 p.m. Trump departs Elberon Park for the Chera home.\n\nTrump departs Elberon Park for the Chera home. 7:05 p.m. Trump departs the Chera home.\n\nTrump departs the Chera home. 7:10 p.m. He arrives back at Elberon Park\n\nHe arrives back at Elberon Park 7:20 p.m. Trump departs for Morristown Municipal Airport, where he will then transfer to plane and head to Joint Base Andrews, en route to the White House.\n\nWhere?\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has invited donors to a house in Deal, the Chera home is actually located on Ocean Avenue in the Elberon neighborhood of Long Branch. Both Elberon and Deal are popular summer resort towns for Syrian Jews from New York, including Chera.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, there was little sign that the president was coming to Elberon, save for a police officer guarding the gate to the Cheras' driveway.\n\nGardeners were on the property trimming hedges and the hum of generators rose above the sounds of passing cars. The power was still out on Ocean Avenue, though power crews were at work a few blocks away.\n\nOn various Jewish news websites, video of a U.S. Secret Service helicopter was shown taking off from Truax Field in Elberon, less than a mile from the fundraiser site.\n\nSomerset Patriots: When Donald Trump threw first pitch, landed helicopter at NJ baseball stadium\n\nMany of those Syrian Jews fled from New York to Deal and Elberon when the COVID-19 pandemic hit full-force in late March, prompting Deal officials to request its summer residents to self-quarantine for 14 days if they relocated there. Chera traveled to his Elberon home around the same time, Deal Mayor Samuel Cohen said.\n\nWho was Stanley Chera?\n\nThrough his company, Crown Acquisitions, Chera became a major real estate titan in New York, with real estate holdings on upper Fifth Avenue. The company also holds a 24% stake in Vornado Realty Trust, which has partnered with Kushner Cos., Trump's son-in-law's family company, on Monmouth Mall and 666 Fifth Avenue.\n\nCohen said Chera most likely had the novel coronavirus before he came down to the Shore, But he soon fell ill and was admitted to New York Presbyterian Hospital. He died on April 11.\n\nIn a March press briefing, Trump called Chera a friend and \"sort of a tough guy — a little older, a little heavier than he'd like to be, frankly.\"\n\n“When you send a friend to the hospital, and you call up to find out how is he doing — it happened to me, where he goes to the hospital, he says goodbye,” Trump said. \"And you call up the next day: 'How's he doing?’ And he’s in a coma? This is not the flu.”\n\nHow much does the fundraiser cost?\n\nAccording to a flyer posted by Hamodia.com, there are three tiers depending on how much is donated to Trump's re-election campaign.:\n\n$5,600: Ticket to the reception at the Chera home in Elberon;\n\nTicket to the reception at the Chera home in Elberon; $35,000: Two tickets to the reception and a photo opportunity with Trump;\n\nTwo tickets to the reception and a photo opportunity with Trump; $250,000: Seat at a roundtable discussion with Trump, along with the photo opportunity and two tickets to the reception.\n\nCOVID-19: Did Trump block New Jersey coronavirus test site? Andy Kim thinks so\n\nIs anyone protesting the fundraiser?\n\nA group simply known as \"Dump Trump\" is planning a protest, gathering at the Elberon train station at 2 p.m. Sunday.\n\n“When I heard (about the fundraiser), I said ‘No. Not in my backyard,’” said protest organizer Jill LaZare, a Summit resident who grew up in Deal. \"We just want to make our statement, make it clear that we know he’s there and we’re opposed to almost everything he does.”\n\nProtesters are reminded to wear masks and maintain social distancing.\n\nKushner at the Jersey Shore: See what the Trump in-laws own in Monmouth County\n\nAre there any local restrictions in place?\n\nAs of Friday morning, Long Branch Police Chief Jason Roebuck hadn't received any word from the Secret Service on road closures, barricades or other restrictions linked to Trump's visit.\n\nBut he hoped whatever closures are ordered don't result in a traffic nightmare. \"It's a weekend on the Shore, but hopefully we'll be able to work it out,\" Roebuck said.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, all roads near the fundraiser site were still open.\n\nThe FAA no-fly zone includes drone activity. According to the FAA, the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security or Justice may take action \"that results in the interference, disruption, seizure, damaging or destruction of unmanned aircraft.\"\n\nTranslation: The military might just shoot your drone out of the sky.\n\nAsbury Park Press multimedia journalist Thomas P.

Likewise, Democrats currently control the Senate but only by a razor-thin margin. Which party will gain control of the upper chamber?\n\nBut there are other, less high profile but still important races on the Nov. 5 ballot. Voters will get to decide on ranked choice voting in multiple states and in Maine voters will decide whether to change their state flag for the first time in a century.\n\nHere is our guide to some of the most consequential — and interesting — races in all 50 states.\n\n— Melissa Brown and Duane W. Gang, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nLearn more about the races\n\nAlabama | Alaska | Arizona | Arkansas | California | Colorado | Connecticut | Delaware | Florida | Georgia | Hawaii | Idaho | Illinois | Indiana | Iowa | Kansas | Kentucky | Louisiana | Maine | Maryland | Massachusetts | Michigan | Minnesota | Mississippi | Missouri | Montana | Nebraska | Nevada | New Hampshire | New Jersey | New Mexico | New York | North Carolina | North Dakota | Ohio | Oklahoma | Oregon | Pennsylvania | Rhode Island | South Carolina | South Dakota | Tennessee | Texas | Utah | Vermont | Virginia | Washington | West Virginia | Wisconsin | Wyoming |\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican Caroleene Dobson, Democrat Shomari Figures\n\nWhat's at stake: Alabama’s congressional map was redrawn in 2023 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the proposed Alabama congressional district map was gerrymandered, discriminating against Black voters in the case of Allen v. Milligan. While the state initially refused to redraw the map, defying a federal court order, a new map was eventually drawn. This allowed for another nearly majority Black district in Alabama and set the stage for the competitive primaries as a minority opportunity district. The winner of this race will be the first person to represent the new district. If Figures wins, Alabama will have two Democrats in the House for the first time since 2008 when it had three Democratic representatives.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Terri Sewell, Incumbent, Republican Robin Litaker\n\nWhat's at stake: Sewell is currently the only Democratic member of Congress from Alabama. If unseated, all nine of Alabama’s Congress members could be Republicans, depending on the outcome of the closely watched race in the 2nd Congressional District. It would also be the first time District 7 has ever been represented by a Republican.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Democrat Eric Hafner, Republican Nicholas Begich and independent John Howe.\n\nWhat's at stake: Holding onto Alaska’s sole House seat is key to Democrats regaining control of the House. Peltola narrowly won in 2022, defeating former Gov. Sarah Palin, becoming the first Democrat from the state elected to the House since 1972. The state’s rank choice voting system advances the top four primary candidates and places them in the general election, regardless of party. Hafner, who’s a New Jersey resident, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for making false bomb threats over the phone and threatening judges, police officers and lawyers, pleading guilty to the crimes in 2022. He’s previously ran for office outside of his home state, running in Hawaii in 2016 as a Republican and in Oregon in 2018 as a Democrat.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and require employers to provide earned paid sick leave for employees.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, Alaska will become the 8th state (not including Washington D.C.) to install a $15 or higher minimum wage.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 2\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting system that was adopted in 2020\n\nWhat's at stake: If repealed, the state will resume traditional voting. There are currently four other states, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, and Oregon, with rank choice related measures their ballots this election.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Republican Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona\n\nWhat's at stake: It’s one of the marquee races across the country that could help determine which party will control the chamber. Lake appears to have gained ground on Gallego, but he has held an advantage in the polls since the outset of the race. The seat is now held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nThe race: Proposition 139 – Arizona Abortion Access Act\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A measure to protect abortion rights\n\nWhat's at stake: This measure would create a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution. If passed by voters, the state will not be able to interfere before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible. Polling shows strong support for the measure.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican David Schweikert, Democrat Amish Shah\n\nWhat's at stake: David Schweikert, a seven-term member of Congress, is locked in a tight race with emergency room physician Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker, in Arizona’s most affluent congressional district. Schweikert is a free-market Republican; Shah is a “practical” Democrat who won a crowded six-way primary. The race is rated a toss-up.\n\nThe race: 6thCongressional District\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Republican Juan Ciscomani, Democrat Kirsten Engel\n\nWhat's at stake: In a rematch from 2022, Ciscomani faces Engel, an environmental lawyer and former state lawmaker whom he defeated by less than 2% of the vote. He is a free-market Republican and served as an aide to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The race is rated a toss-up. Arizona’s congressional delegation is now 6-3 Republican, so flipping both seats could flip the delegation to the Democrats.\n\n— Arizona Republic, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nWho is running: Arkansas Supreme Court Justices Karen R. Baker and Rhonda Wood are competing for the position of chief justice in a runoff election.\n\nWhat's at stake: While the outcome of this race won’t likely affect the ideological breakdown on the seven-member court, it could serve as a symbolic referendum on the two justices who have diametrically opposed views on a number of issues, notably around direct democracy. Both justices recently took strong stances on Secretary of State John Thurston’s disqualification of a ballot measure that if approved would have guaranteed a limited right to abortion in the state Constitution. Wood wrote the majority opinion in the controversial decision to uphold Thurston’s rejection of the measure, while Baker wrote a scathing dissent.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 62\n\nWho is running: In House District 62, Dexter Miller, a tech worker at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is challenging Republican Mark McElroy, a moderate Republican who’s served on and off in the legislature since 2012, also having run as a Democrat and an independent.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Miller ran against McElroy in 2022, losing by less than 200 votes. If 2024’s rematch is nearly as close this time around, the race could be an opportunity for the Democrats to pick up a district in eastern Arkansas, contiguous with the blue counties around West Memphis. Arkansas Democrats are mounting a big push to challenge Republican incumbents in the state legislature and in Congress, many of whom have run unopposed for years.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 56\n\nWho is running: Conway eye doctor Steve Magie, an incumbent Democrat, is defending his state House seat against conservative Republican Kim Slaughter, the owner and operator of a miniature golf course.\n\nWhat’s at stake: If the results of the 2022 elections are any indication, Magie might be one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the Arkansas General Assembly. He won by only 10 votes while running for his seventh term representing District 56, outside of Little Rock, in the last election. Republicans in the Arkansas House command an 82-seat supermajority in the 100-person chamber. Picking up a handful of seats could allow the state’s Democrats to gain some leverage, since spending bills require a three-quarters vote. But this will be challenging without holding onto seats like Magie’s.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 24\n\nWho is running: Moderate Democrat Ryan Intchauspe, an employee for a training contractor that works with the Dept. of Transportation, is running against conservative Republican Brad Hall, a rancher.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This matchup is part of a trend of Arkansas Democrats running for seats which have been solidly Republican for years and where a blue win might be a long shot. Outgoing incumbent Republican Charlene Fite ran unopposed in 2022. In 2020, before redistricting, she won in the equivalent district by close to 40 percentage points in a three-way race, and in 2018 by almost 45%. Intchauspe, a relatively conservative Democrat with some talking points that could appeal to Libertarian-leaning voters, as well as a military service record, might be a good indicator of whether districts like this are necessarily as safe for Republicans as they appear.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent and freshman Rep. John Duarte is hoping to keep hold of his seat in this rural swing district, facing his 2022 challenger, Democrat Adam Gray, a second time.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The rematch is one of five highly competitive House races in California, all of which forecasters say will help decide which party is in the majority next year. They’re also all held by Republicans, despite the state’s overwhelming Democratic majority, making them rare purple races in a state not known for dramatic election face-offs. The 13th district is among the tightest of those five, and with Gray and Duarte facing off again, it’s expected results will be razor-thin. Just two years ago, Duarte won by fewer than 600 votes, the second-slimmest margin in the nation.\n\nThe race: 27th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia is defending his seat from Democrat George Whitesides, a deep-pocketed political newcomer and who once headed space-tourism company Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In this Northern Los Angeles County district, Garcia picked up the seat in 2020 in a special election and has held on to through the general election and 2022 midterm. But all those prior victories were against Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman. With a new Democrat in the mix in Whitesides, the race could see an upset. It’s one of the five most competitive races in California this year, all of which have Republican incumbents representing areas that went to Biden in 2020. Garcia’s record could present challenges in deep-blue California. A staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, he is one of a few California Republicans who voted against certifying election results Jan. 6, 2021, and signed a 2021 amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nThe race: 41st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Rep. Ken Calvert, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades, is up against Democratic upstart Will Rollins. It’s a rematch, as former federal prosecutor Rollins attempts to grab the seat again after his 2022 defeat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whereas most of California's toss-up House races feature relative newcomers who assumed office within the last few years, Calvert is one of the state’s longest-serving representatives. Calvert won against Rollins in 2022 by less than 5 percentage points, and the Democratic challenger boasts a much larger war chest this time around. The race has attracted much attention and cash, making it the most expensive House race in the state as of early October. Polling roughly a month out from Nov. 5 has the pair at a dead heat. While Calvert has defended his seat many times over, this second match-up against Rollins is increasingly competitive, especially as 2021 redistricting looped in more liberal areas like Palm Springs.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, Democrat Trisha Calvarese and three third-party candidates: Paul Noel Fiorino, Unity; Frank Atwood, Approval Voting; and Hannah Goodman, Libertarian\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has been a U.S. House member since 2021, but in a different district: the 3rd Congressional District that covers western Colorado. She decided to run in the 4th Congressional District last year after longtime Republican Rep. Ken Buck announced he wouldn’t be seeking a sixth term, saying many within his Republican Party have strayed from its ideals and are no longer addressing solutions. If Boebert is not elected, it will shift the representation of a portion of Colorado that has long been represented by a Republican and will represent a significant shift in the political makeup of Colorado's representation.\n\nThe race: Proposition 127\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure regarding the hunting of mountain lions, bobcats and lynx\n\nWhat's at stake: Citizen-initiated Proposition 127 seeks to make it illegal to hunt bobcats, lynx and mountain lions in Colorado, though it’s important to note that it’s already illegal to hunt lynx under state and federal law. With appropriate licenses, the hunting of mountain lions has been allowed in Colorado since 1965. Hunting of bobcats in the state has been allowed even longer. Trophy hunting mountain lions is illegal in the state. By law, mountain lion meat must be prepared for human consumption. Bobcats are considered furbearers, so you do not have to eat their meat under state hunting laws. This initiative would allow bobcats, lynx and mountain lions to be killed if they are deemed a threat to human life, livestock or property.\n\nThe race: Poudre School District R-1 Ballot Issue 4A\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A local measure on levy for schools\n\nWhy it matters: This local ballot issue represents a critical crossroads school districts face as they grapple with school funding woes and aging facilities: Do they cut services, ask for help or do both? And if they do ask for help, will they get it? Poudre School District is asking voters to approve a debt-free mill levy to support a wide range of wants and needs, including repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to school facilities.\n\n— Kelly Lyell, Miles Blumhardt, Rebecca Powell and Sarah Kyle, The Coloradoan\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent Rep. Jahana Hayes is seeking a fourth term against Republican challenger George Logan in a highly anticipated rematch. Logan, a former state senator, narrowly lost to Hayes in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 5th District is a key swing seat and the outcome could help decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both candidates are focused on economic issues, but their approaches differ. Hayes backs more federal funding for affordable housing and wage increases, while Logan advocates for reducing government spending. Other major topics include immigration reform and abortion rights, with Hayes supporting federal protections for abortion access and Logan opposing them.\n\nThe race: No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Connecticut voters will decide on the No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment. A \"yes\" vote would allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. A \"no\" vote keeps the current rules, which require voters to give an excuse, like being out of town or having a disability.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, this amendment would make voting more accessible by expanding the use of mail-in ballots. Supporters say it’s the next step in ensuring all voters have the flexibility to cast their ballot. Opponents worry about the potential for misuse and prefer keeping in-person voting as the primary method. With many states already allowing no-excuse absentee voting, this decision could reshape how elections are conducted in Connecticut.\n\nThe race: Key state legislative races\n\nWho is running: Connecticut's state legislature expects to see several highly competitive races. In the 8th Senate District, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Seminara faces Democrat Paul Honig, who seeks to flip the seat held by Republicans since 1967. The 28th Senate District features Republican Sen. Tony Hwang challenged by newcomer Rob Blanchard, a Democrat, testing the suburbs' political leanings. In the 36th Senate District, Republican Sen. Ryan Fazio contends with Democrat Nick Simmons, a former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ned Lamont. The 22nd House District showcases Republican Rep. Francis Cooley battling Democrat Rebecca Martinez, who aims to reclaim her seat after a narrow loss. The 65th House District sees Democrat Rep. Michelle Cook go against Republican Joe Canino. In the 81st House District, Democrat Rep. Chris Poulos is up against Republican James Morelli. Lastly, in the 138th House District, Republican Rep. Rachel Chaleski battles Democrat Ken Gucker, who seeks to reclaim his former seat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These races could reshape Connecticut's political landscape as demographics shift and voter turnout spikes during the presidential election. With several traditionally GOP districts in play, the outcomes will determine whether Connecticut leans further left or sees a Republican resurgence.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Current U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester faces Republican Eric Hansen and independent Dr. Mike Katz. Hansen is a Wilmington resident and businessman, while Katz is an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Both of Delaware’s seats in the U.S. Senate have been held by Democrats since 2001, so a win by Hansen or Katz, while unlikely, would be a major upset. Katz specifically would be the state’s first independent U.S. Senator. If Blunt Rochester is elected, she would be the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride faces Republican political newcomer John Whalen III, a retired state police officer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Delaware’s sole House seat is up for grabs without an incumbent in the race for the first time since Lisa Blunt Rochester, now running for Senate, was elected in 2016. A Republican hasn’t held the seat since 2011, and the odds appear to be against Whalen. If McBride wins the race, she will be the first transgender person elected to federal office, as well as the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer won the Democratic nomination after a tight primary race with the current lieutenant governor. He faces Delaware House Minority Leader Mike Ramone.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats have held the governor’s office in Delaware since 1993, with current Gov. John Carney – now running uncontested for mayor of Wilmington – winning his last election with nearly 60% of votes. Ramone, who has held a seat in the statehouse since 2008, is running on a platform of bipartisan leadership to challenge the state’s “single-party rule.”\n\n— The News Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second six-year term against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who served just one term in Congress before being defeated by U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Miami.\n\nWhat's at stake: At stake is a seat that could decide which party controls the upper chamber, with the power to approve or block appointments to the judicial branch in the next administration. Each has harshly criticized the other on perceived vulnerabilities heading to the Nov. 5 election. Scott slammed Mucarsel-Powell as an “open-border socialist” while Mucarsel-Powell called Scott an “extremist” who would put social safety net programs at risk and push for a federal abortion ban.\n\nThe race: Amendment 3\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Recreational marijuana\n\nWhat's at stake: In Florida, voters statewide will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. As with all proposed constitutional amendments in the state, the measure requires no less than a 60% majority to pass. It would allow people to purchase, possess and use marijuana, but would not allow home growing. Its passage could align Florida with the 24 other states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, potentially affecting the state's economy and criminal justice system. Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top conservatives in the state oppose the measure, with the governor saying it could lead to prolific pot smells, among other criticisms.\n\nThe race: Amendment 4\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Abortion access\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot initiative aims to guarantee abortion access in Florida. It’s generated the most attention, especially since the Florida Supreme Court gave its OK to a six-week abortion ban in the state. Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, have come out in force against the amendment. If approved, abortion access would be assured up to fetal viability, or how soon a fetus can survive outside of its mother's womb, generally considered 24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Opponents say that’s too vague and will lead to an unregulated abortion industry, but proponents dismiss those claims as “scare tactics.”\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 42\n\nWho is running: Gabriel Sanchez, a 27-year-old Democratic Socialist, and Republican Diane Jackson are both vying for their first term in the Georgia legislature.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Sanchez is the first Democratic Socialist to win a state primary in Georgia, according to the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the May primary, he defeated incumbent Rep. Teri Anulewicz, who has served in the House since 2017. District 42 has not been represented by a Republican since 2012 and overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, meaning Sanchez will likely be the first Democratic Socialist state lawmaker in Georgia’s history.\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 53\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Deborah Silcox, a Republican, is vying for her second term representing District 53 against Democrat Susie Greenberg.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is one of the most competitive in the state, and one of the most expensive legislative battles. Silcox flipped the district Republican in the last election, winning by fewer than 1,500 votes. Greenberg has raised nearly $432,000, according to her most recent campaign filing, more than four times Silcox’s $103,000 from this year’s campaign. Silcox previously represented House District 52 but lost to Rep. Shea Roberts, a Democrat, in 2020. Silcox notably refused to concede for over six months following the election, after a lawsuit was filed by a Sandy Springs resident alleging that voter fraud had occurred in the district. The case was eventually dismissed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe race: Georgia Senate District 48\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican, is defending his seat from Democratic challenger Ashwin Ramaswami\n\nWhat’s at stake: Still was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia as part of former President Trump’s fake elector scheme, having served as a secretary who signed and filed false documents in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. His opponent, Ramaswami, has been campaigning on his experience in election cybersecurity and other progressive issues, and has raised more than five times as much as Still, according to recent campaign filings. If elected, Ramaswami would be the first Indian American and first Gen Z lawmaker in the Georgia Senate.\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Hawaii Island mayor\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Mayor Mitch Roth is seeking a second term against challenger Kimo Alameda. Roth, a former Hawaii County prosecutor, has over 40 years of public service experience, while Alameda, a psychologist and former VP at Hawai‘i Island Community Health Center, has deep ties to the island and has been compared to the late Mayor Billy Kenoi.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Key issues include affordable housing, homelessness, permit backlogs, and infrastructure upgrades. The race is closely watched due to the split endorsements from labor unions, with Roth supported by private-sector unions and Alameda backed by public-sector unions. In the August primary, Roth led with 38% of the vote, but Alameda’s 28% and the 34% secured by four other candidates make this a competitive race, as those voters could swing the outcome in November.\n\nThe race: Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees\n\nWho is running: Six candidates are running for three seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) Board. For the at-large trustee seat, incumbent Keli‘i Akina is being challenged by Lei Ahu Isa. In the Kauai-Niihau seat race, incumbent Dan Ahuna faces Laura Lindsey. For the Molokai-Lanai seat, incumbent Luana Alapa is running against Kunani Nihipali. Additionally, Kaiali‘i Kai” Kahele has already secured the at-large trustee seat for Hawaii County in the primary election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The OHA Board directs significant resources to Native Hawaiian communities through scholarships, loans, and grants. These trustees play a vital role in shaping programs that promote education, business development, and community support for Native Hawaiians across the state.\n\nMore: Hawaii House speaker loses reelection bid, deceased lawmaker wins seat: 5 takeaways from Saturday's primaries\n\nThe race: Hawaii legislative races\n\nWhat’s at stake: Hawaii's Legislature is set for a major shakeup, with at least 11 new members joining the upcoming session. With all 51 House seats and 13 of 25 Senate seats up for election, a wave of retirements, primary defeats, and shifting political dynamics are driving significant turnover.\n\nKey races: One of the most notable upsets occurred in House District 25, where progressive Kim Coco Iwamoto ousted House Speaker Scott Saiki, leaving a leadership vacancy that will be addressed after the election. In other key House races, Ikaika Hussey unseated longtime Rep. May Mizuno in District 29, while Shirley Ann Templo defeated Rep. Sonny Ganaden in District 30, signaling growing ideological diversity within Hawaii’s Democratic Party. The race in District 50, where Mike Lee will face Republican Timothy Connelly, could also see a competitive challenge from the GOP. In the Senate, Democrat Cedric Gates is battling Republican Samantha Decorte in Senate District 22, a district that has been trending more conservative, offering the GOP a rare opportunity in a predominantly Democratic state.\n\nWhat's at stake: These contests reflect broader trends of political shifts in Hawaii, with an incoming class that could tilt the legislature in new directions on housing, education, and economic policy. Whether the state moves further left or sees a surge in conservative momentum will depend on the outcomes of these races, marking a pivotal moment for the future of Hawaii’s politics.\n\nThe race: Constitutional amendments\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Voters in Hawaii will consider two significant state constitutional amendments. The first proposal aims to remove the legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, contingent upon a reversal of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The second proposal seeks to streamline the judicial appointment process by aligning the selection of district court judges with that of Supreme Court justices and higher court judges, enhancing consistency and efficiency in the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These amendments mark a notable shift from Hawaii's recent trend of maintaining legislative control over such matters. They represent the first constitutional amendments on the ballot since 2018, following a long period of inaction where the legislature rejected hundreds of proposals, including 68 in the current biennium. Given Hawaii's stringent requirements for passing amendments — requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers or consecutive majority votes — the outcome could have lasting implications for the state’s legal framework and judicial system.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore: Hawaii voters to decide on marriage law authority and judicial appointment process\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Idaho voters will weigh in on an initiative to institute a top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting. Under a top-four primary system, all the primary candidates appear together on the same primary ballot, regardless of their party, and the top four vote-getters from that pool move on to the general election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Idaho’s Republican, Libertarian and Constitution Party primaries are currently closed, meaning that only registered members can vote in them. The Democratic Primary is open, meaning anyone can vote regardless of their affiliation. According to Boise State Public Radio, almost a third of all registered voters in Idaho today are unregistered, which means they can’t vote in most primaries.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 15\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Rick Just, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Republican former state Rep. Codi Galloway in a rematch of a race from 2022. District 15 is a swing district in the western part of Boise.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Spending on this race has been the highest among any state legislature race this year, Idaho Education News reported. Close to a quarter million in spending between the two candidates works out to almost $6 per resident in the district. Just won the seat in 2022 by less than 2 percentage points, a little more than 300 votes which, if that’s any indication of how this race will go, makes him perhaps one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the legislature this cycle.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 6\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Foreman is fending off a challenge from Democrat Julia Parker. In 2022, Foreman ousted incumbent Democrat David Nelson in a tight race decided by little over 400 votes.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This might be one of the best opportunities in Idaho for Democrats to flip a seat in the state Senate, which is dominated by Republican lawmakers by a four-to-one margin. Foreman had run against Nelson twice, in 2018 and 2020, before finally winning in 2022, showing how competitive the district is.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Eric Sorenson faces off with challenger Joe McGraw, a retired Rockford judge running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race, which covers majority of northern/northwestern and parts of central Illinois has been hotly contested the last few races, with the Democrats winning in tight races. The race is seen as a potential seat where Republicans can make a gain. Of the 17 seats in the congressional delegation, 14 are held by Democrats.\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Nikki Budzinski faces off with Joshua Loyd, a political outsider running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is another one which was seen as a potential seat that could flip from blue to red in the Springfield area. In August, Democrats across the state poured “seven figure investments” into two races, this being one of them. Loyd is a West Point graduate and fervent backer of the Second Amendment.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: This is an open seat, since outgoing Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb is term-limited. Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun is giving up his Senate seat to run against Democrat Jennifer McCormick, a former state Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Libertarian Donald Rainwater, who previously garnered 11% of the vote in the 2020 gubernatorial race, a record for Indiana Libertarians.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Braun's to lose, in a solidly red state where Democrats haven't won a statewide office since 2012 or the governor's office since 2000. But since recent polling has shown Braun underperforming compared to other Republicans in Indiana, the race has suddenly seemed more competitive in the eyes of national observers and each party's governor associations, which have chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to each candidate in the last few weeks. A Democratic win is still unlikely, but there are signs that a solid performance by McCormick could mark the beginning of a pendulum shift for the balance of power in Indiana in elections to come.\n\nThe race: Indiana Attorney General\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita is seeking a second four-year term against Democratic challenger Destiny Wells, an Indiana Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who has quickly risen to prominence in the state Democratic Party. Rokita has been a mainstay in Indiana Republican politics for the last two decades, serving in both the U.S. House and as Indiana Secretary of State. Wells has not held elected office but ran for Indiana Secretary of State back in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: There’s been a lot of attention on the race in the context of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban. Rokita is an ardent anti-abortion candidate who faced a national firestorm over his comments on Fox News about an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, who gave an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim back in 2022. Wells has campaigned with Bernard and has pitched the race as a way for Hoosiers to weigh in on abortion rights since the state lacks a ballot referendum process.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan is seeking a third term in the U.S. House. He is being challenged by Republican Lake County Council member Randy Niemeyer, who has been endorsed by high-profile national Republicans and tapped as a “Young Gun” race to watch by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Libertarian Dakotah Miskus, a 25-year-old from LaPorte County, is also running in this election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The district is one of only two Democratic congressional districts in all of Indiana and the 2024 race is the second election cycle that Republicans have eyed the seat as a potential flip to grow their party’s majority in the House. In the 2022 midterms, Mrvan won reelection by 6 points over his Republican challenger in a race closely watched by national political analysts. Democrats have held the 1st District for nearly 100 years, but the area is made up of working-class Rust Belt communities where former President Donald Trump typically performs well.\n\n— The Indianapolis Star, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks is in a rematch with Democrat Christina Bohannan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 1st Congressional District could be the sleeper swing district in a state that has turned decidedly red in recent elections. Active voter registrations favor Republicans, and Miller-Meeks defeated Bohannan in 2022 by about 7 percentage points. But in this rematch, national Democrats have funneled money into the race to capitalize on what they see as Miller-Meeks’ weakness with independents and even some Republicans. The limited publicly available polling of the race suggests Bohannan might have the edge.\n\nThe race: 3rd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Zach Nunn is being challenged by Democrat Lanon Baccam, both of whom are veterans.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 3rd District was anticipated to be its most contested after Nunn squeaked into office with a victory of less than 1 percentage point in 2022. In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional posts, it’s perhaps Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat. It’s got a narrower Republican voter registration advantage than other districts in the state, and it’s home to some of Iowa’s largest urban metro areas, which tend to favor Democrats. But Nunn has avoided major missteps, and Republicans remain confident in their chances.\n\n— The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: House District 52\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jesse Borjon, R-Topeka, faces challenger Jacquie Whitney Lightcap, D-Topeka.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the legislature. National Democrats early on identified Borjon’s seat as a key pickup opportunity, but Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s PAC did not endorse in the race.\n\nThe race: House District 102\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, faces challenger Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Republicans believe they can grow their supermajorities and identified Probst’s seat as a key pickup opportunity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 10\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, faces challenger Andrew Mall, D-Shawnee.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, is widely viewed as the most important electoral battleground, and this race could be a barometer for others in the Kansas City suburbs. Thompson is an affable former television weatherman, but has established himself as one of the most conservative lawmakers with high-profile questioning of climate science and election integrity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 11\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, faces challenger Karen Thurlow, D-Stilwell.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is another high-profile race in Johnson County. Warren was a significant figure behind Value Them Both, an anti-abortion constitutional amendment that voters decisively rejected in 2022. The race could show whether reproductive rights continue to be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 2\n\nWho is running: Kentucky voters will weigh in on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would let state lawmakers direct spending toward non-public education, including through charter school and voucher programs.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While proponents of the change say this would allow Kentucky students to have wider access to a variety of schools that may better suit their educational needs, critics allege that the amendment would leave a devastating financial impact on the state's public school system.\n\n— The Courier-Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t face a serious challenge in what is considered a safe GOP seat, but his race and reaction after will be closely watched because of his close ties to former President Trump.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson’ previous defense of Trump both during his impeachment and following the 2020 election that Trump lost has raised questions as to whether the leader of the House will certify the 2024 presidential election if Trump loses again.\n\nThe race: 6th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress in the 1990s, and former Republican state Sen. Elbert Guillory are familiar faces on the ballot, but they are joined by newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson, a Democrat and executive chairman of a social justice nonprofit, who is also running a district-wide campaign.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana’s new 6th District boundaries created a court-ordered second majority-Black district that favors Democrats and caused incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves to bow out of race. A victory here by Democrats would cut into the Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\nThe race: Amendment No. 1 to the Louisiana Constitution\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The proposed amendment would expand the dedication to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund to add federal money the state receives from offshore wind, solar and other alternative or renewable energy sources generated in federal Gulf waters off the state’s coast.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930s, about the size of Delaware. The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund provides money for projects to restore and preserve the Louisiana coast.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is being challenged by Republican Austin Theriault\n\nWhat’s at stake: Golden is running for his third term in Congress, but as a Democrat in a Trump-won district, he is particularly vulnerable to a Republican challenge. Not only are the party demographics stacked against him, but he also recently changed his position on assault weapons after Maine’s deadliest ever shooting in Lewiston last October. A district with a high proportion of gun owners, this may come back to hurt him in the election. While Golden is a blue dog, conservative Democrat, Theriault, a Republican state representative and former NASCAR driver, has tried to tie him to national Democrats as well as criticized him on the gun issue. The race will be an important one for determining which party will take control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe race: Maine state legislature\n\nWho is running: Every representative and senator in the Maine state legislature\n\nWhat’s at stake: Maine currently has a Democratic trifecta in state politics, with Democrats controlling the governorship, the state House, and the state Senate. The governor has two more years left of her term, but every seat in the legislature is up for reelection. Maine also has term limits on its legislators — they are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms — making the races more volatile and open than other states. While Democrats are the favorites to retain control, these factors along a national election with Trump on the ballot is causing Republicans to feel hopeful of capturing one of those chambers this year, more likely the House.\n\nThe race: Flag question\n\nWho is running: Measure to change Maine’s state flag\n\nWhat’s at stake: This measure would replace the current official Maine state flag, which is blue with the state’s coat of arms, with the former state flag, which features a green pine tree and the North Star on a light tan background. The former state flag, commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, was originally adopted in 1901 before being replaced by the current flag in 1909. It’s become a slightly controversial ballot measure, with some conservatives see changing the flag as a sign of “wokeness,” as the current flag features two white men next to the coat of arms. However, the Pine Tree Flag is already an iconic image, appearing on souvenirs, clothing and many flag poles.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Ben Cardin, who is not seeking reelection after serving three terms.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The eyes of the nation are on Maryland as the Senate race may help might decide the balance of power in the chamber. Though Larry Hogan has said he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, the shadow of presidential race holds major sway over this contest. Alsobrooks leads by double digits in many polls, but this one should still come down to the wire.\n\nThe race: Legislatively referred abortion amendment\n\nWhat's on the ballot: In 2023, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to refer an amendment to the state’s Constitution on abortion to voters. The state’s voters approved a related measure in 1992 with a majority voting to make the procedure legal. If the measure is passed, any future changes would require a future General Assembly to put the issue again before voters. If the measure fails, the procedure would still be allowed under current state law.\n\nWhat's at stake: Though this ballot measure in bright blue Maryland is almost certain to pass, by how wide a margin could have a big impact on Maryland's U.S. Senate race. Ads supporting Democrat Angela Alsobrooks have continuously singled out Republican Larry Hogan's personal opposition to abortion, though Hogan's campaign has stressed that he has publicly opposed to a federal abortion ban and as far back as when he first ran for governor, Hogan promised not to change Maryland’s laws protecting abortion access.\n\n— Keith Demko, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is being challenged by Republican John Deaton\n\nWhat's at stake: Warren has gained a national profile in her two terms as senator, compiling one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. She's been willing to break with party leadership on key issues such as immigration — voting earlier this year against a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and criticizing President Joe Biden's executive order on tightening the border. Deaton moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island only months before the primaries. The cryptocurrency lawyer has highlighted his rough childhood in the Detroit area while presenting a moderate stance on issues such as abortion — at times infuriating conservative Republicans in the process.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 2, Eliminating the MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nWhat's on the ballot: For more than 20 years, students have been required to pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests in math, science and technology, and English in order to graduate from a public high school in Massachusetts. If it is passed, Ballot Question 2 would eliminate the requirement.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The question has divided some of the most prominent Democrats in the state. Supporters include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Ayanna Pressley, James McGovern, Lori Trahan and William Keating. Opponents include Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kimberly Driscoll and Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. Supporters of the ballot question, including the state's teachers unions, say the test is a one-size-fits-all exam that does not properly evaluate student performance and achievement. Opponents, who include business-aligned groups as well as the state superintendents association, say removing the requirement would lead to a lowering of standards across the board.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 5, Minimum Wage for Tipped Workers\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Current law allows employers of service workers such as servers, bartenders and nail technicians to pay them as little as $6.25 an hour, as long as tips raise the workers’ pay to at least the regular minimum wage of $15. If they do not, employers must make up the difference. Question 5 would gradually eliminate the difference between tipped workers' minimum wage and the standard minimum wage.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the question passes, by Jan. 1, 2029, the statewide minimum wage would apply to all workers. The measure would also allow employers to pool tips to distribute to all their workers, as long as everyone on the payroll is paid the state minimum wage. Supporters of the ballot question say that tips should be a reward for good service, and not a subsidy for employers who pay less than minimum wage. The ballot question has been fiercely opposed by the restaurant industry, which warns passage will lead to higher menu prices for consumers, and will force restaurants to cut staff or even close.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served as a CIA officer in Iraq and as a Pentagon official, faces Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who served seven two-year terms before leaving in 2015 and rose the rank of House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is one of a handful of open seats in the U.S. Senate, the result of Democratic U.S. Debbie Stabenow’s decision last year not to run for a fifth six-year term, so it could play into which party ends up with majority control of the chamber. Democrats (and the independents they caucus with) currently have a one-seat majority. No Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since Spencer Abraham in the Republican wave of 1994. But with Michigan clearly in play as a presidential battleground, Republicans are hoping Rogers can ride what they are hoping is former President Donald Trump’s strength in a state he won in 2016 to a victory.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican former state Sen. Tom Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, faces former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., a member of a well-known Michigan political family who was a key aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Two years ago, Barrett lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in one of the most expensive House races in the nation in a redrawn district centered in and around Lansing, the state capitol. Slotkin is running for U.S. Senate this year and Barrett is back figuring that Hertel may be an easier opponent than his former rival who was known for raising scads of money and doing well in tossup districts like this one. Hertel, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on Barrett’s previous stance as an all-out abortion opponent, even though he says he will vote for anything that crosses protections put into the state constitution in 2022. With control of the U.S. House possibly in play, millions in outside spending have already poured into this race again.\n\nThe race: 8th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet faces Paul Junge, a former assistant prosecutor, TV anchor and official with the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Like the race in the 7th District, this is one which, if U.S. House races are close nationally, could determine which party holds majority control of the chamber. Right now, Republicans hold an eight-seat majority in the U.S. House. Even though this district, anchored by Flint, Bay City and Saginaw in mid-Michigan, has been trending more Republican in recent years, it was considered a likely Democratic hold until U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee last year announced he would leave at the end of this term, his sixth. KIldee’s late uncle, Rep. Dale Kildee, sat in the seat before him for 18 two-year terms.\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. John James, in his first term in Congress, faces a rematch with Carl Marlinga, a Democratic former Macomb County judge and prosecutor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This district, which includes much of southern Macomb County and parts of neighboring Oakland County, was widely seen as trending Republican when it was redrawn ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Democratic groups largely stayed away, figuring James, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who had run two strong but ultimately unsuccessful U.S. Senate races, would easily win. It was anything but easy in the end: Marlinga, who has been in and around Macomb County politics for decades and presents himself as a pragmatist and a moderate Democrat, came within about one-half of 1% of beating James, despite being outspent by a 6-to-1 margin. James is running on his record, saying he has worked to bring projects back to the district; Marlinga, now with some Democratic support behind him, is trying to portray James’ conservativism as out of step with the district.\n\n— Detroit Free Press, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Minnesota House of Representatives District 14B\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, is looking to keep his seat in the Minnesota legislature, which he first won in 2018. He is being challenged by Republican Sue Ek, who previously ran for office in 2005.\n\nWhy it matters: The Minnesota statehouse is completely controlled by the DFL, which is Minnesota's Democratic party. Republicans are looking to flip the House to end the DFL trifecta, and St. Cloud is historically a political battleground, with some candidates in District 14A winning by fewer than 200 votes. Wolgamott came under fire last fall after he got a DWI. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent is labeled as extreme with her vocal opposition against same-sex marriage, contraceptives and abortion access. LGBTQ+ issues remain a hot topic in the state. The DFL trifecta passed a law banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth last legislative session. In addition, the state passed gender-affirming care legislation for minors.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection. She is challenged by Republican Royce White, Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey and Libertarian Rebecca Whiting.\n\nWhat's at stake: Minnesota's U.S. Senate race is sparking a conversation about morals. White, a former NBA player, has been criticized for allegedly using past campaign funds at strip clubs. At a St. Cloud appearance, he told voters he is transphobic, alleged the \"woke left\" are trying to villainize Christians and said he's further right than former President Donald Trump. This in part caused former Republican, current Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey to run, saying conservatives needed another option. Despite the conversations, incumbent Klobuchar is polling significantly behind her 24-point margin of victory in 2018. Current 2024 polls show the Democratic senator having an 8- to 11-point lead.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic candidate Ty Pinkins, a Delta native, is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Pontotoc native who has been in office since 2008. If Pinkins' wins, he would be the first Democrat to occupy the office since John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989. While Pinkins' name became more common due to the 2023 Mississippi Secretary of State race in which Pinkins lost, he is polling at a mere 1% against Wicker.\n\nWhat's at stake: Pinkins' challenge to Wicker, if successful, would contribute to the Democratic defense of their majority in the U.S. Senate. A Pinkins victory would also take Mississippi's congressional ratio from five Republicans and one Democrat to four Republicans and two Democrats. While a Democratic win in this race is a long shot, how far Pinkins closes the 99-point gap with Wicker by Nov. 5 will be used as a starting line for future Democrats running for Mississippi's congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is running against Republican challenger Ron Eller, who has never won a political race. Thompson, who is favored to win, has been in office in Washington, D.C., since 1993 and has become something of an institution among national and state Democrats. Notably, Thompson has served as the chair of the Jan. 6 Investigative Committee, trying to unfold the chain of events surrounding a Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat's at stake: Thompson is the only Democrat from Mississippi in the U.S. Congress right now and has been so since 2011. If he were to lose to Eller, the state's largest Black and Democratic district would go red and Mississippi would not be represented by any Democrat in Washington, D.C., if Republican U.S. Reps. Trent Kelly and Mike Ezell, and Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker don't lose to their respective races.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court Central District, Place 1\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Jim Kitchens faces a challenge from four opponents for one of the state's supreme court judge seats. Kitchens was appointed to his seat in 2009, and it is uncommon for a judge to win a seat as a challenger to incumbents in Mississippi, according to state election records.\n\nWhat's at stake: Of Kitchen's opponents, one, state Sen. Jenifer Branning, R-Philadelphia, has been endorsed by the Mississippi Republican Party. The race, as well as the Mississippi Supreme Court, is supposed to be nonpartisan. With an endorsement from the state GOP, a Branning victory could mean a more conservative lean on the court. Kitchens is listed as a nonpartisan candidate, as well as Ceola James and Byron Carter, who are also running in that race.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court District 2, Place 2\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Dawn Beam has served on the court since she was appointed by former Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016. She faces just one challenger, David Sullivan, a South Mississippi attorney.\n\nWhat's at stake: Like in other races this year, the Mississippi GOP has endorsed Beam to beat Sullivan, who himself has so far been outraising Beam for the court seat. Judge positions in Mississippi and judicial races are known for being nonpartisan. Considering the endorsement for Beam, a Sullivan victory could signify a political shift. It would also represent a break from how judges usually win a Supreme Court seat, which is to be appointed and then reelected as an incumbent.\n\n— The Clarion-Ledger, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 3, abortion rights\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A ballot initiative amending the state Constitution to establish a “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” without government interference. While establishing a constitutional right to abortion, the amendment would still allow government regulation of the practice as well as restrictions on abortions that take place after fetal viability.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri was the first state to outlaw abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, enacting a trigger law passed in 2019. The heavily-funded effort to get the abortion rights initiative on the ballot has been opposed by Republican legislators and elected officials at every step, with the state Supreme Court weighing in at the 11th hour to keep it on the ballot.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is seeking a second term after flipping Missouri’s second Senate seat in 2018, when he defeated Democrat Claire McCaskill. Though polls still show Hawley favored to win, Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce, a former Marine, has closed the gap while significantly outperforming Hawley in fundraising. In addition, independent candidate Jared Young, who formed his own Better Party when establishing his candidacy, is running with the endorsement of former Republican Sen. Jack Danforth.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have established a significant advantage in Missouri over the past two decades and now control every statewide elected office, as well as both seats in the U.S. Senate. How competitive the race turns out to be is likely to highlight Hawley’s vulnerability as well as the effectiveness of Democrats’ strategy — Kunce is the second Missouri Democrat with a military background to run competitively for Senate. Young’s performance, meanwhile, could point to desire among moderates and conservatives for a return to a more balanced approach.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe faces Democrat Crystal Quade, who is termed out in the state House of Representatives, where she has served as minority floor leader.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri last elected a Democratic governor in 2012, when moderate Jay Nixon won a second term. In the years since, Republicans have taken every statewide office and hold supermajorities in the legislature. Kehoe, endorsed by outgoing Gov. Mike Parson, is heavily favored to win, but the race against Quade — a well-liked leader who has helped flip several seats for Democrats in conservative southwest Missouri — will show how much ground progressives need to make up to be competitive again. With abortion rights on the ballot and Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, conditions are as favorable as they’re likely to get for Quade to close the gap.\n\n— Amos Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate:\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is fighting for his fourth term against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Sheehy currently leads by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Tester is one of the last remaining Democrats in a heavily Republican state. His loss could almost guarantee a GOP Senate majority. Despite trailing in the polls, Democrats are heavily investing in Tester’s campaign, with outside groups spending tens of millions of dollars. Native American voter turnout, which played a crucial role in Tester’s previous victories, could be a deciding factor. Sheehy's comments about Native Americans and questions about his past have provided Democrats with attack lines. The outcome will likely come down to turnout and the effectiveness of both candidates’ ground games.\n\nMore: These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House\n\nThe race: Montana's Second Congressional District\n\nWho's running: Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking reelection, facing Democrat Monica Tranel in a rematch from 2022. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and interior secretary under Donald Trump, won that race by 4 points. Tranel, a former Olympic rower and energy lawyer, is giving it another shot after her narrow loss.\n\nWhat's at stake: This race could play a key role in deciding control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Zinke has moved further to the right, aligning closely with Trump on issues like the border and \"cancel culture.\" Tranel, once a Republican herself, has positioned her campaign as a fight for accountability and transparency in government. The district includes both Democratic hubs like Missoula and Republican strongholds, making it a competitive battleground.\n\nThe race: Montana Supreme Court justices\n\nWho is running: Voters in Montana will elect two new justices to the state Supreme Court in 2024. The race for chief justice features Jerry Lynch, a former federal magistrate, and Cory Swanson, an attorney with military experience. For the associate justice position, Katherine M. Bidegaray, a district court judge and ranch owner, is running against Dan Wilson, a former justice of the peace.\n\nWhat's at stake: The upcoming election is crucial as it could shift the ideological balance of the Montana Supreme Court. Currently, the court has three liberal-leaning justices, two conservative-leaning justices, and two swing voters. If both conservative candidates win, the court may lean conservative for the first time in years. However, if at least one liberal candidate secures a seat, the court will maintain its existing balance. Partisan groups are already making endorsements: Democratic-aligned organizations support Lynch and Bidegaray, while Swanson and Wilson receive backing from prominent conservatives, including Gov. Greg Gianforte.\n\nThe race: Montana abortion access\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Montana voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution. This measure seeks to protect a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling, which asserts that the right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice.\n\nWhat's at stake: This initiative comes as Republican lawmakers have tried to overturn the Supreme Court ruling since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2023 stating that the right to privacy does not safeguard abortion rights. Supporters collected over 81,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents attempted to block it. With abortion access becoming a hot button issue nationwide, the outcome in Montana could set a precedent for similar measures in other states.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fifth term in a race against Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race between Bacon and Vargas is seen as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year and is being eyed by national Democrats as an opportunity to flip a Republican seat in its attempt to regain a majority in the House. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District is deeply moderate and has gone for Bacon since 2016, despite flipping for President Joe Biden in 2020. Vargas ran against Bacon in 2022 and lost by nearly three points. Vargas has been polling just points ahead of Bacon in recent weeks and the Cook Political Report identified the race as a toss up in late September.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term against former union leader, steamfitter and independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nWhat’s at stake: A few months ago, the race appeared to clearly favor Fischer, who has broad financial and political backing in the deeply Republican state. That was the case until this summer, when polls conducted by Osborn’s campaign showed him and Fischer in a dead heat. Outside groups are pouring advertising money into both campaigns and the Cook Political Report recently changed the race’s leaning from solid-R to likely-R.\n\nThe race: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives: one aiming to expand abortion access in the state and the other looking to limit it.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While multiple states will see abortion on the ballot this election, Nebraska is the first since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to put competing measures before voters. One measure backed by Protect Our Rights, a coalition of reproductive rights groups in the state, aims to enshrine the right to abortion when it is “needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” as well extend abortion access up to fetal viability. However, it does not list a specific number of weeks. The other sponsored by Protect Women and Children would enshrine Nebraska’s current 12-week ban in the state Constitution with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman. It would allow the state legislature to pass narrower or complete bans in the future.\n\nThe race: Ballot measure on the legalization of medical cannabis\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Two measures aimed at legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Nebraska is one of the last states where the use of medical cannabis is still illegal. To combat Nebraska’s single-issue law, the group is sponsoring two separate measures. One would decriminalize the use of medical marijuana and create protections for patients and caregivers. The other would legalize possessing, manufacturing, distributing, delivering and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes and create a state commission to regulate the drug.\n\n— Maya Hoff, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats’ majority in the U.S. Senate is hanging by a thread, and Nevada’s seat up for election this year is considered competitive. Rosen, who prides herself on being one of Congress’ most bipartisan members, has an edge in the polls against Brown, an Army veteran who’s fully in former President Donald Trump’s camp. If Trump wins Nevada — the presidential race is within a single percentage point in the polls — his coattails could help Brown. In 2022, Catherine Cortez Masto — a well-liked incumbent Democrat with support from numerous prominent Republicans — won her U.S. Senate race by only about 8,000 votes. The Senate race may be a squeaker again.\n\nThe race: Ranked-choice voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A “yes” vote on the initiative would create primaries where the top five candidates regardless of party would move on to the general election.\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot race could upend Nevada politics for years to come by allowing nonpartisans — who outnumber Republicans and Democrats in the state — to participate in partisan primaries for state and federal races. Currently only Republicans and Democrats can vote in their own party’s primary races. Supporters think the initiative will create less extreme candidates because candidates will need to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and they say voters will have more choice because often only the two candidates with the most money get on the November ballot. Opponents say it’ll create confusion and could diminish the chances of independent candidates who would now have to compete with major party candidates in primaries. Only three states currently have ranked-choice voting: Alaska, Maine and Hawaii.\n\nThe race: Washoe County Question 1 — library funding\n\nWhat’s the ballot: Continue a dedicated funding stream for the Washoe County Library System or give the county commission more oversight of library programs.\n\nWhat's at stake: As part of the culture wars in a swing county of a swing state, Reno-area libraries have been the scene of heated protests and increased security. Of the 22 book challenges last year in Nevada libraries — most of those over LGBTQ+ content — all were in Washoe County. This summer, the library system ended Drag Queen Story Hours at its libraries, citing “violence against staffers … perpetrated by a small group of very vocal, very aggressive protesters.” A Drag Queen Story Hour protester — Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party — co-authored the official ballot argument against continuing the library’s dedicated funding stream. The dedicated funding stream represents about a quarter of the library system's budget. If the initiative fails, the library would have to appeal to elected officials to make up that shortfall.\n\n— Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces Democrat former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in an open seat race to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been the state’s popular Republican governor for eight years.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats are hoping to take back the governor's office in New Hampshire for the first time since 2016. The most competitive governor’s race in the country, Ayotte benefits from name recognition, while Craig is bolstered by Vice President Kamala Harris’ popularity in the state. Ayotte’s poor relationship with Trump as well as his lack of popularity in the state means she will likely have to run far ahead of the former president to win the seat. She has also faced attacks on her past votes on abortion policies, while Craig has faced attacks over homelessness in Manchester. While the state has trended more Democratic in federal elections in recent years, the state government has been controlled by Republicans. Ayotte currently holds a narrow lead over Craig in the polls.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is seeking a fourth two-year term to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District against Republican former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Russell Prescott.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a swing district, the moderate Pappas has dominated in recent years, proving his ability to win over voters from both parties. It is currently rated likely Democratic by the Cook Political Report. But Prescott is a less pro-Trump Republican opponent than Pappas has faced in the past, and his supporters hope this will help him unseat the popular incumbent and allow Republicans to take one of the two congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Maggie Goodlander faces Republican Lily Tang Williams in this open race seat to replace retiring Rep. Annie Kuster.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This seat leans likely Democratic, but features two unique candidates. A political newcomer, Goodlander is a former senior White House aide in President Joe Biden’s administration as well as the wife of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. She won a hard-fought primary against Kuster’s endorsed successor, Colin Van Ostern, proving herself to be a savvy campaigner and fundraiser. She is favored over Lily Tang Williams, whose American dream-esque story of escaping communist China allowed her to emerge victorious from a field of 13 Republican candidates.\n\nThe race: New Hampshire Executive Council District 3\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent Executive Councilor is seeking a third term to represent the Seacoast of New Hampshire in the five-body Executive Council. She is being challenged by Democrat former state Sen. Jon Morgan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Hampshire’s little known Executive Council has been dominated by a Republican majority of 4-1 thanks to heavy gerrymandering and has faced controversy for the Republican’s repeated rejection of funding for Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics in the state that provide basic, low-cost reproductive health care. Stevens is favored to hold onto her seat in the Republican-leaning district, but Morgan’s record of winning in similar partisan districts means he could be a legitimate threat.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, faces Republican Curtis Bashaw.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The contest will determine the future of the seat long held by former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was convicted on federal bribery charges earlier this year and resigned from the Senate. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to fill the seat until a successor is elected. Bashaw, a Cape May hotelier and businessman who is gay, has framed his campaign around moderate Republican positions familiar to New Jersey voters. Bashaw is pro-choice and has made his focus on government accountability and lowering spending. Kim, who has served in Congress since 2018 and was a diplomat in the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, prevailed in a competitive primary in which he held off a challenge from New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. Kim is focused on ensuring America’s global economic competitivesness and stabilizing affordability.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Faces Democrat Sue Altman\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Jersey’s sprawling 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of the Garden State itself and stretches across 95 municipalities in six diverse counties. The district includes urban, suburban and rural communities. Kean, first elected in 2022 after a career in the New Jersey Senate, is a moderate Republican who is focused on affordability and lowering government spending. Kean has endorsed former President Donald Trump. Altman, the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, is running on a platform that espouses women's and reproductive rights, safeguarding democratic institutions and asserting America’s leadership on the world stage. The race is tight, but registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by more than 14,000.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New Jersey\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Gabe Vasquez faces Republican Yvette Herrell\n\nWhat’s at stake: As a result of redistricting in 2020, New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from its traditional boundaries encompassing the conservative southeastern part of the state to include portions of blue-leaning central and northern New Mexico. The seat has bounced back and forth between the parties since Republican Steve Pearce left it to seek election to the U.S. Senate, with Yvette Herrell gaining the seat in 2020 from Democrat Xotchitl Torres Small, who she challenged in 2018. Herrell then lost it in 2020 to Gabe Vasquez. Herrells’ loyalty to Trump is reflected in her stand on abortion and enthusiasm for domestic drilling of crude oil and natural gas resources, positions in direct opposition to the governor and majority Democratic state legislature.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Martin Heinrich faces Republican Nella Domenici\n\nWhat’s at stake: Martin Heinrich has been at the forefront of developing New Mexico’s green energy transition, committing federal funds to establish wind and solar farms. Nella Domenici, daughter of Pete Domenici, a Republican who held New Mexico’s Senate seat for six terms, is following in her father’s conservative footsteps. Domenici says New Mexico should trade on its position in the Permian Basin, one of the largest oil producing regions in the U.S.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in office since 2009, is seeking another six-year term against Mike Sapraicone, a Long Island resident who owns a private security company.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Gillibrand is widely favored to win, New York state has seen some shifts in places from blue to red. Her margin of victory and where her numbers might slip from the 2018 election will be telling about New York’s political trends.\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: New York has one statewide ballot question for voters to decide this fall: whether to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state Constitution. New York's would ban discrimination based on \"reproductive healthcare\" and a host of other reasons unrelated to abortion, such as sexual orientation, national origin and age.\n\nWhat’s at stake: At a time when such rights are under attack in much of the country, this ballot measure’s fate will be instructive.\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional district\n\nWho’s running: First-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 17th Congressional District, one of the nation's most hotly contested swing districts — a seat Democrats lost in 2022 and need to recover to regain a House majority. Lawler eked out a narrow upset win in the suburbs north of New York City two years ago. If he retains his seat, that would reflect a reddening of these areas where residents have been concerned about immigration and crime. Jones is a former House member who saw his previous seat disappear in redistricting earlier this decade.\n\nThe race: 19th Congressional District\n\nWho’s running: Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro is seeking a second term in a rematch against Democratic challenger Josh Riley, former Dutchess County executive and a former state Assembly member.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In early autumn, this was the most expensive House race in the country, reflecting the importance of the seat in terms of which party will control Congress in 2025 and 2026.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New York\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Mark Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor, has caused shock waves in North Carolina and national politics for his incendiary comments, most recently after a CNN article alleged he made racist and sexual posts on a pornography message board, which he denies. Robinson, 56, is running against Josh Stein, the 58-year-old lawyer and current attorney general.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Abortion and education have become key aspects of this race. Although he’s flipped on his abortion stance, Robinson in the recent past has supported tighter restrictions. Stein is an outspoken reproductive rights supporter and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic. These candidates are also on opposite ends when it comes to funding education. Stein is fighting for fully funding public schools, and Robinson is supporting taxpayer funded private school vouchers. Robinson also used his time in office to investigate possible indoctrination of schools.\n\nThe race: Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nWho is running: Republican Michele Morrow is a former missionary and homeschool curriculum developer and nurse who is running against Democrat Maurice (Mo) Green, a previous superintendent of Guilford County Schools and general counsel and deputy superintendent for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Morrow, 53, has become a controversial candidate for her presence at the Jan. 6 riot and incendiary remarks posted on social media, recently posting on X that the “+” in LGBTQ+ stands for “Pedophilia.” Morrow supports private school vouchers and has said she wants an audit of federal money in North Carolina schools, claiming their money often comes with strings attached, WRAL reports. Green’s campaign has called Morrow a “dangerous” choice for students, and he supports fully funding public schools and rejects using taxpayer money for private school vouchers. Green, 56, also hopes to partner more with outside community organizations to support children's education.\n\nThe race: North Carolina Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is looking to keep her seat on the state’s high court after Gov. Roy Cooper appointed Riggs, a Democrat, to fill former Justice Mike Morgan’s slot on the bench in 2023, following his retirement. She is running against Jefferson Griffin, a Republican on the state court of appeals.\n\nWhat's at stake: Republicans already hold a 5-2 majority on the state’s highest court, which in recent years has upheld gerrymandered maps that could give Republicans even greater control in the U.S. House. But if Riggs, a Democrat wins, her party will have the opportunity to regain that majority in 2028. Griffin is close with N.C. Supreme Court Justice Paul Newby. (Newby won his seat in 2020 by just 401 votes against Cheri Beasley.) So far this election, Griffin has raised $1.3 million, to Riggs’ $1.1 million.\n\nThe race: Buncombe County Board of Commissioners chair\n\nWho is running: Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan is running for chair of the county board of commissioners as an unaffiliated candidate. His opponent, Commissioner Amanda Edwards, a Democrat, faces a steep fundraising gap.\n\nWhat's at stake: Duncan, a former Democrat, is trying to toe the line between parties. But he’s received sizable campaign contributions from notable area Republicans like former Congressman Charles Taylor. Buncombe County is home to Asheville and was hard hit be Tropical Storm Helene. Whoever wins will likely play a major role in the county's Helene recovery efforts.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The measure creates a new chapter of the North Dakota Century Code related to the legalization of cannabis and related regulation, according to North Dakota’s Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat's at stake: If approved, it would allow for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis and the possession and use of various forms of cannabis by individuals who are 21 years of age and older. It would also allow the state to regulate the industry and preserve employer rights regarding the use of cannabis products by employees, among its provisions. The measure includes revenues of $10,227,600, expenses of $8,324,275, and “an undetermined amount of additional costs associated with behavioral health and social impacts for the 2025-2027 biennium,” the website states.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Michael (Coach) Coachman, an independent; Kelly Armstrong; a Republican; Merrill Piepkorn; a Democrat.\n\nWhat's at stake: North Dakota caught a bit of attention this election season, when current Gov. Doug Burgum ended up on the short-list as a vice-presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. Last year, Burgum briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination and in January, he announced he would not seek a third term as governor, leaving the race wide open.\n\n— Shelly Conlon, Argus Leader, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno\n\nWhat’s at stake: Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year − second only to Montana Sen. Jon Tester − and the outcome in Ohio could determine which party controls a closely divided U.S. Senate come January. Former President Donald Trump also won Ohio by 8 points in 2016 and 2020. Polls show Trump easily winning Ohio again. This is the first time Brown has been on the ballot the same day as Trump, who has endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe race: State Issue 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A group called Citizens Not Politicians crafted a new way to draw districts and put the constitutional amendment on the ballot as Issue 1.\n\nWhat's at stake: The proposal would replace the current politician-run commission with a 15-member citizen commission of five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, currently the Republicans and Democrats. Members couldn't be elected officials, lobbyists or political consultants. During the last redistricting cycle, lawmakers and elected officials repeatedly drew legislative maps deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. Currently, Ohio Republicans dominate the redistricting process and hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nThe race: 3 seats on the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: Cleveland Democrat Melody Stewart and Cincinnati Republican Joe Deters, both incumbent justices, are facing off. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Deters to an unexpired term but Deters decided to challenge Stewart for a full term. Cleveland Democrat Michael Donnelly, an incumbent, is being challenged by Cincinnati Republican Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge making her first statewide run. Cleveland Democrat Lisa Forbes, an 8th District Appellate Court judge, and Columbus Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge, are both running for the seat left open by Deters' decision to challenge Stewart.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have held majority on the court for nearly 40 years. The Democrats are trying to reelect two incumbent justices and win an open seat. The GOP wants to expand its majority by sweeping all three races, which would give Republicans six of seven seats. Who controls the court has a major impact on issues including abortion and redistricting.\n\n— The Columbus Dispatch, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nWho is running: Republican Brian Bingman faces Democrat Harold Spradling and Libertarian Chad Williams in a race to replace outgoing Commissioner Bob Anthony. Bingman was the secretary of state until he stepped down last year to campaign for corporation commission.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The influential Corporation Commission regulates public utilities, oil, gas and other energy sources, commercial transportation and petroleum storage tanks. The three-person commission has been the subject of recent turmoil after witnesses reported seeing Commissioner Todd Hiett grope a man while Hiett was extremely intoxicated at a conference in June. Hiett has refused to step down, and Anthony launched an investigation into his colleague’s behavior. Anthony’s replacement will now help determine how the commission moves forward.\n\nThe race: State Question 834\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure put on the ballot by Republican lawmakers asks voters to tweak part of the state Constitution that defines who can vote as a “qualified elector.”\n\nWhat’s at stake: While only a few words would change, supporters say the move is needed to make clear only people who are legal citizens of the U.S. can vote in Oklahoma elections. Critics say the proposed change is targeting issues that don’t exist — routine audits of election results and voter rolls show the state’s election system is accurate and secure.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District, representing Oklahoma City and parts of central Oklahoma\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice faces a challenge from Democrat Madison Horn, a cybersecurity expert.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Oklahoma is a solidly red state, the metro area district Bice and Horn are vying to represent is turning purple. If voters send Horn to Washington, D.C., she would be the state’s lone Democratic representative in Congress. Her odds remain long, however. While Democrats are gaining ground in and around Oklahoma City, they’re still outnumbered by Republican voters. Republican incumbents are on track to retain Oklahoma’s four other seats in the U.S. House.\n\n— The Oklahoman, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Measure 118\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Measure 118, known as the Oregon Rebate, would raise the minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Oregonians will decide whether to raise the minimum tax rate by 3% for corporations with Oregon sales above $25 million a year and distribute the proceeds to every Oregonian, beginning in 2025. Passage would make Oregon the first state with a universal basic income program. State analysts estimate the measure would increase corporate tax revenue by $1.3 billion during Oregon’s two-year budget cycle. Proponents say the measure would decrease the state poverty rate by “rebating” some $1,600 a year to every resident. Opponents say the measure would result in increased costs and loss of businesses.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez DeRemer, R-Oregon.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in the U.S. House. Bynum twice beat Chavez-DeRemer for the Oregon legislature and seeks to flip the seat. Polls have designated the race as a “toss-up.”\n\nThe race: Oregon attorney general\n\nWho is running: Republican Will Lathrop and Democrat Dan Rayfield\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Oregon’s first attorney general election since the state’s 2020 drug decriminalization measure was passed and later dismantled. Lathrop previously served as a deputy district attorney in Yamhill and Marion counties, while Rayfield has been a member of Oregon’s House of Representatives since 2015 and served as speaker of the House from February 2022 until the end of the 2024 legislative session. Democrat Ellen Rosenblum, who has been attorney general since 2012, announced her retirement in 2023. With more than $2 million in combined spending, the race is the most expensive of Oregon’s three statewide elections. Oregon’s last Republican attorney general left office in 1993.\n\nThe races: Mayor of Portland and Portland city councilors\n\nWho is running: There are 19 people running for mayor, including three city commissioners, a trucking company leader, a stripper/author, and a nonprofit director. Ninety-eight candidates are running for 12 Portland City Council seats.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 2024 election will be the first using ranked-choice voting for the mayoral, auditor and city council races in Portland, Oregon's largest city. The new Portland mayor also will have a new job description. A voter-approved change in 2022 means the mayor will not have a vote on the Portland City Council unless there is a tie and will mostly serve in an administrative role.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is vying for his fourth term against Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO and high-ranking Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The Pennsylvania Senate seat is a must-win for Democrats seeking to retain control of the upper chamber, which they hold by a razor-thin margin. Casey, a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, has breezed through his past reelection battles. But McCormick does have the advantage of voter discontent with President Joe Biden and has worked hard to implicate Casey in the Democratic administration's perceived shortcomings on immigration and the economy. While the incumbent is favored, the race has narrowed, and a handful of polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat.\n\n— Bethany Rodgers, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Six-term incumbent Republican Scott Perry is facing perhaps his strongest opponent so far, Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson, a popular former TV news anchor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Control of the U.S. House could be on the ballot in this race. Perry, a former chair of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has not faced strong opposition during his tenure in Congress in a conservative district. But Stelson, a Republican turned Democrat, has hammered Perry for his positions on reproductive rights and has cast the election as a choice between anti-democratic views and her commitment to democracy. Perry was on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s fight to overturn the 2020 election, an effort that led the U.S. Justice Department to launch an investigation and seize Perry’s cell phone via a search warrant. That investigation has not resulted in any charges, and Perry has denied any wrongdoing. Political observers predict a close race in a district that became more competitive after the most recent redistricting. Polls show the race in a dead heat.\n\n— Mike Argento, York Daily Record, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is seeking a fifth term against Army veteran and Apache helicopter pilot Ashley Ehasz, who lost against Fitzpatrick in 2022 but now has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a “top-tier candidate” to flip a longtime red district in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nWhat's at stake: The 1st District is one of 33 congressional races the DCCC has highlighted in its Red to Blue campaign to maintain or bolster control of the House. The southeastern Pennsylvania district has been under Republican leadership since 2011, with Fitzpatrick cementing a reputation as the most bipartisan member of congress. Ehasz’s campaign has pushed back on that neutral image, saying the incumbent’s bipartisanship won’t extend to reproductive rights and threats to democracy.\n\n— Chris Ullery, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: Pennsylvania Senate, 49th District\n\nWho is running: Two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Dan Laughlin faces a challenge from the former chair of the Erie County Democratic Party Jim Wertz, a first-time candidate.\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats see district, which covers nearly all of Erie County, as being among the seats they can flip to take over the state Senate. Laughlin and Wertz, who used to trade emails about politics, also are engaged in a civil lawsuit. Laughlin claims the weekly Erie Reader and Wertz defamed him by publishing an opinion piece by Wertz — who was a contributing editor and writer for the publication before his state Senate bid — that accused Laughlin and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of seeking a pardon over the 2020 election. Laughlin had signed an amicus brief that specifically stated it was not taking the side of either the plaintiff or the defendant in the case Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was a hail-Mary attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\n— Matthew Rink, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking a fourth term against Republican state legislator Patricia Morgan, who lists her occupation as \"financial advisor.\"\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whitehouse, 68, a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, has been in the Senate since 2007, after he ousted Republican Lincoln Chafee. He is known for warning about the perils of climate change and \"dark money\" in campaign finances. Whitehouse was named Senate Budget Committee chair last year and turned much of its focus toward climate issues. More recently, he’s been one of the louder voices in Washington on term limits for the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan is a former state Republican chair, House minority leader – and unsuccessful 2018 primary candidate for governor – who has served in the legislature off and on for 12 years. She has attacked Whitehouse for supporting President Joe Biden on immigration and federal spending, among other issues. In announcing her candidacy, she took aim at inflation, the economy and \"massive and wasteful federal spending.\"\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Question 1 will determine whether there will be a constitutional convention\n\nWhat’s at stake: If voters approve Question 1 on Nov. 5 there will be an election to choose 75 delegates who will meet at a time and place to be determined to recommend amendments to the state Constitution that would be put up for approval at another statewide election. The last time voters called for a convention was 1984, and past conventions have taken on many shapes and sizes, from the 1973 convening that lasted a month to the 1964 affair that lasted four years. The last one cost taxpayers $891,000, or about $2.5 million in today's money.\n\n— Providence Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposed constitutional amendment on voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: South Carolina voters will see a proposed amendment to section 4 of Article II of the state Constitution reading “Must Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of this State, relating to voter qualifications, be amended so as to provide that only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law?”\n\nWhat’s at stake: The proposed change would alter one word of the state Constitution to have it read “only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law.” Although an investigation found no noncitizens were voting in the state’s elections, lawmaker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/16/john-glenn-centennial-passport-office-pileup-museum-chinese-reopens-news-around-states/117547550/", "title": "John Glenn centennial, passport office pileup: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A military base has ordered troops to show proof of vaccination in order to go without face masks as the state sees an uptick in COVID-19 cases – a rise attributed to low inoculation rates. The measure was put in place Tuesday at Fort Rucker, home of the Army’s aviation program. If a soldier is not wearing a mask, base leadership can ask to see a vaccination card. In a video posted to Facebook, base officials said the measure is needed because of rising case numbers on the base and in surrounding counties. Alabama, which has the lowest vaccination rates in the country, is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases. State Health Officer Scott Harris said that is likely driven both by the low vaccination rates and by the spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Alabama has risen over the past two weeks from 205.43 new cases per day June 28 to 559.57 new cases per day July 12. Only about 33% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, compared to about 48% nationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It’s not the vaccinated people that are getting infected for the most part, and if they do, for the most part they aren’t the ones getting sick in the hospital,” Harris said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Biden administration said Thursday that it is ending large-scale, old-growth timber sales in the country’s largest national forest – the Tongass National Forest – and will focus on forest restoration, recreation and other noncommercial uses. The U.S. Agriculture Department, which includes the Forest Service, also said it will take steps to reverse a Trump administration decision last year to lift restrictions on logging and road-building in the southeast Alaska rainforest, which provides habitat for wolves, bears and salmon. A 2001 rule prohibits road construction and timber harvests with limited exceptions on nearly one-third of national forest land. The Trump administration moved to exempt the Tongass from those prohibitions, something Alaska political leaders had sought for years. Restoring those protections in the Tongass would return “stability and certainty to the conservation of 9.3 million acres of the world’s largest temperate old growth rainforest,” the Agriculture Department said. Under the plans announced Thursday, large-scale, old-growth projects that were being planned for the forest will not go forward, Moore said. Smaller timber sales, including some old-growth trees, will still be offered for local and cultural uses such as totem poles, canoes and tribal artisan use, the federal agency said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s largest county approved nearly $3 million Wednesday for new vote-counting machines to replace those used in the 2020 election, which were given to legislative Republicans for a partisan review of the results. The GOP-controlled Maricopa County Board of Supervisors said the machines were compromised because they were in the control of firms not accredited to handle election equipment. Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, had said she would seek to decertify the machines if the county planned to use them again. State Senate Republicans used their subpoena power to take control of Maricopa County’s voting machines after former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence that the 2020 election was rigged against him in Arizona and other battleground states. The Senate hired Cyber Ninjas, a small cybersecurity consulting firm led by a Trump supporter who has spread conspiracy theories backing Trump’s false claims of fraud, to recount all 2.1 million ballots and forensically review voting machines, servers and other data. The firm had no prior experience in elections, and experts in election administration say it’s not following reliable procedures.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas on Thursday said it has asked a former Razorback challenging U.S. Sen. John Boozman to change his ads over their unauthorized use of the school’s trademarks. The school made the request after Jake Bequette launched his bid for the Republican Senate nomination with an online video touting his background playing for the Razorbacks and for the New England Patriots in the NFL. Boozman, a Republican, has held the seat since 2011. The video features footage and images of Bequette playing in his Razorbacks uniform, while a logo says: “Jake Bequette. Patriot. Veteran. Razorback.” “We have asked the campaign to modify its ads related to unauthorized use of the Razorback trademark for political purposes,” UA spokesman Mark Rushing said in an email. Bequette’s campaign did not say whether it planned to change or withdraw the ad. “Jake Bequette is proud of his time at the University of Arkansas where he was an academic All-American and All-SEC defensive end. He will continue to proudly call himself a Razorback,” the campaign said. UA made a similar request when Boozman, also a former Razorback, ran for the Senate in 2010. Boozman pulled a TV ad highlighting his time playing for the Razorbacks after the school asked that it be withdrawn.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County leaders are moving forward with a plan to return prime beachfront property to descendants of a Black couple who built a resort for African Americans but were stripped of the land by city officials a century ago. The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to pursue an action plan created by the county chief executive’s office on returning the land to the descendants of Willa and Charles Bruce once the state allows it. The county would be a sponsor of state legislation that is needed to enable the transfer. “We are on an important road to set a precedent that could be replicated across the country as we work to put actions behind our commitment to an anti-racist agenda and anti-racist county,” Supervisor Holly Mitchell said. The property that became known as Bruce’s Beach is along the shoreline in Manhattan Beach, now an upscale city. The land was purchased in 1912 by Willa and Charles Bruce, who built the first West Coast resort for Black people at a time when many beaches were segregated. They suffered racist harassment from white neighbors, and in the 1920s the Manhattan Beach City Council took the land away through eminent domain under the ruse of needing it for a park. The city did nothing with the property, however, and it eventually was transferred to the state in 1948.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A pre-pandemic shortage of licensed commercial drivers in the waste management industry has become worse, and now cities and companies are dealing with a shortage of workers to hoist trash and recyclables into trucks. Workers in the solid-waste industry were considered essential workers as COVID-19 started to spread, but now there aren’t enough of them, and many are likely looking for different lines of work or better pay, The Denver Post reports. Denver is working to hire more sanitation workers after cutting its budget and letting vacancies go unfilled when the pandemic hit, said Nancy Kuhn, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. The city provides trash and recycling collection services to 181,000 households and compost collection service to subscribers. Kuhn said Denver cut back on extra trash collection, which includes large items, from every four weeks to every eight weeks. In June, the city received 1,738 calls about missed trash pickup and 760 about missed recycling pickups. Denver makes about 724,000 trash collections a month. The solid waste industry is among those using signing bonuses to lure back workers as businesses emerge from cutbacks made because of the pandemic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State regulators have approved a plan to spur the building of infrastructure across Connecticut for charging electric vehicles. The state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority said the nine-year program approved Wednesday creates incentives for the building of fast charging stations, home charging stations and workplace charging stations, both for individuals with electric cars and for companies that have fleets of electric vehicles. The decision directs the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource Energy and United Illuminating, to provide incentives to customers who install the necessary equipment. Those include rebates of up to $500 to homeowners who make electrical upgrades to allow charging at home and up to $40,000 for owners of apartment buildings, condominium complexes and businesses that install charging areas. The program also would provide up to $250,000 for the creation of direct current fast-charging stations in the state. Those who install the equipment in low-income and distressed communities would get the largest incentives, PURA said. “We’re eager to bring a statewide charging program to our customers and are currently reviewing the details of PURA’s announcement to ensure it maximizes all potential benefits for our customers,” said Mitch Gross, an Eversource spokesperson.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Residents of Donovan Smith Mobile Home Park say the untreated wastewater surfacing above an older septic system in the center of the park affects the environment, their safety and their quality of life. “This place started out as travel-trailers and weekenders. They didn’t need a big septic unit,” said resident Samuel Saunders. “Now people live here full time, and these tanks won’t hold that. It bubbles up, and it’s bad.” The park owner, Donovan-Smith MHP LLC, was issued a notice of violation from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control on July 8 for unauthorized discharge to groundwater. According to the notice, the park never renewed its septic system permit after it expired in 2008 and has been operating without one since. The department continued to inspect the system annually despite being without a permit, the notice says. DNREC declined to provide inspection records, citing an “ongoing investigation.” Park manager Clara McNichols, when reached by phone, declined to comment.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Metro Board of Directors Safety and Operations Committee approved a proposal Thursday to temporarily ban certain riders cited for sexual or firearms charges while riding the transit system, WUSA-TV reports. The full Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board is expected to vote on the proposal at an upcoming meeting, but a date on that vote has not been set. Metro says it has seen an increase in sex offenses over the past 18 months. The hope is that a change to the passenger conduct policy would help cut down on those incidents. The first offense would carry a 14-day ban and the second a 30-day ban, but the third offense would bring a 365-day rolling suspension that starts the day the citation is issued. Transit agencies in other major cities have similar policies in place.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that it planned to build a new regional campus in central Florida to house at least 2,000 professional employees who will be relocating from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development. In a letter to employees, Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, said the move would allow creative and business teams to be better integrated. The company already has a theme park resort outside Orlando, Walt Disney World, that is the size of the city of San Francisco. The new Disney campus will be located about 20 miles to the east of Disney World, in a neighborhood by Orlando International Airport. “Florida is known for its rich culture of hospitality and active lifestyle as well as a lower cost of living with no state income tax,” D’Amaro said in the employee letter. While the company is still figuring out which employees will be asked to relocate, they likely will be in the parks division. Workers asked to relocate will have 18 months to make the move, D’Amaro said. “As someone who has moved with my family from California to Florida and back again, I understand that relocation is a big change, not only for the employee, but also for their families,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Former President Donald Trump is declaring his opposition to a high-ranking Republican’s bid for lieutenant governor, another sign of how state-level politics is being reordered by Trump’s insistence that all Republicans repudiate his 2020 election loss. Trump invited other Republicans to run against Senate President Pro Tem Butch Miller in a statement released late Wednesday. “I will not be supporting or endorsing Sen. Butch Miller, running for lieutenant governor of Georgia, because of his refusal to work with other Republican senators on voter fraud and irregularities in the state,” Trump said. “Hopefully there will be strong and effective primary challengers for the very important lieutenant governor position!” Trump weighed in as state Sen. Burt Jones of Jackson considers seeking the GOP nomination to succeed Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, whose support among Republicans collapsed after his outspoken defense of the Georgia election results that gave Joe Biden a narrow victory. Miller has not gone as far as Jones in promoting the false claim that Trump was cheated out of 16 electoral votes, but he counts Georgia’s restrictive new elections law among his top accomplishments and has said voters will support him as a conservative who gets things done.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. authorities launched an investigation and fined Louisiana tourists honeymooning in Hawaii after a video on social media showed a woman touching an endangered Hawaiian monk seal. The couple were “deeply sorry,” a man identified as Stephen told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “We love Hawaii and the culture. We didn’t mean to offend anyone.” A video posted on TikTok and other social media showed a woman touching the seal at a Kauai beach in June. The video showed her running away after the resting seal raised its head and snapped at her. There are an estimated 1,100 Hawaiian monk seals in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and 300 in the main Hawaiian Islands. It’s a felony to touch or harass a Hawaiian monk seal under state and federal laws, with penalties of up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine. The newspaper reports authorities from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contacted the couple over the weekend and assessed an undisclosed fine. Dominic Andrews, a spokesman for NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement, said an investigation is underway and declined to comment further.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Prisons in the state are so understaffed that correctional officers often end up working mandatory 16-hour shifts, leaving them just eight hours to sleep, eat and see their families before returning to duty, a prison official said. Idaho Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt told Board of Correction members about the staff shortages during a meeting Wednesday, saying roughly one-quarter of correctional officer positions are vacant. “We’ve seen a very alarming new trend in our staffing that is cause for concern for us,” Tewalt said, noting that there are about 180 vacant positions statewide. Most of the vacancies are in the five-prison complex south of Boise, where 156 correctional officer positions are vacant. That’s the lowest staffing rate the state has seen in the past six years, according to department data. The staff shortage means there are frequently not enough employees to allow prisoners to move normally throughout their daily schedule, forcing facilities to go on “restricted” status during which offenders may be denied time in recreational yards or day room areas. The shortage also means visiting hours can’t be held in some prisons. Prison understaffing can lead to dangerous conditions for workers and inmates and limit inmate access to programs designed to help them succeed upon release.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Frustrated with a lack of power to investigate unethical conduct by state lawmakers and an ethics reform bill on Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s desk that she considered counterproductive, the Illinois legislative inspector general said Wednesday that she will resign in December. Carol Pope, 67, a former Menard County state’s attorney and former circuit and appellate judge based in Petersburg, emailed members of the Legislative Ethics Commission to say she plans to leave Dec. 15. Pope’s term normally would be up in June 2023. Before Pope, the General Assembly went four years without a permanent inspector general. “The last legislative session demonstrated true ethics reform is not a priority,” Pope said, despite ethics reform legislation that overwhelmingly passed this year and was praised by Democrats and Republicans as a good first step. Pope, in her letter, said the legislative inspector general “has no real power to effect change or shine a light on ethics violations.” She said the position “is essentially a paper tiger.” Pope, a Republican and Melrose Park native who became legislative inspector general in March 2019, said the position needs more independence to be effective.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Less than one-third of elementary and middle school students recorded passing scores on the latest round of state standardized tests, results released Wednesday show, confirming education officials’ concerns that the coronavirus pandemic has fueled substantial learning losses. The Indiana Department of Education released results from the spring ILEARN exam that show 40.5% of students at or above proficiency standards in English/language arts and 36.9% at or above proficiency standards in mathematics. Only 28.6% of students statewide in grades three through eight tested as proficient in both English and math, a drop from 37.1% the last time the test was administered in 2019. State data showed “significant” gaps persist among racial, ethnic and socioeconomic student groups. For example, just 8% of Black students passed both the English and math sections, compared with 46.5% of Asian students, 34.7% of white students and 15.6% of Hispanic students. Indianapolis Public Schools, which has one of the highest proportions of disadvantaged students in the state, saw only 10% of its students pass both English and math. Neighboring Warren Township schools reported less than 8% of students tested proficient. In northern Indiana’s South Bend Community Schools, 7.5% of students had passing rates on both sections of the exam.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly 20% more Iowans died of drug overdoses in 2020 than in the previous year, as the powerful narcotic fentanyl became more prevalent, and the COVID-19 pandemic compounded people’s anxiety and isolated them from addiction treatment services. A new report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates Iowa suffered 419 drug overdose deaths last year, compared to 350 in 2019. Most neighboring states saw steeper increases in overdose deaths than Iowa did, although South Dakota was one of just two states in the country that recorded a decrease. “I think it really reflects how difficult the pandemic has been on people,” said Alison Lynch, a psychiatrist and family practice physician who runs the University of Iowa’s Addiction and Recovery Collaborative. “It’s shocking.” Lynch said in an interview that the pandemic sparked or worsened struggles with drug and alcohol abuse. Social isolation, economic stress and fears of catching COVID-19 often prompted people to drink alcohol or use drugs. And many people who had been in recovery from addictions lost the crucial support of in-person group sessions, such as Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A racial justice panel appointed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has recommended expanding Medicaid, adding another income tax bracket for top-income earners, restoring a food sales tax rebate, and banning Native American mascots and team names in public schools. The 15-member Commission on Racial Justice and Equity created the recommendations after meeting with Kansas Department of Commerce officials, Kansas Department of Health and Environment staff and others, according to the report. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly established the commission last year in response to the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The report comes months after the panel crafted recommendations primarily focused on policing. Some advocates in Kansas have pushed for Medicaid expansion for a decade. Kelly promised this year to continue to push to expand Medicaid in Kansas, despite top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature opposing it. The panel wants to expand Medicaid eligibility to 138% of the federal poverty level and cited an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimating that about 82,000 uninsured non-elderly adults in the state would become eligible for coverage if Kansas expanded its Medicaid program.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Concerns about cybersecurity have led the state to extend its search for a company to modernize its pandemic-stressed unemployment insurance system, Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration said Wednesday. The need for additional safeguards against hackers means the state will go through a rebidding process, said Jill Midkiff, a spokeswoman for the state Finance and Administration Cabinet. In doing so, the state will request enhanced security measures to protect the personal and financial information of jobless claimants, she said. The state is seeking a contract partner to overhaul its outdated technology for processing jobless claims. That search began about 16 months ago, and lawmakers were told last month that the state was in the “latter stages” of selecting a company to revamp the claims-processing system. But the need to provide enhanced cybersecurity forced the state to cancel the prior solicitation and rebid the contract, Midkiff said Wednesday. “The procurement was out for bid when Kentucky and most other states were targeted by one of the most sophisticated cyberattacks on our unemployment insurance system in history, which meant that significant additional elements needed to be added to ensure people’s bank accounts, and other information, could not be accessed,” Midkiff said in an email.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A policy governing the use of online social media and platforms by employees of the city unconstitutionally limits free speech, a lawsuit filed Thursday by two of the city’s library system employees claims. The Tulane First Amendment Law Clinic filed the suit on behalf of two employees of the city’s library system. One, Andrew Okun, is identified as a writer and editor “engaged in substantial online communications.” The other is Erin Wilson, who the suit says has a strong online presence and “engages in online humor and social commentary about the transgender experience and challenges gender stereotypes on multiple social media platforms.” Both reluctantly signed documents outlining the policies as a requirement of employment, according to the lawsuit, which focuses on a policy memo adopted last year that says employees can face discipline, including firing, for violations. Language deemed vulgar or offensive is off limits, according to the policy. It also instructs employees not to “engage or respond to negative or disparaging posts about city departments, employees or policies.” It specifically mentions a host of online sites where social comment can be made, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Slack, gaming sites and news websites.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state plans to study the burden student loan debt has on college graduates. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has signed a bill designed to study the impact of the debt. Democratic Sen. Mattie Daughtry, of Brunswick, proposed the legislation, which reinstates the state’s Commission to Study College Affordability and College Completion. Daughtry said Wednesday that the state needs to “make sure we understand how the cost of education, and the burden of student loans that come with it, is impacting Maine workers and our economy.” Daughtry cited that student loan debt in America is about $1.7 trillion, which is higher than the nation’s credit card debt. Maine’s average student loan borrower has more than $33,000 in school loans, Daughtry said. The senator said that is the sixth-highest average in the country. The commission is slated to provide a report to the Maine Legislature by January.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A jury on Thursday found the gunman who killed five people at a newspaper criminally responsible for his actions, rejecting defense attorneys’ mental illness arguments. The jury needed less than two hours to find that Jarrod Ramos could understand the criminality of his actions and conform his conduct to the requirements of the law when he attacked the Capital Gazette newsroom in 2018. The verdict means Ramos, 41, will be sentenced to prison, not a maximum-security mental health facility, for one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in the U.S. Prosecutors are seeking five life sentences without the possibility of parole. Survivors and family members of victims, some with tears in their eyes, embraced outside the courtroom and applauded prosecutors and jurors as they walked by after the verdict. “Having this going on for three years, it’s been a never-ending nightmare,” said Cindi Rittenour, the sister of Rebecca Smith, who died in the attack. “And then hearing that today – just all my anxiety over it, all the wonderings, the unknowns, it’s all gone away now, and all I feel is just relief and happiness. I feel like my sister can finally start to rest in peace.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston School Committee has unanimously approved an overhaul of the way students are selected for admission to the city’s elite public schools based on grades, an entrance exam and socioeconomic status. “We have come to a place where we are ready to move this district forward,” committee Chair Jeri Robinson said at Wednesday’s meeting. Under the new system, students will receive a composite score based on an admissions test and grades, then invitations to Boston Latin School, Boston Latin Academy and O’Bryant School of Math and Science will go out based on rank within eight socioeconomic tiers. Each tier will be allocated about the same number of places. The plan was opposed by some parent groups that wanted 20% of the spots at the schools set aside for the best applicants regardless of socioeconomic status. Superintendent Brenda Cassellius said she supported the change because it is easy to understand, maintains academic rigor and increases opportunity for disadvantaged students. “What is being considered tonight I believe to be a huge step forward for our students, especially our students who have not been able to access our exam schools through no fault of their own,” Superintendent Brenda Cassellius told the committee.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Canadian government has rejected a creative plan to have Ontario residents line up inside a U.S. border tunnel to tap into a surplus of COVID-19 vaccine held by Michigan, a mayor said. A white stripe was painted inside the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel in the Detroit River. Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens proposed that Canadians would stand along the border while health care workers jab them. “We’re not trying to send a man to the moon here. We’re using the infrastructure to accomplish a shared goal,” Dilkens said. “This is a sensible, reasonable alternative to vaccines heading to the landfill.” Motor vehicle travel between the countries is prohibited during the pandemic except for commercial truck traffic and workers deemed essential. Dilkens said partnering with Michigan, which has a vaccine surplus, would reduce the waiting time for Canadians who need a second shot. But the Canada Border Services Agency told Dilkens that the tunnel clinic could disrupt travel and carry “significant security implications.” Separately, Public Health Agency of Canada warned there could be trouble if the person giving the shot reached across the tunnel’s white line into Canada. More than 500,000 vaccine doses held by Michigan are set to expire by early August, said Lynn Sutfin, spokeswoman at the state health department.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order aimed at banning so-called conversion therapy Thursday but said it’s just a start and called on the Legislature to make it permanent. Minnesota is now one of about 24 states that, to varying degrees, ban mental health professionals from seeking to change a person’s sexual orientation. Eleven Minnesota cities already have local bans, including Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester and Duluth. Walz said conversion therapy is a “byzantine, tortuous practice” that’s not supported by any legitimate mental health organization. He said his order empowers state agencies to ensure that no Minnesotans under age 18 are subjected to it and that insurance companies don’t cover it. “There’s no place for hate in this state; there’s no room for division,” Walz said. “Our LGBTQ+ community is part, and a huge part, of what it means to be one Minnesota. When they are hurt or put through this, we all hurt. And when they succeed, we all succeed.” Attempts to get a ban through the divided Legislature failed in 2019. Sen. Scott Dibble, D-Minneapolis, said legislation is necessary to ensure a future governor doesn’t repeal the ban and to extend it to all Minnesotans. The Minnesota Family Council called the order an attack on the constitutional rights of patients, families and therapists.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge has ordered that an independent monitor be put into place to oversee the state’s embattled mental health care system. The monitor will be tasked with verifying data submitted by the state analyzing the success of its mental health services. A key measure will be whether it’s preventing unnecessary hospitalizations by allowing people to be treated in their communities. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled on a remedial plan for the Mississippi State Department of Mental Health late Wednesday. The order comes 10 years after the federal government issued a letter in 2011 saying Mississippi had done too little to provide mental health services outside mental hospitals. The Justice Department sued the state in 2016, and Reeves ruled Mississippi was in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Federal attorneys said during a 2019 trial that mentally ill people were being held in jails because crisis teams did not respond. They said people had been forced to live far from their families because mental health services were not available in their hometowns. They also said people made repeat trips to Mississippi mental hospitals because there was no effective planning for them to make a transition to community services, and the most intensive kinds of services were not being made available.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The state’s health department on Thursday reported the highest daily count of new COVID-19 cases since the dead of winter, and the association representing the state’s hospitals is warning that the health care system is potentially on the brink of a crisis. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services cited 2,302 newly confirmed coronavirus cases, the largest one-day count since mid-January, as the delta variant continues to spread in a state with one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates. Hospitalizations ticked up statewide by 47 to 1,331, as did the number of patients in intensive care units, rising by 19 to 409. Nearly half of the ICU patients – 196 – are hospitalized in southwestern Missouri. Greene County and Springfield leaders are asking the state to fund an alternative care site since hospitals in Springfield are near capacity. The Missouri Hospital Association, in its weekly COVID-19 update, called the situation in southwestern Missouri “dire” and said signals for the rest of Missouri are “foreboding.” Mercy Springfield was reporting pandemic-high numbers of hospitalizations. Meanwhile, Gov. Mike Parson suggested Tuesday that some of that area’s health officials are trying to find someone to blame and want to scare people into getting vaccinated.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s watercraft inspectors have intercepted a record number of boats carrying aquatic invasive mussels this year with nearly half of the boating season remaining, the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks said. Inspectors identified two infested boats last week, bringing this year’s total to 41, the Montana State News Bureau reports. The previous record was 35 boats intercepted last year. The number of inspections has remained about the same, officials said. Aquatic mussels have no natural predators and can clog water pipes and displace native species. All watercraft including non-motorized boats must be inspected when coming into Montana to prevent zebra and quagga mussels from becoming established in the state. Adult mussels can attach themselves to the bottom of boats and survive out of water for up to 30 days. Mussel larvae are microscopic and can float undetected in boat live wells, bilges and ballast tanks. Thomas Woolf, the state’s Aquatic Invasive Species Bureau chief, said there’s some continued increase in outdoor recreation due to COVID-19, and Montana residents have been buying boats in the Midwest, where mussels are established. “We’re also seeing people moving here bringing their boats,” he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Two weeks after the state quit publicly reporting daily coronavirus statistics, Nebraska launched a new website Wednesday to provide weekly updates on some of the information. The state’s decision to stop providing daily COVID-19 updates was widely criticized by health experts who use the data to track the virus’s spread. “I don’t think that was a well-timed decision,” said Dr. James Lawler, one of the leaders of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. “I think that if you are trying to drive down a rivet at night in the rain, blindfolding yourself is probably not the best idea.” Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Olga Dack said the state’s new website will be updated on Wednesdays with some of the latest information about the virus’s spread. The site includes the number of virus cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the state along with statistics on the vaccination campaign, but it doesn’t include as much detail as the previous version of the dashboard. Dack said part of the problem is that much of the data the state had been reporting previously is covered by state and federal health privacy laws, which were suspended as long as the state’s official virus emergency continued, but that ended June 30.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Washoe County Sheriff’s Office has been offering a “second chance” to motorists registered as organ donors by issuing a warning ticket as opposed to a fine for minor traffic violations. The Second Chance Organ Donation Awareness program was implemented this week through Friday because Wednesday marked the two-year anniversary of the death of Elizabeth “Lizzy” Hammond, a 9-year-old girl from Reno who saved three kids’ lives through the donation of her organs. At the discretion of the individual WCSO deputy, warning tickets are being handed out that note whether the offending motorist is an organ donor and give information about Donor Network West, the organization partnering with WCSO for the awareness campaign. “Through minor traffic infractions, we’ll pull people over and look at their card, and if their driver’s license indicates that they’re an organ donor, we thank them and then give them a second chance,” Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said. “Because they’ve taken that opportunity to give somebody else a second chance at life.” Balaam clarified that the program is for minor traffic infractions such as running a stop sign, minor speeding violations or not putting on a turn signal. “It’s not for your DUI or reckless driving cases,” he said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRochester: A nonprofit has announced its plans to convert a building in the city to a drop-in youth center for young adults and children facing housing insecurity. Currently, Waypoint supports about 130 young people in the state. The nonprofit offers a variety of social services including adoption, mental health counseling and child care, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Erin Kelly, program director for Homeless Youth and Young Adult Services, said the center will be a safe place for young people to be able to drop in to receive support and resources from trained adults. The new center will also provide young people with meals, charging stations for phones, a food pantry, showers and group therapy. Kelly said the center will be officially open in 2022.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A white man captured on video yelling racist slurs at his Black neighbors and later arrested on harassment and more than a dozen other charges will remain in jail pending his trial, a judge ruled Wednesday. Edward C. Mathews, 45, of Mount Laurel, who stood silently from the Burlington County jail during a remotely held detention hearing, poses a “high risk of danger to the community,” Superior Court Judge Terrence Cook said Wednesday. Wednesday’s hearing marked the first time Mathews appeared in court on charges that stemmed from early July interactions with his neighbors at their Mount Laurel housing complex. He stood in an assembly room at the county jail during the proceedings, wearing orange and with his arms behind him. Prosecutors have charged Mathews with 14 counts, including harassment, stalking and weapons counts. Assistant Prosecutor Jamie Hutchinson on Wednesday said Mathews began harassing homeowners association board members, who were all of color, over a year ago, including by smashing windows of a neighbor’s vehicle with a rock and smearing their car with fecal matter.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico spent $1.5 million to advertise the state during the Virgin Galactic space launch Sunday. The state paid the money to display New Mexico’s logo on video of the flight, KOB-TV reports. The flight saw Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson briefly rocket into space aboard the company’s winged space plane for the first time. A third of the money came from a $500,000 special appropriation by the Legislature to market and promote the state during the flight, and the rest came from the Tourism Department’s budget, department spokesman Cody Johnson said. “We actually have a conservative estimate of around $3.5 million in media value just from the event itself – and, again, that’s a pretty conservative estimate – because we’ve seen so much coverage and viewership of the livestream that it’s going to grow over the coming days and weeks,” Johnson said earlier this week.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A museum dedicated to telling Chinese American history marked its reopening to the public Wednesday, with an exhibit on Asian Americans and racism that it curated partially through submissions gathered during the pandemic and a surge of anti-Asian bias incidents around the country. The opening was a long time coming for the Museum of Chinese in America, not only because of the more than yearlong pandemic shutdown but because of a fire that ravaged though the space where its collection was housed in January 2020. Luckily, most of the collection was salvaged. Looking back, there was a question of “how were we going to survive, but we kept pivoting,” said Nancy Yao Maasbach, the museum’s president. That included a lot of virtual programming, including the call for submissions that became part of “Responses: Asian American Voices Resisting the Tides of Racism.” The exhibition’s outer walls are a running history of sorts, a timeline showcasing the racism and bigotry that’s been turned toward Asian Americans throughout their generations in the U.S. They touch on how stereotypes connecting them and disease have a long history, along with more recent issues like the treatment of Middle Eastern and South Asian communities in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks and the anti-Asian bias of the pandemic.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state House gave its final approval to wide-ranging energy legislation during an unusual overnight session early Thursday. The chamber met briefly after midnight to complete the second of two required votes on the measure, which now heads to the Senate. The first vote happened early Wednesday evening, but Democrats unhappy with the legislation blocked an immediate second vote. House Speaker Tim Moore announced the Thursday session would begin at 12:01 a.m. because several colleagues would be unavailable to vote during the daylight hours. The bill pushed by Republican leaders would retire early several Duke Energy power plants fueled by coal and expand solar production. The measure also lets Duke Energy seek multiyear rate increases, rather than year by year, and directs the utility to find a location for a new type of nuclear power plant. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and many manufacturers are among the bill’s opponents, citing in part costs to ratepayers and the shift of authority away from the state Utilities Commission. Environmental advocates say the coal-fired plant retirements rely too much on shifting to natural gas for electricity. Thursday’s final vote of 57-49 included five Republicans who voted against the measure. Roughly a dozen House members had excused absences.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The same stronger-than-forecast oil prices that are swelling the state’s treasury also could shrink dollars for road construction next year, officials said Thursday. Oil is used for road construction and making asphalt. The state Department of Transportation already has approved 174 contracts for road, bridge and other projects this year that total $350 million, agency spokesman David Finley said. Bids on those projects came in earlier this year before oil prices began surging, he said. Bids for next year’s construction projects will begin coming in November, but most will come in spring 2022, Finley said. Steve Salwei, DOT’s director of transportation programs, said none of the state-funded projects being done this year are affected by higher crude prices. Next year, however, things may be different. “We can only construct with money we have to pay for it,” he said. Contractors appear to be ample at present, and bidding competition could lower project costs, Salwei said. The state typically is required to match 20% of federal funding used road construction, Salwei said. North Dakota’s share of the funding won’t be known until a new federal highway bill is passed, he said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: John Glenn’s birthplace and childhood hometown are joining forces to celebrate what would have been the history-making astronaut and U.S. senator’s 100th birthday with a three-day festival. Glenn, who died in 2016, was the first American to orbit Earth, making him a national hero in 1962. Before that, he served as a military fighter pilot in World War II and the Korean War and set a transcontinental air speed record. In 1998, he became the oldest person ever to go into space at 77. He spent 24 years as a Democrat in the U.S. Senate. Running Friday through Sunday, the John Glenn Centennial Celebration is a collaboration between Cambridge, where Glenn was born July 18, 1921, and nearby New Concord, where he grew up and met his late wife, Annie, who died last year at 100 of complications from COVID-19. The celebration will include a Friendship 7-Miler race between the two communities and a Friendship 7 parade, both named for the aircraft Glenn rode during his famous orbit. Also planned are a presentation by space shuttle astronaut and fellow Ohioan Don Thomas, rocket car rides, space movies, and rides in the type of biplane a young Glenn flew over Cambridge to become hooked on aviation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials notified the Oklahoma County Detention Center on Tuesday that all juvenile inmates must be removed from the jail by Friday after a surprise inspection found numerous deficiencies at the problem-plagued jail. The Oklahoma State Department of Health notified the jail of numerous violations in a 61-page report from the June 23 inspection, including inadequate screenings of incoming inmates, failure to conduct proper inmate counts and obscured windows on cell doors that prevented proper “sight checks.” Jail administrator Greg Williams acknowledged in a statement that more improvements were needed but said he does not agree with all the report’s findings. “Decades of physical plant neglect and poor construction cannot be overcome in a few months,” Williams said. Only one current jail inmate meets the state’s definition of a juvenile, he said, and that person was expected to be transferred to the Oklahoma County juvenile detention facility before Friday’s deadline. Jail operations were taken over last July by a trust, which has drawn criticism for inmate deaths, escapes, assaults, and a hostage situation in which an inmate was fatally shot by police after beating and stabbing a jailer.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Nearly 50 years after the Macleay landfill closed, Marion County is considering turning the rolling field on top of it into a park. The county is gathering public input and fielding ideas about what the land 7 miles southeast of downtown could become. So far, contenders include a bike park, a disc golf course or maybe both. “It is beautiful,” said Tom Kissinger, program supervisor of Marion County. “On a clear day, you can see Mount Adams and Mount Hood, even Mount St. Helens.” Some neighbors are less enthusiastic about the idea, however. Discussions began after the county sold Auburn Park to Salem-Keizer Public Schools in 2019 for an expansion of the adjacent Auburn Elementary School. The 4.37-acre Auburn Park was bought in two parcels with Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars in 1977 and 1979. By law, any sale of LWCF land must be balanced by the acquisition of another park of equal or greater economic and recreational value. That’s when “the idea came up of using the old Macleay landfill” for a park, Kissinger said. But multiple commenters on the county’s Facebook post about the land expressed concerns about contamination from the landfill and said they foresee an increase in the problem of people using the vacant land for camping and waste-dumping.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Six of Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities will be consolidated into two new institutions under a unanimous vote Wednesday by the State System of Higher Education’s governing board. Bloomsburg, Mansfield and Lock Haven universities in northern Pennsylvania will form one institution and California, Clarion and Edinboro universities in western Pennsylvania the other. The change will be phased in, starting later in 2022. They will have new names that have not been selected, but the plan is to keep all six campuses open with their own identities and brands, including existing sports teams. Both new institutions will have their own presidents and top administrators. The university system wants to cut student costs by 25% by getting them to graduate more quickly, enrolling high school students, raising more money from donors and grants, and expanding federal work-study offerings. There are 94,000 students in PASSHE, as it’s known, and enrollment has fallen by more than 20% since 2010. Chancellor Daniel Greenstein said students enrolled in the affected universities will be able to finish their degrees, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. In-person instruction and residences on campus will remain.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPortsmouth: The only home on a small island in Narragansett Bay has been sold. The 600-square-foot, off-the-electrical-grid cottage on Patience Island – with the unique address of 0 Patience Way – sold for $365,000, according to public records, lower than the $399,900 asking price when it was first listed in April. Realtor Michael Russo announced the sale on his Facebook page Tuesday. “Congrats to all parties involved with this special sale!” he wrote. He did not disclose the buyer, and the sale had not been recorded in town property records. The seasonal cottage comes with just under a half-acre of land, two bedrooms, a kitchenette, a half-bath and what is described as a “picturesque front porch.” Even though it’s off the grid, a single solar panel provides some electrical services. The island, officially part of the town of Portsmouth, covers about one-third of a square mile. According to property records, the cottage was built in 1972 and had been owned by the same family since.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina’s president has indicated he does not plan to ask the Legislature for permission to change the names of nearly a dozen campus buildings that a special committee says honors racists and Civil War figures. Instead, interim university President Harris Pastides said he will encourage school leaders to concentrate on honoring deserving people on new buildings with the same committee suggesting a number of prominent Black leaders. The police killing of George Floyd in May 2020 led to the removal of building names and statues to racists and Confederates across the South. None of that happened in South Carolina because of a law called the Heritage Act passed in 2000 that requires a two-thirds vote from the General Assembly to change the name of any building based on a historical figure. In the past 21 years, lawmakers have not even taken a vote on any request from the Civil War or segregation eras. The University of South Carolina has a special committee that has been studying building names across campus for two years. It found 11 that members felt were named for racists, including a health center named for U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond, who died in 2003 and started his political career fighting against people who wanted to end segregation, according to a draft report obtained by The State newspaper.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Thursday fired the warden and deputy warden of the state penitentiary, following an investigation into an anonymous complaint that alleged supervising corrections officers regularly sexually harassed their fellow employees. The governor had suspended Darin Young, the former warden, on Tuesday, along with Secretary of Corrections Mike Leidholt. Noem said Thursday that she has also suspended Stefany Bawek, who was the director of a prison work program called Pheasantland Industries. The anonymous complaint released by Noem’s office alleges that supervising corrections officers at the prison were allowed to sexually harass employees and that attempts to report the harassment were ignored. The complaint says that schedules at the prison were adjusted so the officers could “work in the same vicinities as their interest/victims” and that employees who did not give in to the harassment were made to “suffer by being placed in less desirable posts.” The complaint further alleges that employee morale was low amid wages that lagged other industries, that corrections officers did not have body armor that was “up to standards,” and that promotions were based on personal connections. Nome’s statement said the investigation into the complaint is continuing.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s former top vaccination official received a dog muzzle in the mail a few days before she was fired this week in what she has said was an attempt to use her as a scapegoat to appease lawmakers. “Someone wanted to send a message to tell her to stop talking,” said Brad Fiscus, the husband of Dr. Michelle Fiscus. “They thought it would be a threat to her.” Michelle Fiscus had been facing harsh criticism from Republican lawmakers over the Tennessee Health Department’s outreach efforts to vaccinate teenagers against COVID-19. At a June legislative session, in which some lawmakers threatened to defund the Health Department, they specifically referenced a letter Fiscus sent to medical providers explaining the legality of allowing them to inoculate children 14 and up without parental consent. Fiscus was fired Monday. Her termination letter does not explain the reasoning for her dismissal, and a Health Department spokesperson has declined to comment on it. Brad Fiscus said his wife received a box in Amazon packaging containing a black dog muzzle at her office about a week before she was fired. But he said Michelle Fiscus was “taking it in stride” and continuing to “speak truth.” “She said, ‘Whoever sent that must not know me very well. That’s for a beagle, but I’m a pit bull,’ ” Brad Fiscus recalled.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Early in the pandemic, the Design Institute for Health, a joint program from Dell Medical School and the College of Fine Arts at the University of Texas at Austin, studied the best way long-term care centers could help staffers follow sanitation guidelines. The institute’s team looked at creating clear signage about personal protective equipment, for example, and how to design stations for putting on that equipment and sanitizing hands. One finding of that initial study, paid for by a $410,822 grant from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, was that the effectiveness of infection control was directly related to the satisfaction of the workforce in the long-term care centers. The Design Institute for Health now is running three new pilot programs at three local long-term care centers, all of which participated in the previous study. The city of Austin and Austin Public Health are funding the $90,000 project, which began Monday. The first pilot program tries different design strategies to make the physical environment better for the staff and create spaces for breaks. Traditional breakrooms have been closed to staff during the pandemic. The second pilot program looks at what resources and partnerships can be created to help people working in long-term care centers.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The drought and COVID-19 pandemic have combined to make for a difficult year for agriculture, but the state’s farmers are finding ways to make the most of it. Utah farmers created a statewide food distribution program last year aiming to get food to hungry residents and their families, and managers announced this week that the “Miracle Projects” administered via the Miracle of Agriculture Foundation had helped serve more than 1.5 million pounds of food to more than 35,000 hungry people statewide. At the same time, farmers and ranchers were looking for additional ways to get their food products directly to consumers. Now, members of the Utah Farm Bureau are pushing to find new ways to fund the program and keep it going while still supporting area farmers and ranchers. Farmers Feeding Utah Inc., established to make buying local products convenient and reasonable, kicked off recently with a Utah-product-only subscription box that delivers new products to people’s doorsteps every month. Those interested can subscribe at Box.FarmersFeedingUtah.com. Each month’s box will include new products. Subscribers will also receive exclusive access to an online marketplace where they can purchase their favorite items from the boxes.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: The U.S. Passport Agency ended its no-appointment walk-in service at its Vermont office after it was overwhelmed by people seeking the documents amid a backlog of 1.5 million requests, the State Department said Thursday. Dozens of desperate travelers from throughout the Northeast had been traveling to the St. Albans office after getting word that people could get passports on the spot and struggling to make appointments at other offices. The Vermont Passport Agency had been offering appointment slots from no-shows to last-minute customers on its premises, the State Department said in a statement Thursday. The agency has “discontinued this practice due to unintended safety and security consequences,” it said. More than 20 people, including small children, were waiting outside the Vermont office Thursday despite the policy change. On Wednesday, the State Department said the wait for a passport is now between 12 weeks and 18 weeks, even if people pay for expedited processing, because of ripple effects from the coronavirus pandemic. Currently, the State Department is accepting appointments at the Vermont Passport Agency and other public passport agencies for life-or-death emergencies. A limited number of appointments for urgent, non-life-or-death travel within 72 hours can be made online.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: After a pandemic-enforced hiatus in 2020, a popular summer event is making a comeback. While COVID-19 restrictions forced the cancellations of the island’s biggest event – the Chincoteague Pony Penning held each year in July – a small event that still attracts hundreds each year during that same time period is returning. From July 22 to 24, blueberry aficionados can sample the juicy berry in a wide variety of creations while browsing through arts and crafts at what is billed as the “largest fine arts and crafts event on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.” The 33rd annual Blueberry Festival promises plenty of blueberry treats for attendees, along with live entertainment and both indoor and outdoor exhibits featuring artists and crafters from the Shore and beyond. The festival will take place from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. each day at the Chincoteague Center. In addition to popular blueberry=themed foods such as ice cream, pie and cakes, four food vendors will be on hand, offering options including pizza, seafood, and Middle Eastern and Mexican specialties. Live music will be offered throughout the three days of the festival, featuring popular returning and new acts.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A civilian police watchdog group has found that an officer repeatedly worked over 90 hours a week and earned so much overtime that he was the highest-paid city employee one year at more than $400,000 – and none of his supervisors noticed. The review by Seattle’s Office of Police Accountability of the case of Officer Ron Willis found 15 times in which he worked more than 90 hours a week in 2019 and identified numerous gaps in the Seattle Police Department’s ability to monitor overtime, The Seattle Times reports. In a letter to interim Chief Adrian Diaz, OPA director Andrew Myerberg urged the police department to track hours in a centralized database or require the department’s human resources staff to “flag employees who may be working excess hours.” As a result of the review, Willis was suspended for one day without pay for working more than the maximum hours allowed by department rules. A police spokesperson said Willis wasn’t available for comment, and efforts to reach him by the newspaper weren’t successful. The police department has long struggled to monitor overtime and has been the subject of multiple critical findings from city auditors and the oversight group.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: Gov. Jim Justice visited Thomas Jackson’s office at West Virginia University’s Robotic Technology Center in Fairmont on Wednesday to present the latest million-dollar prize in the state’s vaccination sweepstakes, according to a news release. Justice was accompanied by his pet English bulldog – Babydog – who is the mascot of the “Do It for Babydog” vaccination sweepstakes. The Republican governor also surprised two residents with brand-new, custom-outfitted trucks and two more with four-year scholarships to any public institution in the state. Other West Virginians won lifetime hunting and fishing licenses, custom hunting rifles, custom hunting shotguns, and weekend getaways to West Virginia state parks. Earlier in the week, Justice confronted outlandish conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines and set higher targets for vaccinating residents age 50 and older. He said at a news conference Tuesday that he recently had a meal with a group of people who believed in the baseless conspiracy theory that “there was something in the vaccine that would enable the federal government to track us.” The governor dismissed it and urged more people to get their shots. “It’s just a stretch beyond what I can believe,” he said. Justice noted that the phones people carry around with them have more tracking potential.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: Gov. Tony Evers joined local and state economic leaders in the city Wednesday to announce that he will direct $130million in federal funding toward workforce development programs. The funds, which come from the state’s American Rescue Plan Act allocation, will be spread across three programs that will help regions find solutions to workforce challenges and help unemployed or underemployed workers find job opportunities. The Democratic governor said there is “no one-size-fits all-solution” to workforce challenges. “I’ve heard from many Wisconsin business owners, employers, out-of-work job-seekers that while employment in Wisconsin continues to grow, our economy is facing obviously a workforce shortage. A shortage that existed well before I became governor but has been made worse obviously by this pandemic,” Evers said. Wisconsin’s unemployment rate in May 2021 – the most recent month reported by the state – was 3.9%, tied for the 10th-lowest in the country, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The largest block of funding will provide grants to at least 10 local and regional entities with about $10 million each to help meet needs including child care, transportation and housing. Evers said that funding would go out sometime in the fall.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A magician and comic has canceled performances at libraries in northeastern Wyoming because of threats over a social media post about her being a transgender woman, she said. The Campbell County Library posted on its Facebook page that Mikayla Oz, 24, was canceling shows planned for Wednesday and Thursday in Gillette and Wright out of safety concerns for herself, library staff and patrons, the Gillette News Record reports. The fact that Oz is a transgender woman was shared on a social media post, leading to misinformation about her performances and calls to protest the events, library officials said. Oz, from Des Moines, Iowa, has performed at libraries, schools and other events. She said the show she planned is family-friendly and doesn’t have an LGBTQ message. She was initially willing to do her show despite some complaints, but then she started receiving violent and frightening threats online and by telephone, she said. Library director Terri Lesley said her staff also received threats from a patron. Oz’s gender identity was not previously known to library staff, nor is it something they consider relevant, Lesley said. “It just breaks my heart, especially when my show has absolutely nothing to do with my back story at all,” Oz said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/16/casa-bonita-mypillow-poke-banksy-exhibit-news-around-states/118354866/", "title": "Casa Bonita, MyPillow poke: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The Rocket City has overtaken the Magic City as Alabama’s largest, according to new census numbers. Huntsville, with a population of 215,006, is now slightly more populous than Birmingham, according to U.S. census numbers released Thursday. Birmingham, which had long been Alabama’s largest city, has a population of 200,733. And the capital, Montgomery, is biting at its heels in third, with 200,603 residents. However, the Birmingham metro area remains the largest in the state. The Birmingham-Hoover metro statistical area has 1.1 million people, while the Huntsville metro area has just 491,723. Huntsville, with historical ties to the space industry, has seen rapid growth over the past ten years, partly fueled by the tech and manufacturing sectors. The city’s population has jumped by 19% since 2010. “I’m proud that the great things we have going on in Huntsville have grown our city,” Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle wrote in a tweet. “To tell the truth, we’re more focused on being the best than the biggest.” Birmingham got the nickname the Magic City for its rapid growth and had long been Alabama’s largest city. Much of the recent growth around Birmingham has been concentrated in the surrounding suburban areas, rather than in the city itself.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm is spending two days in the state traveling with Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski to showcase what Granholm’s office calls Alaska’s status as “America’s living laboratory.” The visit coincides with the recent passage of the bipartisan infrastructure deal and is intended to show how investments and research and development funding “will bring jobs and help build the state’s clean, secure energy future,” Granholm’s office said. The visit started Sunday in Fairbanks with a tour of the National Renewable Energy Lab’s Cold Climate Housing Research Center, highlighting its training of a local workforce to build and rapidly deploy shelter for climate-threatened communities in an effort to reduce the need for relocation. Also on Sunday’s agenda was a tour of the Permafrost Tunnel Research Facility and the Chena Hot Springs Renewable Energy Fair. On Monday, plans call for visiting the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, where researchers are developing ways to achieve 100% renewable power for rural villages. In Anchorage, Granholm and Murkowski will speak with Malcolm Woolf, president of the National Hydropower Association. The visit is set to conclude with a meeting with Alaska Native engineering students and alumni.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A coalition of educators, parents and advocates for children is asking a judge to overturn several new state laws that restrict the power of local governments and school districts to impose COVID-19 requirements, arguing the statutes violate constitutional rules and pointing out the state is seeing a growing number of coronavirus cases among children. A new lawsuit filed Thursday against the state by the Arizona School Boards Association, a teacher’s union and others challenges a law that prohibits cities, counties and public school districts from imposing mask requirements on students and teachers. At least 11 districts accounting for 140,000 students and more than 200 schools have defied the law by imposing their own mask rules. The coalition also is seeking to overturn a law prohibiting colleges and universities from requiring COVID-19 shots for students and making them reveal their vaccination status, as well as another statute that forbids communities from establishing vaccine passports for people to show they were inoculated. The lawsuit argues elements of the legislative proposals with limits on local government had violated constitutional rules requiring laws to focus on only one subject and have their contents reflected in the title of the bills.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Most public school students in the state will be required to wear masks when classes begin this week, following moves by dozens of districts in response to a judge blocking Arkansas’ mask mandate ban. At least 60 public school districts and charter schools have approved the requirements in the past week. The pace at which districts have approved the mandates surprised even public health experts who say masks are needed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, especially as the ultra-contagious delta variant fuels a surge in cases and hospitalizations. “I think those actions are going to prevent some superspreader events that would have occurred,” said Dr. Joe Thompson, president and CEO of the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. Some form of mask mandate has been approved in the state’s 10 largest school districts. The biggest, Springdale, approved a requirement but only for students in kindergarten through seventh grade. The Little Rock School Board, which sued over the state’s mandate ban, voted Thursday to require masks be worn indoors by students and staff. Republican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge announced Friday that she’s appealing Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox’s Aug. 6 preliminary injunction against the mandate ban. Fox ruled the ban violated the Arkansas Constitution.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: A McDonald’s franchise has settled a lawsuit by employees who said the owner gave them masks made from dog diapers and coffee filters to guard against the coronavirus. Thursday’s settlement requires the owner to provide masks and gloves to all workers and provide other health and safety measures required by a judge last year, such as regular temperature checks. The franchise owner didn’t acknowledge any wrongdoing in the settlement. The measures will remain in place for a year unless government health agencies no longer recommend them. The Telegraph Avenue outlet shut down for a month beginning in May 2020 after 20 workers refused to show up, contending that 25 workers and their families, including a baby, had come down with the coronavirus. After the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020, employees asked for masks but received dog diapers and coffee filters as a stopgap measure, and when they eventually received masks intended for one-time use, they had to wear them for several days, the employees alleged. Three of the employees who sued also alleged that they were required to work despite having COVID-19 symptoms, and all later tested positive for the virus.\n\nColorado\n\nLakewood: The creators of the irreverent animated television series “South Park” are buying Casa Bonita, a quirky restaurant in suburban Denver that was featured on the show. Matt Stone and Trey Parker said in an interview with Gov. Jared Polis on Friday that they had come to an agreement with the current owners of the restaurant, which closed to diners in March 2020 as the pandemic took hold. It declared bankruptcy in the spring. “We’re excited to work with everybody and make it the place we all want to make it,” Parker said. The Lakewood restaurant has been in business since 1974 but gained wider recognition when it was featured on a 2003 “South Park” episode and when the Denver Broncos announced some of their draft picks there in 2018. The Mexican restaurant is known for its decor, which includes a pink facade and large indoor waterfall, as well as its cliff divers and skits that feature an excitable actor in a gorilla costume. But some have noted there is room for improvement. “The one area that we would all love to see an upgrade – and I think I speak on behalf of everybody who patronizes Casa Bonita – is the food could be a little better,” Polis said. “I think it could be a little more than a little better,” Stone added.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Shoppers are getting a one-week tax break. The state’s annual Sales Tax Free Week, which began Sunday and runs through Aug. 21, exempts retail purchases of most clothing and footwear priced under $100 from Connecticut’s 6.35% sales and use tax. The exemption applies to each eligible item costing less than $100, regardless of how many of those items a customer purchases. The sales tax holiday, which costs the state about $5 million in lost tax revenue, applied to clothing and footwear costing less than $300 per item in past years and was ultimately scaled back. However, many retailers are expected to offer additional discounts during the week, which is a popular time for back-to-school shopping. Connecticut Retail Merchants Association President Timothy G. Phelan said the week gives residents an opportunity to save money and also “reconnect with local retail businesses that have endured the business challenges of the past year and a half,” referring to the pandemic. “The COVID-19 economy this year has put retail businesses, particularly smaller independent retailers, under increasing pressure just to stay in business and to stay in business here in Connecticut,” Phelan told state lawmakers earlier this year during a public hearing.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: To enter Firefly Music Festival, guests will have to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours, the festival’s owner announced late last week. The policy will be in place for all events and venues operated by AEG Presents, which purchased Firefly in 2018. “We have come to the conclusion that, as a market leader, it was up to us to take a real stand on vaccination status,” AEG Presents CEO Jay Marciano said in a statement, citing the virus’s delta variant and vaccine hesitancy that have pushed statistics “in the wrong direction again” in recent weeks. In the past month, COVID-19 cases have quintupled in Delaware. “We realize that some people might look at this as a dramatic step, but it’s the right one,” Marciano said. “We also are aware that there might be some initial pushback, but I’m confident and hopeful that, at the end of the day, we will be on the right side of history and doing what’s best for artists, fans, and live event workers.” Firefly officials previously said the festival will be limited to 50,000 people for each day of its four days, Sept. 23-26. According to AEG’s website, its festivals will accept a physical copy of a COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card or a digital copy of the card for proof of vaccination. Masks are strongly encouraged, the website says.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A military base in the nation’s capital was locked down for about two hours Friday, causing a brief panic, after an armed man ran onto the grounds during a local police investigation of gunshots on the surrounding streets. A statement from Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling said the man’s firearm was discovered after the intrusion, and the intruder himself was detained about 2:45 p.m. during “a thorough sweep of the installation.” The individual, who was not named, was transferred to Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department. The naval support facility at the north end of the base is used by Marine Helicopter Squadron One, the fleet of green helicopters that carry the president and vice president. Col. Mike Zuhlsdorf, the base commander, credited the “thorough and coordinated response” among multiple agencies, including MPD and the Secret Service, with helping to swiftly control the situation. “I remain confident in our security posture,” Zuhlsdorf said in a statement. The 905-acre base in southeast Washington houses Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard units, along with the Washington field office of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and the headquarters of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: The University of Florida will open its upcoming semester with in-person classes, reversing itself within hours of telling students the term might begin online because of the state’s renewed COVID-19 outbreak. UF administrators sent an email to students Friday afternoon telling them that after consulting with university epidemiologists, plans were being made to put the first three weeks of school online. But then a few hours later, a second email went out announcing that classes would be conducted in person. No reason was given for the reversal, but UF said in a statement that no schools in the state university system would be conducting classes online. The university is not requiring vaccines or mask-wearing but is recommending both. In an email to students last week, administrators wrote that they “cannot modify the operation of the entire university for a minority of people who may choose not to be vaccinated.” Gov. Ron DeSantis is strongly opposed to vaccine and mask mandates, saying those decisions should be left to each person. He has encouraged vaccination but has stopped wearing masks in public. The state averaged almost 22,000 newly confirmed cases per day last week, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, up from about 1,500 per day in mid-June and blowing past last year’s highs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The National Park Service is pushing back after a U.S. government report recommended approval of a launch pad for commercial rockets on the Georgia coast, saying a chance of explosive misfires over a federally protected island popular with tourists and campers poses an “unacceptable risk.” Camden County in Georgia’s coastal, southeast corner has spent nine years and $10 million seeking permission to build what would be the nation’s 13th licensed commercial spaceport. The proposed Spaceport Camden took a big step forward in June, when the Federal Aviation Administration issued a final environmental impact study that concluded building the spaceport would be its “preferred alternative.” Now the Park Service and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of the Interior, are disputing the FAA’s conclusion that the spaceport poses minimal risks or adverse impacts to Cumberland Island, a federally protected wilderness. The island, known for wild horses and nesting sea turtles, is managed by the Park Service and draws about 60,000 visitors each year. In a July 22 letter to the FAA, the Interior Department said the final study on the spaceport’s impacts noted that a failed launch could result in “fires, explosions, or releases of propellants or other hazardous materials.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Two visitors from the U.S. mainland were arrested for allegedly using fake vaccine cards to travel into the state. Officials with the Hawaii Attorney General’s office arrested the visitors at Honolulu’s international airport, a spokesman for the agency said in a statement. Investigators said the two were in violation of the state’s travel rules, which require travelers to produce either a negative coronavirus test or proof of COVID-19 vaccination to avoid quarantine when entering the state. Violating the state’s COVID-19 mandates, including falsifying a vaccination card, is a misdemeanor that can result in a fine of up to $5,000, up to a year in prison or both. The visitors were arraigned Wednesday after being arrested over the prior weekend. Authorities responded to a tip from a community member. “Attorney General investigators are committed to ensuring all such leads are investigated and thank the community for their assistance and support,” the AG’s office said. The agency said that while there may be other cases pending with other Hawaii law enforcement divisions, this was the first arrest by the Department of the Attorney General for allegedly falsifying vaccination cards.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s budget surplus is up to $1.4 billion, officials said Friday. The Idaho Division of Financial Management said it based the increase on a revised general fund revenue forecast it does every August for the current fiscal year to account for economic conditions and law changes. The agency said the surplus comes from a nearly $900 million ending balance for fiscal year 2021, which ended June 30, combined with another $513 million more than the forecast used by lawmakers to set the state’s budget last May for the current fiscal year, 2022, which ends next summer. The agency also said revenue collections were nearly $40 million more than anticipated in July, the first month of the current fiscal year. State officials said the $1.4 billion surplus could change based on monthly revenue collections. Budget setting for fiscal year 2021 occurred before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, and state officials feared a big deficit. But the state received billions of dollars in coronavirus rescue money, and many Idaho residents and businesses received pandemic aid. Federal money was also used to boost unemployment benefits. In addition, Idaho has been one of the fastest-growing states, with new residents bringing in additional money.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An exhibit of more than 80 works by the graffiti artist known publicly only as Banksy has come to the Windy City. “The Art of Banksy” opened Saturday and runs through Oct. 31 in a shuttered, 45,000-square-foot broadcast communications museum. The pieces – which include canvases, prints and sculptures – are from private collections. Stencils by the street artist have appeared on the walls of buildings – even a British prison, bridges and streets across the globe. Some of his most recognizable stencils and murals include “Flower Thrower,” “Rude Copper,” “Girl with Balloon” and “I Remember When All This Was Trees.” Earlier this year, a Banksy painting honoring health workers in the pandemic sold at auction for more than $23 million. Titled “Game Changer,” the work first appeared on a wall at Southampton General Hospital in southern England in May 2020. The black-and-white picture depicts a young boy sitting on the floor playing with a nurse superhero toy, as Batman and Spiderman toy figures lie in a wastepaper basket next to him. At the time it went up, the hospital said Banksy left a note for workers there saying: “Thanks for all you’re doing. I hope this brightens the place up a bit, even if it’s only black and white.”\n\nIndiana\n\nChesterton: The National Park Service wants to charge entrance fees for the first time at the Indiana Dunes National Park, citing a dramatic increase in visitors in recent years and the need for more revenue for park maintenance. The federal agency will hold an online public meeting on the proposed fees via Zoom on Wednesday, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. CDT. If approved, the fees would begin March 31, 2022. The northwest Indiana park has seen a surge in visitors during the past two years, and the new fees would help finance park maintenance, public safety and programming, officials said. “The value of public open spaces has been underscored during the COVID pandemic,” Park Superintendent Paul Labovitz said in a statement. The proposed entrance fees include $15 per person for people walking, bicycling or boating into the park, or $20 for motorcyclists. A commercial motor coach fee would be $100. The other fees would be a $25 seven-day pass for vehicles and a $45 annual pass. Among the other new entrance fees, the Park Service proposes adding six backcountry campsites that would cost $25 per night, with a limit of eight campers. The 15,000-acre park along Lake Michigan’s southern shore, about 50 miles east of Chicago, became Indiana’s first national park in February 2019.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Iowa’s Ethics Board has found that Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds didn’t violate any laws when she appeared in a series of taxpayer-funded ads last fall promoting coronavirus public safety measures. The Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board voted unanimously Thursday to find Reynolds did not violate a 2018 state law that prohibits statewide elected officials from using public funds for self-promotion. Iowa State Auditor Rob Sand had accused Reynolds of the ethical violation, saying the ad campaign she launched in November was used to promote her own image when she appeared in several of the ads encouraging mask-wearing. Sand, a Democrat, had said the ad campaign was funded with money intended to pay for expanded testing capacity for the coronavirus and improve collection and reporting of data about the pandemic. He also said Reynolds’ office didn’t seek federal approval to spend the money on an ad campaign until after it was announced and well after his office requested invoices for the spending. On Thursday, the Ethics Board found that the law includes an exception for when a governor proclaims a disaster emergency, which Reynolds had done for the pandemic. Sand said the ruling declared “open season” on using taxpayer money for politicians’ self-promotion.\n\nKansas\n\nLeavenworth: The CoreCivic Leavenworth Detention Center has been on lockdown for more than a week and a half after an inmate died from injuries he suffered in a fight, officials said Friday. Scott W. Wilson, 39, was kicked, punched and struck with a tray Aug. 2. He suffered a broken rib and punctured lung and died two days later, said Maj. Dan Nicodemus, deputy chief of the Leavenworth Police Department. Another inmate, a 28-year-old man, has been identified as a suspect, but no charges were filed as of Friday afternoon. The Leavenworth Detention Center houses pretrial detainees for the U.S. Marshals Service. Ryan Gustin, spokesman for CoreCivic, said in an email that the detention center was placed on lockdown Aug. 3, and the lockdown was still in place Friday. Detention center officials are working with U.S. Marshals to determine when normal operations will resume, he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State tourism officials are offering a new incentive for residents to get vaccinated. The initiative called Vax and Visit launched Thursday and allows permanent Kentucky residents who have received at least one COVID-19 vaccination to enter drawings for travel incentives at state parks, said Tourism, Arts and Heritage Secretary Mike Berry. There will be 30 drawings for gift certificates that will include golf rounds, overnight lodging and campground stays, he said. The drawings also raise awareness of how Kentucky residents can get vaccinated, officials said. “Offering vaccine incentives to Kentucky state parks will not only boost travel revenue in local communities but also ensure that Kentucky continues to be seen as a safe travel destination post-pandemic,” Berry said. Winners will be selected beginning Sept. 9, and the final drawing will take place Oct. 7.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The French Quarter Festival, in which thousands crowd the streets of the historic New Orleans neighborhood to listen to brass bands, zydeco and other music, has become the latest victim of the state’s fourth coronavirus surge. Festival organizers announced Friday that they were canceling the festival, which had been slated for Sept. 30-Oct. 2. Other events such as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival have already canceled events slated for this summer and fall. The event will return to the French Quarter on April 21-24 of next year, organizers said Friday. The Festivals Acadiens et Creoles, which takes place in Lafayette, is also being canceled for this fall, organizers announced. That festival had been slated for Oct. 8-10 and instead will take place March 18-20 of next year. Louisiana has set new daily records for the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 for two weeks. Ninety-one percent of those hospitalized are unvaccinated, according to state health department data. Only 38% of Louisiana’s population is inoculated, putting it among the bottom five states in the nation, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the number of people seeking their first shot has increased dramatically over the past month.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s congressional delegation wants the Federal Communications Commission to keep Maine a one-area-code state. All of the Pine Tree State is served by the 207 area code. The four members of the delegation said 207 phone numbers are projected to run out by 2024 if the FCC doesn’t take action, and that would necessitate the creation of a second area code in the state. The delegation told the FCC on Thursday that the 207 area code is “both a cultural touchstone and a matter of efficiency.” It also said adding another area code could be a problem for businesses because so many leave the 207 area code out when posting a phone number or relaying a message. The Maine Public Utilities Commission recently asked the FCC to let Maine try a method that allocates numbers one at a time to phone providers rather than allocating them in large blocks. The congressional delegation said it strongly supports that request, which it said could help maintain the solo area code.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Police officials have told all employees they cannot collect overtime pay while on paid vacation, a practice the department says costs the city an average of $300,000 per year. Shallah Graham, the department’s chief financial officer, told City Council members last week that the agency won’t let employees file for overtime pay in addition to vacation pay, The Baltimore Sun reports. A previous payroll system allowed this practice of “double dipping” without a way to identify when it happened, but Graham said a new system has greater transparency. Before an investigation by the newspaper, the department spent nearly $50 million a year in overtime, according to department budget records. The investigation showed many officers made tens of thousands of dollars in paid overtime, including five who logged more than 2,000 hours of overtime each in a single year. While the practice didn’t violate any city policy, the Inspector General’s Office reported last month that “it could be perceived as wasteful.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nQuincy: Turtles are being temporarily relocated so the city can start a $1.4million pond restoration project. Starting this week, volunteers from the New England Herpetological Society will trap the turtles and take them to the New England Wildlife Center in Weymouth. The trapping process, which involves sardine-baited “hoop traps,” will take four days, according to a news release. Turtles will be taken from the traps each day to the wildlife center. The contractors are scheduled to begin restoration work Aug. 27. The plan is to dredge sediment from the pond and create a gravel stormwater treatment wetland on the north side, the city said. Julie Sullivan, the city’s environmental scientist, said sediment that has settled at the bottom of the pond has become so thick that it interferes with plant life and harms the ecosystem. The idea to move the turtles was sparked after Quincy residents expressed concerns that the restoration of the pond would disrupt wildlife.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state has passed the grim milestone of 20,000 deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic, with a top health official warning that people must continue taking precautions. State health officials reported Friday that Michigan had totaled 20,011 confirmed deaths since recording its first one in March 2020. “We’ve seen real devastation and tragedy as a result of COVID-19, and it remains as important now as it (was) a year ago to mitigate the transmission of this virus,” said Elizabeth Hertel, director of Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services. “Because it is deadly.” Health officials are preparing for a new wave of coronavirus infections caused by the highly transmissible delta variant that is sweeping the country. On Friday, Michigan identified delta variant infections in more than 50 counties and the city of Detroit. Michigan’s COVID-19 deaths have been highest among the elderly and African Americans. Those 70 years and older have accounted for 69% of the total deaths. Confirmed deaths among African Americans have accounted for about about 22% of deaths, whereas Black residents comprise only about 14% of Michigan’s population.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The city’s police will no longer stop motorists for minor traffic violations, such as expired tags or an air freshener hanging from their rearview mirror, according to a new policy change. Police Chief Medaria Arrandondo, in an internal memo Thursday, said the move comes after examining how officers can better use time and resources. “MPD will no longer be conducting traffic stops solely for these offenses: expired tabs, an item dangling from a mirror, or not having a working license plate light,” Arradondo wrote in the memo obtained by the Star Tribune. Critics have long argued that low-level traffic stops in which officers use a minor traffic or equipment violation as a justification for pulling over someone they want to investigate contribute to racial disparities in the criminal justice system. The memo also said the city attorney will stop prosecuting tickets for driving after suspension if there was no accident “or other egregious driving behavior that would impact public safety.” Mayor Jacob Frey said Friday that police will continue to stop motorists for offenses that are a threat to public safety, such as reckless driving or speeding.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A rural community is overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases, two weeks after hosting the Neshoba County Fair that drew thousands who lived in cabins, attended shoulder-to-shoulder outdoor concerts and listened to stump speeches – including one by the Republican governor, who decried federal masking guidance as “foolish.” Frustrated by rising COVID-19 infections, the chief executive officer of the 25-bed Neshoba General Hospital posted a message on social media challenging Gov. Tate Reeves to step up and show leadership. “@tatereeves hospitals and healthcare workers need you to help us. Where are you?” Lee McCall wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “We are overwhelmed with the surge of Covid and understaffed to safely care for our patients. Our incredible staff are holding it together but we are all at our breaking point.” Last week alone, Mississippi broke its single-day records of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalized patients multiple times. The previous records were in January, before vaccinations were widely available. Until recent days, Reeves had made few public statements about the coronavirus the past few weeks. In a July 29 speech to a conservative crowd at the Neshoba County Fair, he called federal advice for the fully vaccinated to resume wearing masks indoors “foolish” and “harmful.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSedalia: Mostly unmasked crowds packed into the Missouri State Fair shoulder-to-shoulder last week as it opened amid soaring numbers of new COVID-19 infections. Fair officials decided in the spring to bring back the full fair after replacing it with a much smaller youth livestock show last year because of safety concerns, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. “We’re not seeing any kind of slowdown in attendance and are expecting an average to good year,” said State Fair Director Mark Wolfe, adding that his staff estimated up to 340,000 people will attend the event before it closes Aug. 22. Among the unmasked was Brian Eggers, a 55-year-old farmer who lives outside Chillicothe. He lost a close neighbor as well as aunts and uncles to COVID-19 and said he hasn’t gotten around to getting a shot. “I’m not anti-vaccine, but I haven’t gotten it myself yet,” he said as he watched a youth livestock show, adding: “If God wants to take me, that’s his choice.” Jessica Miller, who manned the fair’s vaccination station, said five patients had come in for COVID-19 shots in the event’s first 2.5 hours of operation. Some told Miller that their jobs were going to require the vaccine or that they would be allowed to eschew a mask if they got inoculated.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Police on Friday released the name of a 21-year-old man who was shot and killed by a police officer after authorities say he fled a traffic stop. Brendon T. Galbreath, a member of the Blackfeet Nation who lived in Missoula, died in a hospital Thursday. Galbreath’s brother, Terrance LaFromboise, said Friday that the family had received statements from law enforcement officials following his death that did not match up with information publicly released by Missoula police following the incident. In a recording of communications between police officers during the chase and shooting, a police officer can be heard saying the victim shot himself. “Did he shoot or did we?” an officer asks. “Both,” another officer responds. LaFromboise said people who knew his brother find it hard to believe he had a gun or knew how to use one. “He has a strong stance against guns,” he said. Galbreath was the salutatorian of his class in high school and had met former first lady Michelle Obama during a trip to Washington, D.C., through a pre-college program. He moved to Missoula during the coronavirus pandemic, after several relatives contracted COVID-19 and died. He was planning to apply to study at the University of Montana to study medicine or engineering, his brother said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska Board of Regents has rejected an anti-critical race theory resolution. The 5-3 vote Friday followed about three hours of public comment from students, faculty and others, the Lincoln Journal-Star reports. Regent Jim Pillen, a Republican candidate for governor, introduced the resolution objecting to “any imposition of critical race theory” in academic curriculum in July, after another candidate for governor criticized him for not taking action on the issue. Critical race theory, a framework for examining the effects race and racism have on institutions, both historically and today, has become a flashpoint in the culture wars. Several legislatures have enacted bills preventing it from being taught. Pillen said most Nebraskans believe critical race theory to be “discriminatory, divisive” and antithetical to the values held by many. But the proposal ran into a buzz saw of opposition from students, faculty, administrators and others, who said it abridged academic freedom and would hurt recruiting and retention, particularly of students and faculty of color. The ACLU of Nebraska, Anti-Defamation League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People bused students from Omaha to Lincoln and handed out T-shirts emblazoned with “Protect Academic Freedom.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The owner of a hotel that was fined a year ago for defying state coronavirus pandemic restrictions and hosting a beauty pageant and a faith-based Donald Trump campaign rally has lost a court challenge of the governor’s directives that limited meeting sizes. State Attorney General Aaron Ford said Friday’s ruling against Ahern Hotel and Convention Center amounted to a finding by a court that emergency orders issued by Gov. Steve Sisolak after COVID-19 emerged in March 2020 balance the rights and safety of residents. “Today, the court recognized what we already knew – the state has a responsibility to protect the lives of Nevadans,” Ford said. In a verbal ruling, Clark County District Court Judge Nancy Allf decided the lawsuit filed in August 2020 was moot because there are no more occupancy limits imposed by the state, Ford said. The city of Las Vegas and its planning director also were named as defendants. The property was fined nearly $11,000 after holding an “Evangelicals for Trump” event at which a city employee tallied more than 1,100 attendees – far more than the 50-person limit Sisolak had ordered for public and private events at the time. Organizers of the Mrs. Nevada America pageant held days later removed spectators to comply with crowd limits.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has a new goal of reducing waste sent to landfills by 25% by 2030. The goal is included in a bill signed into law last week. Sen. David Watters, a Dover Democrat who co-sponsored the bill, said it reframes and updates the state’s waste reduction goals and requires more innovation to reduce how much trash is generated and to increase the diversion of trash from landfills through reuse, recycling and composting. The law requires the Department of Environmental Services to update the state’s solid waste plan and make it available to the public.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state has retained its slot as the country’s densest, and Newark kept its crown as New Jersey’s biggest city, according to newly released U.S. census figures. The state’s population per square mile climbed 5.6% over the past decade to 1,263 people up from 1,195.5 – higher than every other state, though behind the District of Columbia. Newark also saw its population climb above 300,000, edging out a growing Jersey City that some expected would overtake Newark. Jersey City will remain the Garden State’s second-biggest, after growing 18% to just shy of 300,000 residents. The new figures also show the state became less white and more Black, Hispanic and Asian. The white population fell from 5.21 million a decade ago to 4.82 million in 2020, while the Hispanic and Asian populations both climbed by nearly 30%. People identifying as Hispanic climbed from 1.55 million in 2010 to 2 million in 2020, while the Asian population went from about 720,000 to roughly 942,000. The Black population grew from 1.13 million to 1.15 million. People under age 18 in New Jersey have declined from 2.07 million in 2010 to 2.01 million. Overall, the state’s population climbed from 8.8 million to 9.3 million. It will keep the 12 House seats it currently has.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State health officials say an increase in hospitalizations has prompted them to put out an urgent call for volunteer nurses to help boost the state’s medical workforce. The New Mexico Department of Health late Friday called on nurses or anyone with a medical license to volunteer to help because officials believe hospitals could soon be overwhelmed with patients. They want recently retired health workers or anyone qualified to sign up for the state’s Medical Reserve Corps. Hospitals are seeing increased hospitalizations because of long-postponed surgeries and a surge in COVID-19 patients. The delta variant of the coronavirus is much more contagious than previous strains. “We ask our nurses, and anyone with a medical license, to once again volunteer with the Medical Reserve Corps,” Dr. David R. Scrase, the acting director of the state health department, said in a statement. “To get through this together, we need everyone who can provide patient care to work side by side with us during this critical time.” The state’s Reserve Medical Corps has filled more than 139 requests during the pandemic, deploying 2,750 volunteers. To sign up, go to the Corps website at nmmrcserves.org.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State Sens. Jamaal Bailey and Brian Benjamin are emerging as top contenders in the search for the next lieutenant governor, a person familiar with the matter told the Associated Press. Bailey and Benjamin, both from New York City, are among several candidates being vetted by Kathy Hochul and her team and have emerged as the leading contenders, the person said. Last week Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced he would resign after increasing calls for his impeachment following an investigation that found he sexually harassed 11 women. He is set to leave office Aug. 24, when Hochul, who has been lieutenant governor since 2015, will take over. The state Assembly will suspend its investigation of Cuomo once he steps down after its leader concluded the Legislature didn’t have the clear authority to impeach a departed official, the chamber’s top Democrat said Friday. In an interview Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Hochul, who hails from the Buffalo area, said she had narrowed her search to focus on candidates from New York City. “Even though I’ve spent thousands of hours in New York City, and I’m well familiar with the challenges, I want someone who lives there,” she said. “I want someone who understands the challenges firsthand.” The position of lieutenant governor has largely been a ceremonial role.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Those who visit indoor spaces within the capital city will now need to wear a face mask to limit the spread of COVID-19, the mayor said Friday. Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin also said city employees who are already fully vaccinated or get to that point by Sept. 17 will receive a $250 reward and two days of bonus leave. “The number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase in our community and across the state at an alarming rate,” Baldwin said in a statement. “The idea that we can hope COVID-19 will just go away on its own is not a reality. It’s time to take responsible action and today we are taking an important step to make sure the people of this community, and those who visit us, remain healthy and safe.” The move to reimpose the mask mandate will only be within Raleigh city limits, not Wake County. But the requirement does apply to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. The largest city in the state may also soon decide to compel masking indoors for residents and visitors, as Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles backtracked comments she made last week that she lacked the authority to compel people to wear masks indoors. Renewed mask requirements and rewards for vaccinations are coming as the more contagious delta variant sweeps across the state, giving North Carolina its worst coronavirus metrics in months.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials say production of oil and gas is holding steady. The latest figures released Friday show the state’s oil production from May to June has plateaued at about 1.1 million barrels per day for both months. “I would have to characterize the Bakken at this point as a sleeping giant,” State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms said. “The COVID pandemic kind of put the industry to sleep, and it’s struggling somewhat to wake up.” The state’s oil production has recovered somewhat from last summer’s lows amid the coronavirus crisis, but it’s far from the record 1.5 million barrels per day produced in late 2019, the Bismarck Tribune reports. North Dakota’s natural gas production is also steady at about 2.9 billion cubic feet of gas per day in June. Officials say that if gas production grows, the state will need more pipelines and processing facilities within the next two years if it’s to continue to keep flaring down. “It’s not going to be an easy feat,” North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad said. “Things will have to get moving relatively briskly to meet those time frames.” Helms said he expects oil production will likely increase next year as companies slowly add back rigs in North Dakota, as well as crews needed to frack newly drilled wells so they can start producing oil.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A concealed weapons permit would become optional, and the requirement that individuals “promptly” notify police officers that they are carrying a concealed weapon would be eliminated, under legislation proposed in the state Senate. The bill is similar to a measure pending in the Ohio House and is one of several GOP-backed proposals in recent years seeking to expand gun rights in the state. The new concealed weapons bill, dubbed “Constitutional Carry” by its backers, was introduced Aug. 5 by state Sen. Terry Johnson, a Republican from southern Ohio’s Scioto County. Keeping the permit optional – as opposed to eliminating it altogether – would allow gunowners who obtain it to carry a concealed weapon in states with reciprocity agreements recognizing such permits. Earlier this year, Rep. Tom Brinkman, R-Cincinnati, noted it’s already legal to openly carry a firearm in Ohio without a license or training. “In order to avoid unnecessary hassle from the public or law enforcement, one may decide to put a coat or jacket over their firearm,” Brinkman, sponsor of the House legislation, told the House Government Oversight Committee in April. “Sadly, that individual instantly turns into a felon if they have not gone through some … government-mandated rigmarole first.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An emergency rule by Gov. Kevin Stitt allows hospitals to renovate conference rooms and other areas to care for COVID-19 patients, the state’s health commissioner said Friday. The rule is not an emergency declaration, which would allow state schools to implement mask mandates, said Dr. Lance Frye, adding that he is not convinced one is needed. “We strictly looked at what do we need to respond (to the virus surge) and is there anything that was … accomplished before in our emergency declaration that we can’t do now,” Frye said. “We are good where we are right now as far as our ability to respond” to the surge that Frye said would be slowed with vaccinations. Unvaccinated patients make up 98% of new cases and 93% of hospitalizations in the state, Frye said. The state health department reported 2,814 new coronavirus cases Friday and a seven-day average of 2,122 new cases daily, up from 1,268 on July 28, along with 1,326 virus-related hospitalizations. Oklahoma’s vaccination rate reached 50% of residents with one dose, according to deputy health commissioner Keith Reed, and 41.1% fully inoculated, compared to national rates of 58.2% with one dose and 49.9% fully vaccinated.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A new state law that suspends a requirement for a basic-skills test in math, reading and writing to graduate high school is being praised by advocates as a way to rethink education standards and sharply criticized by others as a misguided effort that will hurt children’s learning in the long run. Democratic Gov. Kate Brown signed Senate Bill 744 last month without much attention. The measure temporarily eliminates essential-skills testing through the 2022-23 school year. That requirement had been put on a hold amid the pandemic, which forced the closure of many schools and remote learning for students. The Oregon Department of Education has said the new law will allow the state to develop more equitable graduation requirements. Officials have been told to compare diploma requirements in various states and find ways to reduce disparities and ensure graduation requirements are fair. “Senate Bill 744 does not remove Oregon’s graduation requirements, and it certainly does not remove any requirements that Oregon students learn essential skills,” department spokesman Marc Siegel told KATU. Rashelle Chase, founder of Mxm Bloc, an advocacy group led by Black women and focused on education and other social justice issues, said certain children struggle with exams and had been hurt by the testing requirements.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Health care workers, college students and higher education employees will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by mid-October under new mandates announced by the city’s Public Health Department on Friday. The mandates were passed Thursday night by the Board of Health, which provides guidance to the city’s health department, said acting Public Health Commissioner Cheryl Bettigole. She said both categories of people will be required to be vaccinated by Oct. 15, but exemptions will be allowed for religious or medical reasons, with added precautions or accommodations for those people. Health care workers with an exemption will be required to wear masks and undergo a coronavirus test twice a week. At colleges, those with exemptions will have to get a PCR test or two antigen tests weekly. Once a college reaches a 90% vaccination rate, Bettigole said those people with exemptions can double-mask and social distance in indoor spaces, or colleges can offer virtual options as an accommodation. City public health officials also made adjustments to mask mandates announced last week in an effort to accommodate parents with young children not yet eligible for the vaccines.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: West Nile virus has been found in a mosquito sample collected in the state for the first time this summer, environmental officials said. A mosquito trapped July 29 in Cranston tested positive for the virus, the state Department of Environmental Management said in a statement Thursday. No mosquito samples this year have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis, another mosquito-borne disease. The finding was not unexpected, given that West Nile has been found in multiple samples collected in neighboring Connecticut and Massachusetts, indicating that the virus has “established seasonal activity in our area,” the department said. Because the virus is expected to become more prevalent as the season progresses, state environmental and health officials urged residents to limit their exposure to mosquitoes until the first hard frost. That includes eliminating mosquito breedings areas; ensuring windows and doors have screens; avoiding outdoor activities at sunrise and sundown, when mosquitoes are most active; and wearing shirts with long sleeves and long pants and using insect repellant when outdoors.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: A new genealogy research project could help preserve vulnerable coastal land belonging to Gullah Geechee families. The Heirs’ Property Family Research Project in Hilton Head Island will assist families with research that could help them obtain valid deeds for land that has been passed down to multiple family members without a will. Organized by the town’s Gullah Geechee Culture and Land Preservation Task Force, the Heritage Library of Hilton Head Island, and the University of South Carolina Beaufort, the project aims to help Black Americans known as Gullah or Geechee. These slave descendants retained much of their African heritage passed down from ancestors who grew up isolated on coastal islands off North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. Some of the Gullah Geechee land is particularly vulnerable, project organizers said in a statement, because of the way it was passed down without a formal will. Volunteers with the free program will tap into census records and other documents to create family trees. Sheryse DuBose of the task force said the project could aid several Gullah Geechee families to secure titles for their land.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell said he was aggressively poked by someone seeking a selfie, which led him to say he was attacked. Lindell, who hosted an election fraud symposium in the city last week, told the conservative talk show FlashPoint that he was approached by a man who wanted a photo Wednesday night. “He put his arm around and stuck his finger, it was so much pressure, I just knew if I did anything something more was coming,” Lindell said, gesturing to his side. “He jammed it in where it was just piercing pain.” Lindell had told the crowd Thursday at the election fraud symposium that he was still in pain and wanted everyone to know about the evil in the world. The Sioux Falls Police Department said it is investigating a report of an assault at a hotel near the symposium. Police spokesman Sam Clemens has declined to identify the victim, citing Marsy’s Law, a state constitutional amendment that protects crime victims. Lindell announced the symposium in July, saying he hoped hundreds of “cyber-forensics experts” would attend and back up his claims that voting machines were hacked to flip votes for former President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The governor’s office is pushing back on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation that goes as far as claiming cows are being vaccinated to inoculate unwitting people who eat meat. The confusion over an assortment of outlandish claims illustrates the hurdles that face a state in the bottom 10 for vaccination rates amid a coronavirus resurgence stretching hospitals thin. In an email Thursday to lawmakers, a top deputy of Republican Gov. Bill Lee debunked “several conspiracy theories” about a recent executive order. The email says some components that are being most frequently misinterpreted were included in previous executive orders during the pandemic. Lee’s office said lawmakers seeking information for constituents and constituents themselves have reached out about the claims. The rumors deemed “FALSE” in the governor’s office email are that his executive order creates “quarantine camps”; that the National Guard will round up unvaccinated people and take them to locations to be quarantined or vaccinated, or forcibly vaccinate them in their homes; that the executive order lays the groundwork for permanent lockdowns; and that COVID-19 vaccines are being given to livestock to vaccinate people through meat consumption.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A man who was scheduled for trial on murder charges last week has instead been granted release on bond after Dallas police revealed that material in his case might be among troves of data lost from its computer system. A Dallas County judge granted Jonathan Pitts bond Thursday after prosecutors asked the judge to delay his trial as they worked with police to determine whether case material was part of the information lost while the Dallas Police Department was moving data from a computer network drive. It was not immediately clear when Pitts would be freed from jail. The release of Pitts, who is charged in the 2019 shooting of Shun Handy, was ordered as authorities race to determine how many cases may have had evidence vanish in the 8-terabyte data loss. Prosecutors told Judge Ernie White on Thursday that they needed more time to work with police to audit the materials in Pitts’ case to determine whether anything was lost. On Friday evening, Dallas Police Sgt. Warren Mitchell said that “all the evidentiary items and data are available for prosecution on this murder case.” White granted Pitts release without paying bail because state law requires a person be freed if prosecutors aren’t ready at the time trial, his defense attorney, George Ashford III, told The Dallas Morning News.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Zion National Park may soon require reservations to hike one of its most famous trails. The Angel’s Landing hike is a narrow trail perched on the edge of a red-rock cliff in southern Utah. The number of people visiting Zion has been growing at a breakneck pace in recent years, and Angel’s Landing is one of the most sought-after destinations. More than 300,000 people made the trek in 2019, according to park officials. The crowding is worrisome on the trail where people regularly fall and die from the trail edged by a sheer cliff, park officials said. The system would start in 2022 and require people to pay $6 to enter an online lottery to get a permit and a $3 per person usage fee if they are chosen. It would apply specifically to the narrowest section of the trail, called the chain section after the metal handholds driven into the rock. Park officials are taking online public comment on the proposal through Sept. 12.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state Supreme Court has authorized a one-year pilot project for remote civil jury trials. The move comes after a committee studied how to utilize remote hearing technology to increase access to justice and address civil case backlogs. The issue is especially important as the judiciary continues to navigate challenges associated with COVID-19. “The judiciary has been using remote technology to facilitate operations in order to ensure access to justice and continuity of operations and to promote the health and safety of judges, staff, and court users during the pandemic,” said state court administrator Patricia Gabel. “Considering the ways available technology can assist us in managing our civil docket is an important step in our ongoing effort to leverage technology and adapt our operations to changing conditions,” she said. The pilot project will not affect criminal trials.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: A federal judge declined to block the blasting of bedrock on a mountain where a natural gas pipeline is supposed to be laid, saying she lacks authority to do so. The decision by U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon comes after the property owner on Bent Mountain in Roanoke County sought an injunction to halt the work involving the Mountain Valley Pipeline. Dillon said Friday that her court was not the proper jurisdiction to resolve the dispute, noting that landowner John Coles Terry III had already sought action from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, The Roanoke Times reports. An attorney for Terry’s family asked last week for a temporary injunction on the drilling and blasting. Construction crews had started boring holes to prepare for explosives that would clear a trench for burying the 42-inch-diameter pipe. Terry’s motion said the blasting could contaminate his well water and that of others downstream. But the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and pipeline officials have said they’ve not seen evidence of the potential harm described in the motion. Terry said after Friday’s hearing that crews had yet to reach the portion of his land where construction would most likely impact his water.\n\nWashington\n\nGeorge: More than 160 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed so far among people who attended the Watershed Music Festival at the Gorge Amphitheatre in central Washington. More than 20,000 fans packed the Gorge, in George, for the three-day outdoor country music festival in late July, The Seattle Times reports. The Grant County Health District said Friday that the cases are tied to residents in counties including King, Grant, Pierce, Skagit, Kittitas, Okanogan, Whatcom, Kitsap, San Juan, Lincoln and Stevens. There’s also one case tied to an Oregon resident. Officials expect more cases associated with the festival to be confirmed in the coming days, and investigators are working with those who have tested positive to identify other cases. Public Health officials urge people who attended the festival to self-quarantine and get tested for the coronavirus. On average, symptoms of the virus develop five to six days after exposure, but the incubation period can be as long as 14 days, officials said. In eastern Oregon, Umatilla County Public Health officials have tied at least 66 COVID-19 cases to the outdoor Pendleton Whiskey Music Fest on July 10. Sixty-one of the people who tested positive were unvaccinated, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Policies that allow state officials to refuse to change a transgender person’s gender on their birth certificates should be declared unconstitutional, according to a new federal lawsuit. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Harvard Law School LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic on Thursday sued the Department of Health and Human Resources on behalf of two transgender men born in West Virginia, The Exponent Telegram reports. The suit stems from a ruling by the West Virginia Supreme Court last year that said circuit judges could no longer issue court orders telling health officials to change birth certificate gender markers. The lawsuit says the ruling led to health officials refusing to change gender markers and prior legal names on birth certificates of transgender individuals. The Department of Health and Human Resources has the authority under state law to make requested changes without a court order, according to ACLU of West Virginia Legal Director Loree Stark. Denying such requests violates transgender individuals’ constitutional rights to free speech, due process and equal protection, Stark said. West Virginia is “one of the last remaining states in the nation” where the gender marker on birth certificates can’t be changed, Harvard Law School LGBTQ+ Advocacy Clinic Director Alexander Chen said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nKenosha: A woman accidentally shot a friend while using the laser sight on a handgun to play with a cat, authorities said. A criminal complaint charging the 19-year-old woman with negligent use of a weapon said she was visiting a Kenosha apartment Tuesday afternoon where a 21-year-old man had brought a handgun. The woman, who a witness said had been drinking, picked up the handgun, “turned on the laser sight and was pointing it at the floor to get the cat to chase it” when the gun went off, the complaint filed Thursday said. The man, who was standing in a doorway, was shot in the thigh, authorities said. He left and went into another apartment, where police found him after responding to a 911 call, the Kenosha News reports. A tourniquet was applied to his leg to stop the bleeding before he was taken to a hospital. There’s no word on his condition, but authorities said he was facing charges for violating bond conditions that prevented him from having a weapon. The woman told police she thought the magazine had been taken out of the gun and said it “accidentally went off,” according to the complaint.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A new memorial honors the military service of Native Americans who long went unrecognized. The Path of Honor opened Thursday at the Frank B. Wise Business Center in Fort Washakie, where stones along a winding red path symbolize courage and commitment to living a purposeful life, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Lyle Wadda of American Legion Post 81 spearheaded the project that began in 2008 after the Wind River Development Fund and Post 81 partnered to create the business center. Still, even after the building and memorial’s completion, Wadda found himself in disbelief when it was finally dedicated to the public in a ceremony attended by dignitaries including Gov. Mark Gordon. “We accept anyone in this post,” he said at the dedication ceremony. “You don’t have to be Native American or part of another tribe. Business is open to everyone.” John St. Clair, chairman of the Eastern Shoshone Business Council and a Vietnam veteran, pointed to the dedication and bravery of Native Americans who served as volunteers in the Spanish American War and in World War I, before Native Americans were granted U.S. citizenship. At the Wind River Reservation alone, close to 900 tribal members have served in conflicts ranging from World War I to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/08/11/north-korea-missiles-would-strike-guam-14-minutes/558377001/", "title": "North Korea missiles can reach Guam in 14 minutes, local official says", "text": "Shawn Raymundo\n\nPacific (Guam) Daily News\n\nHAGÅTÑA, Guam — If North Korea fires missiles toward Guam, the deadly weapons would take about 14 minutes to reach the island, said Guam Homeland Security spokeswoman Jenna Gaminde.\n\nShe said residents would be immediately notified by the 15 All-Hazards Alert Warning System sirens, located in low-lying areas throughout the island.\n\nNorth Korea announced Thursday that the nation has a detailed plan for a missile strike near Guam using four intermediate-range ballistic rockets.\n\n“Our office will be notified from the military and will utilize all forms of mass communication to get the message out to the public,” Gaminde said. Local media, village mayors and social media would be used to disseminate information, she said.\n\nMore:What it will take to avoid a catastrophic war with North Korea\n\nMore:President Trump: Maybe my 'fire and fury' threats against North Korea weren't tough enough\n\nGaminde urged island residents to tune into local media for further instructions if sirens began sounding.\n\nNorth Korea said under its attack plan, four Hwasong-12 rockets would fly over Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi prefectures in Japan, hitting waters 19 to 25 miles from the island, the Associated Press reported. The plan could be sent to leader Kim Jong Un for approval within a week or so.\n\nGreg Kuntz, acting public affairs director for Joint Region Marianas, said the military on island continues to maintain standard operations amid threats from North Korea.\n\n“We always maintain a high state of readiness,” Kuntz said. “We’re maintaining normal operations.”\n\nLocal and federal officials said there’s no change in threat level and all operations continue as normal.\n\nKuntz said that nothing has changed in terms of Joint Region Marianas’ procedures when it comes to communications between the military and dependents.\n\nGov. Eddie Calvo and Guam Homeland Security Advisor George Charfauros on Wednesday noted the defense systems put in place in the region, such as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile system permanently stationed at Andersen Air Force Base.\n\nGuam’s faced previous threats of a rocket attack from North Korea, which has been conducting frequent tests of its nuclear missile capability. Most recently, in March 2013, North Korean military officials made a statement about Andersen Air Force Base being within “striking range.”\n\nIn October 2006, an unofficial spokesman for North Korea in Japan told ABC Radio Australia that Guam, Japan and Hawaii were potential targets if the U.N. levied tougher sanctions against North Korea.\n\nCarl Peterson, president of Money Resources Inc., who serves on the Guam Chamber of Commerce's Armed Forces Committee, expressed confidence in the U.S. military's defense capabilities.\n\n“I don’t think there’s anything to worry about. No missile is going to land on Guam,” Peterson said Thursday. “We’ve got defense mechanisms in place … they have the ability to seek out the missiles with kinetic energy and destroy it.”\n\n“(The North has) improved their missile launch capacity, but that’s neither here nor there,” he said. “If you’re going to fire it at somebody, it’s going to get shot down. Now they have more capacity for launching missiles, but in my view, no missile is going to hit Guam.”\n\nIsland residents woke up Wednesday to national headlines of the North Korean missile threat, which came after President Trump said, “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States.”\n\nTrump told reporters from the clubhouse of his Bedminster, N.J., golf course that Kim “has been very threatening beyond a normal state, and as I said they will be met with fire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.”\n\nU.S. tensions with North Korea and its ambitions to obtain a nuclear weapon have been a concern for the last four presidential administrations, Peterson noted. Regardless of who was in the White House, he said, diplomacy failed.\n\n\"It’s gotten progressively worse over the last 20 years,” Peterson said.\n\nTrump's rhetoric toward North Korea has sparked criticism. Peterson said he reserves judgment, stating that everyone responds differently to a bully.\n\nMore:Investment anxiety? What to do if North Korea has you worried\n\nMore:To tame North Korea, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson must master Washington\n\nSecretary of Defense Jim Mattis on Wednesday echoed Trump’s tough stance against the threats from the North, stating that a provocation would be met with the “destruction of its people.”\n\n“The (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons,” Mattis told the North Korea leader in a Department of Defense press release. “The DPRK should cease any consideration of action that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people.”\n\nThe U.S. and its allies, Mattis said, are capable of fending off an attack. He added that Kim should “take heed\" of the U.N.’s security council, which believes North Korea “poses a threat to global security and stability.”\n\n“While our State Department is making every effort to resolve this global threat through diplomatic means, it must be noted that the combined allied militaries now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth.”\n\nTommy Cho, president of the Korean Association of Guam, advised island residents not to worry about a possible attack from North Korea. He said North Korea has been threatening war for more than 50 years, but so far it’s been all talk.\n\n“Local people are asking, “Why are they targeting Guam?’ … (Kim) needs to protect his position,” Cho said. He said Kim, like his father and grandfather before him, is leading a nation where poverty and hunger are major problems. “They are trying to show the North Korean people, we can do everything for Mr. Kim.”\n\n“Don’t worry about missiles,” Cho said. “The U.S. will protect everything.”\n\nCho said there are missile defenses in Japan and on Guam, as well as on ships at sea. “Anything coming in a missile, they’ll attack in the air,” he said.\n\nHe said his biggest concern is that tourists from Japan and South Korea will cancel their trips to Guam, and that will lead to economic problems on the island.\n\nAbout 2.2% of the 163,000 people in Guam are of Korean ethnicity, according to the CIA World Factbook. In addition, visitors from South Korea recently surpassed visitors from Japan as the dominant force in Guam’s tourism market. In July, more than 61,000 tourists from South Korea visited the island, an increase of 25% over last year.\n\nContributing: Rick Cruz, Pacific Daily News.

It recalled the ex-President’s insistence that an official account of a conversation in which he self-evidently coerced the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden with the promise of military aid was, on the contrary, evidence of “a perfect call.”\n\nTrump’s approach immediately gives his supporters in the GOP and on conservative media new material to muddy the waters, distort the case against him and accuse the DOJ and the FBI of political motives.\n\nBut he did not address the core questions swirling around him in the documents case. These include: why did a former president need material, some bearing the highest designations of classification in the intelligence community? And why did he keep material that could potentially damage national security and endanger US agents overseas in insecure locations in his heavily visited resort?\n\nAnd he also ignored a fundamental principle underlying the Justice Department investigation: According to US law, the papers of former presidents do not belong to the individual who once sat in the Oval Office. They belong to the nation and should be in the custody of the National Archives – an agency that made exhaustive efforts to retrieve Trump’s haul before turning to the Justice Department.\n\nOften Trump’s political and legal strategies cross-pollinate. This was highly successful in the case of the Ukraine call, which led to his first impeachment, although he avoided conviction in the Senate, which could have removed him from office. The complication here, however, is that Trump is facing not political scrutiny but the judgment of the law. And recent days suggest that he’s deeply exposed – not least because of a scathing Justice Department filing on Tuesday that obliterated many of his previous defenses and raised the possibility that Trump and his lawyers could face obstruction charges.\n\nStill Trump’s Wednesday filing, in support of his call for the appointment of an independent official known as a special master to work out whether the FBI took legally privileged documents from his home, could still work for him in the short term. If a judge agrees with his expansive definition of the role, Trump could throw a stick in the spokes of the investigation. He might be able to launch court challenges rooted in legal and executive privilege claims that could be frivolous but would take time to work through the system. And he could challenge the Presidential Records Act through various and exhaustive levels of the legal system. A hearing on Trump’s request is set for 1 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\nIf he can push the investigation deep into 2023 and possibly beyond, it could conflict with the presidential campaign and help Trump portray the episode as a politicized effort by the Biden administration to thwart his return to the White House. And he could once more frustrate political opponents desperate to see him quickly pay a price for his refusal to observe presidential norms and constant challenges to the rule of law.\n\nThis is one reason why the DOJ urged the judge to equip any special master she appoints with exceedingly limited guidelines for operation.\n\nIn itself, a special master is not an unreasonable request in such a case, according to legal experts, though the curiosity here is that Trump waited until the government had documents it took from Mar-a-Lago for two weeks to make it.\n\n“If the government’s case is as they think it is, let’s just play it straight, let a special master come in,” David Schoen, Trump’s lawyer from his second impeachment trial, said on CNN’s “New Day” on Thursday.\n\n“But why not let that process run out? Because a part of this whole scenario has to be – satisfy the public that there’s been a full and fair airing of everything, that all concerns have been addressed.”\n\nHow Trump keeps sabotaging his own defense\n\nAt the same time, however, Wednesday’s filing also threatened to backfire since it appeared to admit to the transgression of which Trump is accused – keeping classified information at his home. This could be another self-inflicted legal blow. Much like the revelations by the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection, the longer the process goes on, the more damning it seems to become for Trump.\n\nWhile the ex-President has succeeded in politicizing the investigation, and uniting much of the GOP behind him, his gambits so far have often only revealed more and more damning evidence about his own conduct.\n\nThe Justice Department, meanwhile, seems to be constantly outwitting Trump’s politicized and emotional defenses, which typically fail to address substantive legal issues.\n\nThe most concrete example of this is the remarkable legal filing by the DOJ on Tuesday night that argued that highly classified material was “likely concealed and removed” from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago. In a staggering photo, the filing showed document title pages bearing highly classified markings on the floor after they were found on the former President’s property. The DOJ filing also suggests that Trump’s lawyers misled the FBI when they attested that all secret documents had been removed earlier this year, a potential trigger for obstruction charges.\n\nWhat is striking about this is that Americans would never have had this level of insight into the case were it not for Trump himself.\n\n“The response that the Justice Department gave was perfectly appropriate,” conservative attorney George Conway told CNN’s Pamela Brown Wednesday. “The Trump people just basically asked to be punched in the face and they were punched in the face by the response,” Conway said.\n\nDave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, Florida, where Mar-a-Lago is located, agreed that Trump’s request for a special master had only worsened his position.\n\n“This is yet another self-inflicted wound by Trump’s legal team. (The special master motion) opened the gates for the DOJ to respond with a 36-page missile right into the heart of Trump Tower,” Aronberg, a Democrat, said on CNN’s “The Situation Room.”\n\n“You have got this response that decimates Trump claims that his team was fully cooperative the whole time. Actually, it lays out a case of obstruction.”\n\nIt was not the first time that Trump had appeared to sabotage his own position.\n\nEarlier in August, Attorney General Merrick Garland pressed for the release of a search warrant that showed classified documents were taken from his home three weeks ago. This revelation, which undermined Trump’s criticism of the search and revealed that the FBI had reason to believe classified information was on the property, only took place after Trump announced the search himself, then unleashed a storm of disinformation and threats against the bureau.\n\nLike many of Trump’s legal filings, Wednesday night’s document seemed as much designed to address a political audience – and to fan his campaign of fury against the Justice Department – as to ease his legal conundrum.\n\nThere is much that remains unknown about this case. It is reasonable for Trump and his allies to demand answers about how the Justice Department handled a hugely sensitive case against an ex-president and possible 2024 presidential candidate. So far, however, there is every sign the DOJ is going by the book. The search was, for instance, not illegal as Trump claims but was permitted by a search warrant signed by a judge who had to be convinced of probable cause a crime had been committed. It is also impossible to get a full window into the case because the underlying affidavit that precipitated the search warrant has only been released in highly redacted form to protect witnesses and FBI agents from backlash and to maintain the integrity of the investigation.\n\nTrump’s 2024 calculation is getting more complicated\n\nThe fallout of the FBI raid on Trump’s property has thrust the former President back into the headlines in a way that Republicans keen to focus on inflation and Biden’s low approval ratings in the midterm elections do not welcome.\n\nIt has also raised questions about how the legal pressure bearing down on him will impact his likely 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nCNN’s Orr and Holmes reported that after months eyeing Labor Day weekend as the target launch date for his 2024 campaign, he has spent the last few weeks backing away from that timeline.\n\nAn onslaught of political concerns – raised by the possibility some of his hand-picked candidates are underperforming in the midterms – and his growing legal worries have Trump nervous about prematurely diving into the race, according to nine former and current Trump aides and allies who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters.\n\n“Everyone was operating under the assumption that shortly after Labor Day would be the best possible time to launch, but that has changed and he’s being told to deal with the FBI stuff first,” said a Trump adviser.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}]}

That's when Troy Bolton, Gabriella Marquez and the rest of the East High School Wildcats burst onto the small screen in High School Musical .\n\nThe franchise was so successful that it spawned two sequels and became a childhood, pop culture essential for many Millennials. In true high school fashion, (most of) the cast reunited for a highly anticipated, 10-year reunion TV special on Jan. 20, which aired on the Disney Channel.\n\nWhile the lives of Troy and Gabriella will be forever immortalized on TV and on the big screen, the stars who played these high school students have moved beyond East High in the last decade, as to be expected. Here’s an update on what the former Wildcats are up to now. Bonus: Real students weigh in.\n\nZac Efron\n\nThen: Efron was 18 years old when he first stole the hearts of viewers as Bolton, the star of East High's basketball team who had a secret passion: musical theater.\n\nNow: He's co-starring in the comedy Dirty Grandpa, which premieres Jan. 22, with Robert De Niro.\n\nAs Troy, “he really displayed how athletes can also enjoy the arts, and there doesn't need to be such a divide between athletics and the arts,” says Pedro Da Silva, a freshman at Santa Clara University.\n\n“Everyone wanted Troy as their best friend or boyfriend,” Alison Joyce, a Connecticut College freshman, says.\n\nAfter the Disney gig, Efron worked steadily as an actor. He even reprised his role as a high school hoop star in the 2009 film 17 Again .\n\nAccording to his IMDb page, he works on a project nearly every year. Some of the most notable included Nicholas Spark’s 2012 film, The Lucky One, and 2014’s college comedy, Neighbors .\n\nEfron admitted himself to rehab for alcoholism and substance abuse in 2013, but the actor says he's been sober since 2014. He's currently dating Sami Mir ó , a “vintage curator and stylist,” according to her Instagram.\n\nVanessa Hudgens\n\nThen: Hudgens was 17 when she first took on the role of Montez, the new girl at East High with a knack for chemistry.\n\nNow: Hudgens recently launched her own lifestyle website, Astral & Opal. She's dating fellow actor Austin Butler.\n\nHudgens, now 27, took on some low-key roles after High School Musical 3: Senior Year (the one made as a feature film) before appearing in 2011's Sucker Punch . In 2012, she starred in the edgy Spring Breakers alongside James Franco.\n\nBrookie Natal, a freshman at Columbia College Chicago, says Hudgens is her favorite HSM cast member.\n\n“Her character is so strong and she was my role model as a kid. I had this red dress and would sing When There Was Me and You all the time,” she says.\n\nAshley Tisdale\n\nThen: Tisdale's character, Sharpay Evans, was East High's biggest diva, an unabashed Troy Bolton admirer and the co-president of East High's drama club. She was 20 when the franchise started.\n\nNow: Now 30, Tisdale works with Disney as a voice actress for the animated show Phineas and Ferb , which premiered in 2007. She married musician Christopher French in 2014 and, incidentally, Hudgens served as one of her bridesmaids.\n\nLucas Grabeel\n\nThen: Grabeel was 21 when he took on the role of Ryan Evans, co-president of the East High Drama Club and under appreciated twin brother of Sharpay.\n\nNow: Grabeel founded production company 1431 Records in 2007, where he creates music videos, short films and TV pilots.\n\nAfter the final HSM film, he nabbed recurring roles on the ABC Family (now Freeform) series Switched at Birth and Family Guy .\n\nCorbin Bleu\n\nThen: Bleu was comparatively a kid when he hit the screen as Chad Danforth, Bolton's best friend and the creator of the franchise's famous \"What team?\" chant, at 116 years old.\n\nNow: He works with charities including the Starlight Children’s Foundation and the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and is currently engaged to actress Sasha Nicole Clements.\n\nFollowing the success of the first High School Musical TV movie, Bleu landed the lead role in the 2007 Disney Channel movie Jump In! , which also featured actress Keke Palmer. In 2014, he appeared on USA's Psych and Lifetime's Drop Dead Diva. Most notably, Bleu placed second in season 17 of ABC's Dancing with the Stars.\n\nMonique Coleman\n\nThen: Coleman began playing Taylor McKessie, captain of the East High Scholastic Decathlon team and best friend of Gabriella, when she was 25 years old, making her the oldest star of the franchise.\n\nNow: Coleman, 35, hosts online talk show Gimme Mo, which she created in 2009. The show aims to “create an environment where young people feel safe and open to talking about real issues, bringing awareness to organizations that are serving teens, and conducting celebrity interviews to spotlight Hollywood's commitment to giving back,” according to its Facebook page.\n\nShe continued to act after High School Musical , appearing in shows like Bones in 2009 and The Fourth Door in 2015. She was also a regular on the Disney Channel show The Suite Life of Zack and Cody as Mary-Margaret. She was the first HSM alum to compete on Dancing with the Stars, placing fourth in its 2006 season.\n\nOlesya Rulin\n\nThen: Rulin was 19 when she first played Kelsie, East High's soft-spoken piano player.\n\nNow: She currently works with the organization WildAid, which advocates against the trade of animals. According to her Twitter profile, Rulin is a “protector of sharks.\"\n\nBefore her High School Musical career, she was best known for her role in another Millennial childhood staple: Disney Channel movie Halloweentown High . She has since appeared on shows like NCIS and Drop Dead Diva .\n\n\n\nGreta Bjornson is a University of Vermont student and a USA TODAY College correspondent.\n\nThis story originally appeared on the USA TODAY College blog, a news source produced for college students by student journalists.

No guests. No extra songs. Just Swift in the spotlight, swapping love with her fans like a musical friendship bracelet.\n\nRuggieri, who covered the first Eras Tour show and has written about Swift since the singer's debut album, wrote: \"Throughout the show, Swift was as much a consummate professional as she was a sweetheart, hitting her marks with fierce precision and then mouthing \"I love you\" to her backup dancers at the end of 'You Belong With Me.'\"\n\nInside the last Eras tour showTaylor Swift ends 'most beloved chapter of my life'\n\nTaylor Swift ends her tour very much as she started it\n\n“Vancouver I want to thank every single one of you for being a part of the most thrilling chapter of my entire life to date, my beloved Eras Tour,” Swift said before her final tune “Karma.”\n\nThe crowd danced for one final song and, yes, she changed the lyric to “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.”\n\nAnd with the confetti drop, a final bow, and a giant group hug, the Eras Tour has officially come to a close.\n\nEnd of an Era:How Taylor Swift's record shattering tour put fun, freedom centerstage\n\nMeet me at midnight\n\nIf you’re in the mountain, central or eastern time zones, you have already passed midnight. If you’re on the west coast, you can still meet at midnight. Swift is wrapping up her final section of the night. What’s a star gotta do when a diamond’s gotta shine?\n\nIt was the song many Swifties wanted her to play, hoped she would play. Swift didn't disappoint with the surprise acoustic set played on the piano with \"Long Live\" from \"Speak Now\" and \"New Year's Day\" from \"Reputation.\" She then added \"The Manuscript\" from \"TTPD\" before she did her final dive of the Eras Tour under the stage.\n\nThe piano composition ended with the final lines of the \"The Manuscript\": \"The only thing that's left is the manuscript, one last souvenir from my trip to your shores, now and then I reread the manuscript, but the story isn't mine anymore.\"\n\nIt's poetic that the very first piano song on the tour was her the first track of her first album, \"Tim McGraw\" and the final song was the final track of her final album, \"The Manuscript.\"\n\nUltimate goodbye mashupTaylor Swift ends final acoustic set of Eras Tour\n\nWhat songs did Taylor Swift play in the acoustic set?\n\nSwift went old school with \"A Place in this World\" from her first album with \"New Romantics\" from \"1989\" played on her guitar.\n\nTTPD and how did it end?\n\nGrab your typewriters, because we’re heading to The Tortured Poets Department, aka “Female Rage: The Musical.” Swift’s eleventh era was added to the set during year two in Paris and she crams a lot in these 25 minutes: a religious institution, high school bleachers, a haunted house, an alien abduction, an asylum, a battleground and a performer's dressing room.\n\nAround the corner is the surprise set. It’s only two “All Two Well (10 Minute Versions)” away.\n\nThe 'bounciest' part of the show\n\nFrom the woods to the cityscape, Swift enters the upbeat era of “1989.” The singer describes this era as “the danciest, bounciest chapter of the night.” When it comes to the “1989” wardrobe department, she has 36 possibilities to wear between her two-piece combination outfit.\n\nShe chose the yellow top and red skirt for the three final shows in Vancouver. It’s giving Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nRepeat outfits on the Eras TourTaylor Swift wore the same outfits for the Eras Tour in Vancouver. Here's why.\n\nMaking the stadium glow for 'Willow'\n\nThe song, “Willow,” is heard at the end of the “Folklore” and “Evermore” combined set. Looking around BC Place Stadium, fans spotted hundreds of yellow and orange balloons with cellphone lights. The fan project that mimics the orbs held by the dancers started in Amsterdam on July 4 by three Swifties.\n\nSee where the balloon trend startedMeet the girls who started an Eras Tour craze and got a Swift shoutout\n\nThe countdown to the surprise acoustic set\n\n“Marjorie” marks about an hour from the surprise, acoustic set. The crowd holds up cellphone flashlights to illuminate the stadium and honor Swift’s late-grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, who was an opera singer. Finlay’s voice can be heard near the end of the track when Swift sings, “And if I didn't know better I'd think you were singing to me now.”\n\nFinlay and Travis Kelce share the same birthday, October 5.\n\n'Marjorie'How this song connects me to my daughter\n\nHappy early birthday to Taylor\n\nAt the moss-adorned piano, Swift introduced fans to “Folklore’s” sister album, “Evermore.”\n\n“I’m also very proud of that one,” she said explaining how she wrote her eighth and ninth eras during the Covid-19 pandemic. “We didn’t know the future of concerts where we’ll all in the same room gloriously singing the same words at the same time, related to each other, like we’ve all been there before.”\n\nFollowing “Champagne Problems,” Swift stood for a thunderous applause. Some fans chanted “Taylor,” others on livestreams sang “Happy Birthday” to the soon-to-be 35 year old.\n\n“Thank you, this tour has been the adventure of a lifetime,” Swift said before expressing her gratitude to her team and the fans. “I speak on behalf of my band, my crew, my fellow performers, who all left their families and spent time away from everything that they know and love and have performed when they were sick. When anything was going on in their lives, they made sure that this show happened for you and I just wanted to say that on behalf of all of us, we will never forget you giving us that moment. Thank you so much.”\n\nThe standing ovation was three minutes long.\n\nIs it really over?\n\nEdging out of the shadows of “Reputation” is the “Folklore” cottage designed by Ethan Tubman. The one- story construction is wheeled out as soon as a black area in the yellow sparkle animation appears. It is then raised by a stage platform. Swift sits on the stairs out of sight until the lights wash over the stage.\n\nAs she finished her first tune, “Cardigan,” the reality of the tour ending started to set in.\n\n\"It’s just crazy to think I’m going to sing the last song I ever sing in the ‘Folklore’ cabin,” she admitted. “That’s wild. Oh my god! The ‘Folklore’ cabin that I’m currently standing in, this whole thing kind of originated in my imagination.”\n\nThe cabin will sneakily be sucked back into the stage once Swift sings “Illicit Affairs” a black area appears on the black-and-white boardwalk animation.\n\nFolklore explainedTaylor Swift explains how she created 'Folklore' on album's fourth anniversary\n\nWho did we spy in the stadium?\n\nAubrey Plaza is an official Swiftie. In a video posted to X, fans traded friendship bracelets with the “Agatha All Along” actress in a red beret before the show.\n\nHow does she do it?\n\n1… 2… 3… let’s go! During “Delicate,” there are red dots on the LED mesh floor monitors so Swift knows exactly where to stomp to create the glass breaking effect.\n\nIs Taylor clowning?\n\nSssssswifties we are heading into the venomous “Reputation” era. Swift described the entrance to this era in her book, “I always imagined the sound of mysterious footsteps timing up perfectly with the ominous synth beats of ‘…ready for it?’”\n\nThis era has haunted fans for the past year thirsting for a rerecorded album announcement. Global fans have come up with theories as to when the singer will announce “Reputation (Taylor’s Version)” and her eponymous era, “Taylor Swift (Taylor’s Version).”\n\nA full day singing 'All Too Well' over the entire tour\n\nSwift became sentimental during her “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” speech thanking the fandom for creating a safe space of community and trading friendship bracelets. She described the impact and legacy of the tour as joy, togetherness and love.\n\n“I couldn’t be more proud of you,” she said the Vancouver arena. “I just wanted to say you’re why this is so special and you supporting me for as long as you have is why I get to take these lovely walks down memory lane every single night because you cared about every era of my entire life that I’ve been making music so thank you.”\n\nShe asked if the crowd had 10 minutes to spare. She’s played the song on the tour for a grand total of: 1 day 1 hour 22 minutes and 17 seconds.\n\nTaylor Swift says tour's legacy is joyHow do we keep this happiness alive?\n\nLike ever! What did Kam say during the 'Red' era\n\nNext for “We Are Never Getting Back Together,” dancer Kameron Saunders — who has a spoken line — shouted “For the last time, No!” during the bridge. For the first 53 American stops, Saunders said the original “Like ever” line. He then came up with 93 unique phrases custom to every city across the globe.\n\nNever againEvery way dancer Kameron Saunders has said 'like ever' on Taylor Swift's Eras Tour\n\nI'm not crying, you're crying\n\nIt feels like a perfect night to dress up in the “This is not Taylor’s Version” bedazzled shirt and custom hat designed by milliner Gladys Tamez. Tonight the 149th recipient of the “22” hat was crowned. The last one.\n\nThis part doesn’t just make me tear up, Jason Kelce has said the same thing.\n\nHow do you get Taylor Swift's '22' hat?Here's everything we know\n\nIn our football era\n\nWe interrupt the \"Fearless\" era to bring some Travis Kelce news! The Chiefs won 19-17 against the Los Angeles Chargers. The defending Super Bowl Champs led the first half 13-0. The third and fourth quarters were a little too close for comfort but they ultimately came out on top. Swift is probably going to shout out Kelce during \"Karma.\" Stay tuned.\n\nOur 'Fearless' era\n\nSixty-thousand hand-hearts gestured back to Swift as she sang the title track to her second era, “Fearless.” In her Eras Tour book, she described the era as the time of high school crushes, daydreams and whimsy.\n\n“This is the first moment in the show where we highlight the magnificent musicians in my live band, who are also the studio musicians who play on the Taylor’s Versions of my re-records.” Half of the six bandmates have been with Swift since the beginning concerts of her career including guitarists Mike Meadows and Paul Sidoti and bassist Amos Heller.\n\nHer four back-up vocalists, dubbed the Starlights, have also been with her for more than a decade.\n\nThe Eras Tour castMeet Taylor Swift's dancers, singers and band members\n\nA promise of what is to come\n\nTo close out Swift’s “Lover” era, she welcomed fans before singing the title track.\n\n“It is such an honor to get to say these words to you, ‘Vancouver, welcome to the Eras Tour,’” Swift beamed.\n\n“You know we have toured the entire world with this tour,” the singer mentioned. “We have had so many adventures. It’s been the most exciting, powerful, electrifying, intense, most challenging thing I’ve done in my entire life. We’ve gotten to perform in front of 10 million people on this tour. And tonight we get to play one more show for you tonight, here in Vancouver and we’re gonna make it count.”\n\nAs the crowd cheered for the Eras Tour host, she added at the end, “Here’s something you should know. You’re about to hear a lot of songs. There are a lot of songs in this show.”\n\nAnyone else crossing their fingers that this message is a foreshadow she added a few songs? We’ll know soon enough.\n\nOur one last grand adventure together\n\n\"We are about to go on one last grand adventure together,\" Swift says, introducing the show. She keeps saying \"last\" maybe to remind us, this is it. After 149 shows, almost two years and 51 cities, this is our final night of following the livestreams, guessing the surprise songs, singing along, and posting about our favorite moments.\n\nGrab your tissues.\n\nOh hi, Taylor!\n\nIt’s been a longtime coming. Two years in fact. Taylor Swift is onstage for the culmination of the Eras Tour. Buckle up we are in for a three hour plus show. Swift is repeating the same “Lover” outfit from night one and two.\n\n“So it’s feeling like it’s a pretty cool night to be in Vancouver, huh?” Swift says in the spotlights of the BC Place Stadium.\n\n“You’re making me feel like tonight we get to spend the last night of the Eras Tour with 60,000 beautiful people in Vancouver,” she smiled while her dancers put on a shimmering black blazer. “I guess what I’m trying to say is you’re making me feel like I’m the man.”\n\nHave a great show everyone!! Happy last eras tour show!!\n\nThe final intro to the Eras Tour show\n\nSay don’t go! The final overture is about to be underway. The order of eras in the introduction is:\n\n\"It's Fearless\"\n\n\"Big Reputation\"\n\n\"And they said, 'Speak Now'\"\n\n\"Into Folklore\"\n\n\"My name is Taylor, and I was born in 1989\"\n\n\"Straight from The Tortured Poets Department\"\n\n\"Evermore\"\n\n\"Cause loving him was Red\"\n\n\"Meet me at Midnight\"\n\n\"Lover\"\n\nTake your bathroom break now\n\nBathroom break warning! Ice Spice’s “In Ha Mood” started playing which means Swift and her team have completed their pre-show huddle. In Swift’s official Eras Tour book she shared, “Every night before we got to he stage, the band, dancers and I get in a huddle and someone gives a speech to get us fired up to play, motivate us, or just say whatever is on their mind.”\n\nSwift is heading to the stage in a compartment with wheels labeled “Cleaning cart.” Crew members are pushing her behind her bandmates and dancers.\n\nNext will be Lady Gaga’s “Applause” and then Leslie Gore’s “You Don’t Own Me” while the 2:24 countdown click ticks down to Taylor.\n\nYes, you are watching this show from a grainy livestream, like some of us are, so we know your phone can go with you.\n\nWhat surprises does Taylor have in store for her final Eras Tour show ever? Will Taylor Swift change her final show?\n\nFans are guessing whether they'll see Fortnight collaborator Post Malone or producer Jack Antonoff at the show. Malone hasn't performed at any of her shows, however Antonoff did in August. What about longtime collaborator Aaron Dessner?\n\nHow much money has Taylor Swift made from the Eras Tour?\n\nIt's been estimated that she will make more than $4 billion.\n\nWe don't have totals yet. But in 2023 alone, Swift’s mega-sized Eras Tour took in an estimated ticket gross of $1.04 billion from 4.35 million tickets sold, according to music industry trade publication Pollstar.\n\nSwift is now the richest female musician with an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion, according to Forbes magazine in October.\n\nAre you watching Eras Tour livestream and trying to keep an eye on the Chiefs game?\n\nWe've got you.\n\nChiefs check for the football Swiftie! The halftime score between Kansas City and the Los Angeles Chargers is very Swift-coded. The red-and-gold are leading the game 13-0. USA TODAY is providing live updates on the game.\n\nGracie Abrams isn't ready for Eras Tour to end\n\nFollowing her first song, “Risk,” Gracie Abrams read from a piece of paper to share her thoughts with the crowd.\n\n“I wrote something because that’s how my brain works and I just wanted to read it because I don’t know the next time we’ll be in the same room together,” she said as fans said aww in the audience.\n\n“I’m not ready for it to be over,” she said of the Eras Tour. “I’m not saying that because I have the privilege of being one of her lucky openers, I’m saying that because like all of you I’ve grown up with Taylor’s songs, magically needing a moment in my life that I didn’t think anyone else could understand or know or ache or mourn or love or lost, and yet she knew.”\n\n“Vancouver this is our last song,” Abrams said with tears welling in her eyes thanking the singer and her family and crew.\n\nHere’s her nine song setlist:\n\nRisk\n\nI Love You, I'm Sorry\n\n21\n\nI Told You Things\n\nLet It Happen\n\nThat’s So True\n\nFree Now\n\nUs.\n\nClose To You\n\nGracie Abrams takes the stage for one last time\n\nLast call for Gracie Abrams! The 25-year-old donned a cardigan and silk dress with lace Sunday night. She parted her hair on the side and added a voluminous style. Abrams has been with Swift since Oct. 18 in Miami, Florida. In 2023, she toured with the Eras Tour 30 times. Last night, the songstress joined Swift during the surprise set. They performed Abrams’ “I Love You, I’m Sorry” and Swift’s “Last Kiss.”\n\nIs Taylor Swift announcing 'Reputation (Taylor's Version)' at the final night of the Eras Tour show?\n\nTaylor Swift played the final song from “Reputation” and the 92,000 fans in Wembley Stadium in August screeched so loud thinking it would lead to the rerelease announcement of the singer’s sixth album. She has yet to say when, but fans say the Easter eggs point to tonight.\n\nThe clowning for the rerecord has taken up much of the tour as fans theorize which date it will be based on which Reputation era bodysuit Swift wears, if it appears to shedding sequins, and other theories. At least after tonight, the clowning will end - or move off the tour and just to socials!\n\nIs Taylor Swift filming a documentary at her final Eras Tour show?\n\nProduction crews have moved cameras, including the massive jib, inside the BC Place Stadium again tonight. The past two days, fans have noticed an uptick in cinematic cameras. It’s why the singer has worn the same outfits for two nights in a row. Christian Cubacub, a TikTok influencer, has been closely following the production elements. He posted several TikTok’s explaining the night three setup.\n\nIf Swift comes out in a blue-and-gold bodysuit and dons a black blazer, don’t be surprised. It’s for the continuity of a possible concert film or documentary.\n\nFans are entering the stadium and getting ready for the Eras Tour\n\nBC Place Stadium is at about half capacity with fans still trickling inside. The behind-the-scenes videos of “Bejeweled” and https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/12/09/taylor-swift-directing-first-feature-film/10864987002/“All Too Well - The Short Film” are playing on the back screen. Gracie Abrams should start her opening act in about ten minutes.\n\nSo is Jason Kelce playing Santa at the Eras Tour?\n\nIt looks like Santa Claus and Buddy the Elf are fans of the Eras Tour. Swifties sitting behind the stage snapped a photo of the two taking pictures before the show.\n\nDo we think this is a bit? Anyone taking bets that it’s Jason Kelce, Travis Kelce's brother? His broadcasting gig for ESPN is for Monday Night Football. Or maybe it’s Swift’s brother Austin who dressed up as Santa Claus at the Chiefs Christmas game last year.\n\nUpdate: We've learned the elf is a member of Swift's crew.\n\nx.com\n\nWill Travis Kelce be at the final night of the Eras Tour?\n\nNumber 87 will not be at the final show in Vancouver. Travis Kelce is at Arrowhead Stadium for a home game against the Los Angeles Chargers. Kick-off started at 8:20 p.m. ET / 5:20 p.m. PT. And we already checked to see if he could make a last-minute flight after the game. It’s a three and a half hour trip even on a private jet, at best.\n\nDo you think he watches the grainy livestream between plays? Or has his own feed?\n\nKelce has made it to 14 shows as Swift’s boyfriend (15 if you count his very first Kansas City concert in July). Every single time Kelce has been in attendance, the singer has changed the lyrics to “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.”\n\nSwift has also sung those lyrics two other times with Travis not in the crowd: on Oct. 20 in Miami and Oct. 27 in New Orleans. He had two games those days and the Chiefs won. So don’t be surprised if she says the line again tonight!\n\nWhat did critics say on the very first night of the Eras Tour?\n\nUSA TODAY national music writer Melissa Ruggieri attended and reviewed the very first night of the Eras Tour in March of 2023 in Glendale, Ariz. Ruggieri has covered Swift since the singer began her career 18 years ago.\n\nWhile Ruggieri is in Vancouver, Canada, for the final show - and you'll see her review here soon after the show, here is what she wrote way before the Eras Tour grew into what it is now.\n\n\"Not since the most vigorous days of Bruce Springsteen and his legendary live concerts has a mainstream artist packed so much music into one show,\" Ruggieri wrote at the time.\n\nOf all the stories she wrote last year - and there were many! - the setlist from the Eras Tour is what keeps bringing readers back before they attend the show.\n\nAbout the show, Ruggieri wrote: \"But more than just a roll call of her ubiquitous smash singles and fan-beloved album cuts, Swift’s show is as ambitious as a Broadway musical. Numerous moving set pieces, squads of dancers and backup singers, a quick-change costume parade, confetti, pyro, synchronized blinking wristbands and a gorgeous curved video screen to blanket her always-smiling visage to those in the farthest rafters complemented her songs, while her multifaceted band perched unobtrusively on a corner of the stage.\"\n\nRuggieri wrote this about the Folklore era: \"While her voice easily swerved from gentle to robust throughout the show, Swift’s vocals on the gripping “Betty,” with its singalong chorus, soared as one of her best of the night.\n\nRead our original Eras tour reviewTaylor Swift rewards fans with 44 songs at Eras Tour opener: Inside her triumphant return\n\nWill Post Malone play at tonight's Eras Tour?\n\nThe last time Taylor Swift concluded a leg of her tour was London on Aug. 20 when she surprised the audience with special guest appearances from Florence Welch and Jack Antonoff and debuted her “I Can Do It With A Broken Heart” music video.\n\nOn Saturday night, Swift brought out her friend and opening act, Gracie Abrams, to perform a mashup of “I Love You, I’m Sorry” and “Last Kiss,” telling the crowd, “Tonight is the last opportunity that Gracie and I have to perform together on this tour.”\n\nFans are guessing who will be the show. Could Post Malone, her Fortnight collaborator, show up?\n\nWhy was that the last opportunity and what surprises are in store? We'll be watching along with you tonight to share.\n\nCan I still get a ticket to the show?\n\nIf you have a last-minute hankering to attend the Sunday show, resale tickets are still available. At last check, the cheapest ticket on StubHub.com was an obstructed view seat, behind the stage, going for $900. The most expensive seat was on the floor and cost almost $12,000.\n\nWhere did Eras tickets cost the most?See which city cracked $3,000 per seat\n\nWhat was it like covering the tour?\n\nAs the official Taylor Swift reporter for The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY network, I'm not being hyperbolic when I say the Eras Tour has been my job — and really, my life — for the past 13 months. I've posted 501 articles, made 42 television appearances, published 974 photos, edited 38 videos, filmed a documentary and written a book on Swift.\n\nIt all started with USA TODAY's viral job posting for the world's first full-time, dedicated Taylor Swift reporter in the summer of 2023. The memories I've made may be unique to me, but the overall themes are common to anyone who went to one or more Eras Tour shows.\n\nYou can read what it was like to travel four continents with this tour in a personal reflection here.\n\nAnd even though this chapter is wrapping up, Swift is already working on her next project. In the foreword to her official concert book, she wrote, \"See you in the next era.\" It's one I plan to cover.\n\nBryan West shares allI spent a year covering Taylor Swift's Eras Tour around the world. Here's what it was like\n\nWhile fans may be reeling, asking, “Is It Over Now?” The answer is yes. Well, at least according to Swift. She’s said multiple times that Vancouver will be the final show.\n\nOn Saturday, Swift said: “I’m just feeling so overjoyed that we decided to spend our last couple of shows in Vancouver. You’re so unbelievable. I love you so much. Aw, my face hurts from grinning. Thank you for that moment. You guys are the best!”\n\nDuring the “All Too Well” section of the 100th Eras Tour show in Liverpool, Swift told the crowd, \"This is the very first time I’ve ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is going to end in December.” That very last night will be Sunday.\n\nThe Eras Tour is endingWhy is was what we desperately needed. Now what?\n\nJust north of False Creek in downtown Vancouver, Canada, is BC Place Stadium. The British Columbia arena — with the largest cable supported retractable roof in the world — opened in 1983 and can fit more than 50,000 fans. Swift is the first performer to sell out three shows on a single tour. On the front of the stadium is a 140-foot inflatable friendship bracelet. Shawn Kolodny, a contemporary artist and sculptor, designed the jewelry for the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. The art was then passed to the succeeding shows in Indianapolis, Toronto and now Vancouver.\n\nTaylor Swift published her own official Eras Tour book including 500+ images from the show and new insights into its production. According to Circana's BookScan, which tracks the majority of print market sales, 814,000 copies of the book sold its first week. That makes the behind-the-scenes collector's item the second-highest adult nonfiction release after Barack Obama's memoir \"A Promised Land\" sold 816,300 copies in 2020.\n\nComplementing Swift's tome is USA TODAY Network's \"This Swift Beat,\" which follows the news, the impact and the fans of the songwriter's magnum opus. We haven't sold anywhere close to 800,000 copies, but we haven't given up hope!\n\nYou also can do what we've been doing: Watching the Eras Tour concert movie.\n\nThe third version of the movie released with unlimited rewatches to Disney+ subscribers included \"Cardigan\" and four bonus acoustic songs eliminated from version two released on Swift's birthday last year, Dec. 13. The streaming service even customized its menu with the singer's 10 albums and movies and shows that fit each era. And parents, keep in mind curse words aren't bleeped out.\n\nUp-and-coming singer-songwriter Gracie Abrams has been opening for Taylor Swift the entire final North American leg of the Eras Tour.\n\nThe two collaborated on the song \"Us.\" on Abrams' album \"The Secret of Us.\"\n\nOn Night 2 in Vancouver, Swift invited Abrams to join her onstage for the second-to-last acoustic set of the record-breaking tour.\n\n\"You guys met my friend Gracie earlier, right?\" Swift teased about Abrams who has opened for her on and off throughout the tour. \"She's also my friend and when I set out on the Eras Tour, I kind of made this invisible decision that I was going to invite artists out on this tour that felt like family.\"\n\nSwift encouraged the 25-year-old starlet in a shimmery black dress to join her for a mashup of two of their songs. They blended Abrams' \"I Love You, I'm Sorry\" and Swift's \"Last Kiss.\" This is the fourth time Abrams has joined Swift onstage during the acoustic section.\n\nUnless you are on the Pacific coast, it’s going to be a late night!\n\nHere are the approximate times opening act Gracie Abrams will take the stage, Taylor Swift will perform and the surprise songs should happen.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/12/09/taylor-swift-eras-tour-last-show-review/76826185007/", "title": "Taylor Swift ends Eras tour in Vancouver: Inside the last show", "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia – Taylor Swift rounded the sides of her massive stage, arms outstretched in her magenta shawl, the last notes of her final Eras Tour concert an entry into the luminous history of her career. Clasping hands with her backup singers and dancers, she concluded \"the most beloved chapter of my life,\" she said.\n\nSunday night was also one of the most memorable excursions in pop music history, doing it, as usual, her way. No guests. No extra songs. Just Swift in the spotlight, swapping love with her fans like a musical friendship bracelet.\n\nShe took the crowd on \"one last grand adventure,\" which, she said, has been shared with more than 10 million people since her live extravaganza began.\n\nThroughout the show, Swift was as much a consummate professional as she was a sweetheart, hitting her marks with fierce precision and then mouthing \"I love you\" to her backup dancers at the end of \"You Belong With Me.\"\n\nSwift’s farewell, the 149th performance on her billion-dollar-earning Eras Tour that has spanned five continents and 51 cities, arrived at Vancouver’s BP Place stadium with the same engrossing mix of precise songcraft, spiffy production and cool glam as when she first unveiled her live opus 21 months ago in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThat night, jaws dropped at the realization that when Swift said she planned to present all of the musical eras in her then-17-year career, she didn’t mean a trite, two-hour mix of medleys.\n\nNo, Swift’s genius concept – and the ultimate reward to steadfast enthusiasts who catapulted her from successful country-pop chanteuse to the most mega of stars – was a carefully constructed 3 ½-hour career overview unlike anything ever seen on a concert stage.\n\n“I’ve never done this many shows,” Swift admitted during her three sold-out (as usual) nights of the Canadian conclusion. “But you guys have made it such a wonderful experience.”\n\nTaylor Swift wears her emotions proudly\n\nSwift’s easy accessibility, one of her most endearing traits, was on display Sunday from the moment she greeted fans with her usual, “Oh, hi” and a red-lipsticked grin between the opening salvo of “Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince” and No. 1 hit “Cruel Summer.”\n\nFan ovations were frequent and lengthy. Not that there haven’t been outpourings of unconditional adoration at every show whenever she bats her cat-eyelined eyes or tilts her head with a combination of gratitude and bemusement.\n\nEnd of an Era:How Taylor Swift's record shattering tour put fun, freedom centerstage\n\nBut the sustained roar at the end of “Champagne Problems” as Swift sat behind her moss-covered piano, bangs damp against her forehead, was nearly as long as the four-minute song.\n\nWith an awed expression and misty eyes, Swift marveled at the waves of aural affection, taking out her ear monitors to fully experience the overwhelming sound. After reminding the crowd of the dedication of her band and crew, Swift smiled and thanked the crowd. \"We will never forget you guys giving us that moment,\" she said.\n\nSwift teared up a few times, keenly aware that tonight meant the last black hat she’d bestow on a lucky kid’s head during “22” and her final opportunity to playfully waggle her hips in a short sequined skirt to “Shake it Off.”\n\nWhat were Taylor Swift's final surprise songs?\n\nThe nine eras of Swift’s show captivate with their own personalities. The vengeful red-and-black snake motif of “Reputation” and its snarling “Look What You Made Me Do” and the monochrome Hollywood glam of “The Tortured Poets Department” – a May addition after she dropped the 30-track album in April – with its stoic drumline during “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” and the visceral discotheque that is “I Can Do it With a Broken Heart” among the highlights.\n\nBut the portion of the Eras Tour that has captivated fans of Swift’s immense catalog and spurred repeated attendances regardless of ticket price, is her “surprise” songs, one on acoustic guitar and one behind her flower-decorated piano.\n\nTaylor Swift setlist:All the songs on her epic Eras tour\n\nAt Saturday’s penultimate show, Swift welcomed protégé and show opener Gracie Abrams to share the spotlight for a mashup of “I Love You, I’m Sorry” and “Last Kiss,” which ended with tight hugs between the friends.\n\nSunday’s closure, the culmination of so much emotion and so much connection with her fans – almost 60,000 at each Vancouver date – hit the perfect note. Saying she wanted to go \"back to the beginning,\" Swift offered the mashup of \"A Place in This World\" from her 2006 debut album and \"New Romantics\" from “1989” on guitar. But feelings heightened with a gorgeous piano trilogy of \"Long Live\" (“Speak Now”), \"New Year's Day\" (“Reputation”) and \"The Manuscript\" (“The Tortured Poets Department”), the chorus 'hold on to the memories\" resonating deeply in the stadium as Swift closed her eyes and threw her head back as she played.\n\nMore:Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is what we desperately needed. Now what?\n\nTaylor Swift is too ambitious to disappear for long\n\nThough happy tears were to be expected as Swift said goodbye, she isn’t the type of performer to pull an Adele and disappear for a few years.\n\nYes, she has a seemingly thriving personal life with NFL star Travis Kelce and deserves a break after a thoroughly exhausting schedule for nearly two years (really three, as she noted from the stage, given the year of prep time and rehearsals).\n\nThe dedication was worth it, Swift told Sunday's crowd because, \"you have created such a space for joy and togetherness and love.\"\n\nBut Swift is too ambitious, too prolific, too fond of sharing her words and music with fans who manage to present new levels of adoration the more she leaves it all on the stage for them.\n\nEven though this marathon has ended, it feels as if another race will soon approach the starting line.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/concerts/2024/11/03/taylor-swift-indianapolis-lucas-oil-stadium-n3-live-coverage-eras-tour-gracie-abrams/75939810007/", "title": "Relive Taylor Swift's final U.S. Eras Tour show, Indianapolis N3", "text": "Taylor Swift marked the end of an era for her epic Eras Tour on Sunday evening in Indianapolis to the cheers of more than 69,000 fans from around the country and beyond.\n\n\"The very last U.S. show the Eras Tour will ever play is right here in Indianapolis, Indiana,\" Swift told the audience.\n\nShe heads to Canada next, where the tour that began in early 2023 will end next month.\n\nThe most surprising thing about the Sunday show was its lack of surprises. Contrary to speculation, Swift had no special guests, nor did she announce long-awaited rerecordings of her \"Reputation\" and debut albums.\n\nThe pop superstar, who previously endorsed Kamala Harris for president, made no mention of Tuesday's election, either.\n\nNeed a break?

As part of the celebration of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour coming to Indianapolis, the city renamed 32 downtown streets.\n\nThere were no surprise guests during the acoustic set.\n\n- Ana Rocio Alvarez Brinez\n\n\"Scram!\" dancer Kam says during \"We Are Never Getting Back Together\" riff\n\nKam Saunders, one of Swift's dancers, pulled out \"scram\" tonight in \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" after two nights of uniquely Midwestern ways of saying \"no.\"\n\nOn N1, Saunders said \"No, yeah, no\" — a phrase fans were quick to recognize as quintessentially Midwestern. On N2, Saunders said \"Ope, no\" in another nod to Midwestern lingo.\n\n- Cindi Andrews and Ryan Murphy\n\nTaylor Swift says tour wasn't done without Indy stop\n\nIn her opening comments of the concert, Swift noted that tonight marks an ending for the Eras Tour.\n\n\"We have spent the year taking this show all over the world — we went to Australia, we went to Asia, spent all summer in Europe and I don't know if anyone knows this in this room, but in case you didn't, the very last U.S. show the Eras Tour will ever play is right here in Indianapolis, Indiana. ...

Green posted a photo of himself on X wearing a T-shirt that says \"Indy going on at the moment,\" in the style of the shirts Swift wears during the \"Red\" portion of her setlist. One of her tees says \"A lot going on at the moment.\"\n\nAn avid Swiftie, Green has given high praise to Swift's latest album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" released in April.\n\nMore:'The writing is so, so good\" on Taylor Swift's new album, John Green says\n\nPart-time Indy limo driver works 3 days straight for Swifties\n\nDriving downtown during one of Indianapolis’ busiest weekends in decades might sound you're in a new hell, but it’s not so bad, Ray Albee said.\n\nAlbee might have as much authority to speak on downtown traffic as anyone — the 77-year-old part-time limousine driver has been snaking through the gridlock of Mile Square for the last two days of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. As he waits Sunday in his sleek black limo outside Conner’s Kitchen and Bar to pick up his next group of Swifties, Albee shows no signs of stress, even if his fellow drivers don’t always share his placid demeanor.\n\n“They’re not polite,” Albee said. “Courtesy is dead. Died years ago.”\n\nStill, Albee is happy to be among the crowd buzzing around Lucas Oil Stadium. His clientele has ranged from a group of four parents with 12 young children to troupes of rowdy college-aged women in sequined dresses and cowboy boots. Albee is hardly a Swiftie, but the way he way he sees it, there are worse gigs than ferrying around happy concertgoers.\n\n“Oh, I think they’re fantastic,” Albee said. “It’s too bad the venue wasn’t three times the size so more people could go.”\n\n- Bradley Hohulin\n\nIndianapolis weather today\n\nScattered rain showers could hit Indianapolis late Sunday afternoon into the evening.

On Night 2, she started a few minutes early at 7:55 p.m. ET.\n\nDon't forget that Indianapolis clocks \"fell back\" an hour overnight with the end of Daylight Savings Time.\n\n- Evan Frank\n\nWhy Taylor Swift said Indianapolis is last U.S. Eras Tour stop\n\nTaylor Swift confirmed at her first Indianapolis show that this weekend will be her last U.S. stops for the Eras Tour.\n\n\"We decided we have got to end this tour in front of the most dedicated, passionate, beautiful, enthusiastic, excitable crowd,\" she said Friday night in front of nearly 70,000 fans. \"So we decided that the very last U.S. city of the Eras Tour would be right here in Indianapolis, Indiana. And I can already tell we made the best decision possible.”\n\n- Bryan West\n\nSwifties hunting around Indy for last-minute tickets\n\nLess than 48 hours from Election Day, Democrats and Republicans aren’t the only ones seeking last-minute support around Indianapolis.\n\n“Need 1 ticket,” reads the sign being waved along Georgia Street downtown by Meredith, a 28-year-old Swiftie from Cincinnati.\n\n“We’re campaigning,” she said. “Just need one.”\n\nMeredith was among the millions who scrambled for Indianapolis Eras Tour tickets. Her friends lucked out — sixth-row seats on the floor for tonight’s concert. Meredith, not so much. She traveled to Indy with her friends, but instead of getting ready with them at their hotel she swung by CVS to pick up poster board and markers. She hit the streets around noon today.\n\nMeredith, who last saw Swift perform in Cincinnati in summer 2023, got into Swift’s music as an early teenager with the popstar’s 2008 album “Fearless.” Lately, as she works through her recent divorce, Meredith has found solace in Swift’s more melancholy, introspective tracks.\n\nWhile she doesn’t love her odds of snagging a ticket with just hours left before Swift’s final Eras Tour stop in the United States, Meredith isn’t ready to give up yet.\n\n“I’ll pay for a ticket,” she said. “I just need to find one.”\n\n- Bradley Hohulin\n\nWill Taylor Swift have surprise guests on N3 in Indy?\n\nUSA Today Taylor Swift reporter Bryan West thinks it is possible Swift could bring out Post Malone to sing their song \"Fortnight.\" This has yet to happen on the tour since the song was released.\n\nWest also said it is possible she will bring out other collaborators from her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department, such as Jack Antonoff or Aaron Dessner.\n\nSee Taylor Swift, fans and crowds on N2 in Indianapolis\n\nTaylor Swift delighted young fans on N2 at Lucas Oil Stadium\n\nIt's no secret teenagers and tweens love Taylor Swift, and IndyStar learned firsthand what younger fans love about the popstar when senior news director Cindi Andrews attended the concert with her 13-year-old daughter Katie Saturday night.\n\nEven having seen the show many times previously via the 2023 concert film \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" and the terrible livestreams on social media, Katie was surprised and impressed by the staging in person. Meanwhile, her mom Cindi appreciated hearing what new ways Eras Tour dancer Kam Saunders would find to say \"no\" during the song \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" bringing a Midwest twist with his \"Ope, no.\"\n\nHer also famous boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce made an appearance in the stadium toward the end of her set Saturday night, sending fans in Indianapolis and around the world into a frenzy. All of a sudden, the yellow and red Chiefs-inspired outfit Swift wore during the \"1989\" set made sense.\n\n- Cindi Andrews and Katie Wissman\n\nWhere can I find Eras Tour merch on N3?\n\nLucas Oil Stadium is the only place to buy official Eras Tour merchandise on Sunday. The stands inside the convention center closed at 8 p.m. Saturday.\n\nMerchandise will be for sale on all levels of Lucas Oil Stadium.

Fans have fingers crossed for Taylor Swift tickets\n\nThis tour has been notoriously difficult to score tickets to; Ticketmaster canceled a planned general onsale for the tour in November 2022 due to \"extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems.\" The meltdown was so bad U.S. senators eventually grilled executives of Live Nation Entertainment over their practices. The Justice Department, 29 states (not including Indiana) and the District of Columbia have since sued Live Nation, Ticketmaster's parent company, alleging it has monopolized live events.\n\nSome fans who had hoped to snag tickets for Swift in Indianapolis eventually decided to fly to Paris to see her relaunch the tour for its European leg, saying it was cheaper to book the flight, accommodations and concert tickets overseas than it was to attend an Indianapolis performance.\n\nEras Tour a hot ticket:Fans who considered buying tickets to Indy shows saved money at the Eras Tour shows in Paris\n\nTicketmaster still shows all three Indianapolis dates as sold out, but tickets are available via third-party resale sites.

The lights came back on and she sang \"Mastermind.\"\n\nShe apologized for the delay and blamed it on the last rain show, in Miami.\n\n\"I play a lot of rain shows and we never quite know when our equipment's going to break,\" Swift said to the crowd. \"Could be that night, could be a few shows later.\"\n\nSee photos from N1 of the Eras Tour in Indy\n\nIndy N1 surprise songs\n\nFor the surprise songs in the acoustic set, Swift performed a mashup of \"The Albatross\" from \"The Tortured Poets Department\" and \"Holy Ground\" from \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" on the guitar.\n\nShe then performed a mashup \"Cold As You\" and \"Exile\" on the piano.\n\nEvery Taylor Swift surprise song:See all the Eras Tour surprise songs she's played so far\n\nShe was wearing the red and blue dress she wore the first time in Miami on Oct. 18.\n\nTonight's 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together' interjection is so Midwestern\n\nDuring her Red Era, Swift’s backup dancer, Kam, always changes up his interjection during the song “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” The change up is something fans look forward to each show and he likes to be creative with his line.\n\n“It’s exhausting we are never getting back together,” Swift said during N1 in Indianapolis.\n\nWhile the original line is “Like ever,” tonight Kam said, “No, yeah, no.”\n\nMidwesterners on social media were quick to celebrate this very Midwestern way of saying no.\n\n— Katie Wiseman\n\nSwift confirms Indy is the last U.S. stop on Eras Tour: 'An absolute thrill'\n\n\"What an absolute thrill it is to get to say these words to you tonight, Indianapolis, Indiana.

The line for those on the floor crossed the width of a football field and wound down one of the tunnels, for an hourlong wait time. You’re on your own, kid, for this one.Those who braved the long lines can purchase sweatshirts, t-shirts and an Indianapolis Eras Tour poster. As of 6 p.m. the merchandise stand on the floor was already out of the coveted size small crewneck.Pro tip: If you don’t care what size you get, I’d go after the show starts. That’s what I did when I saw Taylor in Chicago.\n\n— Kaitlin Lange\n\nSwiftie dad on family's growing fandom: '(Taylor's) teaching women to be strong'\n\nThroughout the Indiana State Museum’s three floors, TAY/gate attendees spin around in swishy purple skirts and balance on the heels of sequined cowboy boots. Then there’s Frank Stretar, whose Eras outfit consists of khaki pants, dark blue tennis shoes and a black “Down Bad” t-shirt.\n\nThe Toledo, Ohio, resident and his wife, Erin, didn’t have the cash to buy concert tickets for themselves, their young son and two young daughters, so TAY/gate it was. Erin was the family’s first Swiftie. After she was gifted a ticket to one of Swift’s summer 2023 concerts in Cincinnati, she decided she should probably brush up on Swift’s discography and quickly fell in love.\n\nThe Swiftie bug quickly spread to Erin’s daughters and then to Frank.\n\n“I think her music is phenomenal,” Frank said. “I think she’s an incredible writer.”\n\nEven the Stretars’ young son has proudly joined the Swiftie bandwagon; his favorite song is “Lover.”\n\n“She’s teaching women to be strong,” Frank said. “And I’ve got two young daughters, so I love that.”\n\n— Bradley Hohulin\n\nTaylor Swift fans still 'clowning for tickets' before Indy shows begin\n\nAndie Vandertie and Sam Korn, both 28, traveled from Milwaukee in a last-ditch effort to obtain Eras Tour tickets after waiting in multiple queues. The duo sported orange t-shirts that said “Ticketmaster” on one side and “Maximum security inmate” on the other.\n\n“Ticketmaster is in the dog house,” Korn said. “They’re the inmates.”\n\nOutside the Indiana Convention Center, the two met another duo in the same situation but different costumes. Stephanie Carrell, 30, and her sister Rachel Carrell, 29, wore clown costumes and held signs that said, “Clowning for tickets.”\n\nThe two are from Chicago, where they saw a previous Eras tour concert and then stalked Ticketmaster, as Stephanie put it, to enjoy the experience again.\n\n“At this point, we know what we’re missing and that’s why we had to come here,” Stephanie said.\n\nAs Swifties came up to the four of them and requested photos, she also admitted: “This part is half the fun.”\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nCuddling with aptly named kittens at the Indiana State Museum\n\nTaylor and Travis just can’t get any privacy these days. They’re basically stuck in an enclosure with people lined up to stare at them, take pictures of them, cuddle them — we are talking about Taylor and Travis the cats, rights?\n\nTaylor and Travis are weeks-old domestic shorthair foster kittens, two of eight that Animal Outreach of Shelby County acquired from an overcrowded shelter. When AOSC board member Sarah Bair saw the Museum was hosting a Swift-themed event, she pounced at the opportunity.\n\nThe line to pet, pick up and pose with the cats isn’t unlike the ticket queues for an actual Swift concert. It’s all a bit much for Taylor, who had to be “put in timeout” after growing tired of constantly being swept up from her cozy abode.\n\nTravis, however, doesn’t mind the attention. “He just wants to be held,” Bair said.\n\nAOSC founder Kerryanne May said socializing is crucial for kittens, especially up to the 10-week mark. Travis has been quite the social butterfly, rough-housing plenty with his fellow felines. But even Travis has his moments, leaping clear out of his enclosure earlier this afternoon.\n\nSometimes the flashing lights are a little too bright, even for the biggest stars.\n\n— Bradley Hohulin\n\nThey spent 12 hours working to perfect their Eras Tour looks\n\nIn a sea of sparkly Eras Tour outfits, sisters Clare and Kristin Bibins stood in matching fuchsia and turquoise fringe tinsel jackets.\n\n“These are the Taylor ‘Karma’ jackets,” said Kristin, 34.\n\nWith inspiration from TikTok and silk blouses and fringe from Amazon, Clare, 25, spent six hours gluing strips of the glittering tinsel onto each shirt.\n\nThe sisters, who are from Owensboro, Kentucky, were able to attend thanks to a generous gift of tickets from their sister-in-law Sarah Bibins. Sarah, in turn, was thanking them for watching her baby for a month while she worked, the sisters said.\n\n“We couldn’t be more thankful,” Clare said.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nUSA TODAY's Bryan West's predictions for Eras Tour Indy\n\nIndyStar spoke with Bryan West, who covers Taylor Swift for USA TODAY, about his thoughts what surprises may be ahead this weekend.\n\nWhich special guests could we see?\n\nWill Travis Kelce be in the Circle City?\n\nWill we see a Taylor and Travis wedding any time soon?\n\nRead his takes here:USA TODAY's Taylor Swift reporter makes his predictions for The Eras Tour shows in Indy\n\nHoping for last-minute tickets while TAY/Gating at the Indiana State Museum\n\nGot a picture to burn? You could swing by the Indiana State Museum, where guests at the TAY/Gate party are casting regrets, worries and loser exes into the Reputation shredder.\n\nAs the massive four-slot paper shredder steadily fills with thin black strips, Swiftie and Michigander Jenny Sugg contemplates what to write. She settles on: “The fear of not getting tickets.”\n\nSugg, along with friends Kourtney Holbrook from Indy and Courtney Holbrook from Dallas, are willing to wait through the concert’s opener to nab tickets as secondary-market scalpers (hopefully) give up and drop their prices.\n\n“Even if she starts and gets a few songs in, we’ll go,” Sugg said of getting tickets last-minute.\n\nAt least one member of the trio has already seen Swift perform live in Dallas, Chicago, even Ireland. But any chance to see the pop star is worth a bit of travel and, in this case, hoping for a lucky break.\n\nAdmittedly, the early prognosis isn’t great. As the women deposit their papers into the shredder, Sugg’s slot malfunctions, leaving her paper — and her fears — squarely intact. She laughs to her friends. “We’re definitely not getting tickets.”\n\n— Bradley Hohulin\n\nSwift never goes out of style, fans say\n\nWhen Catalina Graziano and Halley Walsh found information on the weekend’s activities at Indianapolis International Airport, it didn’t take them long to figure out how to spend part of their Friday afternoon before attending the first night of Swift’s concerts.\n\nThe two registered for “Swift City Sessions: Make & Take Art Stations” led by ArtMix at the Indianapolis Artsgarden, where they worked on felted flowers. Walsh, from Minneapolis, and Graziano, from Portland, Oregon, have been fans of Swift since her first album in 2006.\n\n“She knows how to stay relevant,” said Graziano, 26.\n\n“Her style changes but I think the quality of songwriting is consistent or even improving,” said Walsh, 27.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nHighlighting arts and creativity during Eras Tour weekend\n\nInviting everyone to make crafts for the weekend fit into ArtMix’s mission to make art accessible for all, president and CEO Britt Sutton said. Born in 1989 — the same year as Swift — Sutton is a Swiftie herself.\n\n“I really admire her as a businesswoman, and I also love the fact that she makes crafting and creativity cool. As somebody who runs an arts education nonprofit, I love the fact that people are incorporating elements of the arts into their visit,” said Sutton, as she gestured toward a table full of people making friendship bracelets.\n\nArtMix’s “Swift City Sessions: Make & Take Art Stations” were created in partnership with the with Visit Indy, Downtown Indy, and Indiana Convention Center & Lucas Oil Stadium. Patrons can customize guitar picks, make buttons and friendship bracelets, and paint the number 13 on their hand, among other activities.\n\nThose who are interested in attending can do so until 6 p.m. Friday and from 1 p.m. to about 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Some activities at the Artsgarden are full for Saturday, but others still have spots open and are free all weekend. Registration is closed, but you can find the schedule here, and ArtMix will accommodate as many walk-ins as possible.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nLucas Oil Stadium gets Eras Tour friendship bracelets from NOLA's Caesars Superdome: 'Friendships like this never end'\n\nOn Thursday, the first stadium-to-stadium friendship bracelet exchange took place between the New Orleans’ Caesars Superdome and Indianapolis’ Lucas Oil Stadium.\n\nLucas Oil tweeted a video of the large, inflatable bracelet being hung while thanking their BFF Caesars Dome for the gracious gift.

Now, the mother has passed her love of the music to daughters Parker, 11, and Emily, 8.\n\nSwift “was born only five years after me, so her music is relatable and it’s grown as I’ve grown up, too,” said Block, 40.\n\nParker listens to Swift’s albums on vinyl — which she said she enjoys because she hears sides of the music that don’t necessarily come through when she listens to a streaming playlist.\n\n“I really like listening to the whole album because I get to learn not, like, the most popular songs, but I learn some of the songs that not everybody knows,” said Parker, who stood near Monument Circle as songs including “Tied Together with a Smile” and “Shake It Off” played over the speakers.\n\nBlock and her girls came from Cartersville, Georgia, in a group of eight that includes family and best friends. Block calls it a miracle that the entire group was able to buy such coveted tickets to the same night — Swift’s Friday concert.\n\n“We knew it was special when it happened,” she said.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nIndianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay giving away more free Eras Tour tickets\n\nIf you already entered to win Eras Tour tickets from the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, STAY IN LINE!\n\nJim Irsay posted on his X (previously Twitter) account that he had six more tickets to give away to three lucky winners and he was turning to his previous list of entrants.\n\nTaylor Swift flash mob breaks out at Indianapolis International Airport\n\nSwifties coming through the Indy airport serenaded fellow travelers with a rendition of the star's hit, \"Love Story.\"\n\nWatch:Taylor Swift flash mob in Indianapolis International Airport ahead of concerts\n\nEras Tour rideshare and pickup locations\n\nA standalone rideshare pickup zone on South Street between Missouri and West streets will operate from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. Friday through Sunday.\n\nOnly Uber, Lyft and other rideshare drivers will be given access to this area.

The end of the Eras Tour is upon us.\n\nTaylor Swift's record-shattering show has traversed five continents and 51 cities. Fans have valiantly fought the Great War to get tickets, danced outside of open-roofed stadiums, donned elaborate outfits and tuned into grainy livestreams. Now the show is ending with three shows in Vancouver (...err Swift-couver), Canada.\n\nCatch up on everything that happened at Friday night's show before we're all left asking, \"How did it end?\"\n\nJump to key info with these links:\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n'Flexing like an acrobat'\n\n\"Vancouver I love you so very much,” Swift said introducing her final tune. “This has been the greatest last Friday night of the tour that I could have ever imagined with you. Would you give us one more song?”\n\nSkipping back to grab her magenta “Karma” jacket, Swift and her dancers ended Night 1 in BC Place Stadium. And even though she’s sang “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me” 16 times before (14 times with Travis Kelce in the crowd), she did not sing it Friday.\n\nAnd then there were two. Confetti fell as the show drew to a close, after 2 a.m. on the East Coast.\n\nMade it to 'Midnights'\n\nIf you’re in the central and eastern time zones, you’ve already met at midnight, which is the era Swift is heading into. This is the culmination era of seven songs. During “Midnight Rain,” Swift gestured with two fingers, signaling the final two shows of the tour, while singing her line, “And he never thinks of me except when I’m on TV.” She’s been doing the one-handed countdown since the Toronto shows. Swift admitted her favorite song to perform out of the set list is “Vigilante S***,” which is a spicy, edgy number where she and her dancers perform a chair-assisted dance of seduction.\n\nWhat did Taylor Swift play for the acoustic set in Vancouver?\n\nBefore starting her acoustic set, Swift admitted it's the one part of the show that makes her kind of nervous because it's different each night. She started on guitar with \"Haunted\" from \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version).\"\n\n\"I have to sing this next song at some point in Canada, eh?\" she said before mixing in \"Wonderland\" from \"1989 (Taylor's Version).\" The song's chorus repeats the sound \"eh,\" a common Canadian expression that can mean a variety of things.\n\nSwift then moved to the piano, where she played \"Never Grow Up\" from \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)\" and \"The Best Day\" from \"Fearless (Taylor's Version).\" Both are sweet tracks about childhood.\n\nSee every song Swift has played in the acoustic set, and read about the six she hasn't.\n\nAll's fair in love and poetry\n\nHalfway through the tour Swift added “The Tortured Poets” Department, which signals the 25-minute mark from the acoustic set. Wearing her “I love you, it’s ruining my life” white dress designed by Vivenne Westwood, the singer will travel through a religious institution, high school, a haunted house, an alien abduction, an asylum, a battlefield and musical theater.\n\nIn her official Eras Tour book, the singer admitted that a crew member is hidden inside a rover (the internet calls it a “Tayoomba”) during “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?”\n\nSwift said she planned the new set for about eight months and rehearsed with her crew in private before debuting it in Paris.\n\nTaking it back to '1989'\n\nSparkling in a yellow top and orange bottom, Swift shimmied into her “1989” era set. Like a line from “Out of the Woods,” the superstar was in screaming color while the rest of the world and her dancers were in black-and-white.\n\nInto the woods for 'Folkmore'\n\nSwift has brought the “Folklore” cottage to the last stop. Her moss-adorned cabin designed by Ethan Tubman gets wheeled out from backstage following “Reputation.”\n\n“It kind of feels not that out of place in Vancouver, don’t you think?” Swift said before “Betty” in her berry dress. You guys have your share of woods and mystical forests, and that’s all part of the imaginary world of ‘Folklore.’”\n\nIt’s become a fan tradition for the crowd to give Swift a standing ovation once she presses the final key on “Champagne Problems.” And Swifties are trying to spread the word and sing “Happy Birthday” to Swift during her Sunday show standing ovation, just five days before she turns 35. While most of the raucous roars last about 1-3 minutes, the longest on record is still the last night in Los Angeles on Aug. 9, 2023, when the crowd cheered for 8 minutes.\n\n“I’m just feeling so overjoyed that we decided to spend our last couple of shows in Vancouver,” Swift said thanking the crowd. “You’re so unbelievable. I love you so much. Aw, my face hurts from grinning. Thank you for that moment. That’s the best!”\n\nWhen will Swift play her surprise, acoustic set?\n\nIf you’re wondering how long until the surprise set, we have about an hour and 40 minutes to go. Swift has the rest of \"Reputation,\" the “Folklore” and “Evermore” combined set, “1989” and “The Tortured Poets Department” left. The acoustic set should happen around 1:35 a.m. ET / 10:35 p.m. PT.\n\nBig 'Reputation'\n\nSsssss! After a short 5-minute jaunt into the land of “Speak Now” to hear “Enchanted,” Swift takes us to the snake-riddled realm of “Reputation.\" Fans are salivating for the rerecorded album — yet to be announced — and hope she will reveal news about it at one of the shows this weekend. The singer wore a black-and-red catsuit for the first 131 shows of the Eras Tour. She mixed it up starting in Miami by sporting a black-and-gold suit.\n\nAnd the '22' hat goes to...\n\nWe are in the r-r-r-red era! It feels like a perfect night to celebrate the third to last “22” hat recipient. The fan is chosen during “Love Story” when Swift’s team plucks the lucky one from the crowd and brings them to the catwalk. The singer skipped down the stage in her “This is not Taylor’s Version” tee to a lucky girl dancing at the end who had a similar \"22\" shirt that read “A lot going on at the moment.” Swift gave her a big hug and grabbed a friendship bracelet before placing her fedora on the fan’s head. You can see all the “22” hat winners here.\n\nDancer Kameron Saunders has a speaking line during “We Are Never Getting Back Together.” He’s mixed up his phrases in the bridge when Swift speaks the line, “I mean this is exhausting, like we are never getting back together.” But on Night 1 in Vancouver he returned to the original line, “Like ever.” Could it have something to do with all the film crews? Here’s a full list of Saunders’ sayings.\n\nAs Swift asked the audience if they had about 10 minutes to spare, she reflected on the Eras Tour and what it’s meant to her.\n\n“This has felt different in every single way,” she said. “It’s felt like an escape to a planet where nothing but joy and passion and togetherness and camaraderie exists.”\n\nThen she played her heartbreak anthem \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version).\" By the way, she’s played this song 147 times to sold-out crowds. That's 25 hours.\n\nCamera crew follows Swift onstage\n\nIs that a two-person camera crew following Swift onstage as she sings “Cruel Summer”? Yes it is! The last time fans saw a crew onstage during the main numbers was in the Los Angeles area when she filmed the first Eras Tour movie distributed to AMC theaters.\n\nFind out more about the cameras in Vancouver.\n\nIn our 'Fearless' era\n\nAre you ready to go back to high school with Taylor Swift? Get those hand hearts ready, we have entered the “Fearless” era. The singer appeared in the black-and-silver shimmering dress. Swift has said her guitar was bedazzled by her parents, Scott and Andrea, and brother, Austin. There is a “13” on the side. A special tradition during the “Love Story” number is fans around the globe have proposed during the bridge when Swift sings, “He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring.”\n\nTaylor Swift leaves no doubt the Eras Tour is ending\n\nDuring her welcome monologue in the “Lover” era, Swift yelled, “It means the world to me to have the honor of saying these words to you: Vancouver, welcome to the Eras Tour.”\n\nAs she thrust her hands in the air, she returned to the mic to confirm this is the end of the road for the bedazzled show.\n\n\"This is a little known fact, not many people know this,” she said in a joking manner. “It hasn’t been talked about very much, but let me give you some information that you probably don’t already know. Vancouver is actually the very last city that we will play on the Eras Tour. Did you know that?”\n\nAnd then in the next few breaths, she double downed. So any Swifties wondering or hoping for another show post-Vancouver, it seems implausible.\n\n“This has been a tour of many traditions, it’s been a tour of many, many Friday nights, but this will be the last Friday night that we ever play on the Eras Tour, and we intend on making it count,\" she said. \"What about you, Vancouver?”\n\nTaylor Swift takes the stage in Vancouver\n\nIt’s been a longtime coming. Swift is officially onstage for Night 1 of the Eras Tour in Vancouver. The singer is sparkling in her blue and gold glittery bodysuit designed by Versace. Swift wrote in her official concert book released on Black Friday, “I decided to create the longest, most ambitious show I’d ever attempted. … My goal was for every fan to leave that show knowing I gave them absolutely everything I had. I made a promise to myself to be physically and mentally tougher than I ever had been before.”\n\n“So it looks like a pretty good Friday night to be in Vancouver, huh?” Swift said immediately following her performance of “Cruel Summer.” As she pointed to the crowd of 60,000 and spun in a circle, thunderous applause filled the arena.\n\n“Okay that was amazing,” she replied.\n\nThe size of the BC Place Stadium audience is comparable to her shows in Las Vegas or Stockholm. Swift’s book said 10.1 million total tickets were sold. The first date of the Eras Tour was March 17, 2023. The last date will be Sunday.\n\nThe Eras Tour is minutes away from starting\n\n“In Ha Mood” by Ice Spice is playing. That means the dancers and bandmates are walking backstage and Swift’s production team is pushing her in a “cleaning cart” to keep her outfit out of view. You have about 8-10 minutes until Swift will be performing the first song of her set list, “Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Price.” The order of the pre-show tunes is Ice Spice, then Lady Gaga’s “Applause” and finally Leslie Gore’s “You Don’t Own Me.”\n\nGracie Abrams opens the Eras Tour in Vancouver\n\nNight one of the Eras Tour in Vancouver is officially underway. Gracie Abrams took the stage to perform her opening act. She wore a long, ivory dress with a high slit up the side and chunky white heels.\n\n“My name is Grace Abrams,” the singer said with a guitar slung around her neck. “It’s so nice to meet you. How y’all feeling?”\n\nAs the crowd erupted in an applause, Abrams replied, “Me too! I don’t know how any of us are supposed to have the words to begin to talk about the end of the Eras Tour, but all I know is that I could not be more grateful to be in the same room as all of you tonight.”\n\nAbrams has been touring with Swift ever since the concert returned to the states and Canada. “I just feel overwhelmed with the spirit with what the Eras Tour has gifted us over the past two years.”\n\nAbrams performed nine songs:\n\n\"Risk\" \"I Love You, I’m Sorry\" \"21\" \"I Told You Things\" \"Let It Happen\" \"Free Now\" \"Us.\" \"Close To You\" \"That’s So True\"\n\nAbrams introduced her final song.\n\n“I have been really floored by the way that you’ve adopted this song into your lives and it’s very — how would I describe it — it’s quite petty, it’s kind of angsty,\" she said. \"It’s very sarcastic, and it’s ultimately about not being with the person you wish you were with.”\n\nSwift should take the stage in about 25 minutes at 10:50 p.m. ET / 7:50 p.m. PT.\n\nCameras litter the arena\n\nLights, cameras and smile! Wait. There are actually lots of cameras on the floor of the arena. A drone. A jib. A flyover camera. Addy Miller, who is on the floor of the Eras Tour, posted photos of extra cameras set up, similar to what she saw in Los Angeles where Swift filmed the Eras Tour movie available on Disney+. There is a massive jib, which is a smooth, swinging camera used in cinematography. There are also signs explaining that drones will be in use during the concert.\n\nSpotify's global artist of the year\n\nThe holiday season is the time of year that Swift starts racking up accolades. Miss Americana has 17 nominations across 16 categories for the Billboard Awards. She has six Grammy nominations for “Tortured Poets” and “Us.,” a song with Gracie Abrams. And just this past week, Swift was named the Spotify Wrapped global artist of the year for the second year in a row as well as Apple Music’s top artist. The Spotify achievement was massive with 26.6 billion streams — if every one of those songs was 4 minutes long, that would be 106 billion minutes or more than 202,000 years.\n\nPremier of British Columbia welcomes Swifties\n\nDavid Eby, the premier of British Columbia, welcomed Swifties to Vancouver. “The wait is over!” Eby tweeted this afternoon. “I’d like to formally welcome Taylor Swift to British Columbia. We’re thrilled she’s wrapping the Eras Tour in Swiftcouver with three shows. I hope all those lucky enough to be going have a great time.” He shared the greeting with a cute friendship bracelet image. And before you Google what a premier is, Eby is a first minister and head of government for the Canadian province of British Columbia. A premier in Canada is somewhat analogous to a governor in the United States.\n\nSwifties gather for live Mastermind event\n\nSwift Alert is an app that launched over the summer of 2023 to notify fans worldwide of when the superstar would begin certain eras in the show. But then it added the addictive game Mastermind. Millions of fans log on to guess Swift’s different outfits and which surprise songs she will play. The app’s creator Kyle Mumma is in Swift-couver with his wife, Mia, and Betsy Sedlak. They are hosting an event at the Vogue Theatre tonight. Think of fans gathering at a sports bar to catch a heated game, but make it Swifties hoping to get the most Mastermind points. Tickets are still available for locals. And fans can still cast their Mastermind ballot before Swift takes the stage.\n\nA Swiftmas Wonderland\n\nWhile we wait for Gracie Abrams to take the stage, here is a fun way to pass the time. Check out the two suburban legends in Naperville, Illinois, who have gone viral for a second year for creating their own Merry Swiftmas House. Amy and Brian Scott are back with a larger than life-sized typewriter, a to-scale “Folklore” cottage and a tuxedo-clad Travis Kelce. Big Yeti is up on the rooftop! See the magical set-up here.\n\nPolice share safety tips\n\nThe Vancouver Police Department deployed hundreds of officers wearing highlighter yellow vests in and around the stadium. In a reel posted to Instagram, officers offered some tips for families heading to the Eras Tour like make a meet point before heading in, especially for groups who are visiting the city and stadium for the first time.\n\nDoors are open\n\nAnd in the blink of a crinkling eye the doors to the BC Place Stadium opened and concertgoers filed inside. Opening act Gracie Abrams was set to take the stage in just over two hours at 6:45 p.m. PT / 9:45 p.m. ET. The temperature in the cloud-coated city was 48 degrees Fahrenheit. Rain was expected to start trickling down with a 90% chance of showers happening at 11 p.m. when the concert should let out.\n\nIs the Eras Tour over?\n\nWhile fans may be reeling, asking, “Is It Over Now?” The answer is yes. Well, at least according to Taylor Swift. She’s said multiple times that Vancouver will be the final show. During the “All Too Well” section of the 100th Eras Tour show in Liverpool, Swift told the crowd, \"This is the very first time I’ve ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is going to end in December.” That very last night will be Sunday.\n\nWhere is Taylor Swift performing tonight?\n\nJust north of False Creek in downtown Vancouver, Canada, is BC Place Stadium. The British Columbia arena — with the largest cable supported retractable roof in the world — opened in 1983 and can fit more than 50,000 fans. Swift is the first performer to sell out three shows on a single tour. On the front of the stadium is a 140-foot inflatable friendship bracelet. Shawn Kolodny, a contemporary artist and sculptor, designed the jewelry for the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. The art was then passed to the succeeding shows of Indianapolis, Toronto and now Vancouver.\n\nWho is opening for Taylor Swift?\n\nUp-and-coming singer-songwriter Gracie Abrams has been opening for Taylor Swift the entire final North American leg of the Eras Tour.\n\nThe two collaborated on the song \"Us.\" on Abrams' album \"The Secret of Us.\" This summer, Abrams posted a video of Swift putting out a fire in her New York City apartment after the two wrote the track. Now, it's nominated for the Grammy for best pop duo/group performance.\n\nWhat time is the Taylor Swift concert?\n\nUnless you are on the Pacific coast, it’s going to be a late night!\n\nHere are the approximate times opening act Gracie Abrams will take the stage, Taylor Swift will perform and the surprise songs should happen.\n\nPT: 6:45 p.m. | 7:50 p.m. | 10:35 p.m.\n\nMT: 7:45 p.m. | 8:50 p.m. | 11:35 p.m.\n\nCT: 8:45 p.m. | 9:50 p.m. | 12:35 a.m.\n\nET: 9:45 p.m. | 10:50 p.m. | 1:35 a.m.\n\nSee the entire set list.\n\nSwift mania takes over Swift-couver\n\nAfter flying into Vancouver, fans headed to see \"Downtown Lights\" scattered throughout the metropolitan area. Destination Downtown held a scavenger hunt comprised of 13 locations. Swifties who took photos in front of one or all of the light installations using the Stamp Me app were entered to get a pair of tickets. Most of the life-size letters spelled out Swift's songs: \"Willow,\" \"Delicate,\" \"ME!,\" \"Anti-Hero,\" \"Red,\" \"Betty,\" \"Karma,\" \"Shake It Off,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"Lover,\" \"Style\" and \"Cardigan.\" The 13th was \"Swift-couver.\"\n\nMiguel Barbosa shared a cute video on Instagram dancing around the city in front of all of the locations with his fiancée, Katie.\n\nSince February, I have traveled to four continents and eight countries to speak with fans about the epic and historic Eras Tour. The concerts have become a melting pot of Swifties who all speak the same lyrical language. If you happen to have 18 minutes to spare before Swift takes the stage in BC Place, check out this mini-documentary about the bejeweled singer's impact and how there may never be a concert quite like this again.\n\nWhat it's like to cover the Eras Tour\n\nAs the official Taylor Swift reporter, I'm not being hyperbolic when I say the Eras Tour has been my job — and really, my life — for the past 13 months. I've posted 501 articles, made 42 television appearances, published 974 photos, edited 38 videos, filmed a documentary and written a book on Swift.\n\nIt all started with USA TODAY's viral job posting for the world's first full-time, dedicated Taylor Swift reporter in the summer of 2023. The memories I've made may be unique to me, but the overall themes are common to anyone who went to one or more Eras Tour shows.\n\nYou can read what it was like to travel four continents with this tour in a personal reflection here.\n\nAnd even though this chapter is wrapping up, Swift is already working on her next project. In the foreword to her official concert book, she wrote, \"See you in the next era.\" It's one I plan to cover.\n\nTaylor Swift published her own official Eras Tour book including 500+ images from the show and new insights into its production. According to Circana's BookScan, which tracks the majority of print market sales, 814,000 copies of the book sold its first week. That makes the behind-the-scenes collector's item the second-highest adult nonfiction release after Barack Obama's memoir \"A Promised Land\" sold 816,300 copies in 2020.\n\nComplementing Swift's tome is USA TODAY Network's \"This Swift Beat,\" which follows the news, the impact and the fans of the songwriter's magnum opus.

And yet, it can't help feeling kind of weird to know The Eras Tour is really over after one last concert Sunday night, Dec. 8, in Vancouver, British Columbia, marking the end of ... well, an era.\n\nIt’s a cultural phenomenon as big as Taylor Swift herself, if such a thing is possible: the highest-grossing concert tour of all time and the first such tour in history to generate more than $1 billion in revenue while dominating headlines and holding the cultural zeitgeist hostage for nearly two years in the course of performing 149 concerts on five continents.\n\nAnd it all began with two concerts in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nTaylor Swift launched the Eras Tour at State Farm Stadium\n\nSwift launched the record-breaking Eras Tour with a sold-out two-night stand at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on Friday and Saturday, March 17-18, 2023, unveiling a staggering 44-song setlist in the course of a marathon set that ran more than three hours and still left fans, including this reporter, wanting more.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nEven Glendale emerged as a media darling, thanks to a symbolic rebrand as Swift City in the singer’s honor, a storyline played out on digital billboards along freeways and in Glendale's Westgate Entertainment District, where State Farm Stadium is located, welcoming fans to Swift City (where Swift launched the Reputation Tour in that same stadium five years earlier).\n\nFor what it's worth, we would've gone with Glendale (Taylor's Version), but we're clever that way.\n\nSo how was the Eras Tour launch in Glendale, aka Swift City?\n\nIn announcing the tour, Swift had promised “a journey through all of my musical eras,” which by any reasonable metric, is a lot of ground to cover — 10 hit albums, four of which have been released since the conclusion of the Reputation Tour in late 2018.\n\nAnd she made it look easy, enjoying the journey as much as the Swifties who flocked to the show did while revisiting her catalog one era at a time.\n\nThe end result was a breathtaking journey through 17 years’ worth of musical eras that found the star connecting with her fans at every step along the way.\n\nTaylor Swift Eras Tour:5 magic moments that Arizonans saw first\n\nThe best moments of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour launch\n\nThe stage show was designed to reach the back rows of the stadium with a breathtaking blend of artful set design — that “Folklore” cabin was cottagecore gold — and film projected on the massive screen behind the stage.\n\nIt was a concert packed with highlights, the most theatrical of which came at the end of an understated “Tim McGraw,” which Swift performed alone on a satellite stage, accompanying herself on an upright piano. At the song’s conclusion, she stood up and appeared to dive into a stream to swim beneath the runway to the main stage.\n\nAs entertaining as that was, the full 10-minute version of “All Too Well” from “Red (Taylor’s Version),” the longest song to top the Billboard Hot 100, emerged as the concert’s emotional centerpiece, a heartbreaking triumph that ended in a haunting shower of paper snowflakes.\n\nYes, she was performing 'surprise songs' from the start\n\nThat opening-night performance also introduced the concept of “surprise songs,” two unannounced acoustic songs she planned to slip into the set each night just to keep fans guessing in the Era of the Online Setlist, where a quick Google search can reveal all.\n\nThe Eras Tour helped make Taylor Swift pop's first billionaire\n\nThere’s a concert film, naturally. Released in theaters worldwide on Oct. 13, 2023, \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" quickly overtook a Justin Bieber movie to become the highest-grossing concert film in history.\n\nFollowing The Eras Tour launch, Swift immediately shot to No. 1 on Pollstar's Artist Power Index chart, ending 2023 as Time magazine’s perfectly obvious choice for Person of the Year.\n\nBy that point, USA TODAY had hired its own Taylor Swift reporter and Swift had grabbed another first — first billionaire in history with music as the main source of income.\n\nBefore the tour was through, she even had another era’s worth of music to incorporate, spending 15 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard’s album chart and breaking streaming records with the April 2024 release of “The Tortured Poets Department.”\n\nBest Taylor Swift albums:We rated and ranked them all.

She didn't bring out any special guests. She didn't announce any new movies or \"Reputation.\" In the end, it was just Swift, having the time of her life alongside her massive crowd of fans.\n\nUSA TODAY music critic Melissa Ruggieri called the night one of the most memorable excursions in pop music history, with Swift doing it, as usual, her way.

Taylor Swift is back on her Eras Tour for her second – and final – U.S. leg after a two-month break.\n\nThe world's richest female musician started the countdown clock to the end of her record-breaking tour Friday at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida (!!!).\n\nUSA TODAY Network reporters Bryan West and Samantha Neely attended the show, and provided live updates as the fans, friendship bracelets and frenzy returned.\n\nNeed all the tea?Sign up for Bryan West's weekly email for all the best Taylor Swift news.\n\nThat’s a wrap\n\nThe Eras Tour’s first night in Miami ended the way it always has — with a burst of energy during “Karma.” Swift headed backstage and confetti fell. Thanks for following along with us as the tour returned to the U.S. Make sure to check out photos of Swift in Miami before you go, and find a recap of the night here.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nSurprise! Another new dress\n\nSwift revealed yet another new outfit with a pink, purple and blue dress for her surprise, acoustic set.\n\nOn guitar, she sang “Tim McGraw” from her debut album mashed up with “Timeless,” a vault track from “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version).”\n\nUp next was “This Is Me Trying” from “Folklore” with “Daylight” from “Lover” on piano.\n\nWelcome to Florida, Florence Welch\n\nSwift wrapped the European leg of the Eras Tour with five star-studded nights in London. But no special guest compared to Florence Welch, who joined Swift in unveiling new production and choreography for their “Tortured Poets” duet “Florida!!!”\n\nFans have been wondering ever since if the song would be added to the set list permanently when Swift returned to North America.\n\nIt was, at least on Friday. And Welch joined Swift again to belt their ode to the Sunshine State.\n\nNew 'Reputation' bodysuit\n\nFans closely track the outfits Swift wears on the Eras Tour, and she's switched them up for every era except one.\n\nThat changed on Friday.\n\nShe finally, after 131 shows, debuted a different \"Reputation\" bodysuit as the rain poured down during \"...Are You Ready For It?\" This one's black and covered in gold snakes rather than red ones. This will surely give Swifties plenty to clown about as they continue to wait impatiently for Swift to release \"Repuation (Taylor's Version).\"\n\nSwift also unveiled a new silver, fringed dress for her \"Fearless\" set.\n\nIt's a rain show!\n\nRain fell in Miami as the “Fearless” set ended. \"Rain shows\" hold a special place in Swift lore. The first Eras Tour rain show was in Nashville in 2023.\n\n“The dancers, band, crowd and I all pretty much turned into little kids joyfully jumping in puddles all night,” Swift wrote on X after that show. “That was a late, great night I won’t forget.”\n\nSwift takes the stage\n\nIt’s a sequence of events Swifties know well. A countdown clock appeared that read 2:13. Lady Gaga’s “Applause” gave way to “You Don’t Own Me” by Lesley Gore. The moment had arrived. Swift and her massive Eras Tour had returned for one last leg in North America.\n\nMiss Americana herself took the stage at 8 p.m.\n\n\"Miami, we are so back!\" she proclaimed after singing \"Cruel Summer\" in an orange bodysuit and boots.\n\nGracie Abrams opens show\n\nThe music began at 6 p.m. as Gracie Abrams opened the show. The up-and-coming singer-songwriter took a break from her own Secret of Us tour promoting her sophomore album of the same name — which features a duet with Swift.\n\nAbrams opened earlier U.S. dates on the Eras Tour and will be featured on the remaining North American dates through the end of this year.\n\n\"I’m a diehard Swiftie, so I’m literally just one of you. I’ll be in the stands in tears at soon as our set is over,\" Abrams said from the stage on Friday in a sheer black dress with red detailing and a midriff cutout. She sang the following:\n\n\"Risk\"\n\n\"Blowing Smoke\"\n\n\"I Love You, I'm Sorry\"\n\n\"Where Do We Go Now?\"\n\n\"That's So True\"\n\n\"Tough Love\"\n\n\"Free Now\"\n\n\"Us\"\n\n\"Close to You\"\n\nIs Mama Kelce at the show?\n\nSeveral fan accounts are saying that Travis Kelce's mom will be at the show tonight. And possibly Jason and Kylie Kelce and their kids. We'll update you when we confirm the Kelce family - or some of them - are here to cheer for Swift.\n\nWe know that the Kansas City tight end is in full football mode and will more than likely not be in attendance at any of the Hard Rock stadium shows. The Chiefs have upcoming Super Bowl rematch game against the San Francisco 49ers on Oct. 20 at 3:25 p.m.\n\nWill Florence and the Machine play with Taylor Swift in Florida?\n\n!!!\n\nWill Swift come to Florida and not play the namesake song?\n\nWill Florence Welch surprise the audience like she did in London? Time will only tell.\n\nUSA TODAY national music critic Melissa Ruggieri described \"Florida!!!\" like this when \"The Tortured Poets Department\" was released in April.\n\n“Florida!!!,” co-written by and co-starring Florence Welch, is the standout, with Swift and Welch trading vocals over a stomping backbeat that is both cinematic and purposeful.\n\nWhile it’s impossible to out-lyricize Swift, Welch nudges impressively close with her self-penned contribution: “Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine, well, me and my ghosts had a hell of a time.”\n\nThese two are ideal companions, musically and philosophically.\n\nWhy am I suddenly craving a yellow sweatshirt?\n\nFirst it was glitter freckles.\n\nNow yellow sweatshirts seem to be on our list for fall. Also, do we need another cat?\n\nSwift showed up ahead of the tour with one of her three cats, this one Olivia Benson, captioning it: \"Back in the Office.\" This is exactly how we felt coming to work today. OK, maybe we needed the sweatshirt, which sold out within an hour of her post.\n\nIt was time for Olivia to take center stage. After all, Benjamin Button was on the Time magazine cover with Taylor last year.\n\nBest Eras Tour outfits in Miami\n\nAlmost as much as the tour, we love seeing what fans wear to the shows. Each concert seems to bring more creativity. A few of our favorite looks posted by Swifties headed to the Miami show:\n\nAre you wearing glitter freckles to the Eras Tour?\n\nWe're enchanted by the look Swift wore to the Chief game against the New Orleans Saints. So was everyone else.\n\nIt wasn't just the gorgeous edgy Vivienne Westwood dress.\n\nIt was those glitter freckles.\n\nSales for Fazit skyrocketed 3,500% following Swift's appearance at the Chiefs game. The pop star’s endorsement, in addition to several viral TikTok videos and being picked up by Urban Outfitters, propelled the brand name into a higher echelon of the cosmetics industry.\n\n\"As many have seen I just started sobbing,\" says Aliett Buttelman, Fazit's co-founder, referring to a TikTok video that's been viewed more than 7 million times. \"To have your brand be worn by the No. 1 icon of our generation is validating for the hard work we've put in for two years.\"\n\nBryan West\n\nWhat secret songs are left on the Eras Tour?\n\nHere are the surprise songs that Swift has yet to play during Eras Tour:\n\nFearless (Taylor’s Version)\n\nThat’s when (ft. Keith Urban)\n\nBye Bye Baby\n\nRed (Taylor’s Version)\n\nGirl at Home\n\nForever Winter\n\nRonan\n\nLover\n\nSoon You’ll Get Better (ft. The Chicks)\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department\n\nCassandra\n\nFlorida!!! (ft. Florence and the Machine), however Swift added the song to the setlist for the final London show on Aug. 20.\n\nWhat songs will Taylor Swift sing in Miami?\n\nSwift has followed a specific setlist on her tour, changing it most significantly after \"The Tortured Poets Department\" was released.\n\nTaylor Swift setlistSee the OG setlist for the epic Eras tour\n\nShe has removed the following songs from her setlist since \"TTPD\" came out:\n\n\"The Archer\" from the Lover era\n\n\"Long Live\" from the Speak Now era\n\n\"The 1\" from the Folklore era\n\n\"The Last Great American Dynasty\" from the Folklore era\n\n\"'Tis the Damn Season\" from the Evermore era\n\n\"Tolerate It\" from the Evermore era\n\nHere’s the setlist she played in London on Aug. 20:\n\n“Lover” album\n\n“Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince”\n\n“Cruel Summer”\n\n“The Man”\n\n“You Need to Calm Down”\n\n“Lover”\n\n“Fearless” album\n\n“Fearless”\n\n“You Belong With Me”\n\n“Love Story”\n\n“Red” album\n\n“22”\n\n“We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”\n\n“I Knew You Were Trouble”\n\n“All Too Well” (10-minute version)\n\n“Speak Now” album\n\n“Enchanted”\n\n“Reputation” album\n\n“...Ready for It?”\n\n“Delicate”\n\n“Don't Blame Me”\n\n“Look What You Made Me Do”\n\n“Folklore” / “Evermore” albums\n\n“Cardigan”\n\n“Betty”\n\n“Champagne Problems”\n\n“August”\n\n“Illicit Affairs”\n\n“My Tears Ricochet”\n\n“Marjorie”\n\n“Willow”\n\n“1989” album\n\n“Style”\n\n“Blank Space”\n\n“Shake It Off”\n\n“Wildest Dreams”\n\n“Bad Blood”\n\n“The Tortured Poets Department” album\n\n“But Daddy I Love Him” / “So High School”\n\n“Florida!!!” (It should be noted that this was only played the final night and wasn't added to other European shows)\n\n“Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?”\n\n“Down Bad” (with \"Fortnight\" outro)\n\n“Fortnight”\n\n“The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived”\n\n“I Can Do It With a Broken Heart”\n\n“Midnights\" album\n\n“Lavender Haze”\n\n“Anti‐Hero”\n\n“Midnight Rain”\n\n“Vigilante Sh--”\n\n“Bejeweled”\n\n“Mastermind”\n\n“Karma”\n\nHow to celebrate the Eras Tour if you aren't going?\n\n“Taylor Swift – The Eras Tour Book,” a 256-page book with 500 images, including performances photos (from every era of the show), rehearsal pictures and reflections written by Swift will be out Nov. 29 at Target. The coffee-table style book likely will be a popular holiday gift for Swifties at $39.99.\n\nSwift wrote about the book on Instagram earlier this week: \"We'll be kicking off the final leg of The Eras Tour this week, which is hard to comprehend. This tour has been the most wondrous experience and I knew I wanted to commemorate the memories we made together in a special way,\" Swift wrote on her Instagram account announcing the book. It includes what she says are her \"own personal reflections\" of the tour.\n\n– Melissa Ruggieri\n\nWhat time does the 'Eras Tour' show start in Miami?\n\nThe stadium gates open at 4:30 p.m., with Swift taking the stage around 7 p.m.\n\nThe OG Eras Tour\n\nWhen the tour began in April of last year, no one knew exactly what to expect. Swift hadn't toured since Reputation. Our national music critic Melissa Ruggieri attended that very first show in Glendale, Arizona, calling it: \"as ambitious as a Broadway musical.\"\n\nSwifties knew the tour was big, but could anyone predict what the tour would grow into over the next year? Ruggieri wrote: \"Not since the most vigorous days of Bruce Springsteen and his legendary live concerts has a mainstream artist packed so much music into one show.\"\n\nRead all of Ruggieri's impressions of the first show.\n\nWill Travis Kelce be at the Miami Eras Tour shows?\n\nSwift’s beau may have went to his final Eras Tour in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. The Kansas City tight end is in full football mode and will more than likely not be in attendance at any of the Hard Rock stadium shows. The Chiefs have upcoming Super Bowl rematch game against the San Francisco 49ers on Oct. 20 at 3:25 p.m.\n\nSwift has cheered on Kelce at three home games so far. Her next NFL appearance may be the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Nov. 4 in Arrowhead Stadium. This will be after she completes her final American show in Indianapolis on Nov. 3.\n\n– Bryan West\n\nWho is opening for Taylor Swift in Miami?\n\nGracie Abrams opens for Swift in Miami. She also was an opener for some shows on the tour last year. Our KiMi Robinson saw Abrams on her solo tour in Los Angeles in September and says she \"sings like she's letting you in on a secret.\"\n\nWill she sing \"I Miss You, I'm Sorry\" or \"Close to You\"? Here is what she has included in earlier Eras Tour openers:\n\nSwifties going straight to concert from the airport\n\nFans flying to Miami for the concert this week flocked straight to the stadium. Not for the show, of course, but to buy merch and not miss any of the concert while in lines.\n\nCharmaine Brown went straight from her flight from Charlotte to the stadium and her reward: two plastic bags of Taylor Swift hoodies and T-shirts. Her bright red carry-on bag next to her as she ordered an Uber to her hotel. The super fan wore her bright red \"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me\" tee and \"All Too Well\" sweatshirt tied around her waist.\n\n\"I took my first picture at 11:03 a.m., and my checkout picture was at 12:09 p.m.,\" she said, showing off her recent photos. \"I am so excited for the concert. I cannot wait. I hope Taylor knows we appreciate everything that you do for us.\"\n\n– Bryan West", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2024/11/02/taylor-swift-indianapolis-n2-eras-tour-lucas-oil-stadium-live/75895824007/", "title": "Taylor Swift N2 in Indianapolis saw Travis Kelce, surprise songs", "text": "With Night 1 of Taylor Swift's record-setting Eras Tour stop at Lucas Oil Stadium in the rearview mirror, we pulled out all the stops covering Night 2. Tens of thousands descended upon Indianapolis for the final three U.S. shows of the tour, and the city is absolutely abuzz with Swiftie spirit.\n\nIndyStar journalists were back out on the streets for Day 2 of Eras Tour weekend, meeting fans, exchanging friendship bracelets and bringing you all the sights and sounds of downtown Indianapolis.\n\nEditor's note: Read this story from the bottom up to relive the night as it unfolded.\n\nTakeaways from Taylor Swift N1:Taylor Swift's Eras Tour a whole new experience the second time around\n\nTravis Kelce attends N2 in Indy\n\n\"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,\" Swift sang as photos of the NFL star circulated on social media. One shot appeared to show the tight end wearing a black cap and long-sleeved shirt, smiling.\n\nNormally, Swift sings \"Karma is the guy on the screen, coming straight home to me.\" She first altered the lyric in November 2023, and she's since sang it the same way every time Kelce's been in the audience — now at least 14 times.\n\n— Ryan Murphy\n\nSurprise songs from Eras Tour N2 Indy\n\nOn her second night in Indianapolis, Swift performed a mashup of \"The Prophecy\" from \"The Tortured Poets' Department\" and \"This Love\" from \"1989\" on the guitar.\n\nShe then moved to the piano, where she played a mashup of \"Maroon\" from \"Midnights\" and \"Cowboy Like Me\" from \"Evermore.\"\n\n— Ryan Murphy\n\nWill Indy get a 'Reputation (Taylor's Version)' announcement?\n\nFans have speculated that Swift uses the number 112 to plan her announcements.\n\nThe theory isn't without evidence. \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)\" was released 112 days after the Eras Tour began; \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" came out 112 days after the re-recorded \"Speak Now.\" And 112 days after Swift performed \"If This Was a Movie\" as her surprise song in Minneapolis, the Eras Tour film opened at the box office.\n\nWhile it's been more than 112 days since Swift's last album release, Saturday night's concert takes place exactly twenty years after she first met Scott Borchetta, the then-chief of Big Machine Records, on Nov. 2. 2004 — a date that could also be written as 11/2.\n\nThere are even more Easter eggs:Will Taylor Swift announce \"Reputation (Taylor's Version)\" in Indianapolis? What we know\n\n— Ryan Murphy\n\nTaylor says N2 beats N1's concert attendance record: 'You guys are the best'\n\n\"They told me some really cool news earlier, which I wanted to pass on to you, because you're the reason it happened,\" Swift told fans. \"Last night, before I went on stage, everybody was so excited because they were like the crowd has broken the all-time concert attendance record for the stadium. And tonight, you broke last night's record.\n\n\"So cool that there's just never been this many people in this stadium for a concert before. You guys are the best. Thank you for doing that.\"\n\n— Bryan West\n\nN2's 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together' was even more Midwestern\n\nWhen Swift sings \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" backup dancer Kam Saunders chimes in with a different interjection after Swift speaks during the song's bridge. On N1, Saunders said \"No, yeah, no\" — a phrase fans were quick to recognize as quintessentially Midwestern.\n\nOn N2, Saunders said \"Ope, no,\" in what seemed to be a nod to the Hoosier State — seeing as \"ope\" is one of the most Midwestern words there is.\n\n— Ryan Murphy\n\nCaitlin Clark returns to Lucas Oil Stadium for N2 of the Eras Tour\n\nNo. 22 was spotted back at Lucas Oil Stadium on Saturday night to watch Swift perform for a second time this weekend.\n\nClark was spotted N1 at the Eras Tour by fans and shared her excitement on her Instagram story. She posted N2 with the caption: \"So back.\"\n\n— Katie Wiseman\n\nRead more:Caitlin Clark returns to the Eras Tour to see Taylor Swift for the second time this weekend\n\nIt's go time! Taylor Swift takes the stage at Eras Tour N2 in Indy\n\nGracie Abrams hits the stage and N2 is officially underway!\n\nWhat time will Eras Tour N2 start at Lucas Oil Stadium?\n\nThe concert gets underway at 7 p.m. with Gracie Abrams as the opener. For Night 1, Swift took the stage at 8:05 p.m. Expect Night 2 to be right around 8 p.m. again.\n\n— Evan Frank\n\nWhat to know about N2 show timing:What time does Taylor Swift go on stage for Eras Tour Night 2 in Indianapolis?\n\nConcertgoers remain hopeful outside stadium\n\nDozens of people hoping to snag last minute-tickets stood outside Lucas Oil Stadium less than 90 minutes before Taylor Swift was set to go on stage. Many held up signs saying they were in search of tickets.\n\nAnne Henry, 36, flew in from Orlando with two friends for less than 24 hours to try for tickets knowing that not attending the concert was a real possibility. Henry tried for tickets multiple times when the surprise Ticketmaster drops went online but failed to snag any.\n\nWithout a hotel room for the night, she said the trio are planning to go get a bite to eat and hang out once the concert starts.\n\n“Being around the community is always good and we are having a good time despite being sad about how Ticketmaster went down,” Henry said.\n\n— Alysa Guffey\n\nLooking to buy last-minute Eras Tour N2 tickets in Indy?\n\nWith opener Gracie Abrams expected to take the stage in less than an hour, there are still tickets available for purchase via third-party sites like StubHub.\n\nA little less than an hour before the show was scheduled to start, the cheapest ticket available for purchase was through Vivid Seats for $2,213 located at Lower Level 249, Row 5 with an obstructed view.\n\nRead more:Still hoping to see Taylor Swift N2 in Indianapolis? Here's how much tickets are reselling for\n\n— Katie Wiseman\n\nMaking flower crowns to honor Swift\n\nDemarise Abbett’s admiration for Taylor Swift stretches back to a 2008 Verizon Wireless Music Center concert when the singer-songwriter opened for Tim McGraw.\n\nAt the time, Abbett was 15 years old and had curly hair she was a little unsure of.\n\n“In her first self album cover, (Swift’s hair) is just down and frizzy and curly and just there. She’s just not afraid of herself,” Abbett said. “I just always looked up to that.\"\n\nDuring the Eras Tour weekend, the Little Flower resident was selling handmade flower crowns through her business, Cellar Creations by Demarise. At her booth at the Indiana State Museum’s TAY/gate, Abbett displayed several types of crowns inspired by Swift’s eras.\n\nFor example, “Fairytale” — with its daisies, spray roses and baby’s breath — evoked the “Fearless,” “Folklore” and “Evermore” eras. The “Cruel Summer” crown nodded to the “Lover,” “1989,” “Speak Now” and debut album eras with mums, roses, waxflower and carnations.\n\nAs for Abbett’s favorite era? That’s tough to choose, she said. But she’s particularly fond of the singer-songwriter’s early songs — the ones Swift would have performed at that 2008 concert, like “Picture to Burn” and “Our Song.”\n\n“I think it’s just so relatable — like being a teenage girl and wanting to dream about the future but also being so frustrated,” Abbett said.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nFans love the stories Swift tells with her music\n\nJordan Eltzroth, who’s from Morristown, has been listening to Swift since her debut album. And now, her 3-year-old daughter Evelynn loves to listen, too — especially to “Shake It Off,” “Paper Rings,” “Reputation,” “Cruel Summer” and “Lover.”\n\nSo what does Evelynn like best about Swift? “My shirt!” she replies.\n\nWhat to know:Your guide to Taylor Swift in Indianapolis for Eras Tour shows\n\nColorful letters on the black background spell out “In My Swiftie Era.” Her mom’s sweatshirt depicts Swift’s album titles on books.\n\n“I just love her overall music and the message behind all of her music,” said Eltzroth, 30. “It’s all of the albums but they’re books, so it tells a story.”\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nTalk about a wild era\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, what looked to once be a large paper friendship bracelet was no more. Inside a chimpanzee lair at the Indianapolis Zoo, an “o” and “u” were strewn across the enclosure near other colorful pieces of paper.\n\nThree chimps calmly sat nearby, giving no hint as to what happened. But their message appeared to be clear.\n\n“They’re not Swifties,” one bystander said.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nA view from above: See the J.W. Marriott's Taylor Swift decal from the sky\n\nHow long is the wait for Eras Tour merch in Indy?\n\nJust three hours before the Saturday night show, merchandise lines topped three hours inside the Indiana Convention Center and some sizes of certain items were running out, according to fans exiting the line.\n\nHayley Turnbaugh, 32, of Baltimore, waited two and a half hours to shop. Blue crewnecks were beginning to sell out along with various sizes of t-shirts, she said.\n\nStands inside the convention center close at 8 p.m. and will not be open Sunday, meaning Saturday is Swifties' last chance to buy merchandise without a ticket.\n\nMerchandise is available at Lucas Oil Stadium Saturday and Sunday night. Some products can be bought online at store.taylorswift.com.\n\n— Alysa Guffey\n\n'This was the very first page': Indy couple gets engaged during enchanting Eras Tour N1\n\nAinsley Clements, 31, had a moment at the first night of the Eras Tour in Indianapolis when she thought her boyfriend, James Underwood, might propose.\n\nIn Taylor Swift's iconic love song \"Love Story,\" she sings that Romeo \"knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring / And said / Marry me, Juliet,\" making it a popular time for Eras Tour marriage proposals.\n\nBut the moment passed without a proposal for Clements, 31.\n\nInstead, Underwood's proposal came a little later in the setlist, during the song \"Enchanted\" from the \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)\" album.\n\n\"That is our song,\" Underwood, 45, told IndyStar on Saturday. \"I thought about doing it during 'Love Story' but that is too cliche.\"\n\nRead more about how he made it happen:Indy couple gets engaged in enchanting N1 of Eras Tour but not during 'Love Story'\n\n— Alysa Guffey\n\nLooking forward to N2's surprise songs? Here's Taylor Swift sang in N1\n\nDuring the acoustic set N1 of the Eras Tour, Taylor performed a mashup of \"The Albatross\" from \"The Tortured Poets Department\" and \"Holy Ground\" from \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" on the guitar.\n\nShe then performed a mashup \"Cold As You\" from her debut album and \"Exile\" from \"Folklore\" on the piano.\n\n— Katie Wiseman\n\nWhat's Taylor Swift's big announcement?\n\nIt is officially Eras Tour weekend in Indianapolis, the last city on the U.S. leg of the tour. We are only hours away from Taylor Swift taking the stage at Lucas Oil Stadium, but will she make a big announcement this weekend?\n\nFans are already buzzing on social media speculating about whether or not Indy will be the city that hears the long-awaited \"Reputation (Taylor's Version)\" announcement.\n\nRead more takes:Will Taylor Swift make a big announcement in Indy?

One popular shop has been Francis and Fern Boutique, 421 Massachusetts Ave., which went viral on TikTok this week.\n\nThe store has had a constant, hourslong line to shop custom-made items like shirts, mugs and necklaces, owner Kim Pauszek said.\n\n“We’ve always carried Taylor Swift and we have a huge Swiftie following, so we knew we had to go nuts,” Pauszek said.\n\nElla Klaus and Andi Reiser from Pittsburgh waited for three hours to shop. Both bought custom mugs, with one reading “With some Indy record that’s much cooler than mine,” a play on a lyric from “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.”\n\nThe friends traveled to the Circle City with tickets for Night 1 of the Indianapolis shows and were meandering about downtown continuing to soak up the Swiftie spirit.\n\nIt wasn’t their first time seeing Swift, but the night was one to remember.\n\n“The set-up was so much better, and it was so different with the 'Tortured Poets Department' set,” said Reiser. And the surprise songs were amazing, she added.\n\n— Alysa Guffey\n\nDarius Rucker took daughters to Eras Tour Indy N1\n\nThe singer, who is known for his solo work as a country artist and for fronting Hootie & the Blowfish, posted to social media that he took his two daughters to the show, with the stage and a Lucas Oil banner appearing in the background.\n\nHe wasn't the only celeb in attendance for N1: Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was also at the show.\n\nSee Swift's 2019 Teen Choice Awards look on display at The Childrens Museum\n\nA multicolored outfit once worn by Swift drew crowds at The Children’s Museum on Saturday.

The items will be on display until April 20.\n\nSee hours and ticket prices at childrensmuseum.org.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nMaking a day of Swift-themed events around Indy\n\nErika Leisure and her daughter Kate are without tickets to an Eras Tour concert, but they still drove from Goshen to Indianapolis, singing Swift’s album “The Tortured Poets Department” at the top of their lungs. Kate, 10, especially loves the high notes in the song “Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me.”\n\n“We decided we wanted to make a Taylor Swift day anyway,” Leisure, 40, said, “so we came down and we’re making bracelets and we dressed up together and we’re going to the dance party, and after we’re done here, we’re going to go to the zoo’s Wildest Era party.”\n\nLeisure’s own fandom began before she had kids, and now she shares a love for Swift’s work with her daughter. The two wore matching outfits and red lipstick on Saturday at The Children’s Museum.\n\n“I think before kids, (it was) just like, ‘Oh, women empowerment — she’s amazing.’ Now that I have my daughter — she has three older brothers, and then, I got Kate.

They dressed in matching heart sunglasses and T-shirts, nods to Swift’s “Reputation” and “Fearless” albums.\n\nEven without tickets, the drive from Columbus, Ohio, was worth it, they said.\n\n“I’m breathing the same air as (Swift),” Rhylynn said.\n\n“I think the reason we did it was just so at least they could experience what it’s like close to it, a part of the Eras Tour stuff even though we can’t actually go to the concert,” mom Amanda Little, 40, said.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nOur takeaways from Taylor Swift N1 Indianapolis\n\nWhile Post Malone did not show, Caitlin Clark did.

It is the largest fine the FTC has ever imposed for a rule that it enforces, the agency said Monday.\n\nIn a second and separate settlement, Epic will pay $245 million as refunds to consumers who were allegedly harmed by user-interface design choices the FTC claimed were deceptive. That agreement is the largest administrative order in FTC history, the FTC added.\n\nIn a blog post addressing the twin settlements, Epic said the agreement reflects an evolution in how US laws are applied to the video gaming industry.\n\n“No developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here,” Epic said in the blog post. “We accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.”\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan said the settlement reflects the agency’s heightened focus on privacy and so-called “dark patterns,” a term used to describe design elements intended to nudge users toward a company’s preferred result.\n\n“Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices,” Khan said in a statement.\n\nThe FTC’s complaint and proposed settlement dealing with children’s privacy was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. In addition to the alleged illegal collection of children’s data, the FTC also claimed that Epic’s default settings for matchmaking and in-game communications exposed children to bullying and harassment.\n\nThe allegations of Epic’s deceptive design choices were filed as an FTC administrative complaint. The complaint claims Epic made it extremely easy for children to purchase in-game items with a single click or button press without parental approval, resulting in more than one million parental complaints to Epic about unwanted charges.\n\nThe FTC further alleged that Epic made it more difficult to cancel purchases of in-game items by burying the option at the bottom of the screen and by requiring consumers to push and hold a button on their controllers to complete the cancellation. Those design choices were allegedly implemented after surveys showed that, when the cancel button was more prominently displayed, accidental charges were the “number one ‘reason’” users clicked on the button, the FTC said.\n\nEpic’s agreement with the FTC, which is not yet final, prohibits the company from using dark patterns or charging consumers without their consent, and also forbids Epic from locking players out of their accounts in response to users’ chargeback requests with credit card companies disputing unwanted charges. The agreement will last for 20 years from the time it is adopted.\n\nIn its blog post, Epic said it has agreed with the FTC to implement a feature that explicitly asks Fortnite users whether to save their payment information for future use. The feature is currently live, it added. The company also recently rolled out a more limited version of “Fortnite” for younger players that allows them to access some features while awaiting parental consent but that restricts chat and purchases.\n\nThe FTC said that as part of its children’s privacy settlement, Epic may no longer enable text and voice chat by default for teenage Fortnite players or those under the age of 13. The company must also establish a comprehensive privacy program and delete the data it allegedly gathered in violation of COPPA.\n\n“We share the underlying principles of fairness, transparency and privacy that the FTC enforces, and the practices referenced in the FTC’s complaints are not how Fortnite operates,” Epic wrote. “We will continue to be upfront about what players can expect when making purchases, ensure cancellations and refunds are simple, and build safeguards that help keep our ecosystem safe and fun for audiences of all ages.”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/09/11/equifax-hit-least-23-class-action-lawsuits-over-massive-cyberbreach/653909001/", "title": "Equifax hit with at least 23 class-action lawsuits over cyberbreach", "text": "Equifax faces at least 23 proposed class-action lawsuits since its disclosure that personal identifying information for 143 million U.S. consumers may have been compromised by a massive cyberbreach.\n\nAnd additional cases are likely to come.\n\nFederal court records show the lawsuits were filed through the weekend after the credit-reporting giant's Thursday disclosure that a cyberattack by criminal hackers provided unauthorized access to information for nearly 44% of the U.S. population.\n\nSeparately, Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, respectively the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Finance, sent Equifax detailed questions about the breach on Monday.\n\nA copy of the letter, reviewed by USA TODAY, shows the panel wants a detailed timeline of the breach, information about the company's efforts to identify the number of consumers affected, the breadth of information compromised and the steps Equifax has taken to identify and limit potential consumer harm.\n\nEarn rewards on your spending: See the best credit cards\n\nThe relatively large number of new lawsuits against Equifax that seek class-action status signal the high legal stakes over the potential for identity-theft losses by millions of Americans whose personal data was exposed.\n\nThe cases also show an eagerness by plaintiff law firms to stake swift claims on behalf of consumers who eventually might be in line for a share of either a court judgment against Equifax or a settlement by the company.\n\n\"Equifax probably injured 143 million people, which is kind of a record,\" said John Coffee, a Columbia Law School professor and director of the school's Center on Corporate Governance. Although the extent of the damage hasn't yet been determined, \"with 143 million people it doesn't surprise me there are already 23 suits,\" said Coffee.\n\nEquifax did not respond to emails seeking comment on the cases. However, the company acknowledged last week it expects costs related to the cyberattack. Shares of Equifax (EFX) closed down 8.2% at $113.12 in Monday trading, extending Friday's nearly 13.7% plunge.\n\nUnknown hackers carried out the cyberattack out from mid-May through July 2017. The resulting breach primarily involved names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and in some cases, driver's license numbers, Equifax said last week.\n\nThe company said it discovered the intrusion on July 29, but it first disclosed the attack publicly on Sept. 7, after engaging an independent cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic assessment and provide recommendations to toughen electronic security safeguards.\n\nThe Atlanta-based firm is one of the nation's three largest credit-reporting and monitoring firms, along with Experian and TransUnion.\n\nEquifax organizes and analyzes data on more than 820 million consumers and more than 91 million businesses worldwide. The company's databases hold employee data submitted by more than 7,100 employers.\n\nThe complaints:\n\nFiled in 14 states and the District of Columbia, the federal lawsuits target either Equifax or the company's Equifax Information Services subsidiary. The legal complaints cite a range of legal claims, including alleged security negligence by Equifax, the delay in alerting the public and concerns about the free credit monitoring service the company has offered consumers.\n\nNoting that Equifax experienced smaller cyberbreaches in 2013, 2016, and earlier this year, the lawsuit filed in California federal court on behalf of Ehud Gersten and Hannah Obradovich charges the company \"knew and should have known of the inadequacy of its own data security.\"\n\nEquifax's delay in alerting consumers was \"willful, or at least negligent,\" argued the case filed in Illinois federal court on behalf of Dan Lang and Russell Pantek.\n\nAs a result, \"consumers were deprived of their opportunity to meaningfully consider and address issues related to the potential fraud, as well as to avail themselves of the remedies available under the FCRA (U.S. Fair Credit Reporting Act) to prevent further dissemination of their private information,\" the Illinois lawsuit alleged.\n\nA California federal court lawsuit filed on behalf of Richard Spicer and Julia Gutierrez in part focused on Equifax's offer to register consumers for a free year of credit monitoring from TrustedID.\n\n\"Equifax failed to disclose to consumers that it owned TrustedID, and its long-term business model turns on baiting consumers into signing up for its services,\" the California case alleged. \"In other words, Equifax sought to turn its failure to protect consumers' sensitive data into a clandestine money-making opportunity.\"\n\nCyber breach at Equifax could affect 143M U.S. consumers\n\nThe company separately drew legal criticism from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office over an implication that those who registered for TrustedID would waive their rights to pursue class-action lawsuits and instead would have to pursue legal claims through arbitration.\n\nSchneiderman is investigating the Equifax cyberbreach. Late Friday, the company said the waiver requirement applied only to the offer of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection, \"not the cybersecurity incident.\"\n\nHow the legal process could play out:\n\nBarring any pretrial settlement, the cases would likely go through a legal culling process.\n\nFirst, a federal panel on multidistrict litigation would likely to consolidate the cases in a single lawsuit on behalf of all consumers claiming harm, and assign that case to a judge, said Coffee. In turn, the judge would likely determine which law firm or firms would serve as lead plaintiff counsel — a designation that typically brings a larger percentage share of any settlement or judgment.\n\nAlthough the lawsuits seek class-action status, such a designation typically is approved by a federal court only after extensive legal arguments from plaintiff and defense lawyers.\n\nIn a Thursday online notice to investors, Equifax said it was too early \"to provide specific estimates of the costs we expect to incur related to the cybersecurity incident.\"\n\nWhile anticipating \"some disruption to our business,\" Equifax said it \"remains committed to delivering on the long term financial model of 7-10% revenue growth and 11%-14% growth in adjusted earnings per share on average over a business cycle.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/13/boy-scout-camp-sale-courthouse-concerns-crazy-mountains-news-around-states/117500146/", "title": "Boy Scout camp sale, courthouse concerns: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Work has begun on a $34 million project to develop a nearly mile-long area beneath an elevated interstate highway through Birmingham with attractions that include spaces for performances and recreation.

Lisa Murkowski, who has been one of the GOP’s most outspoken critics of former President Donald Trump, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The Alaska Republican State Central Committee endorsed Kelly Tshibaka in the 2022 race for the U.S. Senate seat held by Murkowski. The committee approved Tshibaka’s endorsement in a 58-17 vote during a meeting in Fairbanks, the newspaper reports. In a statement, Tshibaka said she will uphold conservative ideals and be a senator who Alaskans “can depend to make every decision based on what is best for our great state.” Tshibaka, who ran the Alaska Department of Administration, announced March 29 that she would run for the Senate seat held by Murkowski, who has been in office since 2002. On March 13, the Republican State Central Committee voted 53-17 to censure Murkowski, citing her vote to impeach Trump and other votes that have broken with GOP leadership. Alaska Republican Party leaders said at the time that they would recruit someone to run against her. Trump has endorsed Tshibaka. “Lisa Murkowski is bad for Alaska,” the former president said in a statement last month. “Murkowski has got to go!”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A Boy Scout council that serves most of the state plans to sell its main summer camp near Payson and part of a Phoenix facility to help the national organization settle claims by thousands of victims of child sex abuse. The Phoenix-based Grand Canyon Council said it will sell Camp Geronimo and 10 acres of Heard Scout Pueblo and shift its summer camp operations to Camp Raymond near Flagstaff. “This option leverages the high net value of Camp Geronimo and the rising real estate values in Arizona against our program needs; we will retain the most-used portion of the Heard while giving up the portion under-utilized by us yet highly valued to others,” the council said Wednesday on its website. The council said it must contribute just over $7 million toward the settlement and reviewed its options carefully. “The process has been difficult and at times emotional, as everyone has strong ties to our various camps, and each is loved for its own special characteristics.” The council serves most of central and northern Arizona. The Tucson-based Catalina Council serves most of southern Arizona, while parts of northwestern and northeastern Arizona are served by councils based respectively in Las Vegas and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The authenticity of a United Nations designation that was given to the city by an artist is now being questioned. At a ceremony last Tuesday, Nigerian artist Ibiyinka Alao announced Fort Smith became the 10th city in the world to be declared a “United Nations international city for artistic and cultural innovation in peace building and economic growth.” Fort Smith Mayor George McGill attended the event. Alao, who is a guest artist in residence with a nonprofit group in nearby Rogers, said the U.N. declaration is given to cities that support the arts. Alao is described as a U.N. art ambassador. But Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary-general of the U.N., said he is not aware of an “ambassador of the arts” in the organization. He also said the U.N. does not designate cities with the title Alao gave Fort Smith. “This has all the hallmarks of a scam,” Dujarric told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. He said the U.N. legal team has been notified of the situation. Asked Friday about Dujarric’s statement, Alao said it was simply his assessment. He said the word “designation,” which Dujarric used and has been used in news articles to describe the declaration, is misleading: “It’s just a declaration, which is my assessment of what a city is doing to foster the arts, use the arts as a tool for economic development and peace building.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nIndio: Thomas Rhett, Carrie Underwood and Luke Combs are slated to headline the return of the Stagecoach Festival next spring. Other festival highlights include Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile and country legend Tanya Tucker on Friday, April 29, masked country singer Orville Peck and alternative country vocalist Margo Price on Saturday, April 30, and rock band The Black Crowes and Motown legend Smokey Robinson on Sunday, May 1. A summer announcement is unusual, as the lineup is typically released in October. Los Angeles-based producer Goldenvoice announced on the Stagecoach Twitter last week that it was forgoing an advance sale in lieu of an early lineup release. Both Coachella and Stagecoach were postponed twice before the April 2021 dates were canceled. Some fans hoped the festivals would be rescheduled for October, as the city of Indio has a contract with Goldenvoice that allows for five concerts each year. Rhett and Underwood were announced as headliners for the 2020 festival, along with Eric Church. The previous lineup also included Billy Ray Cyrus, ZZ Top and Alan Jackson and Bryan Adams.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Ahead of Major League Baseball’s All-Star Game this week, city officials are facing scrutiny from advocates who accuse them of accelerating the clearing of homeless encampments near Coors Field as the sports world turns its attention to Colorado’s capital city. Mayor Michael Hancock has emphatically denied that the All-Star Game influenced any clearing decisions, saying the city is just getting caught up after suspending cleanups at the beginning of the pandemic. It resumed regular cleanups last summer. Officials knew before the city was chosen as the All-Star host that it faced a big cleanup effort, with more encampments than ever, Hancock said. In cleanups, also called homeless “sweeps,” encampments are fenced off, and the people living in tents there are told to pack up and leave so the area can be cleaned. In March, just before Denver was chosen as a substitute host – Major League Baseball pulled it from Atlanta in April over objections to Georgia’s voting law that critics condemned as being too restrictive – data shows sweeps increased, with cleanups taking place over nine days. The previous peak over the past year was eight days, in October. But the sweeps picked up even more in May and June with 17 scheduled cleanups taking 22 days, according to public records first reported by online news outlet Denverite.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Lyme: Six National Guard soldiers were sent to the hospital for observation Monday after experiencing heat-related issued during a training march. Maj. Dave Pytlik, a spokesperson with the Connecticut National Guard, said the soldiers were among several dozen participating this week in officer training school at the Guard’s Stone’s Ranch Military Reservation in East Lyme. Monday is what is known as “ruck march” day, when the soldiers carry heavy backpacks on a rigorous 6-mile training march, he said. Pytlik said medical personnel, including a doctor, were on hand as part of precautions for the early morning march and responded appropriately to treat those suffering dehydration and other heat-related symptoms. “The issue is that someone came on the network and used the term ‘mass-casualty incident’ and said someone was unresponsive,” he said. “There was nobody who was unresponsive, and mass-casualty kind of means something different in the world than it means to us.” He said the six soldiers were taken to Lawrence + Memorial Hospital in New London for observation, but nobody was seriously injured. Pytlik said minor injuries and dehydration are relatively common issues during training marches.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles is turning its operations back to pre-COVID-19 “normal” conditions. That means DMV buildings will return to full capacity, among other changes. The Delaware State News reports the changes will be made Tuesday after Gov. John Carney’s state of emergency declaration is lifted. Starting Tuesday, mask recommendations will follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Customers who have not been fully vaccinated will be encouraged to continue wearing face coverings while at the DMV. Driver license and vehicle registration suspensions for bad checks will also resume. So will uninsured motorist customer notifications for any outstanding balance owed to the DMV. Class D road tests and counter eye exams are also set to resume. Specific guidance will be in place from the Delaware Division of Public Health to protect both customers and staff. Marinah Carver, chief of communications for DMV, said staff is to be commended for its service to the public during the pandemic.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Drivers who frequent Rock Creek Park’s Beach Drive during late mornings and early afternoons will need to reroute themselves to accommodate an extensive renovation project, WUSA-TV reports. As of Monday, the segment of Beach Drive between Shoreham Drive and Tilden Street Northwest will be closed to traffic daily between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., according to D.C.’s Department of Transportation. The closures will remain in effect until at least Dec. 20. The detours are part of the city’s larger 3.7-mile renovation project that will consolidate the existing paths into part of the Rock Creek Park Multi-Use Trail and Pedestrian Bridge project. This includes the addition of a 110-foot bridge south of the Smithsonian National Zoo tunnel that will reroute foot and bike traffic off the existing narrow footpath that flows directly adjacent to traffic inside the current tunnel. DDOT expects the entire trail renovation to be completed sometime in spring 2023. The rehabilitation process comes nearly three years after a trail adjacent to the National Zoo collapsed following extreme flooding. Foot and bike traffic have subsequently been forced to use the narrow sidewalk in the Beach Drive tunnel.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The Miami-Dade County Courthouse will begin undergoing repairs immediately after a review, prompted by the deadly collapse of a nearby condominium building, found that safety concerns exist within the courthouse, officials said. A joint statement from multiple leaders released late Friday said an engineer’s report recommended floors 16 and above be closed to staff at the courthouse. The leaders decided all courthouse employees would go back to working from home. The statement said workers only recently returned to the building after working remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Court operations will go back to a remote format until the safety concerns are addressed. People with upcoming court proceedings scheduled to take place in person will be receiving a new notice with instructions, the statement said. Specific details about what repairs are needed were not disclosed. The courthouse was built in 1928 and added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1989, news outlets report. The building has 28 floors. The building underwent a review following the collapse of Champlain Towers South in Surfside, where the toll is likely to top 100.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: A new initiative at the Mercer University School of Medicine conceived by a retired federal judge is helping poor people in rural Georgia erase their medical debt. The Mercer Family Cares Initiative, funded by three families with ties to the university, is retiring more than $4.3 million in medical debt for nearly 3,000 people who live in 33 Georgia counties, according to a news release from the university. The idea came from retired U.S. District Judge William Duffey, who served in the northern district of Georgia and was previously a partner at King & Spalding law firm in Atlanta, after he noticed inflated prices for items on his own medical bills. He did some research and found that the system is needlessly confusing and fraught with undue and unreasonable expenses, particularly for those who are least able to pay. “I’ve always wondered how people navigate the system, especially those who didn’t have the patience, time or resources,” Duffey said in the news release. Mercer’s medical school works on issues related to access to medical care in rural Georgia, and Duffey reached out to two friends who had graduated from Mercer Law, one a current university trustee and one a former trustee, to see about helping to resolve medical debt for people living in poverty.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A nonprofit organization that serves and advocates for the Micronesian and Pacific islander communities plans to open a youth center in Honolulu this month. The center will offer college and career prep, cultural exhibitions, mentorship programs and study areas, We Are Oceania CEO Josie Howard told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. It will have resources for homeless youth and families, she said. “Just like a home means everything to a family, this center will be the same,” Howard said. “It’s a place where they can come and seek help. Somebody is there to help, and somebody is there who understands them.” The Youth Empowerment Center, the first of its kind for We Are Oceania, is located inside a former American Savings Bank branch in Liliha that offered the space to the nonprofit rent-free. University of Hawaii at Manoa undergraduate K-nard Narruhn, who is Chuukese, is recruiting youth mentors and said he is excited to continue working as one himself. The 22-year-old who helps organize and run food drives, vaccination clinics, translation services, and unemployment and housing support remembers getting help from We Are Oceania after he dropped out of high school and was going from job to job feeling unfulfilled. Narruhn earned his high school equivalency diploma and enrolled in college, making the dean’s list.\n\nIdaho\n\nBuhl: A far-right extremist group whose members took part in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol participated with a float in the town’s July 3 parade. The Times-News reports Proud Boys members were among about 100 floats in the Sagebrush Days parade. The Buhl Chamber of Commerce runs the parade but wouldn’t comment specifically about the Proud Boys taking part. “At this time the Buhl Chamber (of) Commerce will not feed into any negative propaganda,” the group said in a statement to the newspaper. “The Buhl 2021 Sagebrush Days parade saw 90 plus entries who celebrated in a courteous and civil manner.” Chamber officials later told the paper they were looking into the process for reviewing parade entries. On Jan. 6, the Proud Boys marched to the Capitol before then-President Donald Trump finished addressing thousands of supporters near the White House. The insurrectionists who descended on the Capitol sent terrified lawmakers running for their lives. Twin Falls County, where Buhl is located, overwhelmingly voted for Trump. In Buhl, men accompanying the Proud Boys float wore black and yellow shirts while carrying an American flag and a black flag with the yellow letters “P.B.” “I was surprised as anyone else to see that particular float go by,” said Buhl City Councilman Michael Higbee. Idaho has a history of far-right groups. The neo-Nazi group Aryan Nations was based near Hayden Lake in northern Idaho starting in the 1970s.\n\nIllinois\n\nCarbondale: A Southern Illinois University researcher is tracking coyotes and bobcats to understand the habitats they seek and how they affect them. Nicole Gorman, a graduate zoology student and a research assistant at SIU’s Wildlife Research Laboratory in Carbondale, is studying the movement of bobcats and coyotes in central and southern Illinois. Such midsize predators dominate North America, and it’s critical to understand their impact, she said. “Studying predator movement specifically can provide scientists with more details about their behavior and how they might be interacting with their environments and other species around them,” Gorman said. “This understanding can lead to effective wildlife management, benefiting predator and prey species alike.” Since starting in November 2019, Gorman has captured and tagged 33 of the animals at sites near Makanda and Lake Shelbyville. She said she traps them safely with foothold or cage traps and fits them with GPS transmitters to follow them. She studies the incoming data to determine habitats they like and those they avoid. She also reviews their interaction with deer as part of a project on white-tailed deer movement sponsored by the U.S. Wildlife Restoration Fund and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. She’s found coyotes and bobcats in heavily forested southern Illinois need not travel far to sustain themselves, but in the more agricultural central Illinois, their range can exceed 200 square miles.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The number of abortions performed in the state grew slightly last year, with a new report showing drug-induced abortions made up a majority of the procedures for the first time. The annual report from the state health department shows that the number of abortions in Indiana grew by 119, or 1.6%, to 7,756 during 2020. That increased number remained below the some 8,000 performed in 2018, Indiana’s highest total since 2014. Drug-induced abortions represented 55% of Indiana’s total, up from 44% during 2019 and about double the state’s rate from 2016. Indiana’s Republican-dominated Legislature passed a law this year aimed at requiring doctors to tell women undergoing such abortions about a disputed “abortion reversal” treatment for potentially stopping the process. That law, however, was blocked by a federal judge just before it was set to take effect July 1. Indiana recorded about 79,000 live births last year. Indiana Right to Life President Mike Fichter blamed the abortion increase on several anti-abortion laws passed by state legislators being blocked by federal courts. Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Nicole Erwin said the COVID-19 pandemic added pressure to many women facing unintended pregnancies, and making contraception more accessible and affordable was the best way to reduce such pregnancies.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Efforts to reduce overcrowding in the state’s prisons have been continued into a second year after beginning in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to new data from the state. As of June 14, Iowa’s prison population was 7,744 people, the Legislative Service Agency reported. That’s an increase of only 52 people compared to the previous year, a change of less than 1%. In comparison, there were nearly 9,000 people in the state’s prisons in 2011. Since then, 2014 was the last time fewer than 8,000 Iowans were in state prison at the end of the fiscal year. The current numbers mean about 245 out of each 100,000 Iowans are behind bars. The number was last that low in the late 1990s, according to a report from the Prison Policy Initiative. The Legislative Service Agency’s report uses data from the Iowa Department of Corrections and compares Iowa’s prison population, including admissions and releases, in the 2020 and 2021 budget years. The Legislative Service Agency attributed some of the decline in Iowa’s prison population, admissions and releases to COVID-19 mitigation policies. The Iowa Department of Corrections worked with the Iowa Board of Parole and community-based corrections to transition “as many inmates as possible” to community supervision to reduce prison populations, according to the report.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Health officials are investigating an outbreak of COVID-19 cases at a summer camp in Butler County, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment announced last week. Thirteen cases were reported in the past two weeks and 23 cases overall at the AGK Ministries summer camp at the Wheat State Retreat Center near Maize held June 21-25, the KDHE reports. State and Butler County health officials are investigating and urging anyone who attended the camp to be tested for the coronavirus. The camp is one of four camps listed by the state Thursday as COVID-19 cluster locations based on cases in the prior 14 days. The others are Christ the King Summer Camp and Early Education Center in Topeka, with nine cases; Moana Camp in Overland Park, with five cases; and West Central Christian Service Camp in the Johnson County town of Missouri, with seven cases.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A federal appeals court has ruled the state Department of Corrections can deny a life-saving medication for inmates with hepatitis C because it is expensive – a decision a dissenting judge said will condemn hundreds of prisoners to long-term organ damage and suffering. In a 2-1 ruling, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel said last Tuesday that the department can deny the treatment, which cures nearly 100% of patients but costs $13,000 to $32,000. The majority found that denying it to most of Kentucky’s 1,200 inmates with hepatitis C does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. But in a sharply worded dissent, Judge Jane Stranch of Nashville said by “flouting the recognized standard of care,” the Corrections Department “consigns thousands of prisoners with symptomatic, chronic HCV to years of additional suffering and irreversible liver scarring.” She said by withholding medical treatment until the damage has progressed too far to be reversible, Kentucky’s rationing plan “shocks the conscience” and is fundamentally unfair. Louisville attorney Greg Belzley, who represents prisoners in a class-action lawsuit, called the decision “horrendous” and said they would ask for a rehearing or petition the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Edwin Washington Edwards, the high-living, quick-witted four-term governor who reshaped the state’s oil revenues and dominated its politics for decades in a run all but overshadowed by scandal and eight years in federal prison, died Monday. He was 93. Edwards died of respiratory problems with family and friends by his bedside, family spokesman Leo Honeycutt said, days after entering hospice care at his home in Gonzales. “I’ve made no bones that I have considered myself on borrowed time for 20 years and we each know that all this fun has to end at some point,” Edwards said days before he died, according to his family’s statement. The “Cajun King” was known for delivering a steady supply of memorable one-liners as well as for his deft political instincts. Infamously, the lifelong Democrat said once said that the only way he could lose to a particularly lackluster Republican was if he were “caught in bed with a dead girl or a live boy.” A native of Louisiana’s Acadiana region who swore his 1972 oath of office in French and English, Edwards enjoyed renewed popularity after emerging from prison in 2011 at age 83 with his flamboyant character intact. The federal case that led to his May 2000 conviction involved him taking payoffs from interests seeking riverboat casino licenses.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Endangered Atlantic salmon in the Kennebec River can be protected without removing four hydroelectric dams, federal energy regulators said, leaving conservation groups stunned. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reached the conclusion in a draft environmental assessment July 1 in the relicensing of one of four dams owned by the Canada-based Brookfield Renewables. The regulators said the fish can be protected and brought back to a population of at least 2,000, even if the Shawmut Dam in Benton injures or kills as many as 4% of them. That’s a lower bar than both conservationists and Maine’s Department of Marine Resources have called for. “It’s really bad. It’s incredibly bad,” said Nick Bennett, a staff scientist at the Natural Resources Council of Maine, told Maine Public. FERC assessment also failed to meet fish passage standards recommended by its sister agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, he said. “Both National Marine Services and the Department of Marine Resources recommended dam removal. FERC completely ignored that,” he said. In a statement, a Brookfield spokesman said FERC’s proposed conditions are consistent with most of the company’s own recommendations, including the completion of a fish-lift at the Shawmut dam.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: A software glitch in some parking kiosks may have cost the city as much as $20,000 in revenue. Flowbird, which runs kiosks in downtown Ocean City, had performed a software update July 1 that led to some customers being charged multiple times, Ocean City spokeswoman Jessica Waters said. When city officials learned of the problem, they shut down paid parking July 5-6. Waters said that resulted in a revenue loss that has been estimated to be as much as $20,000. The problem also affected other communities with Flowbird kiosks, including Rehoboth Beach in Delaware. Flowbird has since resolved the problem and is issuing refunds, Vice President of Marketing Sean Renn said. He said that there were no security violations or hacks and that all customer data is safe.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The U.S.S. Constitution is returning to its full summer visitation hours this week for the first time in more than a year. Starting Tuesday, the warship known as “Old Ironsides” will be open for free public tours from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. The ship suspended public visits in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic but reopened on a limited basis last August. After a second shutdown, it reopened with limited visitation hours in May. Visitors are allowed to freely explore the top three decks of Old Ironsides and hear active-duty Navy sailors explain the ship’s 223-year history. The ship welcomed more than 600,000 guests in 2019. The U.S.S. Constitution is the world’s oldest commissioned warship still afloat. It played a crucial role in the Barbary Wars and the War of 1812, actively defending sea lanes from 1797 until 1855. The ship was undefeated in battle and destroyed or captured 33 enemy vessels. It earned its nickname during the War of 1812 when British cannonballs bounced off its wooden hull.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republicans’ attempts to add an ID component to absentee ballot applications and to institute signature verification at polling places have died in the GOP-led Legislature, amid pushback from election clerks and voting-rights advocates. Rep. Ann Bollin, who chairs the House Elections and Ethics Committee, said she and many other House Republicans oppose a Senate-passed bill that would require absentee ballot applicants to include a copy of their photo ID, their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Those who do not would get a provisional ballot and have to either verify their voter registration or their identity and residence within six days after the election for it to count. “There was not support to make it more difficult for voters through the AV process,” said Bollin, of Brighton Township. Nearly 3.3 million people – a record – voted absentee in November. Voters currently seeking an absentee ballot by mail must sign the application, and the signature is matched to the voter file. The Senate, meanwhile, is poised as soon as this week to reject the House GOP’s proposal to require that in-person voters’ signatures be verified before they are given a ballot, by mandating that signatures in Michigan’s voter file be added to electronic poll books.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: One of the state’s oddest, perhaps coolest and definitely most historically underappreciated fish – the gar – is about to get some love. The long, slender, toothy and prehistoric-looking fish will, for the first time ever in Minnesota, be protected in ways similar to other gamefish, the result of a bit of an outcry on social media following a series of mass killings that some saw as wantonly wasteful. In a Legislature divided starkly along partisan lines, Minnesota’s gar species found bipartisan support. Officials say they aren’t sure exactly what restrictions they’ll place on catching and killing gar, but the move carries a growing awareness of changing attitudes toward native fish that humbly live on the opposite end of the piscatorial spectrum from celebrated fish like walleye and bass, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. The much larger environment and natural resources bill approved by both the House and Senate contains one brief reference to gar: “The commissioner must annually establish daily and possession limits for gar.” Most states, including Minnesota, consider any gar, which are native to North America, as a “rough fish” with no limits for how many can be killed, of any size, any time of year. Two species of gars are native to Minnesota, the longnose gar and shortnose gar.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, which examines all fatal shootings by police officers across the state, has typically denied requests to release video footage and other evidence. But the commissioner of public safety told the Sun Herald the agency is changing its approach to allow for greater transparency. Sean Tindell, a former state senator and a former judge who became commissioner in June 2020, said he has directed the Department of Public Safety, which includes MBI, to be more responsive to public records requests. In June, the agency released video footage and some investigative material from its investigation of a Harrison County deputy’s shooting of Reginald Johnson outside the Biloxi courthouse in January. “As more and more of these incidents of officer-involved shootings are shared with the public in other parts of the country, I believe we need to be more transparent here in Mississippi as well,” Tindell said. “I’ve always been a big believer in transparency. I believe that if you … maintain a cloak of secrecy, then it lends itself to conspiracy theories and incorrect assumptions. I believe the public should have a right to view the footage and understand exactly what happened.” Tindell said his guidance for transparency applies to all agencies under his department.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Five police officers facing criminal charges remain on the job, with four on administrative duty and one still on patrol. Community leaders who have been critical of the Kansas City Police Department say they are particularly angry that a detective charged with manslaughter, Eric DeValkenaere, remains on administrative duty and is being paid, according to the Kansas City Star. “I think it’s despicable,” said Randy Fikki, senior pastor of Unity Southeast, who led several Black Lives Matter demonstrations last summer. Police spokeswoman Capt. Leslie Foreman said the department’s policies give supervisors discretion to determine whether to suspend officers and whether that suspension should be paid or unpaid. That is despite a separate policy that says officers charged with a crime related to their use of a department firearm will be suspended, which would apply to DeValkenaere, who is charged in the 2019 shooting of Cameron Lamb in Lamb’s backyard following a traffic incident. Officials said that policy requiring suspension when an officer’s gun is used is under review. DeValkenaere was suspended with pay after the shooting but returned to work in January. He is the only one charged in an incident involving a gun.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: A subsidiary of the company that owns the Yellowstone Club bought an 18,000-acre ranch at the foot of the Crazy Mountains east of Clyde Park and said it has no plans to develop or change the property. The Lone Mountain Land Company announced the purchase of the Crazy Mountain Ranch last week, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The company said in an announcement that it doesn’t intend to develop residential subdivisions or a commercial heliskiing operation on the property. “Lone Mountain Land Company will continue to operate the ranch’s cow-calf operation and guest ranch,” Sam Byrne, managing partner and co-founder at CrossHarbor Capital Partners, said in a release. “We look forward to working with our neighbors, the Clyde Park community, and the Forest Service to be thoughtful stewards of the land and good members of the community.” The potential of residential developments and a heliskiing operation had caused a measure of public concern ahead of the sale, said Erica Lighthiser, deputy director with the Park County Environmental Council and member of the Crazy Mountain Access Project. That portion of Park County isn’t zoned, Lighthiser said, leaving any future developments to the sole discretion of the new owners.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Storms that knocked down trees and power lines across eastern Nebraska over the weekend left more people without electricity than any area storm in years. The Omaha Public Power District said with 188,000 customers losing power after the storms Friday night and early Saturday, it was a larger outage than any storm since June 2008, when 156,000 customers lost electricity. By midday Sunday, fewer than 60,000 OPPD customers remained without power, but utility officials said it could take several days to restore electricity to everyone, according to the Omaha World-Herald. By comparison, the historic snowstorm that pummeled Omaha in October 1997 left 150,000 in the dark. More recently, a Father’s Day tornado in 2017 left about 75,000 customers without power. The utility set another record after this weekend’s storm. Spokeswoman Laura King-Homan said OPPD deployed more workers in the field than ever before when 539 crew members were out Saturday working to restore power.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Driver’s licenses and identification cards are getting a new look and upgraded security features, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said Monday. DMV spokesman Kevin Malone said the agency began rolling out cards at a busy Las Vegas office, and the Reno office is due to begin offering the cards Wednesday. By next month, all 18 DMV offices around the state should have upgraded camera equipment to produce the new cards. They represent the first redesign since 2008, although some modifications were made in 2014. DMV Director Julie Butler said in a statement the new licenses and ID cards have enhanced security features that help protect Nevadans against identity theft and aid law enforcement agencies. Malone said the state currently has more than 2.2 million licensed drivers. The officials said existing licenses and ID cards will remain valid until they expire. Customers will receive the new design at renewal or during other transactions such as a name or address change. Card production fees will remain $3.25, Malone said. Nevada’s “Battle Born” insignia is featured on the front of the license in addition to the year of statehood, 1864.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: An island garden that once inspired one of America’s foremost impressionist painters has been reconstructed on the mainland for a second summer because of the coronavirus pandemic. In the late 1880s, poet Celia Thaxter attracted members of Boston’s literary and artistic societies to her family’s hotel on Appledore Island off the coast of Portsmouth. Artist Childe Hassam kept a studio there and featured Thaxter’s gardens in a series of paintings. The island is now home to the Shoals Marine Laboratory, and hundreds of people visit a recreation of the garden each summer. But the tours have been canceled again this year because of the pandemic. Instead, the garden has been recreated at Prescott Park in Portsmouth. Free guided tours are scheduled for July 16 and 30 and Aug. 6.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state on Monday unveiled a phone app that lets people keep track of their COVID-19 vaccination card digitally. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy announced the app called Docket during a news conference in Trenton. He said it’s not meant to serve as a passport and instead will serve as a backup in case people lose their paper vaccination cards. It’s unclear what the app cost the state to develop, said Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli. She said officials plan to begin allowing people to use the app to track other vaccinations they have, but for now it works just for COVID-19 vaccines. The app is available through Apple and Google Play app stores, the governor said. “To be absolutely clear, this is not a ‘passport,’ ” Murphy said. “Docket is intended solely to give residents easy access to their COVID vaccination record, especially if their vaccination card has been damaged or lost.” Murphy has been reluctant to embrace the idea of vaccine passport, proof of vaccination, in order to enter certain places or take part in certain activities. On Monday, he said he wants to see more vaccine “equity,” particular among African American residents. Objections to passports revolve in part around privacy and security, including how people’s personal information will be stored, and fairness.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The University of New Mexico will continue to encourage that students, faculty and staff get vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to campus in August for the fall semester but no longer plans to require it. University President Garnett Stokes said in a campuswide email that vaccinations are key to stopping the spread of the coronavirus and that the university is working toward a 100% vaccination rate. However, the vaccine remains under emergency use authorization by the federal government, the university noted in a statement Thursday. The school previously proposed a vaccine requirement and posted a draft policy on its website. “After more than a year of mostly remote learning and working, mask mandates and testing,” the university community views its approaching full return to campus “with a sense of optimism and renewed purpose,” the statement issued Thursday said. UNM officials still urge those who are not vaccinated to continue to wear a mask, the statement said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A sinkhole on a Manhattan street collapsed under two parked cars Sunday, prompting renewed criticism of the city’s infrastructure several days after heavy rains caused severe subway flooding. There were no injuries reported after the sinkhole on the Upper West Side left an SUV with its back end stuck and the car behind it tilting forward. “But this yet another reminder: NYC simply must invest more in upgrading our outdated infrastructure,” New York City Council member Mark Levine said on Twitter. Levine posted pictures of the vehicles on Riverside Drive days after widely circulated videos showed water pouring into subway stations following heavy rain Thursday. The vehicles had been removed by Sunday afternoon.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A man who served 26 years in prison for a murder he said he didn’t commit is still seeking a pardon and compensation. Dontae Sharpe told The Raleigh News & Observer on Friday that he wants to be able to support a family that includes his daughter and two grandchildren. He said he also wants to help out his mother after she spent her savings sending him money in prison and trying to prove his innocence. “The monetary part, that was the most difficult part of being released,” Sharpe said. Sharpe was 19 when he was sent to prison for the 1994 murder of 33-year-old George Radcliffe. He maintained his innocence throughout, and the NAACP argued for his release for years. He was released from a Pitt County courtroom in 2019 when a judge ordered a new trial at the end of a hearing. The prosecutor then said she wouldn’t pursue a retrial. Theresa Newman, a lawyer who represented Sharpe and a professor emerita at the Duke University Law School, said that a person who receives a pardon can apply to the state for monetary compensation. It has a cap of $750,000.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: A petition backs the idea of a ban on undocumented immigrants and refugees and the notion of declaring Ward County a Second Amendment “gun sanctuary.” Language on the resolution led by county resident Nicole Engberg offers support “to ban sanctuary cities, illegal immigrants, aliens, refugees in Ward County, North Dakota, and add Ward County, North Dakota, as a Second Amendment gun sanctuary county.” Egeberg said the immigration issue on the southern border is relevant to the county. Undocumented immigrants stress the local law enforcement system, schools and tax dollars, she said at a county commission meeting. “They have no respect for our laws, no respect for our border, and it causes pressure. We have drug trafficking, human trafficking, sex trafficking, amongst many other things,” Engberg said. “We want them removed. We don’t want them brought here illegally. If they want to come here legally, appropriately vetted, they are more than welcome here in the county.” Enberg said about 5,000 people had signed the petition, the Minot Daily News reports. The commission did not object to banning illegal immigration and supporting gun rights, which members pointed out are current law. But commissioners sought more specific resolution language than was included in petitions.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Wind and solar companies hoping to do business in the state will face an additional hurdle, thanks to a bill Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law Monday. Under Senate Bill 52, county commissioners could reject particular wind turbines or solar farms, ban the projects entirely, or carve out portions of the county where those facilities couldn’t be built. The change, which takes effect in 90 days, adds a step for solar and wind companies that their coal and natural gas competitors don’t face. But lawmakers who introduced the bill say companies need to involve local residents – not just a little-known Ohio Power Siting Board – to succeed. Under the new law, project developers must notify county commissioners and trustees at least 90 days before filing with the power siting board. The proposal also adds a commissioner and trustee to the board while it reviews the local project. Opponents of the bill say it singles out renewable energy for unnecessary restrictions. Meanwhile, Ohio lawmakers enacted a law to prevent municipalities from banning natural gas in new construction projects and saved subsidies for the owner of two coal plants. The Ohio Chamber of Commerce and local development arms opposed the changes because they want to encourage renewable energy projects in the state, which can attract other business activity.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Public school teachers could have their teaching licenses suspended for teaching certain concepts about race and racism under new rules approved Monday by the State Board of Education. With just one opposing vote, the board approved emergency rules to comply with a bill approved by the Republican-led Legislature this year that purports to ban so-called critical race theory. The new law prohibits public school teachers of grades K-12 from teaching eight different concepts about race, including that an individual, by virtue of race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously. It also prohibits teaching that any individual should feel discomfort or guilt on account of their race or sex. The Republican authors of the bill said it targeted critical race theory, which is a way of thinking about America’s history through the lens of racism, although there is no mention in the bill of critical race theory, which is not typically taught in K-12 schools. Democrats in the Legislature who opposed the bill argued it was a waste of time and addressed a nonexistent problem. Carlisha Bradley, the only Black member of the board, voted against adopting the rules, saying she believes the new law and the rules are doing a disservice to students and teachers.\n\nOregon\n\nMedford: Sheriff’s deputies in southern Oregon may start arresting people who refuse to heed evacuation orders issued because of a large, growing wildfire that threatens two small towns. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the wildfire grew to about 231 square miles by Sunday afternoon. The blaze, burning in the Fremont-Winema National Forest and on private land north of Sprague River and Beatty, about 290 miles southeast of Portland, was 0% contained. Fire managers on Sunday extended a Level 3 evacuation zone to unincorporated Beatty, with a population of about 120 people. Level 3 evacuations mean residents must leave immediately. Deputies continued to circle the area to ensure people were contacted, said Stacey Todd, a spokesperson for Klamath County Emergency Management. She couldn’t recall a time the sheriff’s office warned of citations or arrests for failing to evacuate during a wildfire.“I think the message has gotten out that this is a very serious fire that is unpredictable and is very high-risk to the area,” Todd said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s Department of Health has reduced the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses that have been administered by about 500,000, saying the numbers were duplicates. The figures, released Friday evening without explanation, also showed an increase of about 60,000 in the number of people counted as fully vaccinated. The numbers include 66 of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. They do not include Philadelphia, which is its own vaccine jurisdiction. For all 67 counties, the percentage of people 18 and over who are vaccinated was 61%, up slightly with the change in data. Asked about the changed figures, a Department of Health spokesperson said agency staff had been working to link both first and second doses to individual residents. As a result, they were removing duplicated data that resulted from providers using software that did not include a unique patient identifier or uploading duplicate data, or from people getting first and second doses from different providers. The data now more accurately reflects the number of people who have received the first of a two-dose vaccine, the spokesperson said. Friday’s data showed just under 11.3 million total vaccine doses, down from Thursday’s figure of 11.8 million. It also showed over 5.5 million people fully vaccinated.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has officially banned the release of large numbers of balloons in a move to protect wildlife. Under a new law signed Friday by Gov. Dan McKee, the state will prohibit anyone from intentionally releasing 10 or more helium or other lighter-than-air balloons outdoors. Supporters say balloon releases are an environmental nuisance and pose a serious threat to birds, marine animals and other wildlife that ingest or become entangled in balloon litter. Violators face a fine of $100 when the new rule takes effect in November. The new law won’t affect hot air balloons, indoor balloon releases, or scientific and weather research.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is asking for public input on whether state-leased Wildlife Management Areas should be open for hunting on Sundays. The Department of Natural Resources has an online survey up until July 28 as well as four public hearings planned across the state over the next two weeks. The 1.2 million acres public land in South Carolina are also used for fishing, hiking, bird-watching and other ways to observe nature. Hunters can use the public land during season, but state law only allows hunting on Sundays on private land. The first of four public hearings on the hunting changes is set for Tuesday at the Clemson Pee Dee Research and Education Center in Florence. There is a meeting Thursday at the Clinton National Guard Armory, on July 19 at the Santee Cooper Auditorium in Moncks Corner, and July 26 at a site that hasn’t been determined in Columbia. All the meetings start at 6 p.m.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: As federal officials debate investing billions of dollars in broadband access, the state is planning to invest $100million as it struggles to extend reliable internet service to every corner of the state. Data suggests many South Dakota schoolchildren and adults who worked from home during the pandemic struggled with subpar access to high-speed internet, particularly in the state’s poorest and least populated counties. Advocates say the “digital divide” across South Dakota and the rest of the U.S. is due largely to two factors: a lack of internet infrastructure in rural areas and relatively high costs that have made broadband unaffordable for many in urban centers. In about half of South Dakota’s counties – 34 of 66 – measured by a Federal Communications Commission study, broadband access is available to at least 88% of residents. Yet in about half of the state measured by Microsoft – 33 of 65 counties – no more than 28% of households actually have high-speed access, a USA TODAY analysis shows. That helps explain why the Legislature and Gov. Kristi Noem earlier this year set aside $100 million, mostly federal pandemic relief money, to help the telecommunications industry build fiber lines and antenna towers in rural areas.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: A federal judge in the state has joined other judges in blocking a Biden administration program designed to redress generations of discrimination against some farmers, saying the federal government has failed to show the U.S. Department of Agriculture discriminates against people of color today. Chief U.S. District Judge Thomas Anderson issued a national injunction that bars the Biden administration from enacting the loan forgiveness plan approved by Congress in March as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. The injunction is the third to result from litigation filed in seven states, including Tennessee, on behalf of white farmers in the past month, according to court records. The administration said it chose to funnel relief to qualifying farmers because of the USDA’s “long history” of discriminating against Black farmers and the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on minorities. White farmers, including Tennessee rancher Rob Holman, are calling it “reverse racism” in litigation filed by conservative legal advocacy groups, including the Southeastern Legal Foundation and Mountain States Legal Foundation. Anderson agreed in his ruling.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Democrats in the Legislature on Monday began bolting for Washington, D.C., and said they were ready to remain there for weeks in a second revolt against a GOP overhaul of election laws, forcing a dramatic new showdown over voting rights in America. One large group was set to leave Austin on private planes before the GOP could pass a voting bill in a special legislative session ordered by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott that began days ago. It was not immediately clear how many of the 67 Democrats in the Texas House of Representatives planned to go, but it was expected to be enough to bring the Legislature to a halt. “This is a now-or-never for our democracy. We are holding the line in Texas,” said Democratic state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer. “We’ve left our jobs; we’ve left our families; we’ve left our homes. Because there is nothing more important than voting rights in America.” By leaving, Democrats would again deny the GOP majority a quorum to pass bills, barely a month after their walkout thwarted the first push for sweeping new voting restrictions in Texas, including outlawing 24-hour polling places, banning ballot drop boxes and empowering partisan poll watchers.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Water managers in the bone-dry state reported last week that 98% of Utah was in extreme or exceptional levels of drought. The state was already 10 inches of precipitation below the “normal” amount expected in a given water year, making it extremely unlikely it would reach its usual count of 27 inches during an average water year, according to the Utah Department of Natural Resources. “Utah’s precipitation is down about 38% this year compared to an average year. It’s extremely unlikely we can make up that deficit between now and the end of the watering year on Sept. 30,” said Brian Stee, executive director of the Utah DNR. “When we consider future patterns, we should not expect an immediate recovery from this extreme drought. We anticipate it will take time, possibly years, to climb out.” In southwestern Utah, water managers had only measured 41% of the precipitation normally expected by this point in the water year. Drought maps produced by the U.S. Drought Monitor showed small pockets of northern Utah were the only places in the state not already at the two worst levels of drought as measured by federal climate criteria, with the entire southwestern section of the state rated as being in “exceptional” drought, the worst category.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: About 40 homeless people who had been scheduled to lose their pandemic-related emergency hotel rooms in the state on July 1 are seeking to be verified as having a disability, allowing them to stay longer. Late last month, a federal court judge signed an agreement extending the emergency housing for two weeks for some people to show they can remain eligible. That came after Vermont Legal Aid sued the state, alleging the changes violate state law and have a restrictive definition of what qualifies as a disability. About 700 people were expected to lose their hotel rooms at the beginning of the month. The state has extended the hotel voucher program 84 days for families with children, the disabled, pregnant women and other vulnerable people, and it gave $2,500 checks to those no longer eligible. Families with children and some disabled households may be able to stay longer. So far, 37 people who were no longer eligible July 1 have attested that they have a disability while they work to get paperwork from a medical provider, Nicole Tousignant of the Vermont Department for Children and Families said Monday. Vermont spent $79 million on the hotel vouchers program, housing up to 2,000 households on some nights, but the program is not financially sustainable, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nBlacksburg: A conservative group is asking a court to temporarily prohibit Virginia Tech from enforcing some of its policies against harassment and discrimination. The Roanoke Times reports the group, called Speech First Inc., has already filed a lawsuit on behalf of three students against the school’s anti-bias policies. Now the group wants a federal judge to temporarily prevent the university from enforcing the policies until he rules on the lawsuit. The group contends that the students hold views that are unpopular on a campus of roughly 35,000 students. Those views include opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement as well as same-sex marriage and abortion. The lawsuit claims Virginia Tech’s policies are overly vague because they forbid “telling unwelcome jokes about someone’s identity” and urging “religious beliefs on someone who finds it unwelcome.” The school has revised one of its policies by clarifying that a ban on speech for “partisan and political purposes” applies only to employees. But Virginia Tech is defending the rest and urged the judge not to grant the group’s request for a preliminary injunction. “It cannot be that Virginia Tech is essentially prohibited in the face of the First Amendment” from having anti-harassment policies, said counsel to the Attorney General Jessica Samuels, who represents university President Tim Sands.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: One day after an investigation found that two of six Seattle police officers violated the law while in Washington, D.C., during the Jan. 6 insurrection, lawyers representing the officers in a related public records case filed a motion to withdraw from that case. The six officers had filed a lawsuit in February against a list of people who had filed public records requests seeking the officers’ identities and information about the investigation by the Office of Police Accountability into their activities while in the nation’s capital. After a judge ordered the release of their identities in March, the officers appealed. Sam Sueoka, a Seattle University law student who was named in the officers’ lawsuit, has asked the Washington Supreme Court to decide the issue. The court will consider that request at the end of July. On Thursday, the OPA released a report on its investigation. It found that at least two of the officers had violated the law and department policy by trespassing at the U.S. Capitol while rioters stormed the building. OPA Director Andrew Myerberg recommended that the two officers be fired. On Friday, the officers’ three lawyers, Kelly Sheridan, Victoria Ainsworth and Kayla Higgins, filed a motion stating their intent to leave the public records case. They did not give a reason but said withdrawal would be effective July 19.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClarksburg: Federal regulators have joined state officials in reviewing lead service lines in the city for elevated levels of the toxin in drinking water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will assist the state Department of Health and Human Resources and the Clarksburg Water System in the review, which was announced July 2, the DHHR said in a news release. Sampling in several homes showed lead levels above a limit set by the EPA. Lead lines were phased out in the 1950s, and it’s unlikely homes built after 1960 would have them. The DHHR is encouraging residents of homes built before 1950 to use bottled water for consumption and have children younger than age 6 evaluated for lead, Dr. Ayne Amjad, the state health officer, said in the statement. The issue of lead service lines was first identified by Bureau for Public Health staff during assessments conducted in the homes of children diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Devil’s Lake State Park, Wisconsin’s most-visited park, is set to get larger. The Wisconsin Natural Resources Board has unanimously approved purchasing a 220-acre property for $1.64 million to add onto the park, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. “It is truly a great potential addition to Devil’s Lake State Park,” Jim Lemke, real estate section chief at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, told the board. “The land is very useful. It’s beautifully wooded with mature hardwoods and has potential of many different opportunities for public use.” The parcel is located on the southwestern edge of the park and could be used for hunting and wildlife watching. It could also be developed into hiking and mountain biking trails, according to a memo on the proposed purchase. The money to purchase the land would come from the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program, which the state uses to purchase new land for parks and recreation areas. Located outside Baraboo and 45 minutes north of Madison, the approximately 9,200-acre Devil’s Lake was created in 1911 and is the third-oldest state park. There were 2.1 million visitors to Devil’s Lake last year, making it Wisconsin’s most popular park.\n\nWyoming\n\nGlenrock: The community is jumping at the chance for a company to build an experimental power source on the edge of town. Before the end of the year, developers of a new type of nuclear power plant will decide which of four Wyoming towns will house their project, and Glenrock wants to be selected, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. During a Wednesday meeting with the heads of TerraPower and Rocky Mountain Power, community leaders listened attentively to the companies’ pitch. Most were already on board with the project. A few safety questions did come up, but Glenrock’s leaders wanted to focus the conversation on logistics – not risk. The town’s coal-fired power plant, Dave Johnston, is set to retire in 2027, taking 191 jobs with it. The Natrium reactor is scheduled to come online the following year, generating an estimated 250 permanent jobs. Its developers intend to establish training programs to help workers in the selected community transition from their current jobs at the coal plant to new roles at the nuclear facility. Glenrock is a town of just 2,600 people; Converse County’s entire population numbers fewer than 14,000. The community’s history is intertwined with that of the energy sector. Many see the nuclear plant not only as a natural transition but a necessary one for their economic survival.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/01/28/inland-empire-warehouses-moving-toward-coachella-valley/9015546002/", "title": "Are Inland Empire warehouses moving toward the Coachella Valley?", "text": "For years, warehouses have proliferated in the Inland Empire.

A study led by University of Alabama at Birmingham is recruiting participants for a program that will screen hundreds of children in Wilcox and Perry counties for signs of hookworm. State health officials took issue with a previous study involving Baylor University that found evidence of hookworm. The parasite was once widespread in the United States and is now a problem mainly in underdeveloped counties. Health officials say poor waste disposal systems and environmental conditions in rural west Alabama put the area at risk for the problem. UAB announced the new program in a statement this week. The work is being funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: Southwest Alaska’s Mulchatna Caribou herd has decreased to less than half its numbers, leaving wildlife officials with suspicions but no clear answers. KYUK-AM reports there were more than 27,000 Mulchatna Caribou three years ago, and the figure is now only 13,500. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game says causes could include the animals trampling their food, heavy predation from wolves and overhunting by humans. Officials say the caribou are roaming more in their western range near the Kuskokwim River and Bristol Bay region, an area with more communities than the eastern range. Fish and game officials say surveys indicate more people are hunting caribou than suggested by the 238 animals listed in 2018 harvest reports. State and federal managers plan to respond with restrictions to conserve the population.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The city will no longer use red-light and speed-enforcement cameras at intersections starting with the new year. A proposal to extend the contract for the cameras beyond Jan. 1 failed by a 4-5 City Council vote last week. Councilman Michael Nowakowski told KJZZ radio he voted against the extension because city staff never supplied him with the information he requested months ago. Phoenix has stationary red-light cameras at 12 intersections in addition to mobile speed-enforcement units that can be moved around school zones. Council briefing materials said the program generated more than $7 million in net income from Sept. 1, 2009, through Sept. 30, 2018, from more than 205,000 complaints filed in the city court about traffic violations.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: All University of Arkansas students are being required to have up-to-date vaccinations in order to attend classes following a mumps outbreak on campus. The state Department of Health on Friday issued a notice telling students they need to be immunized with at least two doses of the mumps vaccine or sit out of class for 26 days. The agency says nine cases of the viral disease have been diagnosed at the Fayetteville school this fall, and other possible cases are being investigated. University spokesman Zac Brown says the school has vaccination records for its roughly 27,000 students and has already contacted the 407 who don’t have current vaccinations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nArroyo Grande: Cal Fire alleges that fast food chain In-N-Out was responsible for a 2017 wildfire in this rural community, according to a lawsuit filed in San Luis Obispo Superior Court. The San Luis Obispo Tribune reports that Cal Fire claims the September 2017 wildfire was caused by a tractor mowing grass on In-N-Out property, saying it was covered in “dry annual grasses and scattered brush, which created a receptive bed of flammable vegetation.” The agency also claims that the tractor was improperly maintained and that the driver allowed the fire to spread. Cal Fire is seeking roughly $1.2 million from the burger chain to recoup costs. The fire burned about 245 acres in four days. In-N-Out did not respond to a request from the Tribune.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A survey of passengers who use the metro area’s regional transit system shows more of them would be willing to see service cuts if it leads to more reliable travel. The Denver Post reports the survey by the Regional Transportation District comes as the agency looks at whether and how to pursue service cuts amid one of its worst labor shortages in its 50-year history. RTD Director Judy Lubow called the situation an “emergency” that’s “just creaming us in terms of status and reputation.” In a survey of 13,000 people, 59% favored a temporary service reduction to better balance bus and train runs with RTD’s employee numbers. The respondents said they’d be willing, on average, to wait up to 18 minutes for a bus or light-rail train.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMystic: A proposal to import five whales to the state has sparked a standoff between animal welfare groups and an aquarium that says the animals will contribute to its research. Mystic Aquarium wants to import the captive-born beluga whales from MarineLand of Canada in Niagara Falls, Ontario. The Connecticut aquarium, where belugas have been a popular attraction for generations, says the acquisition of the whales would enable research that helps protect the species. Animal Welfare Institute and other animal advocates disagree. They say the stress of importation would be too much for the whales, and it would make more sense for the scientists to come to the animals. The importation would require a federal permit, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is taking comments on the permit application until Dec. 2.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: More than 150 people are praying that the city reverses course on a ban that prohibits the display of a Nativity scene on city property. The mostly Catholic protesters gathered Thursday outside City Hall in Rehoboth Beach to ask officials to allow the display. They were joined by the Rev. William Cocco of St. Edmond Catholic Church, who asked city commissioners to let the creche return to its “proper place,” the Rehoboth Bandstand. The city ordered church officials to remove the display last December, saying it hadn’t been given permission to install the display in the first place. The city later announced plans to create an all-inclusive display for 2019. It’s unclear what progress, if any, has been made on that display.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Melania Trump opened the holiday season in the nation’s capital Monday by accepting delivery of the official White House Christmas tree. Members of the U.S. Marine Band played “O Christmas Tree” as a pair of horses named Cash and Ben trotted up the driveway pulling a green carriage that carried an 18 1/ 2 -foot Douglas fir. The towering tree will become the centerpiece of Christmas in the White House Blue Room. The first lady appeared moments later, escorted by a military aide, and smiled, waved and chatted up the top-hatted men holding tight to the reins. She walked around the carriage and paused to look at the tree before posing for photos with the Pennsylvania farmer who donated it, Larry Snyder of Mahantongo Valley Farms in Pitman, Pennsylvania.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Port Richey: No frogs were harmed in the making of a local high school’s science class. J.W. Mitchell High School began using synthetic frogs for educational dissections last Wednesday. Pasco County Superintendent Kurt Browning says it’s the first school in the world to use the technology. The lives of real frogs are being spared at a cost of $150 per synthetic frog. Tampa-based developer SynDaver received funds from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to help create the “SynFrog.” SynDaver says the fake frogs are made of water, fibers and salts and can be reused. Founder and CEO Dr. Christopher Sakezles says the synthetic frogs are also safer because there are no potentially harmful chemicals. PETA says 3 million frogs are killed for classroom use each year.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSocial Circle: A state agency says it has money available to help fund projects that give people a closer view of the state’s wildlife. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources is taking applications for its Wildlife Viewing Grants Program through Jan. 15. The grants award up to $3,000 per project. The agency awarded money to six projects last year, including a viewing scope and platform at a nature center on Jekyll Island and a tower that provides shelter for federally protected migratory birds at Talking Rock Nature Preserve in Pickens County. The Georgia DNR says the goal of the wildlife viewing program is to create a greater appreciation for animals native to Georgia beyond fishing and hunting. A news release says grant winners will be announced by Feb. 21.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A federal transportation agency has awarded the state a $6.5 million grant to purchase new buses for Kauai and Hawaii Island. Kauai and Hawaii county officials say the Federal Transit Administration announced the grant Friday, but it is unclear when the buses would be fully operational. Hawaii County officials say the money would be used to purchase 10 40-foot buses on the Big Island. Officials say the buses would be used on existing and new routes, including from Hilo to South Kohala and over the Daniel K. Inouye Highway. Kauai County officials say an additional three 30-foot buses and three smaller buses would be purchased for Kauai. U.S. Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz says investing in new buses ensures residents have an affordable way to get around.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Forest Service has agreed to complete environmental reviews of 20 water diversions in central Idaho that a conservation group says could be harming imperiled salmon. A U.S. District Court judge on Thursday signed off on the agreement between the Forest Service and Idaho Conservation League involving the water diversions in the Sawtooth Valley. The conservation group says the Forest Service is violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to complete consultations with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries about the diversions. The Forest Service has three years to complete what are called biological assessments on each of the diversions that mostly supply water to homes in the area. The diversions are on tributaries or the Salmon River, which is home to federally protected salmon, steelhead and bull trout.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A planned one-day strike by some 2,200 nurses at the University of Chicago Medical Center has been called off after their union reached an agreement with the hospital. The Chicago Tribune reports that the agreement between the 618-bed hospital and the nurses who have been without a contract since April was reached Saturday morning. The union had planned to strike Tuesday, and the hospital had said it would lock the nurses out for another four days to guarantee replacement nurses a certain amount of work. That’s what happened in September when a one-day strike by nurses was followed by a four-day lockout. The nurses had been seeking lower nurse-to-patient ratios, but the terms of the agreement were not immediately made available.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A foundation is investing up to $50 million to help low-income residents in the capital move up the economic ladder. The Lilly Endowment Inc., based in Indianapolis, says the funding will boost programs and projects aimed at improving residents’ economic footing and move them toward self-sufficiency. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports the endowment is soliciting proposals from not-for-profit groups, including human service agencies, neighborhood groups and churches. The Enhancing Opportunity in Indianapolis grants will range from $50,000 to $10 million. Rob Smith, a senior vice president with the endowment, says an average of 180,000 Indianapolis residents experience poverty each year, and many struggle “to meet even their basic needs.”\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City: Artist Ray “Bubba” Sorensen II recently finished painting his 87th rock in Albia, Iowa, leaving 12 rocks remaining on his Freedom Rock Tour of the state. During the tour, which Sorensen hopes to wrap up by late next year, he honors veterans by painting military-themed murals on large boulders in each of the state’s 99 counties, the Sioux City Journal reports. He has completed rocks in every Northwest Iowa county. In 1999, Sorensen asked permission to paint a large boulder near Menlo. The 60-ton rock had been a popular spot for graffiti. He painted “Thank you veterans for our freedom” and the flag raising at Iwo Jima. After the rock was eventually graffitied over, a group of veterans asked Sorensen if he would go out and paint the same thing for Memorial Day. Instead, he changed the mural. “It just kind of snowballed from there,” Sorensen says.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: Universities in the state are reducing general education requirements to ensure more students can graduate on time and create more room for classes in their majors. Wichita State University became the latest school to slash the numbers of general ed classes their undergraduates are required to take. Schools are hoping students can learn skills such as ethical reasoning from an engineering course by scrapping philosophy and history requirements in favor of specific goals. But KCUR-AM reports that some liberal arts professors warn the change will remove an essential aspect of what a university education offers – a widespread knowledge of the world. Wichita State’s general education cuts were largely spurred by a Kansas Board of Regents mandate to reduce students’ credit hours.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Outgoing Gov. Matt Bevin has appointed three of his staffers to the University of Louisville and University of Kentucky boards of trustees. Scott Brinkman, the governor’s secretary of the executive cabinet, and Bevin’s state budget director, John Chilton, have been appointed to the University of Louisville’s board of trustees. Brinkman is also a former state legislator from Louisville. Chilton, an accountant, is also from Louisville. Bevin also named Bryan Sunderland, his deputy chief of staff, to the University of Kentucky’s board of trustees. Randall J. Bufford, president of Trilogy Health Services, was also named to the U of L board. Bevin named Sheldon McKinney, executive director of the Kentucky Future Farmers of America Foundation, to the Western Kentucky University board of regents. McKinney lives in Fleming County.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Disney movie “Frozen” inspired an assignment for a Louisiana State University class in modeling the marine atmosphere. The question: If the sea froze while the air temperature was well above freezing, could it bring on wintry weather, as it did in the movie after Princess Elsa runs across the ocean and freezes it? The answer was that, under some circumstances, such a change would be possible. Assistant Professor Paul Miller says he got the assignment idea after watching “Frozen” many, many, many times with his 4-year-old daughter. He set the simulations in 1840s Norway, using climate data from a set going back to 1851 – the earliest available.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Taking a cue from Uber and Amazon, two heating oil distributors in the state are stepping up their game by letting consumers order quickly from their phones. The Portland Press Herald reports the first company was Heatable, which is owned by Dead River Co., followed by Order Oil Online. Both distribute in southern Maine. Both Heatable and Order Oil Online are aimed at people who are looking for the lowest prices and quick delivery – not furnace repairs or maintenance. David Simmons, the crew leader of Heatable, says the company serves as a “disruptor” in the marketplace by resetting customer expectations. Kai Nice, president of Order Oil Online, says he plans to drive people to the website primarily with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter campaigns.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Letting a balloon float away would draw a fine of $250 under a bill sponsored by state Sen. Clarence Lam, D-Howard and Baltimore counties. The legislation is similar to a Queen Anne’s County law. Lam says he hopes the bill reduces the amount of waste that ends up in the environment and raises awareness of the need to properly dispose of balloons. He says there would be a $250 civil fine for each act of intentionally releasing a balloon, but no one would go to prison for it because it’s not considered a criminal offense. Lam says the state, unlike in Queen Anne’s County, will not allow biodegradable balloons. Because there is not a definite label that states when a balloon will biodegrade, they are still considered damaging and could affect farms, water and wildlife, he says, calling it a bipartisan issue.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nStow: The state is honoring its best and bravest firefighters this week. State Homeland Security Undersecretary Jeanne Benincasa Thorpe and state Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey will recognize heroic acts of bravery at the 30th annual Firefighter of the Year awards at Mechanics Hall in Worcester on Tuesday. Awards to be given out include the Medal of Honor, Medal of Valor, Group Meritorious Conduct, Excellence in Leadership, and the Norman Knight Award for Excellence in Community Service. Firefighters from departments in Andover, Boston, Everett, Fall River, Fitchburg, Lawrence, North Andover, Revere, Rochester, Rockland, Saugus, Sudbury, Westborough and Worcester will be honored during the ceremony. Worcester firefighter Christopher Roy, who died fighting a house fire last year, will be honored posthumously.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Health officials say the state’s drug overdose deaths declined last year for the first time in several years. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services says the state had 2,599 overdose deaths in 2018. That’s a 3.2% drop from 2017’s 2,686 overdose deaths and the first decline in six years. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state agency’s chief medical executive, calls the decline “a step in the right direction” but says much work remains to be done, including addressing disparities in access to drug treatment. Michigan’s opioid-related overdose deaths fell by 0.8% from 2017’s tally to 2,036 such deaths last year. That decline was largely driven by decreases in the number of deaths due to poisoning by heroin and commonly prescribed painkillers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Democrats say the decision by the Republican leader in the state House of Representatives to join a Washington, D.C.-area government relations firm as its director of public affairs is a conflict of interest. The Star Tribune reports that Stateside Associates of Arlington, Virginia, announced the hiring of Rep. Kurt Daudt on Friday. The Republican from Crown will continue to serve in the Legislature and as GOP caucus leader. Minnesota DFL Chairman Ken Martin called on Daudt to resign from one of the roles, arguing that he is “opening himself up to massive conflicts of interest by working for a lobbying firm” while serving in the Legislature. Daudt told the newspaper he will not be lobbying or working on any Minnesota issues in his new job.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Hardy Middle School now has a mural of the late, prominent author Margaret Walker Alexander. WAPT-TV reports the mural was dedicated last week. Alexander was part of an African American literary movement called the Chicago Black Renaissance. While in Chicago, she was part of the Federal Writers’ Project and the Southside Writers Group. She and her family moved to Jackson, where she was a literature professor from 1949 to 1979. She was the director of the Institute for the Study of the History, Life, and Culture of Black People and organized several conferences that were the first of their kind. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at the mural dedication that Alexander used her words to bring beauty and light. She died in 1998.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The Episcopal Diocese of Missouri has elected an openly gay man as its next leader. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the Rev. Deon Johnson will replace Bishop George Wayne Smith upon Smith’s retirement next spring. The election was held over the weekend at Christ Church Cathedral in downtown St. Louis. Preaching there Sunday, the Rev. Kathie Adams-Shepherd said the Episcopal Church “has not always been a safe space” for all, but a “new season is ahead.” Johnson is rector of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Brighton, near Detroit. He and his husband have two children. He says he has a passion for “social justice and inclusion.” The Episcopal Diocese of Missouri has about 11,500 active members who live in the eastern half of the state.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Yellowstone National Park officials report significant progress in reducing the number of unwanted lake trout in Yellowstone Lake. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports that the National Park Service says Yellowstone and contract crews culled 282,960 fish this year from the lake. The total is smaller than last year and the year before that, signaling a decline in the overall number of lake trout. That’s good news for Yellowstone cutthroat trout, which suffered a major decline after the detection of the nonnative lake trout 25 years ago. More than 3.1 million fish have been removed in the effort to help bolster native cutthroat trout in the lake. But a panel of experts told the park in May that it would need at least another five years of suppression work.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission is releasing rooster pheasants at 14 wildlife management areas in time for the Thanksgiving weekend. The 14 areas are Powder Creek (Dixon County), Oak Valley (Madison County), Wilkinson (Platte County), George Syas (Nance County), Sherman Reservoir (Sherman County), Pressey (Custer County), Cornhusker (Hall County), Kirkpatrick Basin North (York County), Branched Oak (Lancaster County), Yankee Hill (Lancaster County), Arrowhead (Gage County), Hickory Ridge (Johnson County), Twin Oaks (Johnson County) and Rakes Creek (Cass County). The pheasant season runs through Jan. 31. Permits, including the nonresident two-day hunt permit, may be purchased online.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A team of school police motorcycle officers is getting attention not just with tickets but with its posts on social media. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the school zone enforcement unit dubbed the “Fab Five” is racking up traffic stops while providing comedic commentary that might include photos of offending cars (emojis cover license plates), hashtags, memes and humor geared to an extremely online crowd. One recent post included “#JankMachine #MoreSqueaksThanAPetShop.” No one’s spared – not the Review-Journal photographer ticketed for speeding in a school zone on the way to cover the story, and not the school bus driver whose citation prompted the hashtag “#SchoolBusTED.” The crackdown is noticeable. Last school year, the unit cited 3,600 drivers for traffic violations. Just three months into the current year, it’s on pace to about double that number.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Another turkey will live free, not die, after a successful pardon plea at the Statehouse. In his third such request, Gov. Chris Sununu asked the Executive Council on Monday to spare the life of a 2-year-old, 18-pound female turkey named Joanna, noting that while the state abolished the death penalty this year, it doesn’t apply to turkeys. The council’s vote was unanimous, with Councilor Mike Cryans joking that he had no choice given the way the bird was staring at him. Joanna, raised at Birch Rise Farm in Sanborton, will join last year’s pardon recipient, Brooke, at Crotched Mountain School. Two years ago, the lucky pardon recipient was named Hale, after Sarah Josepha Hale, the New Hampshire native known as the mother of Thanksgiving.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy says the state has made a deal to buy a 1,400-acre farm in order to protect endangered species. The Democrat announced the deal Monday. The price the Department of Environmental Protection paid to Atlantic City Electric, which owns the farm, is confidential until the deal closes next month. Known as Holly Farm in Millville, Cumberland County, the property sits between two rivers federally designated as “wild and scenic.” Murphy says the farm has the “largest concentration of endangered species” in the state, and the land will help mitigate climate change. The DEP says a rare plant called the joint-vetch is on the property, along with other threatened and endangered species. The DEP says it doesn’t disclose their locations to protect them.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A top official with the state’s court system says bail reforms are working, and the state is moving in the right direction. Artie Pepin, director of the Administrative Office of the Courts, appeared Monday in Santa Fe before a panel of state lawmakers. His testimony comes as critics contend the voter-approved system has allowed for the release of violent and dangerous offenders. Pepin disputed those claims, pointing to a new study by the University of New Mexico’s Institute for Social Research that shows the majority of people released pending trial will show up for subsequent court hearings and aren’t committing new crimes. The researchers reviewed the cases of nearly 6,400 defendants over 21 months. Pepin says the study shows bail reforms are not to blame for Albuquerque’s high crime rates.\n\nNew York\n\nRochester: An intruder didn’t count on an 82-year-old woman living alone being an award-winning bodybuilder with nerves of steel. Willie Murphy tells WHAM she was getting ready for bed Thursday at her home in Rochester when a man pounded on the door and said he needed an ambulance. Murphy called police but wouldn’t open the door. Then the man broke in. She says she clobbered him with a table, poured shampoo in his face and was beating him with a broom when police arrived. The man was sent to a hospital. Police tweeted a selfie with Murphy, calling her “tough as nails.” Murphy works out almost daily at a Rochester gym and says she can deadlift 225 pounds.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Despite bouts of rain that fell in Haywood County over the weekend, the Cold Mountain Fire continues to burn, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Adrianne Rubiaco says. According to National Weather Service meteorologist Doug Outlaw, 1 to 1.5 inches of rain fell Saturday in southern Haywood County, in the vicinity of Cold Mountain. The fire was first detected at 3 a.m. Thursday on the summit of the iconic mountain in the Shining Rock Wilderness area of Pisgah National Forest, according to the Forest Service. As of Monday morning, it was considered 15% contained. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The entire 18,000-acre Shining Rock Wilderness area about 30-35 miles southwest of Asheville, including all 53 miles of hiking trails, remains closed to the public, Rubiaco says.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An 18-week-old turkey got an official Thanksgiving pardon from Gov. Doug Burgum on Monday. Lilly was brought to the Capitol by North Dakota Turkey Federation President David Rude. He says the 18-pound turkey was raised on organic feed at his farm near Tolna. As part of the annual tradition, the governor pardoned the bird from being Thanksgiving dinner. The annual event also benefits charity. The Turkey Federation is donating a dozen frozen turkeys each to the Heaven’s Helpers Soup Cafe and the Abused Adult Resource Center, both in Bismarck. North Dakota isn’t a big turkey producer. Nine farms in the state produce about a million birds each year.\n\nOhio\n\nCanton: The Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission says it is now providing free, reliable public Wi-Fi inside all 14 service plazas along the toll road. It says the upgrade replaces an inconsistent patchwork of systems that had been provided by food vendors at those stops along the 241-mile roadway across northern Ohio. Director Ferzan Ahmed says the new system offers seamless Wi-Fi access even at service plazas in more remote areas. The commission says the contract cost nearly $1.9 million, including Wi-Fi and 24-hour customer support for five years, plus equipment, installation and configuration. The project also included network connectivity improvements for turnpike operations, such as toll plazas and maintenance buildings. Agile Network Builders will manage and support the Wi-Fi system.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Health Care Authority has hired a consultant to help devise a state Medicaid program as an alternative to Medicaid expansion. The Oklahoman reports the OHCA finalized a contract last week with Michigan-based Health Management Associates Inc. for up to $1.49 million during the next year to develop a plan. OHCA CEO Kevin Corbett said Gov. Kevin Stitt is looking for an experienced consultant to advise him on alternatives to Medicaid expansion, which Stitt has opposed. Last month, supporters of Medicaid expansion turned in about 313,000 signatures on petitions calling for a statewide vote next year to expand Medicaid coverage in Oklahoma to adults ages 18 to 65 whose income does not exceed 133% of the federal poverty level. An estimated 200,000 Oklahomans currently can’t afford health insurance.\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: The carcass of a giant blue whale that’s been submerged off the Oregon coast for more than three years is being hauled to the surface so it can be reassembled, studied and put on public display. Oregon State University said Friday that the dead whale washed ashore near Gold Beach in 2015. It’s extremely rare for a blue whale to wash ashore intact, as the creatures can be the length of two school buses. Scientists removed 58 tons of its flesh and then placed the bones in the water off Newport so scavengers could pick them clean. The university says the 365 bones were brought back to land Thursday, including 18-foot-long mandibles and a skull weighing 6,500 pounds. The skeleton’s reassembly will take a year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State lawmakers, judges and top executive branch officials will collect another annual salary increase, with the governor passing $200,000 and rank-and-file lawmakers passing $90,000. Increases for 2020 will be 1.9%, a figure tied by law to the year-over-year regional change in consumer inflation. The boost takes effect Dec. 1 for lawmakers and Jan. 1 for judicial and executive branch officials. Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Saylor is the highest paid, pulling down a $4,000 raise to just above $221,000. Gov. Tom Wolf’s salary will rise about $3,800 to almost $202,000, although he donates it to charity. Both are among the nation’s highest. Most lawmakers, the nation’s third-highest paid, will see increases of $1,725 to about $90,300 in base pay. They also receive per diems, pensions and health benefits. Lawmakers in leadership posts will top out at $141,000.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A Christopher Columbus statue has been vandalized for a second time in recent weeks. The statue’s pedestal was splashed overnight with what appeared to be red paint. Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza’s office said Monday that city workers had already cleaned it, and police are investigating. The statue was splashed with red paint Oct. 14, when the U.S. holiday named for one of the first Europeans to reach the Americas was being celebrated. A sign that said “stop celebrating genocide” was leaned against the pedestal. It was one of several Columbus statues vandalized nationwide. Elorza said then that he’d consider moving the statue from the city’s Elmwood neighborhood to the largely Italian American Federal Hill neighborhood. The Democrat wants the city to form a committee to review commemorative works, like the Columbus statue.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAnderson: A judge has ruled a school board member couldn’t cancel his resignation by sending another email three days later. Anderson County School District 2 Trustee Stu Shirley sent an email to the board saying he was resigning immediately May 14 after a meeting over whether to buy out the superintendent’s contract. Shirley sent another email three days later saying he rescinded his resignation. But the board split 3-3 on a vote whether to let Shirley back on the board, and a lawsuit was filed. Judge Cordell Maddox ruled against Shirley, saying the board removed his photo, biography and email from its website immediately, showing the intent of the members.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Some tribes in the state are laying the groundwork for residents to begin growing hemp in the next year. The 2018 Farm Bill allows tribes to implement their own hemp programs separate from the state. While Gov. Kristi Noem and the Legislature continue their stalemate over legalizing hemp, tribes have been moving quickly to adopt hemp ordinances, create committees to oversee their hemp programs and submit hemp plans to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval. The Flandreau Santee Sioux and Oglala Sioux tribes have already submitted their hemp plans to the USDA. Some tribes, such as the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, are still educating themselves about hemp and haven’t yet formally voted on creating a hemp program.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: More than 40 insurance companies are suing the federal government over its handling of a 2016 wildfire that killed 14 people and destroyed or damaged more than 2,500 buildings in Sevier County. The companies are seeking more than $450 million for claims they paid after high winds swept flames from a wildfire in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park into Gatlinburg and its surrounding areas. Five lawsuits filed last week in federal court in Knoxville claim National Park Service officials violated their own policies by letting the blaze burn despite prolonged drought and predicted high winds. It says they also failed to monitor the fire or warn residents of the danger. The park faces a separate lawsuit by victims of the fire.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Central Texas could be on pace for a ninth straight year of record-setting home sales, according to new data from the Austin Board of Realtors. Real estate agents sold 2,721 homes across the region last month, the board said in its latest home sales report. That’s the most for any October on record and a 17% jump over October 2018’s volume, the board said. The latest numbers bolster the chances that the five-county Austin region could end 2019 with sales at an all-time high, said Kevin Scanlan, the board’s president. In addition to October’s home sales tally for the Austin region, several other records were shattered last month. The median home sales price in the region was $327,500, the highest on record for any October and a 7.4% increase over October 2018.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Wildlife officials say the number of reported human encounters with black bears in the state has almost doubled since last year. The Daily Herald reports the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources has received 53 reports statewide of incidents involving black bears since Nov. 7, and two involved physical contact with a person. Wildlife officials say there were 27 reports in 2018 and more in 2017. Officials say most of the reported incidents occurred between Salt Lake City and Santaquin, including in northern Zion National Park. Officials say the increased sightings could be due to the increased number of bears in the state over the past decade, but it doesn’t indicate an upward trend. Officials urge campers and canyon residents to secure food and stay informed with safety tips online.\n\nVermont\n\nMiddlebury: Local high school students are seeking a patent for an invention they think will help the maple syrup industry. Mynbc5.com reports the invention that measures sap flow was created by technical education students at the Hannaford Career Center in Middlebury. The device measures the flow of maple tree sap moving from trees through plastic tubing to a collection site. The students say it helps to determine if tubing is clogged or frozen. Maple syrup is created by boiling down sap. The Lemelson-MIT program has awarded the team a $10,000 grant to refine the device. The students have met with a manufacturer and with University of Vermont researchers, who their faculty adviser says were encouraging.\n\nVirginia\n\nLorton: A new museum honoring the women’s suffrage movement is set to open early next year. The Lucy Burns Museum is scheduled to open in January to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote. The museum will present the story of 91 years of prison history and the imprisonment of suffragists who were arrested in 1917 for picketing the White House for the women’s right to vote. The Workhouse Arts Center funded, designed and renovated the new museum, restoring a decrepit prison building vacated in 2001. The museum is scheduled to open to the public Jan. 25. A grand opening celebration is scheduled for May 9.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Officials say it’s safe to eat squid caught in Puget Sound. KOMO-TV reports King County officials recently tested squid from the sound for metals and other contaminants for the first time in two decades. King County officials say the results show it’s safe to eat Puget Sound squid for eight to 12 meals a month. Jenee Colton with the King County Department of Natural Resources says pollution in the sound is contaminating fish. But squid doesn’t have a lot of fat, which means that it doesn’t store a lot of contaminants like other seafood. Dave McBride with the Washington State Department of Health says contaminant levels in squid are low. He says squid is a good choice for consumers and anglers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFayetteville: Sportsmen’s groups say they are not happy that they could lose about 4,800 acres of hunting land if the New River Gorge National River is designated a national park and preserve. The Register-Herald reports the proposal by U.S. Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Joe Manchin would designate about 64,000 acres as a national preserve, with hunting and fishing allowed. The National Park area would consist of a little less than 8,000 acres, with hunting restricted. Some of that land already has hunting restrictions, but more than half does not. West Virginia Wildlife Federation President Jerod Harmon tells the paper the group will not support additional restrictions on hunters, anglers or trappers. The senators say a national park designation will boost tourism.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A federal report shows that the state’s job growth dropped dramatically in the first half of 2019, although economists say there’s little cause for concern. The U.S. Department of Labor says the state had 2,945,000 nonfarm jobs through June, up 9,340 from the same period last year. That lagged well behind the year-over-year increases for every June since the recession ended a decade ago. From June 2017 to June 2018, Wisconsin added 27,000 jobs. The previous year, the state added 35,000. Dennis Winters, chief economist for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, says job growth has slowed nationally and in many other states. He says a key reason is that unemployment continues to be low, at 3.3% in Wisconsin in October and 3.6% nationally. Winters says many business owners would expand if they had the workforce.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: New rules calling for disciplinary action against Republicans who break from the state party leadership’s views have exposed a rift between state and county GOP leaders. The new rules come after some county party leaders, such as Natrona County GOP Chairman Joe McGinley, criticized the state party’s actions. The Casper Star-Tribune reports members of the party’s state central committee approved the resolutions during a meeting in Lusk last weekend. The committee rejected proposals by Natrona County GOP officials seeking to protect free speech. The resolutions say the First Amendment “does not supersede the conduct and expression within the confines of a private organization.” They also say that violating the party’s principles, bylaws or rules of order “could subject a fellow Republican to a disciplinary committee review or disciplinary action.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/media/2019/08/01/gannett-gatehouse-media-merger-talks-digital-journalism/1867476001/", "title": "Gannett, GateHouse Media talks: Does digital future hinge on deal?", "text": "When the Times Herald-Record lands on Jim Ottaway Jr.’s doorstep in New Paltz, New York, it’s a daily reminder of what once was.\n\nMemories flood back of the newspaper his family once owned in Middletown, New York. It was a time when newspapers thrived in an environment unchallenged by the disruptive forces of online news, social media and smartphones.\n\nFor about a decade, his family chronicled Middletown's story, taking on important local issues, celebrating community moments, keeping a watchful eye on government and building the company's reach and influence before selling it to Dow Jones in 1970. The paper ultimately was acquired by GateHouse Media.\n\nNow, GateHouse – operating under the ownership of New Media Investment Group (NEWM) – and USA TODAY owner Gannett Co. (GCI) are said to be considering a deal that would create the largest American media company through its combination of online and print readership.\n\nThe proposed consolidation comes at a time when news providers, particularly on the local level, face daunting challenges for survival. Analysts say the merger could provide broader national scale for the new company, along with potential cost savings, that could buy longevity and strengthen its position to compete with Google and Facebook for critical digital ad dollars.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nDeal talks:Gannett reportedly in talks to combine with GateHouse Media\n\nMNG board members rejected:Gannett board members reelected\n\nThe combined company would operate more than 260 daily news operations in local markets across the United States – more than any other U.S. news publisher – as well as USA TODAY. And it would vie for claiming the largest online audience nationally of any news provider.\n\nOttaway said he’s rooting for the journalism industry to succeed, and he recognizes that strategic alliances may be a key to the survival of community journalism. He’s concerned about the effect of the industry’s decline on American democracy. He remembers being a young reporter for his family’s paper, hustling between government meetings to provide the type of public service and watchdog reporting that he believes is vital to communities and is the lifeblood of journalism.\n\n“Most hand-wringing about journalism is worrying about big-city newspapers,” he said. “I worry about the … local daily newspapers that are struggling to survive.”\n\nBuying time\n\nFaced with the loss of ad dollars to companies like Google and Facebook, many news companies have been gasping for air. Newspapers lost about 57% of their advertising and circulation revenue and about 49% of their weekday print circulation from 2000 to 2018, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nThe biggest risk to media companies is that revenue contracts until they don’t have the cash to maintain significant news operations, as they continue to work on strategies to deal with industry challenges.\n\nGannett’s revenue fell to $2.92 billion in 2018 from $3.15 billion a year earlier.\n\nAt GateHouse, revenue rose in its most recent fiscal year to $1.53 billion from $1.34 billion a year earlier. However, it increased primarily because of acquisitions, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nGannett owns USA TODAY and more than 100 local news operations in the United States, including the Detroit Free Press, Arizona Republic, Indianapolis Star and Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The news operations work collaboratively on journalism efforts as the USA TODAY Network.\n\nGateHouse owns 156 daily publications, including the Austin American-Statesman in Texas, Columbus Dispatch in Ohio, Florida's Palm Beach Post and the Oklahoman, as well as many smaller publications.\n\nKen Doctor, a media analyst at Newsonomics, a website and brand where he publishes analysis of the news industry’s economics, said the two news organizations may need to team up to shed overlapping costs and give themselves more time to pursue financial stability through reader-driven revenue. He said the organizations need to find ways to invest in journalism efforts to attract readers and cash.\n\n\"That's what's needed in terms of actually turning their fortunes around,\" he said.\n\nGannett declined to comment for this story. GateHouse has not responded to requests seeking comment.\n\nAs they search for alternative revenue sources – through digital marketing services, for example, and additional online subscriptions – Gannett and GateHouse must answer to shareholders. In the 12-month period leading up to May 30, when reports first emerged that the companies were in talks to combine, Gannett shares declined about 24%, while stock in New Media Investment Group, which operates GateHouse, declined about 39%.\n\nThis deal might make sense to give both companies time for that search, said Chuck DelGrande, a Chicago-based managing director in the tech, media and telecommunications group of investment bank Alantra, who has decades of experience in the news industry.\n\nDelGrande said “the holy grail” for Gannett and GateHouse would be to get big enough to “live to fight another day,” giving them sufficient time to continue to invest in a digital transformation.\n\nWall Street may agree. As of the close of trading on July 31, New Media Investment Group’s stock was up 20% since May 30 to $10.77, while Gannett’s stock was up 35% to $10.25.\n\nGoogle, Facebook duopoly\n\nGoogle and Facebook, which critics have called a “duopoly” because of their grip on digital advertising and data, have controlled an estimated 52% of digital display advertising revenue in 2019, according to eMarketer, which provides companies with research and analysis on digital advertising and marketing.\n\nBut there’s still room for news companies to compete with them, said Lauren Fisher, principal analyst at eMarketer.\n\n“For advertisers, the reality is the duopoly offers great scale, they offer great targeting, they offer great measurement,” she said. “But sometimes that’s not enough. And it’s often not enough when advertisers are looking for very specific audiences. They’re looking for very specific types of branding opportunities and branding associations, which I do believe some of the newspapers still can provide.”\n\nFacebook, Google, Amazon, Apple:Is Big Tech headed for a big breakup?\n\nIn an online world littered with misinformation – such as intentionally misleading news stories, false memes and fabricated video – trust is currency, and local news companies can capitalize on their reputations.\n\n“There’s that legacy, there’s that reputation, and I think for a lot of advertisers and brands there’s still a lot to be gained by having that positive association with some of these brands,” Fisher said.\n\nWhat’s more, national brands may welcome the chance to work with a combined Gannett-GateHouse because the newly combined company would provide a central funneling point for placing ads, said Jaime Spencer, who leads the media strategy group at research and consulting firm Magid.\n\n“There have been, quite frankly, frustrations from national advertisers for a long time about the differences in the models of different print organizations, in terms of how they bill, how they’re structured, their workflow,” said Spencer, who formerly served as general manager of Gannett’s Iowa City Press-Citizen.\n\n“Bringing this level of scale could answer a lot of those questions for advertisers and create a higher degree of consistency so that they can buy more national advertising and inserts in a more consistent fashion and actually improve the profits and improve the return from their perspective.”\n\nGatehouse makes a move\n\nIt was little surprise that a potential deal involving Gannett emerged. After the company defeated a hostile takeover attempt by hedge fund-owned MNG Enterprises in May, industry observers agreed that more attempts at consolidation were just a matter of time. Gannett is said to have considered other deals, including a tie-up with Tribune Publishing Co., whose holdings include the Chicago Tribune.\n\nWhat caught some industry observers off guard was the prospect of GateHouse, the smaller company by revenue and stock market value, acquiring Gannett, the larger of the two. Gannett’s market capitalization is currently about $1.17 billion, compared with New Media Investment Group's roughly $652 million.\n\n'Patient capital'?:SoftBank group acquires major stake in Uber\n\nWhat GateHouse brings to the table is backers with deep pockets who might be willing to finance the deal, which could be difficult for Gannett to pull off on its own, DelGrande said.\n\nGateHouse owner New Media Investment Group is operated by Fortress Investment Group, which is owned by Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank. With more than $53 billion in assets as of March 31, SoftBank has the wherewithal to make long-term bets. For example, the company has made heavy investments on self-driving cars, which are years away from turning a profit.\n\nWhile Gannett, based in McLean, Virginia, could theoretically turn the tables and make an offer to buy GateHouse, based in Pittsford, New York, Gannett would have to line up independent financing to do so since the company’s cash balance at the end of the first quarter was only $89.4 million, according to a quarterly filing with the SEC.\n\nWith net debt of about $211 million already, as of the end of the first quarter, Gannett would likely have to take on significant new debt to buy GateHouse. It’s unlikely Gannett would do so because it could potentially compromise the combined company’s ability to “do future investment along the lines of what’s required” to diversify its business model, DelGrande said.\n\nGannett has taken significant steps in recent years to add digital revenue by broadening its assets through businesses like ReachLocal, a marketing services provider, and data-based business listings adviser SweetIQ. GateHouse has made similar moves through a division called UpCurve, which provides marketing services to small businesses.\n\nBoth companies will need to do more, together, in that direction, DelGrande said.\n\n“You’ve got to come up with ways to increase revenue in order for it ultimately to win – and this is where the patient capital comes into play,” he said, referring to the potential Fortress-SoftBank backing.\n\nTime to invest\n\nIf they combine, Gannett and GateHouse must balance the need for cost cuts with the need to invest in journalism efforts, said Jim Friedlich, CEO of the Lenfest Institute for Journalism, a nonprofit that promotes local journalism innovation and owns the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\n“There is understandable rationale for this deal including the potential for meaningful cost savings and revenue synergies in a very tough environment for local news,” Friedlich said in an email. “Bigger is not necessarily better, nor is it necessarily bad. If these savings are used to reinvest in local newsrooms and the communities they serve, then we should all applaud.”\n\nThat may be the only way for Gannett and GateHouse to continue building their digital audiences.\n\nTo be sure, Gannett has much larger digital readership. Gannett’s USA TODAY Network averaged just under 127 million monthly unique visitors in the first six months of 2019, compared with just over 20 million at GateHouse, according to audience tracker Comscore. If combined, the new company’s audience would rival top-ranked CNN Network’s 146 million monthly uniques.\n\nBoth Gannett and GateHouse have been making progress attracting paid digital subscribers to make up for the loss of print subscribers in recent years.\n\nGannett's digital-only subscriptions rose 39% year-over-year to 538,000 in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nGateHouse’s digital-only subscriptions rose 44% to 174,000 over the same period.\n\n“Subscription revenue is one of the biggest levers, and there is potential there. The challenge is with so many sources to get information these days, the bar for paying is higher than ever,” Magid’s Spencer said. “And the only way you’re going to substantively drive increases in those subscriptions is by delivering a level of value I can’t get anywhere else.”\n\nTo build paid online readership, Gannett and GateHouse need to pursue a “reader-first” model that favors stories that prompt readers to revisit and subscribe, said Michael Silberman, senior vice president of strategy at subscription commerce and tech provider Piano.\n\n“For those audience members who you do have a relationship with, what are the stories that are getting them to come back and engage or, even more so, volunteer information and pull out their credit card?” said Silberman, a former general manager of digital media at New York Media, the parent company of New York magazine.\n\nCost cuts are important, but investing in newsgathering may be key to growing the digital subscriber base, Doctor said.\n\n“Without substantial reinvestment at the same time, this is going to end poorly,” he said.\n\nGannett has invested in investigative reporting across its USA TODAY Network, expanding the impact and frequency of that work on both the national and local level while also amplifying other areas such as video storytelling and podcasts. USA TODAY’s national investigative team has tripled in size, for instance, to more than 20 journalists. They work closely with local investigative reporters and editors employed throughout the USA TODAY Network. GateHouse similarly has launched an investigative group of 30 reporters, editors and producers.\n\nFriedlich said Gannett and GateHouse “seem compatible” from a corporate culture and business standpoint.\n\n“Like Gannett, Gatehouse is a highly efficient and cost-conscious operation but not a slash-and-burn cost-cutter,” he said. “Hopefully both organizations recognize that there is an irreducible minimum in providing their communities with the local news resources they need and deserve.”\n\nOttaway, whose family once owned GateHouse's Times Herald-Record, said the stakes are high for Gannett and GateHouse to get this right.\n\nWithout local news organizations, “suddenly you don’t know why your taxes went up, why your local school isn’t doing a good job for your kids, when they’re going to fix the potholes on your street,\" he said.\n\n\"Most people don’t realize how dangerous this is to our democracy.”\n\nHe said he understands the rationale for the deal.\n\n“I think if they can find some kind of savings from joining together and keep the papers going for longer, that’s a good thing,” he said. “Whether they can, I don’t know.”\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/01/16/wilmington-nc-hotel-new-apartments-housing-crisis-new-hanover/9116776002/", "title": "Budgetel Inn on Market Street in Wilmington to see new apartments", "text": "Developers are moving forward with plans to bring more than 230 apartments to a Market Street hotel once deemed a \"nuisance\" property by the city of Wilmington.\n\nCalifornia-based Vivo Investment Group purchased the Budgetel Inn and the 7.7-acre site surrounding it for $11 million in December, according to New Hanover County property records.\n\nLater that month, the company submitted plans for the project, located at 4903 Market St., to the city of Wilmington.

Liz Cheney’s supporters say her reelection hopes were doomed on January 13, 2021, when a week after the insurrection at the Capitol, she and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach former President Donald Trump.\n\nEverything since that day – Cheney’s role on the House select committee investigating the insurrection; her ads featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, eviscerating Trump; her speeches attempting to steer the GOP away from Trump’s influence – only served Harriet Hageman’s victory in Wyoming’s primary for its lone House seat on Tuesday.\n\nCheney’s ouster caps a summer in which Trump has purged the GOP of many of his critics, while elevating candidates – including Hageman – who have parroted his lies about widespread election fraud. Trump-aligned candidates have won primaries for governor in swing states such as Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and Senate in Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Candidates backed by the former President have positioned themselves to take over the election machinery in a series of key states if they win in November.\n\nPrimaries in recent months have also brought into focus the role a handful of prominent Republicans, including Cheney and former Vice President Mike Pence, are seeking to play in moving the GOP beyond Trump and his election denialism.\n\nBut Wyoming’s results on Tuesday demonstrated the long odds those Trump critics face in a party in which the former President remains the most dominant figure and is teasing a third run for the White House in 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Cheney following her primary loss, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to divulge the contents of the conversation. Bloomberg was first to report the call.\n\nCheney attempted to assemble a coalition of Democrats, independents and moderate and anti-Trump Republicans – many of them ideological opponents of the neoconservative congresswoman before the last 19 months – to save her seat. Her campaign sent information to registered Democrats in Wyoming about how to change their party registration, and in interviews across the state in the lead-up to the election, a number of Democrats did say they were voting for Cheney.\n\nBut the Cowboy State’s electorate is almost entirely Republican. Wyoming has more than 215,000 registered Republicans compared to just 36,000 registered Democrats, according to data from the secretary of state’s office. That’s a drop of about 15,000 registered Democrats from early 2021, but the pool of party-switchers, along with a fall-off of more than 3,000 independent voters who likely became Republicans, was nowhere near large enough to save Cheney from defeat in a Republican Party that had turned against her.\n\n“I think she stood up for what she believes in,” said John Grant, a Republican who cast his ballot for Cheney, even though he suspected she would fall short. “It took a lot of courage to stand against the Republican Party and Donald Trump.”\n\n‘Uneasy from the beginning’\n\nThe roots of Cheney’s loss were planted long before Tuesday’s primary. And in some cases, the seeds were planted during the factional battles within the Wyoming GOP that date back to the tea party era, when Cheney was still a resident of Virginia.\n\nThe state’s GOP, with no real competition from Democrats, has divided into two factions, with a more moderate establishment wing butting heads with a more conservative faction that has increasingly wrested away control.\n\nThe establishment wing retains some power in Wyoming. Gov. Mark Gordon, a part of that wing, won Tuesday. But the conservative faction has seized control of the state Republican Party and many of its local organizations.\n\n“In Wyoming, we don’t necessarily embrace the idea of a big tent,” Wyoming GOP Chairman Frank Eathorne said on Fox earlier this year.\n\nWyoming Republicans’ reservations about Cheney were first evident in 2016, when she won her House seat after winning just 39% of the vote in the GOP primary against a fractured field. She was cast as too close to the establishment by some rivals, and as a carpetbagger by others – including Tim Stubson, a former state lawmaker who now supports Cheney.\n\nBut, she was by far the best-known candidate in the race thanks to the decade her father spent representing Wyoming in Congress prior to becoming secretary of defense and later, vice president.\n\nCheney had coasted to reelection since then, largely because she had not broken with conservatives on major issues. Stubson said she was on course to do so again, until the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, when Cheney became a leading critic of Trump’s actions and defender of the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nThe makings for a divorce from Cheney were immediately evident. Though Wyoming’s GOP has been fractured by warring factions, one thing that has broadly united those factions is support for Trump. He won Wyoming in 2020 by 43.3 percentage points over Biden – Trump’s largest margin of victory anywhere in the nation.\n\n“Yes, there may have been an undercurrent there of anti-Liz sentiment, but there is no way she would have had any trouble getting elected,” Stubson said.\n\n“Her relationship with that portion of the party has been uneasy from the beginning, and they probably never totally embraced her because she has been the definition of an establishment Republican. But she was right on the policies,” he said. “In my mind, it’s a sort of binary issue: If she votes for impeachment, it doesn’t matter what she does afterward.”\n\nVoters say Cheney was too focused on Trump\n\nWhile Trump’s shadow loomed large over the race, conversations with voters across Wyoming over the last week often came across with a sense of disappointment in Cheney, more than a burning sentiment of anger. Several people said they felt Cheney devoted far more time on national issues – to the detriment of her focusing on energy and natural resource priorities of critical importance to the state.\n\n“I want Wyoming to be protected and I don’t feel Liz is doing that job,” said Jenille Thomas, who lives in the coal-mining town of Rock Springs in southwestern Wyoming.\n\nFor many Republican voters in Wyoming, though, it was Cheney’s vote to impeach Trump that spurred them to action.\n\nEsther Egan, a 68-year-old who cleans houses and lives in Jackson, said she voted for Hageman because Cheney “bailed on us when we need her the most.”\n\n“They can say whatever they want about Trump, but he did a damn good job. And then she turns tail,” Egan said. “She’s with Nancy Pelosi.”\n\nCatherine Norsworthy, a 68-year-old homemaker in Jackson, said she switched from being an unaffiliated voter to a Republican to vote for Hageman, citing Trump’s endorsement of her.\n\n“I’m not in favor of the January 6 hearings at all,” she said. “I didn’t like her voting against Trump. I’m very pro-Trump. I listen to him.”\n\nU.S. Representatives Liz Cheney (R-WY), Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) and Elaine Luria (D-VA) listen during a public hearing of the U.S. House Select Committee to investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol, on Capitol Hill, in Washington, U.S., July 21, 2022. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nGoing down swinging\n\nCheney was by far the most prominent of the 10 House Republicans to vote in January 2021 for Trump’s impeachment. She revealed her decision to do so the day before the House vote, saying in a statement that Trump “summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.”\n\nThe retribution she faced within the GOP built over the following months. In May 2021, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy publicly endorsed removing Cheney from her position as the No. 3 spot in the party’s leadership team.\n\nThat same month, the House GOP removed Cheney from her leadership post on a voice vote.\n\nShe followed the ouster by telling reporters, in a preview of how she would approach the following year and her reelection campaign: “I will do everything I can to ensure that the former President never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office.”\n\nIn July 2021, Cheney accepted a position as one of two Republicans, along with retiring Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, on the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nAs the committee conducted its probe, Trump set his sights on revenge, endorsing challengers to most of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him.\n\nTrump’s biggest target was Cheney. He endorsed Hageman, a former Republican National Committee member and lawyer who had once been a Cheney ally, on the day she entered the race in September 2021.\n\nFor the most part, Trump’s efforts have succeeded. Four of the 10 have retired. Three more, in addition to Cheney, lost their primaries. Only two survived their primaries, and California Rep. David Valadao and Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse did so in part because their states hold all-party open primaries.\n\nAs those retirements piled up and those primaries unfolded, Cheney was busy playing a leading role on that committee, in its interviews of former Trump administration officials and in its public hearings in which the panel has revealed some of its findings.\n\nShe has also sought out opportunities to confront the GOP’s direction. She delivered a searing rebuke of Trump and her party’s leadership in a late June speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\n“We are confronting a domestic threat that we have never faced before – and that is a former President who is attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional Republic,” Cheney said then. “And he is aided by Republican leaders and elected officials who have made themselves willing hostages to this dangerous and irrational man.”\n\nWeeks after that speech, Cheney was elusive when asked about the possibility of running for president in 2024. She told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview that she will “make a decision on 2024 down the road.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt earlier this month, Cheney made clear she would not temper her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father once held and that she has held since 2017.\n\n“We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.”\n\nEven as polls showed Cheney was on her way to a resounding defeat, she stuck to a message focused squarely on Trump.\n\nHer campaign bought ad time on Fox for a spot featuring Dick Cheney, in which he called Trump a “coward” who lies to his supporters and “tried to steal the last election” using violence.\n\nRepublican candidate U.S. Representative Liz Cheney speaks during her primary election night party in Jackson, Wyoming, U.S. August 16, 2022. David Stubbs/Reuters\n\nWhat’s next\n\nIt didn’t take long for the outcome of Tuesday’s primary to become clear. Cheney had been badly defeated, and conceded the race to Hageman quickly.\n\nShe told supporters that she’d won the primary with 73% support two years ago, and “could easily have done the same again.” But doing so, she said, would have required embracing Trump’s lies about election fraud.\n\n“That was a path I could not and would not take,” Cheney said.\n\n“No House seat, no office in this land, is more important than the principles that we are all sworn to protect. And I well understood the potential political consequences of abiding by my duty,” she said.\n\nAfter a primary that Cheney and her allies knew she was set to lose, the question is, what’s next for the Wyoming congresswoman who had in a short time rocketed up the House Republican ranks?\n\nShe did not answer that question Tuesday night, at her election night event on a ranch in Jackson Hole. But overnight, her campaign filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission creating a leadership PAC to be called “The Great Task” – a nod to Abraham Lincoln, who spoke at Gettysburg of the “great task” facing the country. And on Wednesday morning, she told NBC’s “Today” show that she is “thinking about” running for president and will make a decision in “the coming months.”\n\nIn her election night speech, Cheney previewed a continued fight against Trump: “I have said since January 6 that I will do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it. This is a fight for all of us, together.”\n\n“I ask you tonight to join me: As we leave here, let us resolve that we will stand together, Republicans, Democrats and independents, against those who would destroy our republic,” she added.\n\nAs she left the stage, Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down” blared over the event’s speakers as the sun set over the Grand Teton mountain peak.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Jeff Zeleny", "Eric Bradner", "Jeff Zeleny"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}]}

New proposal weighs in.", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO – Each year, millions of majestic orange and black monarch butterflies make an extreme, multi-generational 3,000 mile migration across the United States, flocking to wintering grounds in California and Mexico. Beloved by children, the iconic species is instantly recognizable and found almost entirely in North America.\n\nThe fluttering insects could also be gone by the time today's grade-schoolers are grandparents.\n\nUnder current conditions, the butterflies are estimated to have a 99% chance of going extinct in the western part of the United States by 2080 and somewhere between a 56 and 74% chance of extinction in the east, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n\nWhich is why Fish & Wildlife has proposed listing the iconic insects as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n(Endangered species are considered close to extinction and get significant protection, while threatened species are considered on their way to being endangered – but aren't there yet. The threatened designation gives the government more leeway when working to protect a species.)\n\n“Despite its fragility, it is remarkably resilient, like many things in nature when we just give them a chance,” said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams.\n\nThe designation could help conservationists protect habitat critical to the brightly-colored butterflies' survival.\n\nIn a press release issued by the service, wildlife officials said public input is being sought until March 12, at which point the Fish and Wildlife Service will make a final decision about listing the species as threatened.\n\nThe final decision will be in the hands of the incoming Trump Administration. In 2020, during the first Trump administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service found that monarchs were threatened with extinction but did not list them because other species were more high-priority.\n\nIf you love monarchs, plant milkweed\n\nOne reason monarchs have struggled is that their primary food source, milkweed plants, is disappearing. Milkweed once commonly grew in rural areas across the nation but new herbicides, development and overall loss of habitat have significantly decreased the food source for the caterpillars that become monarchs.\n\nOne thing Americans who love monarchs can do is plant milkweed, said experts. It's the only plant that monarchs will lay their eggs on and is an important part of their diet.\n\n“This science-based decision is a national call to action for all Americans to save this majestic species by joining forces to plant native milkweed and nectar plants all across the nation – our yards, schools, parks, rights-of-way, businesses, places of worship, working lands, and so much more,” Collin O’Mara, president and CEO, National Wildlife Federation, said in the Fish and Wildlife release.\n\nThe pretty plant, which sports pink, purple or orange flowers, gets its name from the milky sap inside the stems and leaves.\n\nDespite its name, milkweed is not a weed but a wildflower, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nCommon milkweed, Asclepias syriaca, has a wide native range in the United States. There are also many regional species that grow well in every part of the country, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a partnership of federal and state agencies and others who are working to protect the monarch migration.\n\nExpert says designation could help 'steady and concerning' population decline\n\nDesignating of the migratory monarch butterfly as threatened would allow for further conservation efforts to prevent their extinction.\n\nDr. Rebeca Quiñonez-Piñón, monarch recovery strategist and director of climate-resilient habitats for the National Wildlife Federation said the designation would allow for further conservation efforts.\n\n“This determination will give new life to our conservation efforts and affirms what the science community has documented for almost three decades, a steady and concerning decline of the species’ populations,” she said in an NWF release.\n\nAlthough the butterfly has not been added to the threatened wildlife list, the service said people can help with their conservation.\n\n“Everyone can play a role in saving the monarch butterfly. Because of the species’ general habitat use and wide distribution, all sectors of society have an opportunity to participate in a broad range of conservation efforts throughout the butterfly’s range,” the service said.\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

The highly territorial birds were found nowhere else on earth.\n\nAnd now, none exist in the wild.\n\nThe introduction of the brown tree snake, and its proliferation in an environment with no natural predators, has been blamed for the bird's demise. In 1984, the Guam kingfisher was added to the U.S. Endangered Species List.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the last of the remaining few Guam kingfishers were removed from the wild, and since then, they've been part of a captive breeding program. Unfortunately, the species is very difficult to breed in captivity.\n\nThe bird is so rare that only about 140 exist today, and they all descend from the same 29 individuals.\n\nOn Thursday, the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Virginia announced that a Guam kingfisher chick hatched on May 17 - the first chick of its kind hatched at the institute in the last four years.\n\nThe plight of the Guam kingfisher is a reminder that even a small change in an ecosystem - the introduction of just one species, possibly just one specimen, in an environment where it doesn't belong - can have devastating effects on the environment.\n\nWhile we might say the lesson has been learned, we haven't been successful in stopping other invasive species from coming to the island. Even in recent years, new problems have been introduced. The cycad aulacaspis scale insect, which destroys trees, was first found here in 2003, according to the University of Guam. The coconut rhinoceros beetle arrived in 2007. The little fire ant was found in 2011. The greater banded hornet was discovered in 2016.\n\nGreat measures have been taken to preserve the existence of a bird that once thrived on our island. After more than 30 years, the involvement of dozens of institutions and untold amounts of money, we still have fewer than 150 Guam kingfishers alive in the world.

Sitting at the bottom of her trap fashioned from a 5-gallon plastic bucket was an American burying beetle, a federally endangered species that hadn't been found living in Ohio since 1974 — until now, that is.\n\nAnd Malek didn't find just one. She found three of the beetles at The Wilds last month: two females and a male, which she marked with tiny bee tags.\n\n\"It's like having your best dream come true,\" said Malek, a 25-year-old wildlife ecology technician from Zanesville. \"It's just amazing that all of our hard work is finally paying off.\"\n\nThe American burying beetles are important because they turn decay into compost and help keep ecosystems in balance and clean, she said.\n\nIn an attempt to re-establish the species, conservationists at The Wilds have bred and released hand-reared beetles for nine straight summers in portions of the 10,000-acre conservation park in Muskingum County, which is operated by the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. Last year, they released 472 of the insects, their largest number to date.\n\nGet the news delivered to your inbox: Sign up for our morning, afternoon and evening newsletters\n\nThe process includes carving out nests for the beetles with golf-hole diggers, filling them with carcasses and placing a paired male and female beetle inside every hole. The insects are marked for identification.\n\nIn the wild, the beetles typically forage for a dead animal themselves — usually a bird or rodent. They drag it underground, strip off its fur or feathers and coat it with gooey secretions. The female beetle lays eggs in nearby dirt chambers and days later as many as 30 ravished larvae emerge. The entire family feeds off and lives in the cozy, mummified slime ball until the baby beetles fly off a couple of months later.\n\nMalek, who started as an Ohio University student intern, has overseen the program for the past two years.\n\nDuring that time, shehas spent several hours every day checking more than 20 bucket traps filled with ripe, smelly bait that are topped with funnels to prevent the insects from escaping. She captured plenty of American burying beetles each summer. But as the seasons passed, she never found them again the following spring.\n\nSome questioned if the hand-reared bugs, which were successfully reproducing, were capable of surviving Ohio's frigid winters. They're also not active if the spring weather is too cold. The inch-and-a-half-long insects have a lifespan of about a year.\n\nTheir ability to travel long distances — sometimes several miles in one night when searching for food or a mate — also made finding them a challenge.\n\nBut after some trial and error, Malek finally found the elusive insects, offspring of ones released this past summer, in the western part of The Wilds property. They were near Zion Ridge Road, about a mile from their release site and 70 miles southeast of Columbus.\n\nThe beetles released this past summer had been captured from a wild population in Nebraska and were bigger than usual, which may have led to the breakthrough, said Stephen Spear, director of wildlife ecology at The Wilds.\n\nSpecimans previously came from Arkansas, a warmer climate.\n\nThe Cincinnati Zoo, which also participates in the conservation program, also captured its first overwintered beetle in May at the Fernald Nature Preserve in southwestern Ohio, perhaps supporting that theory.\n\n\"This is a huge milestone to celebrate, but we're always thinking about the next thing,\" Spear said. \"It's a long-term goal, but now there's no reason to think we can't get them re-established all over the state of Ohio someday.\"\n\nThe American burying beetle was once the most-common burying beetle in the country, found in 35 states in the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It was the first insect to be placed on the federal endangered species list, and that distinction has stuck since 1989.\n\nToday, the insect remains in only a handful of states.\n\nIt's believed the species is dwindling because of a lack of appropriately sized food sources, especially following the extinction of the once-abundant passenger pigeon in 1914. The beetle can't bury animals that are too large. Animals that are too small, meanwhile, don't provide enough food.\n\nIt's also possible that light pollution, more competition from larger scavengers, increases in pesticide use and sweeping land-use changes might have hurt the beetle, experts say.\n\nNow that they've finally found beetles that survived the winter, conservationists at The Wilds hope to start tracking generations of offspring.\n\nThey'll maintain a database containing DNA of every American burying beetle they release and capture, to confirm the population is continuing to reproduce and remaining genetically diverse, Spear said.\n\nTheir work continued last Thursday with this year's first release.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources' Division of Wildlife is to establish a burying beetle population that can sustain itself without human intervention, said Erin Hazelton, a wildlife administrator with the division.\n\nShe said that's a step closer to its removal from the endangered species list.\n\n\"Our mission is to make sure that we're looking out for all wildlife, not just the cute and fuzzy ones,\" Hazelton said.\n\nawidmanneese@dispatch.com\n\n@AlissaWidman\n\nListen to the NewsCycle podcast:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/12/28/endangered-species-act-turns-50-landmark-law-reaches-key-anniversary/71987562007/", "title": "Endangered Species Act turns 50: Landmark law reaches key ...", "text": "President Richard M. Nixon enshrined the Endangered Species Act into the nation’s history 50 years ago on Thursday.\n\nBeleaguered by the Watergate scandal, Nixon signed the act unceremoniously, issuing a short statement from the “western White House” in San Clemente, California.\n\n“Nothing is more priceless and more worthy of preservation than the rich array of animal life with which our country has been blessed,” his short statement read, in part.\n\nThe Act would enrich the lives of countless future generations, he predicted. “America will be more beautiful in the years ahead, thanks to the measure that I have the pleasure of signing into law today.”\n\nThe legislation provided a road map for protecting vanishing species and their habitats. Its 50-year journey has seen speed bumps, detours and a few failures, but though its future remains uncertain, many experts say it remains one of the nation’s crowning achievements.\n\n“The Act reflects our democracy,” said Zygmunt Plater, an environmental law professor at Boston College, whose advocacy has seen the fate of the tiny snail darter fish come full circle over more than 40 years.\n\nOn its golden anniversary, many Americans routinely experience joyful encounters with one of the plants or animals considered the Act's success stories. They may see sunlight gleaming off the brilliant white head of one of the more than 300,000 bald eagles now found across the nation or watch one of the protected whales breaching from the ocean waves.\n\nWildflowers in California, Kirtland’s warblers, peregrine falcons and the Monito gecko on an island in Puerto Rico are among more than five dozen species that have recovered.\n\nEndangered species controversy:Feds want to hunt one kind of owl to save another kind of owl. Here's why.\n\nThe bipartisan adoption and signing of the Act 50 years ago was \"a moment that stands out in the national environmental consciousness,\" said Tim Preso, a managing attorney of the biodiversity defense program at Earthjustice. \"It would be great to see more of those.\"\n\nEven as these successes are celebrated, many other plants and animals remain on the brink of extinction or are sliding in the opposite direction, often because of habitat loss and fragmentation.\n\nThe act’s “record of accomplishment from these strong rules remains contested,” said Cary Coglianese, a professor of law and political science at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. Many species “remain listed as endangered or threatened.”\n\nThe Florida panther, for example, struggles to gain ground and avoid deadly collisions with speeding cars. The lesser prairie chicken narrowly escaped this year when President Joe Biden vetoed a bill that would have stripped the bird of its endangered species protection.\n\nThe perils of the changing climate add urgency to calls for increased funding and more protection. In North Carolina, for example, the rising sea steadily creeps over a refuge that’s home to the sole remaining wild red wolf population. Off New England, warming waters forced changes in the foraging habits of the endangered North Atlantic right whale, putting the massive marine mammals in harm's way more often.\n\nRemembering when the Endangered Species Act was adopted\n\nThe Act was one of several landmark measures passed during the Nixon years, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. His administration came amid an environmental awakening of the country that had begun years earlier.\n\n“This truly was an environmental revolution that had been building up to this point,” said Clay Henderson, author and retired environmental attorney. Several events contributed, including the publication of Rachel Carson’s \"Silent Spring,\" which riveted the nation’s attention on the perils of pesticides. Momentum grew during the administrations of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nThen on Dec. 24, 1968, astronaut William Anders captured the iconic picture of Earth, “rising over the desolate moon,” Henderson said. “It just really captured the imagination of people and there was this moment in time where people thought 'we need to do something'.”\n\nEight days after Nixon was inaugurated in January 1969, a major oil spill occurred in his home state of California. Weeks after the inauguration, millions turned out across the country to participate in the first Earth Day celebration.\n\nThree years later, the Act passed 355-4 in the House of Representatives and unanimously in the Senate. Among those senators was Biden.\n\nPart of the beauty of the act was the citizen enforcement provisions that allowed citizens to go to court to force the federal government to enforce the law, taking a page from the civil rights movement, Plater said.\n\nThe Act \"finally recognized that all forms of life have evolved over time, and some only ask to be given room to continue to live and grow by man,” said the late Nathaniel Reed, one of a small group of men convened by the administration to help get Nixon’s environmental measures approved.\n\n“We are Earth’s stewards and the ESA, difficult as it is, recognizes the right to life of plants, mammals, insects, birds, and whales,” Reed said in a 2015 interview.\n\nHow many species have been listed as endangered or threatened?\n\n◾ More than 2,300 are listed as threatened or endangered.\n\n◾ The list includes 1,252 species endangered in the United States and 417 threatened species.\n\n◾ It also lists 698 foreign species as threatened or endangered.\n\n◾ The endangered list includes 766 plant species and 486 animal species.\n\nSuccesses of the Endangered Species Act\n\nThe law has been “incredibly effective,” said Susan Holmes, executive director of the Endangered Species Coalition. \"It has been the global gold standard for protecting wildlife and conservation.”\n\nIt has remained consistently popular in polls and surveys, with support consistently above 85%, said Holmes and Preso.\n\nThat support \"speaks to something really fundamental in our relationship with our world and the irrevocable nature of extinction,\" Preso said.\n\nIt \"has been extremely successful at preventing extinction and bringing a lot of these species back from the edge, Preso said. \"Either they're back from the brink or their populations are more secure.\"\n\nIn addition to saving several species, the act has been “a means of protecting a great amount of habitat,\" said Henderson, author of \"Forces of Nature: A History of Florida Land Conservation.\"\n\nPlater's work in helping to protect the tiny darter, a brown-banded fish about 3 inches long, saw it listed in 1975. A case he represented to stop a Tennessee Valley Authority dam to protect the fish was the first endangered species case to reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Then in 2019, Plater and Jim Williams, a former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist, petitioned the service to delist the fish in a move to stop it from being delisted without protections.\n\nThe snail darter is a lesson in the need for habitat protection and the complexities that occur with species protection, Plater said. The fish have recovered because they were transplanted into other ponds to ensure their recovery, but that work hasn't been \"an unmitigated success.\"\n\nHow many species have been removed from the endangered or threatened species list?\n\nAt least 117.\n\n◾ 64 recovered to the point that they no longer qualified.\n\n◾ 32 were declared extinct, including the dusky seaside sparrow and the Bachman's warbler.\n\n◾ 21 were removed for other reasons that meant they no longer met the definition.\n\nWhich presidential administration listed the most species?\n\nPresident Bill Clinton leads for the most species listed and the greatest number of species listed per year on average.\n\nDespite his administration leading the charge, Nixon is at the bottom of the list, with only seven species added after the act was signed. He resigned just seven and a half months after signing the Act.\n\nTotal species listed by administration:\n\n◾ Bill Clinton: 501\n\n◾ Barack Obama: 334\n\n◾ Ronald Reagan: 256\n\n◾ George H. W. Bush: 229\n\n◾ Jimmy Carter: 116\n\n◾ George W. Bush: 52\n\n◾ Gerald Ford: 46\n\n◾ Joe Biden: 42\n\n◾ Donald Trump: 22\n\nBy political party, when Democrats have been in the White House, an average of 43 species were added to the list each year. When Republicans were in the White House, the average fell to 33 species a year.\n\nWhich types of animals are most endangered or threatened?\n\nFish. At least 169 fish species found in the United States are listed as endangered or threatened.\n\nThese are the other animal groups represented, in descending order:\n\n◾ Mammals: 95\n\n◾ Insects: 93\n\n◾ Birds: 91\n\n◾ Clams: 89\n\n◾ Snails: 52\n\n◾ Reptiles: 46\n\n◾ Amphibians: 43\n\n◾ Crustaceans: 32\n\n◾ Arachnids: 11\n\n◾ Corals: 7\n\nWhat's next for endangered species protection?\n\nOne in 5 plant and animal species in the nation remain at risk of extinction, Holmes said. “Loss of habitat and climate change are absolutely some of the most important threats that we have.”\n\n“We are at what I would say is a pivotal moment with the threats of climate change,” she said. “We have to act faster than ever in order to ensure that these species are going to thrive.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/agriculture/2018/07/12/monarch-iowa-needs-up-830-000-acres-habitat-save-butterfly/739653002/", "title": "Iowa farmers play crucial role in monarch butterflies' survival", "text": "Growing up in eastern Iowa, Rob Stout spent his summers pulling milkweed from his family's soybean fields.\n\nNow he's planting it, along with coneflowers, black-eyed Susans and other plants and flowers that support monarch butterflies, an insect that environmentalists say is nearing extinction.\n\n\"My father probably would be spinning in his grave,\" Stout said, knowing his son mows around milkweed, avoids spraying the plants and lets them go to seed.\n\n\"A lot of farmers think it's time to do something.

It’s in the heart of the summer habitat of the eastern migratory population,\" said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nThe center is among the environmental groups that petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2014 to protect the monarch butterfly, saying the pollinators' North American population had declined 80 percent over the past two decades.\n\nThe federal agency must decide within a year whether the monarch should receive protections.\n\n\"The best available science right now shows monarchs are still below the 225 million adult overwintering butterflies, which scientists still say is the danger zone for extinction,\" Curry said.\n\nMany factors play into the monarchs' demise — from deforestation in Mexico, where the insects overwinter, to severe weather, McPeek said.\n\nThe number of monarchs overwintering in Mexico this year was estimated at 93 million.\n\nMORE: Bachelor farmer brothers leave behind a surprising gift that's now blooming in Iowa\n\nBut the butterflies' loss of milkweed in Iowa and other Midwest farm states has had a big impact, too, Curry said.\n\nShe points to widespread adoption of genetically engineer crops tolerant to pesticides that enable corn, soybeans and other crops to be sprayed with chemicals that kill weeds and bugs.\n\nMonsanto first introduced the seed and chemical system with Roundup Ready soybeans in 1996.\n\n\"In the Midwest, nearly ubiquitous adoption of glyphosate-resistant 'Roundup Ready' corn and soybeans has caused a precipitous decline of common milkweed, and thus of monarchs, which lay their eggs only on milkweeds,\" the only food the hatching monarch caterpillars will eat, the petition seeking monarch protections says.\n\nAbout 90 percent of U.S. corn and soybean acres are planted with herbicide-tolerant seeds, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.\n\nCurry said other ag practices, such as using neonicotinoids, also can be deadly to the monarch caterpillars and butterflies.\n\nThe insecticide is used to treat corn and soybean seeds, but it's also used on residential flowers and plants that remain toxic to insects, she said.\n\n\"Some scientists are pointing to 'neonic' residues as a problem in the fall for the return migration to Mexico,\" when butterflies look for nectar-producing flowers, she said.\n\nMilkweed is disappearing along with land.\n\nFarming and urban development have resulted in monarchs east of the Rockies losing an estimated 167 million acres of habitat, an area about the size of Texas, since the mid-1990s, environmental groups say in their petition.\n\nTo help offset losses, Iowa leaders look to add milkweed and nectar-bearing flowers to local and state parks and forests, roadside ditches, along utility lines and private right-of-ways, and farmland set aside in federal conservation reserve programs.\n\nIowa's plan expects about half of the monarch habitat will come from agricultural areas, with conservation reserve land, pastures, buffer strips and marginal farmland being the first candidates for pollinator habitat.\n\nClose to a quarter of the habitat will come from suburban areas, with about 20 percent coming from public lands and roadsides.\n\nFor example, Iowa has close to 60,000 miles of gravel roads alone, where monarch milkweed can be planted, said Steve Bradbury, an Iowa State University professor of natural resource ecology and management.\n\n\"Roadside areas are really important\" to helping monarchs better move around the landscape to find food, said Bradbury, part of the research team heading up Iowa's plan.\n\nJoe McGovern, president of Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, a statewide conservation group, said Iowa will need \"diverse groups coming together to figure this out.\"\n\nAll Iowans should look at what they can do to add monarch habitat, he said.\n\nYOU'RE NEEDED: Iowa State University and others provide tips for helping monarchs\n\n\"What can you do on your land now?\" McGovern said, adding that his group and others that manage large tracts of land are looking at how to add pollinator habitat.\n\n\"No place is too small. People think, if I don't have 40, 60 or 100 acres, I can't make a difference. But we know every acre counts. Every stem of milkweed counts,\" he said.\n\nSchools, churches, families and businesses are adding habitat.\n\nFor example, Linn County is adding 1,000 acres of pollinator habitat, while Farmers Electric Cooperative in Greenfield is adding 5 to 7 acres around its Greenfield office.\n\n\"Whether you’re a farmer or not, no one wants to see the monarch listed as an endangered species,\" said Theo Gunther, a resource management specialist at the Iowa Soybean Association.\n\n\"Everybody can play a role in getting habitat on the landscape,\" said Gunther, who works with farmers on incorporating pollinator habitat into their land.\n\nStout, the Washington farmer, said he started planting pollinator plants and flowers over a bioreactor.\n\nHe liked it so much, he's added a couple acres of prairie strips each year since.\n\nWith 30 to 40 different kinds of grasses, plants and flowers, the areas are awash in birds, bees and bugs, Stout said.\n\n\"There's always a buzz out there,\" he said. \"It's beautiful, and I like what it's doing for the environment.\"\n\nCurry said she hopes Iowa and other states' efforts to bring back the monarchs work.\n\nEven with a yard filled with milkweed, she's not seen a monarch all summer in Oregon, part of monarchs' migration west of the Rockies that also has suffered shrinking populations.\n\n\"My best friend lives in Minneapolis, and she tells me about being a kid and laying on her back, watching clouds of monarchs migrating overhead,\" Curry said.\n\n\"It’s such a beautiful, magical image.

They were a testament to one of the country’s greatest conservation success stories, experts say – because roughly six decades ago, America’s national symbol was on the brink of extinction.\n\n“We recovered the bald eagle in every state in the country,” said Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s probably the most geographically widespread recovery effort of any endangered species.”\n\nThe bird – threatened by hunters, habitat loss and DDT poisoning – was one of the first species to be protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. The ESA requires the federal government and its agencies to use all their resources and put measures in place to ensure a listed species doesn’t go extinct.\n\nWith the help of a massive, decades-long effort to save the bird, bald eagle numbers jumped from roughly 400 nesting pairs in the lower 48 states in the early 1960s to nearly 10,000 nesting pairs by the time they were taken off the list in 2007.\n\nThe federal law played a huge part in the bird’s recovery and is credited with helping keep hundreds more species alive since then, with the help of federal protections.\n\n“It is a reality that the human population does continue to grow and we’re squeezing wildlife into smaller and smaller areas to live, but in species like the bald eagle we have shown that we can live side by side as long as we take simple measures to not disturb them,” Hartl said.\n\nHere’s what experts say we can learn from the iconic bird’s success story and how Americans can help animals that are currently in peril.\n\nThe eaglets on January 7, 2022. SWFLEagleCam.com\n\nWhat are the biggest threats to species?\n\nWhen the federal government moved to create protections for the bald eagle, the animal faced several dire threats, including habitat destruction, shooting, DDT and lead poisoning, after feeding on animals that had been killed with lead ammunition or had been contaminated with the dangerous pesticide.\n\nDDT, or dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane, was developed in the 1940s and used to control mosquitos and other insects. The chemical has since been classified as a probable human carcinogen and correlated with liver tumors in animals, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nDDT hindered the bald eagle’s ability to create strong eggshells, and they would be crushed during incubation or would not hatch. The EPA banned its use in 1972, which experts say became the first crucial step in helping bald eagles recover. Further help arrived when the ESA became law, according to the US Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS).\n\n“This is where science meets policy,” said John Horning, executive director of WildEarth Guardians. “We realized, as a society, that a particular human action was threatening this iconic species, so we began to phase out DDT and that, combined with habitat protection and even halting hunting, are the main reasons that bald eagles have done so well.”\n\nToday, there are more than 1,300 endangered or threatened species across the United States, according to the EPA. The biggest reason species are endangered is because humans have changed or polluted their habitats, according to the EPA. Manatees, which are protected under the ESA, are one example of the devastating effects of pollution.\n\nLast month, conservation groups including the Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife announced they would sue the EPA for failing to protect the animals from Florida’s water pollution, which has fueled algae blooms and killed thousands of acres of seagrass, which the manatees feed on, leading the large creatures to starvation, they said.\n\nMore than 1,000 manatees died in Florida in 2021. The groups gave the EPA 60 days to address violations before they filed a lawsuit.\n\n“EPA is concerned about the manatee deaths and is committed to working with Florida and other partners to implement nutrient reduction strategies,” an EPA spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “We have received the notice and are currently reviewing it.”\n\nPollution is one of the main drivers of the extinction crisis, Jacob Malcom, director of the Center for Conservation Innovation at Defenders of Wildlife, told CNN.\n\n“Manatees show the manifestation of what happens when we don’t take the actions we know need to be taken,” Malcom said.\n\nOther threats species face today include climate change, exploitation (for example, the hunting of American alligators led to the species’ decline before it gained federal protections and rebounded), and invasive species.\n\nInvasive mosquitoes multiplying in Hawaii because of the warming climate, for example, are spreading malaria to birds endemic to those islands – and killing them.\n\n“The birds are starting to basically just disappear in those islands,” Hartl said.\n\nHow do we pull a species from the brink of extinction?\n\nThe good news: federal protections generally work.\n\n“The fact that almost every species that has been listed is still on the Earth today, most of them haven’t gone extinct, that’s success,” said Malcolm, of Defenders of Wildlife.\n\nMeasures that are generally taken to protect species and prevent them from going extinct include prohibitions. They include the prohibition of hunting in the case of American alligators or the DDT ban that contributed to the bald eagle’s recovery.\n\nAnother critical measure is restoring habitats.\n\n“To ensure that every species has places to live, that is the most important intervention to keep something from the true brink of extinction,” Hartl said.\n\nThe US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) recently proposed the listing of another species as endangered due to habitat loss: the Tiehm’s Buckwheat. The plant, found only in Nevada, is threatened by a lithium mine that would wipe out nearly all of its natural habitat. The announcement was a huge victory for conservationists who had sounded an alarm on the species and had urged the Biden administration to take action to protect it.\n\nThe fight to list a species under the ESA can often take decades, Horning said, hindered by a process that can often be politicized. Critics of the act say it has failed to modernize with the times, and that some species stay listed too long, even after they’ve recovered from the threat of extinction. And some industries – including mining and farming – say the law stymies business.\n\nBut removing species from the list too quickly can have devastating consequences.\n\nSince the Trump administration removed the gray wolf from the endangered species list, saying the animal’s population has sufficiently recovered, there has been an “incredible ramp-up” in the hunting and killings around Yellowstone National Park, Malcom said.\n\nDefenders of Wildlife announced in a news release on Friday that 20 gray wolves from the park have been shot and killed by hunters after leaving park boundaries – 15 in Montana, and five in Idaho and Wyoming. Organization president Jamie Rappaport Clark called on the government to reinstate federal protections.\n\nMontana Gov. Greg Gianforte also petitioned the federal government last month to de-list grizzly bears, saying the animal has “far surpassed population recovery goals.” Activists have warned against such a move, and the FWS itself has said that several challenges remain to fully recover the bear in the lower 48 states.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nWhile the act is still widely popular and remains largely successful in helping species recover, there’s plenty of room for improvement, experts say.\n\nLast year, the Biden administration moved to undo a handful of Trump-era curbs that critics said rolled back ESA protections. That’s a step in the right direction, Malcom said, but there’s more the government could do, including to better fund the law to support its efforts, like habitat restoration initiatives.\n\nThere are also things Americans can do to help support conservation efforts, including volunteering with environmental groups as well as contacting legislators to express support for conservation initiatives, Horning said.\n\n“Elected officials are responsive to the voices they hear, so if you’re silent on these matters, then they’ll respond to the voices that are the loudest,” Horning said.\n\nShowing support for local leaders and legislation that pushes for conservation can go a long way, experts said.\n\nRep. Joe Neguse, who represents Boulder, Colorado, reintroduced a resolution last January calling for a national biodiversity strategy, which would encourage government agencies to implement actions and policies to address the ongoing biodiversity crisis. Strategies like that could help bolster the ESA’s efforts too, Malcolm said.\n\n“We need that kind of movement,” Malcolm said. “We need that kind of support that says, ‘this is a national priority,’ because these species depend on it and ultimately, people depend on it. We all depend on nature.”", "authors": ["Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/08/14/federal-officials-joshua-tree-threatened-endangered-species-act/2009509001/", "title": "Federal officials: No reason to list Joshua tree as 'threatened'", "text": "The Joshua tree does not require protection under the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service said in a decision announced Wednesday.\n\nConservationists had petitioned the service in 2015, seeking to have the iconic desert plant and namesake of Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California listed as a threatened species. On Tuesday, the petitioners, a group called Wild Earth Guardians, filed a lawsuit complaining that the service was long overdue to respond to their petition.\n\nFish and Wildlife, part of the Department of the Interior, said Wednesday that it had determined that the Joshua tree's habitat is primarily on federally managed land, and has seen \"no major contraction in populations\" in the last 40 years. Joshua trees are found not only in California but also in Nevada and Arizona.\n\nFederal wildlife officials on Wednesday also declined to protect eight other species across the U.S., citing commercial and scientific data. The determinations come two days after the Trump administration unveiled changes to how the Endangered Species Act will be implemented, including ending a ban on considering economic impacts and decreeing that climate change impacts should not be considered.\n\nSecretary of the Interior David Bernhardt has called the changes “improvements to regulations\" and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has praised the changes, saying they would ease the regulatory burden on the American public.\n\nAgency: Joshua trees have 'enough resiliency'\n\nThe decision from the Fish and Wildlife Service's Carlsbad office reviewed the primary stressors to Joshua trees, among them wildfire, invasive plants, effects of climate change, and habitat loss. However, because the two species of Joshua tree, Yucca brevifolia and Yucca jaegeriana, still occupy their historical ranges of roughly 12 million acres, there is “enough resiliency in the population despite threats acting on them,” the service said. The species native to Joshua Tree National Park, Yucca brevifolia, has a historic range of 6.4 million acres, the service said.\n\nTaylor Jones, the biologist and advocate who authored the petition, expressed frustration with Wednesday's decision.\n\n“It appears that this administration is ignoring the science because they don’t believe in climate change,” Jones said. “This is blatant disregard of the climate crisis.”\n\nJones' petition cited climate models indicating the Joshua tree could lose roughly 90% of its habitat in the next 80 years, should the most severe climate conditions bear out. The gradual warming and drying of Southern California, which could see average maximum temperatures in July rise by as many as five or six degrees, could reduce the Joshua tree population in California to one small refuge in the center of Joshua Tree National Park.\n\nIt is unclear whether the agency agrees with the projections cited by Jones, though the findings state that “future stochastic and catastrophic events would not lead to population- or species-level declines in the foreseeable future.” A more detailed examination of the climate change impacts is still to be released, and will include the agency's own 80-year projections.\n\n“This administration has a history of climate-change denial,\" Jones said. \"President Trump called climate change a hoax, and Bernhardt discounted climate change when opening up public lands to oil and gas development. Denial of protections to Joshua trees fits that pattern.”\n\nChanges to the Endangered Species Act\n\nThis week's changes to the Endangered Species Act for the first time allow authorities to compile and review economic impacts of protecting a particular species during the review process; end blanket protections for animals newly deemed threatened; and reduce the scope of assessments during the listing review process. Instead of blanket protections for threatened species, officials said they will require “species-specific regulations for protective status.”*\n\nLegal challenges are expected by California and other states, as well as environmental groups.\n\n“Even as we suffer an extinction crisis and a climate emergency, the Trump administration continues to serve only narrow corporate interests,” said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “By shooting down protections for these imperiled plants and animals, Trump officials are displaying contempt for America’s natural heritage.\"\n\nMore:Joshua trees, monarch butterflies among species that may be impacted by Endangered Species Act change\n\nMore:Riverside County report deals blow to Paradise Valley, a proposed 'new town' near Joshua Tree park\n\nWednesday's decision on the Joshua tree was not made public as a result of Wild Earth Guardian's court filing on Tuesday, according to a Department of Fish and Wildlife spokesperson, Jane Hendron. Wild Earth Guardians said in a statement Wednesday it plans to file another lawsuit appealing Tuesday's decision.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) responded to Tuesday's announcement by saying: \"The iconic Joshua tree defines the California desert, but it could be lost forever if the administration has its way.\" Feinstein also criticized the Trump administration's rule changes for the Endangered Species Act.\n\nBee, mussels, blackbird also rejected\n\nBesides the Joshua tree, the Fish and Wildlife Service said Wednesday it would decline to extend protections to another tree, freshwater mussels, reptiles and insects across the United States.\n\nPetitioners were seeking protections for species including:\n\nthe Arapahoe snowfly\n\nthe brook floater and smooth pimpleback (two types mussels),\n\ngolden orb spider\n\nthe seaside alder, a tree\n\nthe tricolored blackbird\n\nthe yellow-banded bumble bee.\n\nThe agency asked the public \"to submit to us at any time” any new, relevant information on the status of the species or their habitats.\n\nCommercial as well as scientific information was used in the decisions not to protect the species, the federal agency said. Critics say economic impacts should not be allowed to outweigh biological and other research. Home developers, farmers and others have long argued that economics should be weighed as well.\n\nThe brook floater, a North American mussel, has historically been found from Georgia to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, clustered in sand pockets behind boulders and stream banks. The medium-sized mussel has been wiped out of approximately half of its U.S. locations, making the Canadian population “an important global stronghold for the species,” according to Fisheries and Oceans Canada. U.S. wildlife officials said there are also resilient populations in North Carolina and Maine.\n\nMore:Imperiled by climate change, Joshua trees could be declared a threatened species\n\nMore:How Minerva Hamilton Hoyt saved Joshua Tree park for future generations\n\nCalifornia’s tricolored blackbirds have declined by nearly 90% since the 1930s because of the destruction of wetlands and grasslands, pesticide use that wipes out their insect prey base and loss of nest sites during agricultural operations, environmentalists say. Federal officials said the fact that the bird is protected by California as an endangered species is adequate.\n\nYellow-banded bumblebees, once common in the American Midwest and East Coast and in southern Canada, have declined due to pesticide use and large swaths of habitat lost to development, conservationists say. Federal officials said: \"In the species’ current condition, there is occupancy across the majority of the yellow-banded bumble bee’s historical range.\"\n\nThe seaside alder tree lives in riparian and marshy areas in the East, where it may be threatened by salt-water intrusion via sea-level rise due to climate change. A separate population in Oklahoma is threatened by cattle grazing. But the tree has adequate, diverse habitat and populations, and is equipped to adapt to future change, the wildlife service said.\n\nThe Siskiyou Mountains salamander lives in the Klamath-Siskiyou region of Oregon and California, primarily in old-growth forests. It is threatened by U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management plans to increase logging, according to environmental biologists. Federal officials said that environmental groups had not presented \"substantial\" information to support their contention that fires, logging, mining and other factors were imperiling the salamander's existence.\n\nThree creatures — the golden orb spider, smooth pimpleback mussel and Arapahoe snowfly — were determined to no longer be genetically distinct species. Curry, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said the government appeared to have properly relied on science that determined they are subgroups of larger species.\n\nTrump has protected 18 species to date\n\nThe Endangered Species Act, signed by President Nixon in 1973, covers more than 1,600 species in the United States and its territories. The Trump administration has now protected 18 species and declined protections for more than 60 species, said Curry. Eighteen is the lowest number of species protected by any president this far into a first term, she said.\n\nDuring the eight years of the Obama administration, 360 species were protected under the Endangered Species Act. Under President Bill Clinton's two terms, 523 species were protected.\n\nUnder President George H.W. Bush, who served one term, 232 species were protected. Under President George W. Bush, who served two terms, 62 species were protected.\n\nDuring Ronald Reagan's eight-year presidency, 254 species were protected.\n\n*Clarification: This story has been clarified to explain more clearly about the role economic impacts will play in the Endangered Species Act process and how protections will be extended to species listed as threatened.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/07/30/bees-dying-off-south-dakota-agriculture-news-watch/1866137001/", "title": "Bees are dying and South Dakota beekeepers struggle with losses", "text": "Nick Lowrey, South Dakota News Watch\n\nSouth Dakota beekeepers — among the largest players in the U.S. pollination and honey industries — are reeling from a nationwide spike in honeybee colony losses that has the potential to affect 90 different agricultural crops across the country and could raise the price of fruit, vegetables and nuts if the problem worsens.\n\nIn 2018, the state’s beekeepers brought in more than $23 million from the sale of honey from roughly 255,000 hives. South Dakota ranked fourth in the nation in terms of honey production that year. But declining numbers of bees, both domestic and wild, threatens yields on crops ranging from almonds and apples on the West Coast to cotton and cranberries in the East.\n\nFor more than a decade, beekeepers in South Dakota and around the country have been fighting against historically high colony loss rates of nearly 30 percent each year. Still, last year’s 40 percent colony loss rate was a blow to beekeepers. Despite years of intensive research and countless hours of work to reverse the tide, bees continue to struggle.\n\nTim Hollmann, a beekeeper from Dante, S.D. a few miles south of Wagner near the Yankton Sioux Reservation, said much of the problem comes down to what bees eat. Farmers have plowed up more pastures to plant row crops such as corn and soybeans, and they’ve gotten better at killing flowering plants like milkweed and sweet clover in and around their fields, leaving less pollen and nectar for bees to consume. The pesticides and fungicides commonly used in modern agriculture also have been shown to make bees more susceptible to disease, if not killing them outright.\n\nMore SD News Watch:Truck crash in June sent Roundup and other herbicides into Big Sioux River\n\nWild bee populations have also suffered. In 2017, the rusty patched bumble bee became the first native bee species in the lower 48 states to be placed on the federal endangered species list by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Non-governmental conservation groups have said 346 other species of native bees also are threatened.\n\nIn all, bees pollinate about 90 crops in the U.S. and account for up $19 billion in added value to the country’s agriculture industry annually, according to the USDA. Without pollination from bees, many of whom are trucked around the country from their summer home in South Dakota to provide pollination services, experts worry the price of common food items such as strawberries and apples could rise.\n\nCommercial beekeepers say official data undercount the loss of commercial bee colonies. Bret Adee, co-owner of Adee Honey Farms in Bruce, S.D., one of the largest commercial beekeeping operations in the world, said some commercial keepers lost 70 percent or more of their bees last winter.\n\nAdee said his company lost so many bees that the business was forced to shutter its beekeeping operation in Nebraska and lay off employees. Prior to last year, the business kept bees in Nebraska for 60 years, Bret Adee said.\n\n“We didn’t have enough bees in our boxes,” he said.\n\nHoney produced from South Dakota’s sweet clover, alfalfa and wildflowers is highly prized for its mild flavor and light color. Unfortunately, per-hive production has fallen about 50 percent over the past 15 to 20 years, said Bret Adee’s brother and business partner, Kelvin Adee. Total U.S. honey production has dropped by about half, falling from 250 million pounds to about 150 million pounds annually, he said.\n\nAs annual honeybee colony loss rates continue to rise and honey production falls, the federal government has been pulling back ts honey bee monitoring efforts. In July 2019, the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service announced it would indefinitely suspend its quarterly honeybee colony survival survey and in December 2018, the service suspended its annual cost of pollination survey. Both surveys were cut, according to USDA news releases, due to budget reductions.\n\nNews of the colony loss survey being cut was a blow to the industry, Bret Adee said. Many beekeepers worry that the information might be lost for good and with it more targeted research funding. Better research will be needed to help reverse the tide of honeybee colony deaths, Bret Adee said.\n\n“We’re kind of in the darkest days of the industry right now,” he said.\n\nTough time to be a bee\n\nDuring the winter of 2018-19, the number of honeybee colonies lost in the U.S. came in at just shy of 38 percent, according to data gathered by the non-profit honey bee research group Bee Informed Partnership and the USDA. When stretched to the 12 months between April 2018 and April 2019, colony losses came in at more than 40 percent.\n\nHigh colony loss rates aren’t new to the industry. Since 2006, the U.S. has averaged a nearly 30 percent colony loss rate among its domestic bees, according to the Bee Informed Partnership. The 30 percent loss rate is roughly double the 15 percent colony loss rate noted prior to 2006. The losses have beekeepers worried about the future of their industry.\n\nMore:Expanded South Dakota cheese plant violated pollution limits\n\n“Any business that has a 30 percent annual loss rate, that’s getting to be unsustainable,” said John Stolle, a beekeeper near Sturgis and president of the South Dakota Honey Producers Association.\n\nStolle’s bees spend their summers making honey in the grasslands and hay fields north of the Black Hills. The bees find plenty of pollen and nectar there and can lay in plenty of honey for the winter. That allows them to recover their strength, even after Stolle takes his cut of honey to sell to such end users as Prairie Berry Winery in Hill City. Like many beekeepers, Stolle loads his hives onto flatbed trailers in the fall, covers them in a net and trucks them to wintering grounds in California. They make some honey there too, but mostly the move is to avoid cold weather and to be in place for almond pollination in February, Stolle said.\n\nAdee Honey Farms tries to keep between 75,000 and 85,000 hives going at any given time, said Kelvin Adee, who also serves as president of the American Honey Producers Association said. The company’s bees are spread throughout the Great Plains in the summer, often being moved in search of better foraging grounds.\n\nBret Adee spends his year traveling back and forth between Bruce, S.D., where his father founded Adee Honey Farms in 1959, and Bakersfield, Calif., where the Adees’ bees help pollinate the state’s roughly $7.1 billion annual almond crop.\n\nThe Adees pegged recent colony losses at closer to 60 or 70 percent. “They died faster than we can breed them,” Brett Adee said.\n\nWith annual losses of more than 50 percent, Bret Adee said, beekeepers won’t be able to keep up. Fall and winter of 2019 will be especially telling, he said.\n\n“If it’s anything like last year, the industry will be in a death spiral,” Bret Adee said.\n\nJay Fatland, a life-long beekeeper from Kimball who provided honey as a flavoring for “The Original Kimball Popcorn Ball,” has wound down his beekeeping efforts over the last few years. Losing so many bees each year just got to be too hard to handle, he said.\n\n“It’s just a struggle to keep the bees alive anymore,” Fatland said.\n\nHe’s down to about 200 hives now and is mostly retired from the business that was his sole source of income for more than 30 years.\n\nDespite the challenges over the past 15 years, enterprising beekeepers have been able to keep hive numbers relatively stable, if not growing slightly, according to USDA data. Keepers split colonies and breed new queens to keep their numbers up, a very expensive proposition. Queens can cost $30 to $40 each but average about $18.\n\nFor commercial producers, most of whom run thousands of hives, replacing 30 percent of their breeding stock every year isn’t economical if they can’t breed the queens themselves. Plus, for every split colony, there’s a drop in honey production and potentially more labor costs.\n\nThe increasing value of pollinator-dependent crops, such as almonds, has helped finance domestic bee breeding and kept many beekeepers in business. Farmers have been paying more than $350 million annually for pollination services, USDA data show. About 85 percent of the pollinator income came from the almond industry. Hives can command pollinator fees of up to $200 each per season in almond groves. About half to two-thirds of America’s roughly 2.8 million bee colonies are trucked to California for the February almond bloom each winter.\n\nWild bees, however, are showing marked declines. Until the late 1990s, the rusty patched bumble bee was a fairly common visitor to backyard tomato gardens and wildflowers in South Dakota and 22 other states. Now, the bee has probably been eliminated from South Dakota and can only be found in 13 states plus one Canadian province, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThere isn’t much historical population data on the more than 4,000 native bee species in North America. One of the few comprehensive reports on the continent’s native bee population was published in 2017 by the Center for Biological Diversity. The report found that there was sufficient data to assess the population of about 1,400 bee species. Roughly half those species were declining and 347 of them were determined to be threatened, the report said.\n\nMore NewsWatch:South Dakota infants still dying at a high rate due to sleep issues\n\nDeclining native bee populations also pose a big problem to anyone who buys food. While domestic honey bees are pretty good at pollinating some crops such as almonds and canola, they aren’t so great with such things as squash. Squashes tend to bloom early in the morning when domestic honey bees aren’t very active, said Amanda Bachmann, an urban entomologist with the South Dakota State University Extension Service. Instead, native squash bees handle most of the squash pollination duties.\n\n“If you’re growing zucchini here, you can go out in the morning and if you see a bee flitting about, it’s probably a squash bee,” Bachmann said.\n\nWild bees and a host of other native pollinators, such as monarch butterflies, also are responsible for pollinating everything from wildflowers and some grasses to flowering trees in far greater numbers than domestic bees. All of that pollination work helps provide food for everything from pheasants to cattle and even people.\n\n“These are the things doing the heavy lifting in terms of pollination,” Bachmann said of wild pollinators.\n\nWhy are bees dying\n\nNo one has been able to pinpoint a single cause for the widespread devastation of honeybees or native bees. Instead, a combination of factors is at play in the beehives themselves and in the fields where the bees look for pollen and nectar.\n\n“The whole environment has changed,” Kelvin Adee said.\n\nOne of the biggest problems facing bees in South Dakota is a drastic change in how the state’s farmers operate. Flowering plants such as milkweed have been virtually eliminated from the fields growing the state’s top two crops — corn and soybeans. Corn and soybeans, which have seen their acreage greatly expanded in South Dakota over the past two decades, are two of the worst crops for bees.\n\nHollmann, the beekeeper from Dante, said the problem with corn and soybeans is two-fold. First, the fields tend to be devoid of any plant life other than corn or soybeans, thanks to the use of glyphosate herbicides such as Roundup. Bees need flowers from which to draw the pollen and nectar they eat and use to make honey. A 2018 study by a group of researchers at the University of Texas also showed that glyphosates may be harming gut bacteria in bees and making the insects more susceptible to disease.\n\nThe second problem with corn and soybean fields is pesticides. Bees are bugs, and so are the pests killed by the most popular pesticides, which are called neonicotinoids for their chemical makeup that is similar to nicotine. When bees get hit with stray spray from a farm field, they die. Neonicotinoids are used all over the world and on just about every food crop because compared to other chemical pesticides, they’re considered relatively safe for humans.\n\nPesticides also help boost crop yields and keep food prices down, said Bachmann, who also works as a pesticide educator. Taking an effective tool for controlling pests away from farmers could cause as much harm as good, she said.\n\nOften, farmers who know a beekeeper has bees in the area will warn the keeper about their intention to spray and provide time for the bees to be moved or contained within their hives. But bees can also be exposed to pesticides indirectly. A lot of seeds are sold coated with neonicotinoids, which are then absorbed into the growing plant. A bee can pick up a non-lethal dose by landing on such plants and then can carry the chemicals back to the colony and expose other bees which are weakened.\n\nThe increased number of corn and soybean acres also limits locations bees can find food in South Dakota. Since 2008, 42 percent of the land South Dakota farmers had enrolled in the federal Conservation Reserve Program have been taken out of the program and often converted to row crop production. The CRP pays farmers to plant grass and other wildlife habitat and leave it relatively undisturbed for 10 years. Wildlife such as pheasants and deer benefit, but so do bees which find plenty of honeymaking materials and a wide variety of nutritious pollen in CRP grasslands.\n\nHollmann, who keeps some of his bees in Iowa, said the reduction of CRP lands, as well as the loss of weeds along fence rows and in ditches near farm fields in that state, has been devastating. Some of his Iowa locations have had bees producing honey on them for nearly 100 years, but those sites may not produce at all this year due to habitat loss and poor weather, Hollmann said.\n\nHollmann is a member of the Sioux City-based Sioux Honey Cooperative. He said southeastern South Dakota and northwest Iowa used to be “God’s country” for honey production. There was relatively stable weather and plenty of forage available between alfalfa, hay, ditches and fence rows, he said. Now, beekeepers are having to move west to central South Dakota and beyond where the habitat is better and safer but good honey production only comes when the weather cooperates.\n\n“We call it feast or famine territory,” Holmann said.\n\nFungicides are another man-made threat to bees. The insects evolved to work with certain fungi in their pollen stores, Bret Adee said. The fungi help break down pollen so it’s easier to digest and gives the bees better nutrition. Fungicides sprayed on crops to increase yields are then picked up by foraging bees and carried back to hives, where they can kill the helpful fungi.\n\nDespite all the problems caused by chemicals and habitat loss, the USDA has identified a parasite as the biggest threat facing bees. Varroa destructor, better known as the varroa mite, has been ravaging North American bee hives for decades. The mite first was found in the U.S. in 1987. South Dakota, as a top honey producing state, was infested with the mites soon after.\n\nVarroa destructor is native to Asia and acts similar to a tick. The mite attaches to a bee and sucks out the bee’s bodily fluids, weakening the host and making it more susceptible to disease and starvation when food runs low. Varroa mites also happen to be insects.\n\n“That’s been really difficult, you’re trying to kill a bug that lives on a bug,” Stolle said.\n\nThere isn’t a very effective treatment for mite infestations which by themselves are not necessarily fatal to bees, he said. Some beekeepers coat their bees with powdered sugar to try to loosen the varroa mite’s hold, but that only goes so far, Stolle said.\n\nVarroa mites also carry diseases such as deformed wing virus that can kill bees and infect whole colonies. Diseases have long been a killer of domestic bees and are easily spread because honey bees are social creatures. Often, honey bees interact with both wild bees and domestic bees from other colonies while out foraging up to three miles from their hive.\n\nSeveral exotic honey bee parasites and diseases have made their way into the United States since the 1980s. Small hive beetles from Africa, wax moths, European foulbrood and Israeli acute paralysis virus are just a few examples of foriegn diseases that have been inadvertently imported over the last 30 years.\n\nDespite setbacks, all is not lost for beekeepers\n\nEven with all the doom and gloom surrounding the beekeeping industry, domestic honey bees are in no immediate danger of extinction. The people who harvest bees for pollination and sell honey are the ones in trouble.\n\n“We’re not at a tipping point yet, but we’re getting there,” Stolle said.\n\nLuckily, most farmers and ranchers seem to be concerned about bees and the landscape they live on, Bret Adee said. There is a strong movement in South Dakota to diversify crops and focus on soil health as a way to boost farm incomes. What’s good for soil is generally good for bees too, he said.\n\n“Every time I meet someone who is doing that, I get excited,” he said.\n\nThere’s some good news for native bees too, Bachmann said. More people are becoming aware of the issues facing pollinators and are interested in helping out where they can. One of the big things people can do is use pesticides only as designed, Bachmann said. Every pesticide, whether it is intended for agricultural use or for the backyard, comes with a label that tells the user how to use it legally and safely while minimizing harm to beneficial bugs such as bees and butterflies.\n\n“A lot of home pesticides tell you not to apply them to flowering plants,” Bachmann said.\n\nFor Stolle, there’s real hope in the interest more people seem to be taking in bees. He said he sometimes is approached by curious people at gas stations while transporting his bees. Not too long ago, most everybody gave him dirty looks and kept their distance, Stolle said. Yet one person told him the story of a relative who had been injured in the blitz of London during World War II and would have lost a leg if not for doctors using honey to help treat an infected wound.\n\n“I think more people are starting to think, ‘Where does my food come from?’” Stolle said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/30"}]}

As of Oct. 1, 791,597 drones were registered in the U.S., according to the FAA. There may, of course, be others out there that are not registered.\n\nSo, can you take a shot at a hovering drone with a firearm or other projectile? The short answer is no.\n\nThe FAA says shooting any aircraft – including drones – is illegal.\n\nOnly law enforcement authorities can take action against drones, said Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor and robotics law expert.\n\nWhy do people shoot down drones?\n\nShooting a drone is a federal crime and additional penalties vary by state.\n\nIt can also be dangerous. The unmanned aircraft could crash and cause damage to people or property on the ground or collide with other objects in the air.

He believed the drone was spying on him. It was a Walmart delivery drone.\n\nShooting down drones is not the only way to disable them. Other means include putting up nets and jamming the drone's signal.\n\nGovernments around the world have trained eagles to attack unmanned aircraft. Angry shorebirds defending their nests have also attacked drones deployed by city officials to alert lifeguards to sharks and struggling swimmers.\n\nHow can you stop drones from flying over your property?\n\nEven if a drone is flying over your property, the FAA says homeowners can’t control that airspace.\n\nYou can contact a professional drone removal service that uses nets and other devices to stop a drone without damaging it, but that’s expensive. You can file a complaint online with the FAA. Or you can report the drone to the police.\n\n“If you feel like it’s spying on you or you feel like it’s scary, by all means, call the FAA or the local cops,” Calo said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/12/12/drones-over-yorktown-westchester-ny/76940851007/", "title": "Drones in NY: Why you may see them above Westchester today", "text": "If you happen to see drones Thursday in Yorktown's Route 134 area, they're not the mystery ones eyed in New Jersey and Delaware skies that have fueled an FBI investigation.\n\nThey're part of a private event — described as a movie shoot — in the area of the northern Westchester town, the police said.\n\n\"There will be drones utilized in the area of Route 134, west of the Taconic State Parkway during daylight hours, for a private event,\" Yorktown police said on Facebook, under a \"Movie Shoot Drone Activity\" header. \"We are alerting the public due to the current uncertainty involving recent drone sightings in New Jersey.\"\n\nPolice Chief Robert Noble said the drone usage should be finished during daylight hours, but may extend into very early evening.\n\nWhat's slated to be filmed wasn't immediately known.\n\nWhat's that in the sky?Westchester residents take to social to weigh in on UFOs in NY, NJ\n\nMystery drones spotted over New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island\n\nIn New Jersey and Delaware, mysterious nighttime drone flights have prompted questions and concerns among residents.

Phil Murphy has said the drone sightings over the last month are under investigation. On Wednesday, he held a briefing call with Alejandro Mayorkas, who runs the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nTestifying before a congressional hearing this week, Robert W. Wheeler Jr., assistant director of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, said the agency still can’t explain the drones, some of which have been spotted over military installations and other sensitive sites such as President-elect Donald Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nAuthorities say they're seeking information about the drone sightings and asked eyewitnesses to call the FBI hotline at 1-800-225-5324 or leave tips on the agency’s website.\n\nCan you shoot down a drone?\n\nWith alarm growing over the unidentified fleets of drones – many of which are reportedly larger than those available to hobbyists – residents have been asking whether you can shoot them down.\n\nThe question has come up more frequently as drone use for commercial and casual purposes soars. As of Oct. 1, 791,597 drones were registered in the U.S., according to the FAA. There may, of course, be others out there that are not registered.\n\nSo, can you take a shot at a hovering drone with a firearm or other projectile? The short answer is no.\n\nThe FAA says shooting any aircraft – including drones – is illegal.\n\nOnly law enforcement authorities can take action against drones, said Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor and robotics law expert.\n\nWhy do people shoot down drones?\n\nShooting a drone is a federal crime and additional penalties vary by state.\n\nIt can also be dangerous. The unmanned aircraft could crash and cause damage to people or property on the ground or collide with other objects in the air. And you could be on the hook for civil damages, according to Calo.\n\nA retired New Jersey fire captain recently faced criminal charges after he shot a Walmart delivery drone whirring over his Florida home with his 9 mm pistol, according to reports. He believed the drone was spying on him.\n\nShooting down drones is not the only way to disable them. Other means include putting up nets and jamming the drone's signal.\n\nGovernments around the world have trained eagles to attack unmanned aircraft. Angry shorebirds defending their nests have also attacked drones deployed by city officials to alert lifeguards to sharks and struggling swimmers.\n\nHow can you stop drones from flying over your property?\n\nEven if a drone is flying over your property, the FAA says homeowners can’t control that airspace.\n\nYou can contact a professional drone removal service that uses nets and other devices to stop a drone without damaging it, but that’s expensive. You can file a complaint online with the FAA. Or you can report the drone to the police.\n\n“If you feel like it’s spying on you or you feel like it’s scary, by all means, call the FAA or the local cops,” Calo said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/06/07/joro-spiders-giant-venomous-flying-spider-spotted-in-u-s-states/74012442007/", "title": "Joro spiders: giant venomous flying spider spotted in U.S. states", "text": "Giant venomous flying spiders from Japan have made their way to the U.S. in recent years, and will likely infiltrate more states in 2024.\n\nOriginally spotted in Georgia a decade ago, the arachnids are expected to reach parts of the northeast as early as this year. What does that mean for Indiana? Here's why Hoosiers don't need to worry about the spiders quite yet.\n\nTHE LATEST:Flying Joro spiders have been reported in nine states. Will we see them in Indiana?\n\nWhat are Joro spiders? How big are they?\n\nJoro spiders are large and brightly colored arachnids with a body span of up to 4 inches, according to The Pennsylvania State University. They have vibrant yellow and black coloration and are native to Asia.\n\nWhere are Joro spiders from?\n\nJoro spiders are native to Asia, according to Penn State. They are commonly seen in countries like Japan, China, Vietnam, Taiwan, India and North and South Korea.\n\nHow venomous flying spiders invaded the U.S.\n\nAccording to Penn State, Joro spiders were first seen in the U.S. in three Georgia counties in 2014. They were likely introduced to the states accidentally through shipping containers or potted plant materials.\n\nStates with giant flying Joro spiders\n\nJoro spiders have been confirmed in Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. A singular incident was reported in Oklahoma after a person had traveled there from northern Georgia, according to Penn State. Cases have also been reported in West Virginia and Maryland, according to Clemson University.\n\nAre Joro spiders poisonous or harmful?\n\nJoro spiders are venomous but do not have \"medically important\" bites, according to Penn State. Joro spiders are reluctant biters with small fangs and struggle to pierce human skin. Bites from the spiders hurt less than a bee sting, according to the article, and the pain is often localized to the bite area and goes away naturally.\n\nCan Joro spiders fly?\n\nJoro spiders have a natural mechanism called \"ballooning,\" which allows them to move through the air by releasing webs to catch the wind currents. The arachnids don't have wings, but if the silk gets long enough, winds can carry them for 100 miles or more at a time, according to USA TODAY.\n\nGiant flying spiders might invade the northeast\n\nAccording to Penn State, Joro spiders can survive in low temperatures and are often found in northern Honshu, Japan, where temperatures range from 25 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit in winter months. The average January temperature in northern Japan is similar to that of Pennsylvania, and the Joro spiders will likely \"spread throughout eastern North America at least as far north as Pennsylvania and possibly further in warmer, coastal areas.\"\n\nHow quickly venomous flying spiders are invading the U.S.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2022, Joro spiders spread between 50 and 80 miles from the location where they were originally spotted. At around 10 miles per year, the spiders were predicted to reach Pennsylvania years from now, but factors can accelerate the process, according to Penn State.\n\nThe spiders are able to invade the U.S. more quickly due to their \"ballooning\" characteristic, similar to flying, as well as human transportation.\n\nAccording to a news release from New Jersey Pest Control, a New Jersey-based pest control service, those in the state and surrounding ones like New York and Delaware have \"heightened concerns\" about the arrival of the spider this year.\n\n\"The potential for these spiders to establish populations in new regions raises questions about how local ecosystems will respond and adapt to their presence,\" according to the release.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/11/new-jersey-drone-sightings/76921707007/", "title": "New Jersey drone sightings: Lawmakers press FBI, call for ...", "text": "Recent drone sightings in New Jersey have garnered responses from several government officials and politicians.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) wrote a letter on Tuesday asking the agencies investigating the drone sightings, which include the FBI, to share any information with the public.\n\n“I also request that the DHS, the FBI and the FAA provide a briefing to the New Jersey’s municipal and county officials on the current situation, to include the federal government's response to date, in accordance with the appropriate classification restrictions,” Booker wrote in part. “It is our shared obligation to ensure that our airspace is safe and secure, and I am committed to giving New Jerseyans peace of mind about these activities.”\n\nNew Jersey residents have witnessed a startling number of drones since mid-to-late November, with sightings reported across counties including Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon, Morris, Passaic, Sussex, Somerset, and Warren. Some eyewitnesses have reported seeing “car-sized” objects that appear to rise in the sky as the sun sets. They have been hovering over reservoirs, military installations and critical infrastructure.\n\nIn response to the drones, Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-NJ) called on Gov. Phil Murphy to “issue a limited state of emergency banning all drones until the public receives an explanation regarding these multiple sightings.”\n\nIn a joint statement on Dec. 3, the FBI, State Police and the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness said authorities were asking the public to report any information related to the recent sightings of drones flying in several areas along the Raritan River.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the FBI and the FAA for comments.\n\nHere is what you know about the drone sightings in New Jersey.\n\nCongress questions FBI on New Jersey drone investigation\n\nIn Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, some members of Congress expressed their frustrations with the FBI as they wait to learn more information regarding an individual or group that may be responsible for the drone sightings in the Garden State.\n\nTexas Rep. August Pfluger, who chaired the hearing, said the threat posed by unidentified drones is \"real\" and opened the questioning by saying \"Let's start with current events. What is going on in New Jersey?\"\n\nRobert Wheeler Jr., assistant director of the Critical Incident Response Group for the FBI, said they are working with local and state authorities on the investigation and had received more than 3,000 sighting reports from the public since establishing a tip line last week. But so far, they have not found a break in the case.\n\n\"The bureau is actively investigating the unexplained sighting of drone activity over that part of New Jersey, including proximity to sensitive sites and areas of concern,\" Wheeler said. \"We do not attribute that to an individual or group yet. I don't have an answer of who's responsible, one or more people that are responsible, but we're actively investigating.\"\n\nFive 'large drones' spotted over Bucks County, Pennsylvania\n\nBucks County residents said they've spotted multiple drones overhead in the past week, including over a police department.\n\nFive large drones flew over Solebury Township Police Department late Dec. 8, Det. Sgt. Jonathan Koretzky told the Bucks County Courier Times, part of the USA TODAY Network. The drones were spotted approximately 1,000 feet in the air.\n\nMembers of the Solebury department also received reports of two large drones flying near Covered Bridge Road on Dec. 8 and last week.\n\nBoth sightings occurred at night, Koretzky said. He added that the resident who reported the incidents said both drones displayed flashing lights.\n\nFAA bans drones in the area\n\nLast month, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary flight restriction prohibiting drone flights over Trump National Golf Club Bedminster and the Picatinny Arsenal military research and manufacturing facility in Morris County. The move came \"at the request of federal security partners,\" the FAA said.\n\nWhat to do if you see drones in New Jersey\n\nThe FBI asks that anyone who sees the drones call 1-800-225-5324 or submit tips and video footage at www.tips.fbi.gov.\n\nContributing: Fernando Cervantes Jr., USA TODAY; Jenna Calderón and Lisa Robyn Kruse, Asbury Park Press.\n\nAhjané Forbes is a reporter on the National Trending Team at USA TODAY.

Break out the fly swatter. It's killing season in parts of the United States plagued by the beautiful – and dreaded – spotted lanternfly.\n\nThe next generation of the plant hopper and crop-destroying pest has hatched in 11 states across the northeastern U.S. after their dormant winter.\n\nThe invasive bugs, which evolve into colorful moth-like insects, can ravage plants and trees – and could eventually threaten the U.S. wine industry.\n\nThe spotted lanternfly, which actually doesn't fly but is a leaf-hopping insect, is thought to have been transported into the U.S. on a stone shipment from China in 2012, according to the New York State Integrated Pest Management Program at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. The first spotted lanternfly infestation in the U.S. was found in Berks County, Pennsylvania, northwest of Philadelphia, the Cornell experts say.\n\nE.T. phoning home?

European nations are also concerned about spread to their countries.\"\n\nWine crops 'at risk' from spotted lanternfly\n\nThere's reason to worry about the arrival of the spotted lanternfly in wine production-rich California. A study published earlier this month in the journal Communications Biology predicts that the spotted lanternfly could reach grape-producing counties in California as early as 2027, but likely by 2033.\n\nIt's not just grapes at risk, according to the study completed by researchers at North Carolina State University and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other crops \"considered at risk from SLF infection\" include almonds, apples, walnuts, cherries, hops, peaches, plums, and apricots, they said.\n\nThe researchers suggest that vineyards could reduce the spotted lanternfly risks by removing an invasive weed called the tree of heaven, to which the insects are attracted.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a 2019 economic impact study estimated the spotted lanternfly, if uncontrolled, could cost the state at least $324 million annually and more than 2,800 jobs – across the state's produce, wine, timber and plant nursery industries. The study's worst-case scenario puts the losses as high as $554 million annually, and about 5,000 jobs.\n\nTwo-thirds of Pennsylvania's counties are in a quarantine zone, meaning many businesses must get a special permit, earned after employees are trained to spot the insects and not to transport them elsewhere. Parts of Maryland, New Jersey, and Virginia are among other states with quarantine areas requiring permits too.\n\nPest will continue to spread across US\n\nQuarantines and public outreach campaigns have helped slow the spread of the spotted lanternfly but \"eradication does not seem possible at this point,\" Eshenaur said.\n\nDespite New Jersey's quarantines and the state's \"Stomp It Out\" campaign to get New Jerseyans to crush the bug with their feet, experts say the spotted lanternfly will continue to flourish there in 2022.\n\n\"With few predators and no parasites in New Jersey to keep them in check, each year’s population will be bigger than the last,\" said Matthew Aardema, an entomologist at Montclair State University in Montclair, New Jersey. He has already seen large quantities this spring near his Mercer County home in central New Jersey.\n\nSpotting the spotted lanternfly\n\nThe life cycle of the spotted lanternfly begins in mid-spring when they hatch from egg clusters that were laid by the prior generation last fall. They are currently in the early nymph stage, in which they appear black and very small. Two giveaways are their white spots and ability to jump a foot or more.\n\n\"You’ll see them marching up stems of plants and emerging everywhere, but they’re between a tick and housefly in size, so they’re easy to miss,\" said Shannon Powers, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.\n\nA warmer spring led to spotted lanternflies hatching about two weeks ahead of last year, she said. So far, the state has had 3,036 reports of lanternflies this season, up from 2,400 about this time in 2021, Powers said. That doesn't necessarily mean there are more insects, but more people may be reporting them, she said.\n\nBetween the first and third phases of growth, the spotted lanternfly grows from about ⅛ inch to ¼ inch. Typically in July, the insects hit a fourth phase or instar of growth in which they gain the red, black and white color and are about ½ inch in size, according to the New Jersey Department of Agriculture.\n\nSubsequently, the winged adult insect emerges, typically one inch or larger in size. The adult female insect lays eggs in the fall; the adults don't survive the winter, but the egg masses do. These egg masses, typically about an inch long with a gray mud-like covering, can contain up to 50 eggs. They are typically found on trees, rocks and anything left outdoors such as boats, lawn furniture, RVs and firewood.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nAt all stages of life, the insects suck the sap from as many as 70 plant species, especially fruit trees. As they feed, they secrete a sugary substance that draws other insects such as wasps and ants to feed and promotes mold growth. It leads to a one-two punch that can weaken the tree and eventually contribute to its death.\n\nReport and then kill them\n\nMost states have set up websites – such as badbug.nj.gov in New Jersey – for the public to report sightings and get information. Just search your state name and \"spotted lanternfly\" to find them. Last summer, in August alone the New Jersey Department of Agriculture received almost 10,000 emails and phone calls concerning the pest.\n\nExperts recommend you kill the insects when you see them. There are various ways to kill them including building a trap, as shown by Pennsylvania state officials in an online video. For information on approved insecticides and how to scrape egg masses go to the New York State Integrated Pest Management Program site.\n\nBut before you kill the bugs, officials urge you to report them, especially if you live in an area where the spotted lanternfly is not established. \"We're encouraging people to send photos first and then, of course, we would love to have them bring in a live sample,\" said Kirsten Ann Conrad, an agriculture natural resource extension agent with the Virginia Cooperative Extension in Arlington, Virginia. She recommends contacting your local extension office to report sightings.\n\nFor now, the area around the nation's capital hasn't had reports of the insects. But northern Virginia counties and parts of surrounding Maryland have had reports. \"It is coming at us,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/18"}]}

Place the smaller disc on a sheet of waxed paper, and use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll the dough into a 12-inch circle. If the dough sticks to the rolling pin, dust it lightly with more flour. Lay a 9- to 10-inch pie pan face-down on top of the circle; flip the pan over and remove the paper. For the top crust, on a sheet of waxed paper roll out the other disc to form a 14-inch circle. Do not roll the dough more than necessary.\n\n4. Sprinkle the tapioca on the bottom crust. Add the peach filling, mounding it in the center, and dot with 1 tablespoon butter. Lift the waxed paper with the remaining crust and flip it over the filling. Peel back waxed paper. Trim the edges of the crusts and pinch together the top and bottom crusts. Brush the pie with the egg Sprinkle with sugar. Poke fork holes or cut vents in the top crust.

Sturgis has to be cleared by an independent neurologist before he is cleared to practice. He is competing with Cody Parkey for the kicking job, and was clearly ahead of Parkey during the first three weeks of training camp.\n\nThat left Parkey as the sole kicker on Thursday night in the Eagles’ preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Parkey hit his only field goal attempt in the first half, a 40-yarder, with 3 seconds left. And he handled the kickoff duties as well.\n\nParkey held the job last season until suffering a groin injury in Week 4 last season. He went on injured reserve and missed the rest of the season. Sturgis was signed to take Parkey’s place. Sturgis made 81.8 percent of his field goals last season.\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nThe two had split the kicking duties in the preseason opener last Thursday against Tampa Bay. Each kicked off and hit an extra point. Sturgis has the only field-goal attempt, which he made from 42 yards out.\n\nWentz, new Eagles’ WR at game\n\nBoth Dorial Green-Beckham and Carson Wentz were at Heinz Field on Thursday night.\n\nWentz didn’t play, and Green-Beckham, whom the Eagles acquired Tuesday in a trade with Tennessee, wasn’t expected to play. But Green-Beckham was in uniform and went through pregame warmups with the rest of the team. He got into the game with the Eagles facing a 1st-and-goal at the 5 early in the third quarter. Backup quarterback tried a fade pass into the end zone, but he underthrew the 6-foot-5 Green-Beckham and the pass was broken up.\n\nFrank: Roseman's latest gamble a test of character\n\nTypically, injured players don’t travel under Eagles coach Doug Pederson. But Pederson made an exception for Wentz because he wants the quarterback around the team as much as possible so he can learn while he sits out with fractured ribs.\n\nThe Eagles are hoping that Wentz will be able to play in the preseason finale on Sept. 1 against the Jets.\n\n“He’s a quarterback and I want him involved in every single meeting, so we don’t stunt his growth,” Pederson said. “I want to continue that whole process with him. And [with] his injury, it’s a rib injury. [With] guys that have hamstrings and quads, it’s a little bit different.”\n\nPederson had said that Wentz is “day-to-day” as far as practicing, and it just depends on how much pain he can tolerate in his ribs while he recovers. But even if Wentz practices at some point soon, chances are that he won’t be involved in team drills.\n\nAs for Green-Beckham, it only made sense for him to travel. The Eagles acquired the wide receiver in exchange for reserve offensive lineman Dennis Kelly. Green-Beckham needs as much time as possible to get to know his new teammates and the Eagles’ offense.\n\nHe flew to Philadelphia from Tennessee on Tuesday, went through the walkthrough practice on Wednesday and traveled with the team to Pittsburgh. Green-Beckham will go through his first full practice with the Eagles on Saturday. The players have the day off Friday.\n\nNo doubt, the Eagles will be working feverishly to get Green-Beckham up to speed in time for the Eagles’ third preseason game, next Saturday night against the Colts in Indianapolis.\n\nSmallwood sits out\n\nRunning back Wendell Smallwood didn’t play Thursday night despite returning to practice last Saturday after missing the previous 12 days with a quad injury.\n\nSmallwood didn’t take part in team drills last Saturday and Sunday, the last time the Eagles practiced in pads. The Eagles wore shorts and shells both Monday and Tuesday and had a walkthrough practice on Wednesday.\n\nThe Wilmington native will have to wait until the Aug. 27 game against the Colts to make his NFL debut after missing the first two games.\n\nThe other Eagles who didn’t play were WR Hunter Sharp (hamstring), CB Jalen Mills (hamstring), WR Jordan Matthews (knee), LB Mychal Kendricks (hamstring), DT Mike Martin (knee) and CB JaCorey Shepherd.\n\nAs for the Steelers, they held out their offensive stars in quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, running backs Le’Veon Bell and DeAngelo Williams, and wide receiver Antonio Brown, but not because of injury.\n\nThe two teams play in Week 3 of the regular season, on Sept. 25, at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Phillips\n\nThe News Journal\n\nEditor’s Note: On Sept. 17, the country will celebrate Constitution Day. The following is part of a series The News Journal has put together with commentary that looks at the Constitution's most popular words, \"We The People.\" Topics pertaining to African-Americans, Muslims, birthright citizenship, same-sex marriage and the one-person, one-vote case will be explored.\n\nThere has always been a difference between what someone or something says, and what it actually means.\n\nIt’s the classic example of abiding by the letter of the law, or the spirit of it.\n\nThe first three words of the Preamble of the Constitution have always been the most popular. The ones that Americans love to use. But is it really as inclusive as it sounds?\n\n“We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”\n\nThat’s what it says, but to black people in this country, it’s not what it means.\n\nFrom slavery, to the three-fifths compromise, to Jim Crow laws and to the Fourteenth Amendment, ask us if we have ever been a part of “the people.”\n\nBecause when you really think about it, “the people” has historically only catered to white men. Women’s rights and the suffrage movement, along with the civil rights movement, prove that the “we” has always been a small group. Once you add in gay marriage and the rights for biracial couples to marry, it makes it even clearer that “we” has never been for “us.”\n\nFor some people in this country, black and white, Barack Obama was the answer. Because a black man had been elected as the leader of the free world, black people had finally made it.\n\nIt was the end of racism. Our fight against “the man” was finally over.\n\nBut I never bought that; I knew what Obama’s election really meant, the good and bad.\n\nOn the positive side, the unimaginable finally happened. There will be a generation of black kids who don’t know the significance of Barack Obama, because he’s the only president they’ve ever known. That is the epitome of the phrase, “ignorance is bliss.”\n\nI’ll never forget the joy I experienced on election night, or the tears of happiness I cried. I thought about my deceased mother who never got a chance to see it, but I did. I called my grandparents, and my grandfather told me about the disbelief his father experienced. My great-grandfather remembers seeing the first car drive past him, but seeing a black man in the Oval Office topped that.\n\nObama gave us hope, not a cure.\n\nThe negative was that some people, black and white, felt as though it was the end of the line.\n\n“We elected him. Be happy, don’t want for anything else.”\n\nAs if electing Obama was some kind of favor that magically washed away hundreds of years of oppression and racism.\n\n“So, to say Obama is progress is saying that he’s the first black person that is qualified to be president. That’s not black progress. That’s white progress. There’s been black people qualified to be president for hundreds of years... The question is, you know, my kids are smart, educated, beautiful, polite children. There have been smart, educated, beautiful, polite black children for hundreds of years. The advantage that my children have is that my children are encountering the nicest white people that America has ever produced. Let’s hope America keeps producing nicer white people.” – Chris Rock.\n\nThink about how the last 24 months in this country have played out for Black America.\n\nTrayvon Martin; Tamir Rice; Michael Brown; Cleveland; Charleston; Sandra Bland; Baltimore; McKinney, Texas; Eric Garner; Ferguson (twice); Lateef Dickerson and countless other injustices have taken place.\n\nSo excuse “us” if we don’t feel like the “we.”\n\nBecause we’re not mad, we’re pissed off. But here’s the thing about that feeling: we’re never allowed to feel it. Feeling emotional isn’t illegal or wrong, but when a group of people are continuously told to get over it, to turn the other cheek and to be the bigger person and forgive – that’s problematic.\n\nNo other race on Earth has gone through what we have, and then been told to let it go. For instance, most people don’t realize African Americans haven’t even been free as long as we were enslaved. But when the conversation about slavery is brought up, we’re told that enough time has passed for us to be over it.\n\nThat doesn’t work, especially when we didn’t sign up for that long boat ride across the Atlantic.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that things can’t change, and haven’t.\n\nI love this country, and couldn’t see myself living anywhere else. But that doesn’t mean I turn a blind eye to all of our issues in the name of patriotism.\n\nFor us to feel like the “we,” more needs to happen. Racism has been a hot topic lately, and it’s an uncomfortable conversation. Black people have to discuss things that are sensitive and hurtful, and white people have to sometimes look at themselves in the mirror and deal with harsh realities.\n\nThe conversation about race is a necessary evil in this country, but it’s one that has to be had. Not for us, but for our future.\n\nBecause maybe then, the word “we” will actually live up to its definition.\n\nCarron J. Phillips is the Engagement Editor at Delaware Online.

But Vance E. Thorpe Jr., 46, of Wilmington, said he had few options other than to return.\n\n\"If I didn't need to work, I would have walked off the job,\" Thorpe said. \"I have a brand new baby. He's 4 months old and I've got to support him.\"\n\nThe men filed a complaint with Millville police Thursday after they said nothing was done at work other than to take it down the following day.\n\nThe incident is being investigated, said Lt. Jody Farabella, a spokesman with the Millville police.\n\n\"It's listed as a harassment, but it's a potential biased incident here,\" Farabella said, adding the investigating officer had to do some more followup.\n\nThorpe said he's still fearful when he's at work.\n\n\"I probably won't have a job after this,\" Thorpe said. \"But I just feel I have to say something because you have to stop it somewhere or they're going to continue to do it and do it and then things could get worse.\n\n\"Somebody actually could be hurt. Thank God none of us were.\"\n\nThe incident took place Feb. 26 at Nipro Glass where they are working on an industrial furnace for the glass company. Thorpe said he'd returned from lunch and started to pick up a block, when he saw a noose hanging on the wall they were working on.\n\n\"At first I didn't want to believe that it was a racial thing and I said 'Well maybe they're getting ready to lift something up with it,' \"\n\nHe waited a while, but when no one used the noose, let alone touched it, Thorpe said he became offended.\n\nWhen he pointed the noose out to a fellow laborer who was white, Thorpe said the other man saw it \"and just kind of shook it off.\"\n\nBecoming more uncomfortable with the noose, Thorpe said he sought out Winters, who was driving a forklift and had him look at it.\n\n\"It didn't sit good with me either,\" Winters said. \"It was a noose, man. When I think of a noose, I think of a hanging.\"\n\nThere were other minorities at the site, but Winters said the rest of them shrugged it off.\n\n\"Me and Vance are the only ones who seemed to care about it,\" he said. \"Because I'm not going to let anybody get away with that. That's crazy. It's 2014. You can't do that at the work site or anywhere.\"\n\nThe morning after it happened, Thorpe and Winters spoke to their supervisor at Access Labor Services, a construction and industrial temporary service out of New Castle.\n\nThe men asked to be assigned to another site, but according to Thorpe, the supervisor was unable to because it was under short notice. He asked them to stick it out for another few days, but if there was another incident to leave the job site.\n\nThe men's supervisor declined comment when contacted at Access Labor. Calls to the contractor the men were working for, Byers Electrical Construction in Bear, and to Nipro Glass, were not returned.\n\nKaren Sutherland, a Seattle attorney whose practice deals with workplace issues, said she's heard of similar incidents, but did not know how prevalent they are.\n\n\"In terms of what to do in such situations, generally speaking, most companies have policies on who to report such incidents to; sometimes, the designated person is an human resources person and not the supervisor,\" she said.\n\nIf the person has already reported to whoever is listed in the policy, assuming there is a policy, then the other options, include making a complaint to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, state or local agencies the person has in the jurisdiction or contacting an attorney or group that protects people's rights.\n\nNeither men were aware of where to complain that day.\n\nWhen Thorpe returned to work, he spoke to the site foreman. The foreman removed the noose that was still hanging from the wall and asked Thorpe if he knew who had done this.\n\nThorpe said he'd been told it was one of the bricklayers, who'd started working at the site two days before. After initially defending the bricklayers, the foreman spoke to them only to return to say there was nothing he could do about it, Thorpe said.\n\nThat's because no threats were made to Thorpe.\n\n\"Because of the fact that they said that they didn't say anything to us, but that noose ... to me is a statement in itself,\" Thorpe said. \"That's just like you burn a cross in my yard. You don't have to say anything to me for me to understand that you're trying to do something to me or threaten me or harm me or get me fearful.\n\n\"It's almost like terroristic threatening by throwing that noose over there.\"\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2016/12/09/seedling-santa-delawares-christmas-tree-farmers-committed-crop/95082720/", "title": "From seedling to Santa, Delaware's Christmas tree farmers ...", "text": "Adam Duvernay\n\nThe News Journal\n\nSpend three decades meticulously cultivating trees needing eight to 15 years of love apiece and you'd think of them as your children, too.\n\nAt Turning Pointe Farm in Hartly, Roseann Conlon expects to send 200 to 300 of her grown babies home with families eager to deck their halls and transform them into Christmas centerpieces.\n\n\"I feel in some regards my trees are like my children. I never raised my children to keep them at home. I raised them to bring out their good characteristics and to give them the confidence to move out into the world and become beautiful people,\" Conlon said.\n\nColon and her husband in 2003 retired and made the Christmas tree farm they've operated since 1986 their full-time occupation. At around 7,000 trees, she thinks of her farm — one of more than 30 in Delaware — as a small one.\n\n\"When I work with the trees, I am in a place of great peace and great beauty,\" Conlon said.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nMost of Delaware's Christmas tree farms are small, family-run ventures like Turning Pointe. The crop doesn't require a lot of land, most of the state's farms are built on fewer than 10 acres.\n\n\"They're a pretty specialized form of agriculture. You don't often see a Christmas tree grower raising chickens or growing lima beans,\" said Dan Shortridge, communication director for the Delaware Department of Agriculture. \"Growing Christmas trees might be a good avenue for a non-traditional or new farmer who wants to carve out a niche, or it could be an option for a farmer in retirement.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture won't conduct its survey on Delaware Christmas tree farms again until next year, but in 2012 they covered 318 acres of land statewide. Two years later, a smaller survey of seven of the state's 31 farms found they did $315,000 in sales — $122,000 wholesale and $193,000 retail.\n\nTheir small size belies their importance and charm, Shortridge said, and the state offers them assistance on par with other agricultural projects.\n\nSTORY:Troops overseas have Christmas cookies courtesy of Middletown students\n\nSTORY:Holiday events light up Delaware this weekend and beyond\n\nSince 2009, the state has offered $77,000 to the Delaware Christmas Tree Growers Association from federal grants supporting speciality crops. The association also gets free space at the state fair and the state is in the process of launching a social media campaign promoting their products.\n\n\"It's a pretty simple equation: buying local helps keep a family farm operating,\" Shortridge said. \"Ninety-nine percent of our farms are family-owned, so when you buy local you're supporting a family business whether it's watermelon or a Christmas tree.\"\n\nThat matters to the Nichols family of Townsend, who for the past 17 years has shopped the extensive fields of Coleman's Christmas Tree Farm in Middletown, the state's largest at around 90 acres.\n\n\"It's a great experience. Busy on the weekends, but always good. Great trees, never had a problem,\" Eric Nichols said. \"You're getting it fresh, for sure. It's not something frozen out of Canada.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Eric and Stephanie Nichols brought their teenage sons and a hand saw to the farm. Out in the rows of grown trees, the boys chose and cut their favorite and even turned down a ride back to the register, preferring instead to haul their holiday staple back to the vehicle over their shoulders.\n\nBut where the Nichols might see an hour or two of simple Christmas joy, the man responsible for bringing that tree up from a seedling sees years of effort and two generations of agriculture.\n\n\"It's gotten a lot harder to take care of the trees,\" said Jack Coleman, whose father was the first to plant Christmas trees on the property and whose family still helps him operate the farm. \"I don't think they recognize how much work it is and how long it takes.\"\n\nThe farm's separate fields sprawl across the acreage in various stages of growth, some more recently clear cut parcels hosting yearlings just barely taller than twigs and others finally ready after the passing of eight to 10 winters.\n\nThe first trees saw planting there in the 1950s meant as wildlife cover, but by the '70s they'd come to represent another commercial crop. But the mono-culture has made disease and pests more difficult to combat.\n\nLike Santa Claus, tree farms have to push back against a perception they only work around the holidays. Toys for the whole world can't be built over just a few days, and Christmas trees need yearly shearing and constant attention to their health over years of growth\n\n\"They can get mites, they can get bag worms, there's a disease called rapid decline and Swiss needle cast that affect the needles on the trees. There's so many things that could go wrong,\" said Nadine Moody, Coleman's daughter.\n\n\"We work year-round on them. You plant them in the spring and you mow them all summer. I spray them for weeds and I spray them with a fungicide to prevent the rapid decline. I have to do the whole entire farm four times.\"\n\nCertain varieties of Christmas trees, such as the popular Fraser fir, can't grow in Delaware because it lacks the necessary altitude. But growers found their niche here regardless, and like all farmers they know there's more to what they do than just business.\n\n\"The most important thing for people to realize is Christmas trees as a crop are beneficial to our environment. Christmas trees capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and they will convert it in the presence of sunshine into oxygen,\" Conlon said. \"Everybody needs to breathe. Even though they're not flashy and they're not a one-year crop, they do something unique for our environment.\"\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 324-2785 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com.\n\nDelaware Christmas tree statistics, 2012\n\nTotal farms: 31\n\nTotal acres: 318\n\n1-2 acres: 7 farms\n\n3-4 acres: 6 farms\n\n5-9 acres: 13 farms\n\n10-19 acres: 4 farms\n\n100+ acres: 1 farm\n\nSource: USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/03/22/women-business-owners-delaware-beach-communities/6798293001/", "title": "How women business owners drive Delaware's beach communities", "text": "Women business owners are often the backbone of life in coastal Delaware.\n\nThey are the creative forces behind beloved restaurants and brunch spots at the beach.\n\nThey are the sometimes invisible leaders ensuring that homes of residents and visitors have working air conditioning in the summer.\n\nThey are the drivers of community as they offer cozy corners in used book shops and uplift local artists and vendors in their cafés.\n\nAnd since the pandemic, these women – both mothers and business owners – are finding new opportunities to challenge antiquated narratives about what is expected of them.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/12/16/children-channel-covid-19-concerns-letters-santa/6539855002/", "title": "Columbus-area children channel COVID-19 concerns in letters to ...", "text": "For many children, a letter to Santa might be the most important piece of mail they send all year. During the current pandemic, though, some of them are sounding a little different.\n\n“This Christmas is different than every other Christmas,” one girl wrote in green marker, her name signed in red. “We don’t get to hug or kiss our loved ones. We don’t get to share the Christmas spirit in our normal ways, so this year what I’d like for Christmas is for you to spread the Christmas spirit in ways we can’t.”\n\nThis letter, which requested no material gifts, was one of many collected at Butch Bando's Fantasy of Lights, a drive-thru lights show in Delaware, where children passing by in cars can hand their notes to a masked Mrs. Claus to drop in a large, lighted mailbox.\n\nMore:Santa visits amid pandemic a ho-ho-whole different experience this holiday season\n\nThis is the first time in the show's 21-year history that it has accepted letters for Santa, according to Theresa Bando, chief executive officer.\n\n“We’ve received well into the thousands,” said Bando, who scans each letter into an email that she sends back to parents so they know just what to put under the tree come Christmas morning.\n\nAnd although she and others who read and respond to these yuletide queries around central Ohio have been heartened to see that many children still have taken the traditional route of asking for the latest video game or doll, they can’t help but notice how some notes have served as a way for children to voice concerns about COVID-19 — and to receive a bit of reassurance from Old Saint Nick that things will be all right.\n\nSeveral letters answered mention how the sender should be put on the nice list because they have learned to socially distance well or worn their masks without a fuss. Some children want to know about Santa’s health and how the reindeer might be feeling.\n\nOne letter, turned in at the municipal building at Canal Winchester, read, \"I hope things are going well at the North Pole and that you and all the elves are practicing COVID-19 precautions,\"\n\nAnd a few can’t help but ask for Santa to work his magic — a Christmas miracle of sorts — to make the pandemic end.\n\n“You do see some letters where their wish is to make the virus go away or they ask, ‘Can you do anything to help this pandemic?’” said Greg Pearce, recreation coordinator for Pickerington Parks & Recreation, which has a mailbox with Santa painted on it sitting outside City Hall. “It’s really sweet, especially the ones that use the phonetic spelling for everything.”\n\nAt Easton Town Center — where children can drop off letters or send an email to Santa and receive a personalized video message back — chief executive Jen Peterson said their Santa has heard from a child requesting that presents be left at an outside fireplace so the gifts can “quarantine” for three days. There also was a boy who was disappointed that he couldn’t see his grandparents for the holidays.\n\n“Reassuring kids is definitely part of the message,” Peterson said.\n\nMore:Empty toy chests: As holidays approach, need grows amid pandemic but donations are down\n\nWith many Santa appearances canceled due to COVID-19, children haven’t been able to recite their list directly to St. Nick while sitting on his lap, and the meaning of these notes has only increased. Even for the few events that have featured the big man in red, plexiglass and social distancing requirements have often come between him and a child.\n\nFor that reason, many municipalities and businesses that collect letters to Santa have seen an increase from previous years in penned requests received. The pandemic prompted places, such as Butch Bando's, to set up a decorated mailbox for the first time to meet the demand of correspondences headed to the North Pole.\n\n“Each day we have a sizable amount,” said Hannah Voss, events and communications coordinator for the city of Canal Winchester, referencing the candy cane-striped bin outside the municipal building. “It seems like we’re ahead of (other years) since kids can’t see Santa in person and give him their list. Mail seems to be a safer option.”\n\nThough it has been a lot of work to collect, scan in and respond to letters, Bando said the task has brought her a lot of joy during these challenging times. She said she has been blown away by the selflessness of children asking for gifts for family members, wanting happiness for others and hoping for a coronavirus cure.\n\n“I’ve laughed, I’ve smiled, I’ve cried,” she said. “It touches you — the innocence.”\n\nMore:Make the season bright: Check out these Columbus-area holiday light displays\n\nAnd don't worry, some things never change — even during a pandemic.

When you need a break from the sights, stop at Sambo's Tavern in Leipsic.\n\nThe seasonal tavern was founded more than 50 years ago by Samuel \"Sambo\" Burrows. The locals know it's the go-to place for steamed crabs and cold beer.\n\n-Take a brewery tour: For being such a small state, Delaware sure has its fair share of breweries.\n\nThere's that little one in Milton that we all love, but if you've already been to Dogfish Head a billion times, check out others across the state: Twin Lakes in Greenville, Fordham and Dominion in Dover, Mispillion in Milford, Iron Hill in Wilmington and Newark, Stewart's in Bear, 16 Mile in Georgetown ... and the list goes on. For a full directory, check out visitdelaware.com.\n\n- Watch a horse race: Even if placing bets isn't your thing, watching a horse race at one of Delaware's three tracks is always a good people- and horse-watching time. Delaware Park in Stanton races May through October and offers meet-and-greets with the horses and jockeys in the gorgeous paddock. And several Kentucky Derby horses have gotten their start at the Stanton location.\n\nOr enjoy harness racing at Dover Downs or Harrington Raceway, both in Kent County.\n\n- Zip line through the trees\n\n: You no longer have to go to the rain forest or somewhere tropical to swing through the trees. In fact, you just have to go to Bear. It hasn't been around long, but the Go Ape Lums Pond zip lining and treetop adventure is wildly popular already. And with good reason: The four zip lining courses provide a scenic view over the 200-acre pond.\n\n- See a ballgame\n\n: Sure, Delaware may not be known for its professional sports teams, but there's plenty of sports action happening throughout the year.\n\nCheck out a Delaware 87ers game in the winter to see future NBA prospects. And in the spring and summer, the Blue Rocks provide a family-friendly atmosphere where you can watch future MLBers while eating and drinking food for a fraction of the cost of a Phillies game.\n\nIf football is your thing, check out a Blue Hens game in Newark during the fall.\n\n- Watch a re-enactment: Dover Days is one of Delaware's longest running events that celebrate First State history.\n\nIt's the only please in Delaware where you can see hundreds of children in colonial attire dancing around the maypole on Dover's historic Green. While there, explore Revolutionary War, Civil War and World War II encampments.\n\nThe festival runs May 1-3 this year.\n\n- Hit a festival: Delaware is quickly becoming a mecca for live music. Check out the growing and nationally acclaimed Firefly Live festival in June at Dover Downs, which draws big rock acts.\n\nOr this year, there'll be dueling country festivals: Big Barrel's 35-act list is led by headliners Carrie Underwood, Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert with Haggard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Loretta Lynn and critically adored indie country newcomer Sturgill Simpson on board. Delaware Junction will have Toby Keith, Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line.\n\nFirefly: June 18-21\n\nBig Barrel: June 26-28\n\nDelaware Junction: Aug. 14-16\n\n- Indulge in ice cream: Tucked away in Hockessin, Woodside Farm Creamery offers to-die-for dessert (or, let's be real, we could eat this for dinner, too). You certainly can't ever go wrong with the wacky flavors - bacon or dirt, anyone? Or if vanilla is more your thing, that's there as well.\n\nThe family-owned creamery is open from early April through late October.\n\n- Be spooked: Sure Frightland near Middletown is awesome but there's another, lesser-known and more \"very Delaware\" way to get your spook on during Halloween. You have to check out the Haunted Chicken House on Proctors Purchase Road near Hartly. In addition to some decked-out chicken houses full of scary characters, there's also a hayride through a junkyard and concessions.\n\n- Explore Amish country: You don't have to go across the state line to Lancaster County to find a simpler way of life. Just outside Dover, more than 1,500 Amish live. A drive through the area offers picturesque views of farmland, historic barns, plenty of churches and a few businesses - cabinet shops, blacksmiths, dry good stores - to stop at.\n\n- Head to a beach festival: Yes, a day at the beach, is a joy in itself but if you can only take so much sunbathing, check out one of the beach events:\n\nThe annual Sandcastle Contest (Aug. 1) at Fisherman's Beach at the north end of the Rehoboth Beach Boardwalk. More than 100 teams are expected to express their artistic flair. Past creations have included swamp animals, mermaids, crabs, dolphins, pyramids and of course traditional sandcastles.The best part about the event? It's free.\n\nThe Great Delaware Kite Festival (April 3) at Cape Henlopen. The competition is free and open to all age groups. Grab a kite or make your own and compete in several categories. Or just go to watch the kite-flyers in their glory.\n\n- Learn about Delaware's geological history: It would nearly be impossible to make a Delaware list and not include at least one DuPont-related activity.\n\nHagley Museum - the site of the gunpowder works founded by E. I. du Pont in 1802 - lets you explore more than just the family's history: It offers a walking tour of the grounds where visitors explore the geology of the Brandywine Valley and its impact on the milling industry.\n\n- Take a train ride with Santa:\n\nA train ride is fun any time of year, but there's something magical about a holiday ride through the woods along a winding creek, twinkly lights glittering through trees along the way. It's not quite the \"Polar Express\" but there is a special passenger who is quite familiar with the North Pole: Santa\n\n. From Thanksgiving through Christmas, the Wilmington & Western Railroad's Santa Express makes a 90-minute run from Greenbank Station in Prices Corner to Ashland and back. With Santa. And a little chocolate for the kids. If Santa's not your bag, they also do leaf-peeper rides, a Valentine's Day ride and other special events. It's a jolly good time.

It has very dense foliage and a lot of branches, so there’s no holes or open spots,” said DeLuca.\n\nThat brand of tree works well with one new trend, ornaments on thin, foot-long rods that can be stuck into the branches like a flower arrangement, instead of hung with hooks. These ornaments are usually larger and so decorating can take less time if you fill the tree with fewer, larger ornaments – and you don’t have to worry about finding hooks.\n\nA new favorite the past couple of years has been celestial lights by Season’s Designs that are figures like a penguin or Santa Claus in a chimney top that are about 2 to 3 feet tall and lighted from the inside, so the whole figure glows.\n\nAnother hot seller has been the infinity light by Melrose, where it looks like the lights around Santa or a reindeer go back endlessly.\n\nAs far as best sellers online, Amazon.com lists dozens of trending holiday decorations including:\n\nAn illusion doormat by WPOZD that looks like the Grinch is emerging from a black hole,\n\nTransparent gift boxes, lighted from the inside and wrapped with red bows, for indoor or outdoor use, plastic on a metal frame, by Funpeny,\n\nThree inflatable snowmen that look like they’re carrying each other on their shoulders, decked out with scarves, hats and candy canes, by Joiedomi.\n\nHow do your decorating habits compare with other Americans?\n\nWhen do you decorate for the holidays?

DIAA last held football finals at DSU in 2012, when Middletown shut out Salesianum 27-0 for the Division I title and Caravel topped Hodgson 39-29 in the Division II final.\n\nHOW READERS VOTEDRevealing readers' picks for high school football championship venue, top issue\n\n“They have invested over a half-million dollars in their locker rooms for football,” Baylor said. “And they have done some outside improvements to their stadium complex, which just made it an option for us to look at hosting tournaments there. Plus, it’s the central part of the state.”\n\nBaylor said tentative kickoff times on Nov. 29 are 6 p.m. for the Unified Flag Football championship, followed by the Class 3A final at 7:30.\n\nBaylor said the Class 1A championship is tentatively set to kick off at noon Saturday, Nov. 30, at Abessinio Stadium, with the Class 2A final to start at 4.\n\nThe doubleheader will be the first DIAA championship games played at Abessinio Stadium, located at the site of the former Baynard Stadium across the street from Salesianum School.\n\nThe stadium opened in 2020 after being completely rebuilt by the private school, facilitated by a $16 million gift from Salesianum graduate Rocco Abessinio.\n\n“We’re hoping that may be a more intimate atmosphere for championship football,” Baylor said. “I think their capacity is about 5,000 people. We’ll give it a try and see how it works out.”\n\nBaylor said DIAA has committed to holding the Class 3A and Unified Flag Football finals at DSU for the next two or three years. The agreement to hold the Class 1A and 2A football finals at Abessinio Stadium is for this year only, with an eye toward perhaps moving all of the football finals to DSU.\n\nBaylor said Alumni Stadium will also host the championship games of the DIAA Field Hockey Tournaments on Saturday, Nov. 9, with the Division I final tentatively starting at 1 p.m. and the Division II final following at 4.\n\n“One of the philosophies of the DIAA under my leadership is we want to be able to collaborate with all of our collegiate athletic programs to have tournament games at collegiate sites,” Baylor said. “We still have a partnership at UD, and we will maintain that partnership for basketball, volleyball and softball.”\n\nBaylor said he has met with officials from Delaware Technical Community College about the possibility of hosting DIAA tournament games in some sports.\n\n“We want to spread it around throughout the state,” Baylor said. “We want to show the partnership between DIAA and college-level sports because hopefully some of our student-athletes will consider going to our in-state schools to continue their athletic and academic careers.”\n\nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com.

Please support the work we're doing by subscribing to Delaware Online.\n\nWhen the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association board of directors met via teleconference on Friday to discuss the options for possibly salvaging a spring high school sports season, there were dozens of questions and no concrete answers.\n\nBut with Gov. Carney ordering all schools closed through May 15 to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, DIAA and its member schools still have plenty of time to work out the details of what abbreviated sports schedules could be.\n\nThe general consensus of the board was that if schools were to reopen on Monday, May 18, sports teams would likely need to practice for a week to make sure athletes were prepared to compete safely. Then after the Memorial Day weekend, competition would likely start on May 26 and run for three weeks, likely ending on June 12 or 13.\n\nAlthough nothing was taken off the table, competition would likely be limited to regular-season games, mostly played against conference opponents, with no state championships at the end.\n\n“My greatest concern is with our senior athletes, the ones that won’t have an opportunity to play sports in high school again,” said board member Dr. Kevin Fitzgerald, superintendent of the Caesar Rodney School District. “I think that if we could get a few games in, I certainly don’t think that it should result in a state championship. … I would really leave it to the conferences to modify a schedule as best that they can, and then I would support that.”\n\nSTAYING IN SHAPE:Eagles players finding creative ways to work out\n\nBoard chairperson Dr. Bradley Layfield, principal at Sussex Central High School, agreed.\n\n“I don’t foresee, if we can salvage any type of season, that we can put any legitimacy in any type of tournament or championship,” Layfield said.\n\nBoard member Bob Cilento, athletic director at Cape Henlopen High School, said Henlopen Conference ADs met via teleconference last week and worked out schedules in the team sports that would have schools playing six or seven games within divisions (for example, Henlopen North teams only playing other Henlopen North teams) in the May 26-June 13 timeframe.\n\nDIAA executive director Donna Polk said she spoke with conference presidents from around the state on Thursday, and all shared similar types of scheduling arrangements.\n\nBLUE HENS:With sports fields empty at UD, construction continues on Whitney Athletic Center\n\nPolk said Blue Hen Conference athletic directors had worked out seven-game schedules – all within Flight A or Flight B – for each sport.\n\nPolk said Diamond State Conference athletic directors were considering jamboree play dates – featuring multiple games on the same day – with the emphasis on recognizing seniors.\n\nPolk also said the Delaware Independent Schools Conference was considering playing games only against conference opponents.\n\nAll of those plans would exclude schools that are not in a conference – such as Salesianum, St. Mark’s, Caravel and St. Elizabeth. But Polk said St. Mark’s athletic director Matt Smith planned to contact non-conference schools about coming together for scheduling.\n\n“I think there are enough schools within the non-conference that would be able to reach out to each other to play, to get games in,” Polk said.\n\nBut at this point, there is no guarantee that every DIAA member school would want to participate in a spring sports season. Several board members said some private schools have an increased capacity to remain on schedule via online learning and may be able to finish their school years near the end of May, while most public schools would be more likely to extend their school years through the end of June.\n\nSo the next step is for Polk to reach out to each school, to determine how many would be willing to field spring sports teams, a process that she started Monday.\n\nThe DIAA board has two regularly scheduled monthly meetings – on April 9 and May 14 – to consider more possible options and finalize plans for a spring sports season before schools could reopen.\n\n“I think there are probably enough member schools that would like an opportunity to have some form of athletics, to salvage part of the season,” Layfield said. “We’ve got time. We can work on how that plan looks.”\n\nThe spring is the busiest season in high school sports, with DIAA-sanctioned competition in baseball, golf, boys and girls lacrosse, girls soccer, softball, boys and girls tennis and boys, girls and Unified track and field. So if an abbreviated, three-week season could be played, there would be a rush of activity on every campus at the end of each school day.\n\nIf issues around the coronavirus continue to worsen, at any time between now and May 15 Carney could order that schools remain closed through the end of the school year.\n\nBut at this point, DIAA still wants to provide hope to high school athletes and have a plan in place if there is a window of opportunity for schools to compete.\n\n“We want everyone to work together to provide the most opportunity for all athletes throughout the state,” Layfield said.\n\nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com.

Kyle Evans Gay introduced a package of bills last week aiming to give families greater assurance that Delaware's child care facilities \"are being held to the highest standards of safety and accountability,\" according to an announcement last week.\n\nTwo parts of the package look to help strengthen state oversight of such facilities, while another stands to help the same outfits better protect the safety of the young children they serve.\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 7 would direct the state's Department of Education to adopt an electronic licensing record system and registry of child care professionals by June 1, 2026, with a report on the agency’s progress due by the end of next January. This includes an online application process to join the system as well.\n\nSenate Bill 294 would eliminate the existing salary schedule for child care licensing specialists, supervisors and administrators, continuing a transfer of the Office of Child Care Licensing to DOE. This should allow for better alignment across staff salaries, according to lawmakers, attracting strong employees.\n\nSenate Bill 295 looks to reinforce that prospective child care professionals with prior experience must provide \"service letters\" to health care and child care facilities before they can be hired. Letters would need to include statements from prior employers regarding \"any concerns they have about the job candidate working with children and any warnings, reprimands, suspensions or discharge the job candidate received.\"\n\nCounty police:After 3-year-old nearly drowns in covered pool, Bear child care worker charged\n\n“As we expand access to childcare opportunities for more families, we also need to do more to make sure that providers have a strong, professional workforce and our state is doing its part to make sure licensed providers are implementing best practices to prevent children from being harmed,” Sen. Gay said in a press release May 8.\n\nRep. Cyndie Romer, prime sponsor of SJR 7 in the House, agreed.\n\n“Childcare isn't just a service,\" she said of the package headed to the Senate Education Committee for consideration. \"It's a fundamental support system for working families.\"\n\nHosted by Delaware Association for the Education of Young Children, Rodel and other partners, an \"Early Childhood Advocacy Day\" event is set for May 16 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Dover Library and then Legislative Hall. The free event hopes to bring providers, parents, advocates and lawmakers together.\n\nChild-care centers:Struggle for affordable child care persists in Delaware. That's for parents and providers\n\nLawmakers look to bolster mental health resources for high schoolers\n\nThe entire House said yes.\n\nLast Thursday, a bill sponsored by Rep. Valerie Longhurst among a list of fellow co-sponsors found support to move onto the Senate for consideration. The act aims to establish a mental health services unit for Delaware high schools, within three years.\n\nAt full structure, that's offering a final ratio of 250 students for one full-time school counselor, school social worker or licensed clinical social worker in Delaware's public schools. And the ratio for a full-time school psychologist would be 700 to one. Total cost by fiscal year 2026 is expected to reach $33.8 million, in combined local and state unit funds, according to the fiscal note.\n\nOne in 5 youth are affected by a mental health disorder nationally, the bill states with National Institute of Mental Health statistics, while some 50% of lifetime mental illnesses begin by age 14.\n\n“For the past several years our students have been forced to overcome an unprecedented set of barriers, and many are struggling with their mental health in ways many of us can’t even begin to understand,” said Longhurst, speaker of the house, in a statement.\n\n“Mental health providers save lives by creating spaces where students can feel comfortable working through their problems and developing solutions.”\n\nWith the marching orders to prioritize hiring in these roles, this act also creates a reimbursement program to encourage current school employees to gain certifications or licensure in \"critical need\" areas.\n\nFlashback in Leg Hall:Delaware lawmakers confront mental health crisis for teens with these bills last year\n\n2 Delaware students land scholarships at $25,000 and $10,000\n\nTwo Indian River School District students recently landed scholarships from the Horatio Alger Association.\n\nYamileth Lopez-Renoj of Sussex Central High School received a National Horatio Alger Scholarship valued at $25,000, according to the district, while Vivian Felipe-Lucas of Indian River High School was awarded a Delaware Horatio Alger Scholarship valued at $10,000.\n\nLopez-Renoj was the only student from Delaware to be named a 2024 National Scholar and just the seventh from Sussex Central. Felipe-Lucas was one of four students from Delaware and three from Sussex County to receive the state award.\n\n\"The Horatio Alger Association provides scholarship assistance to deserving young people who have demonstrated integrity, determination in overcoming personal adversity, academic potential and the personal aspiration to make a unique contribution to society,\" the district wrote in a press release last week. Each year, the association awards 100 national scholarships to seniors across the country.\n\nThat's more than $262 million to more than 35,000 students in the United States and Canada, since its 1984 inception.\n\nHigh school rankings:U.S. News & World Report just ranked Delaware’s top schools.

Leading up to their \"Empty Bowl Event\" on May 22, middle school and upper elementary students have been exploring food and water insecurity through research, readings and volunteering at the Delaware Food Bank, according to the school. Students have also crafted bowls and serving platters, with the help of The Clay Studio in Philadelphia, to provide at the event.\n\nTickets, purchased online, will include a handmade bowl, full dinner and an \"evening of fun\" as the school looks to bring the community together to recognize youngsters engaging in \"service-learning initiatives.\" Adults are $30; children, $10.\n\nSo far, according to a school spokesperson, students have raised about $1,000.\n\n\"The purpose of this event is to bring our community together to share a meal and raise money to support those who don't have access to food and water,\" students wrote on the event website they designed.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: WMS Empty Bowl Event\n\nWhen: 5:30 to 7:30, Wednesday, May 22\n\nWhere: Wilmington Montessori School — 1400 Harvey Road, Ardencroft\n\nTickets available at bit.ly/WMSEmptyBowl\n\nIndian River schools snag national distinction in STEM program\n\nGeorgetown Elementary, John M. Clayton Elementary and Millsboro Middle School were all recognized last week as a 2023-24 \"Distinguished Schools\" within a national network of STEM-focused education.\n\nProject Lead The Way — a nonprofit serving millions of PreK-12 students and teachers in schools across the U.S. with STEM curriculums, according to Indian River School District — gives the honor to a select number of schools for \"providing broad access to transformative learning\" through its materials.\n\nGeorgetown landed the recognition just three years into having the PLTW Launch programming. Millsboro just claimed the honor as a \"Distinguished Gateway School\" for the third year running.\n\n“Georgetown Elementary is proud to provide STEM education for every student,” said teacher Nicole Morey in a district press release. “Through the Project Lead the Way Launch program, students discover and learn through activities, projects and problems.\"\n\nStudies show, the district said in its announcement, that students decide as early as elementary school whether they like, or think they are any good at, math and science. For consideration here, schools had to have more than 75% student body participation.\n\n\"Whether designing a car safety belt or building digital animations based on their own short stories, PLTW Launch students engage in critical and creative thinking, build teamwork skills and develop a passion for and confidence in STEM subjects,\" the district wrote.\n\nHigh school rankings:U.S. News & World Report just ranked Delaware’s top schools.

The two formed an early connection.\n\nBy the time she was 6, she was already playing with older girls on Shore Byrds club teams operated by her mother Juli Byrd Bradford and aunt Jodi Byrd Holloman, a pair of former University of Delaware field hockey standouts.\n\nOne of those other girls was sister Morgan, two years older and now a Delmar senior set to begin her college hockey career with early entry to Delaware in February.\n\n“If one of us went outside, both of us went outside, competing with each other to make each other better,” Maci said. “It was always so fun to be out there with her. That’s where I am today, too, from her helping me.”\n\nWhere Maci Bradford now resides is in the No. 1 spot among Delaware high school field hockey players, having been voted the state’s Division II Player of the Year by coaches. It’s stiff competition, considering her fellow Delmar sophomore and first cousin Josie Holloman earned that honor in 2019.\n\nCHAMPS AGAIN: Delmar wins 5th straight hockey title\n\n“Josie is more of a defender and Maci had an outstanding attacking year,” said Delmar coach Jodi Holloman, Josie’s mother. “I don’t know if one is better than the other because they’re two totally different type players. The two of them really complement each other.\n\n“Maci was just outstanding attack-wise. She is just straight-up deadly in the circle. Her 3D skills, which are skills that not many high school kids can utilize consistently, are the best. Her hands are out of this world.”\n\n3D skills in field hockey involve being able to lift and scoop the ball over and around an opponent and her stick.\n\nBradford finished with 30 goals, a career high, and nine assists despite the 15-0, Division II state champion Wildcats playing fewer games than other years because of COVID-19 shortening the 2020 season.\n\nShe has 70 goals and 33 assists in her three varsity seasons.\n\n“When we’re thinking about a scouting report for Delmar, the first two people who come up are Maci and Josie,” said coach Kate Austin of Division I state champion Cape Henlopen. “Maci’s skill, she’s phenomenal. She can put a shot anywhere in the air. She always knows where it’s gonna go. Her 3D skills are incredible. She’s super deceptive and she can take the ball wherever she wants, whenever she wants. She’s hard to defend.”\n\nThose skills were honed in the fall of 2019 and winter of 2020 while Maci was in camp with the United States under-16 team. She and Josie both made the final cuts for the team that defeated Canada in three games at the Elite Athlete Training Center in Chula Vista, California, in February.\n\n“It was just unreal,” Maci said of training and competing in such an environment.\n\nA spring trip to England, however, and other U.S. team activity for the rest of 2020 were thwarted by COVID-19.\n\nALL-STATE FIELD HOCKEY: Delmar, Cape lead the way\n\n“The national team definitely helped me coming into the Delmar season from the competition of playing against better players than myself,” Maci said. “I knew I had to step up as a leader because I knew we were losing some players, too.”\n\nDelmar’s state championship was its fifth in a row and the Wildcats extended their winning streak to 77 games.\n\n“They’re learning so much because there are so many different styles of players,” Jodi Holloman said of the national team experience, “and they’re exposed to multiple, high-caliber coaches.\n\n\"Their coach, Katie O’Donnell Bam, is a former Olympian who was noted as the best field hockey player in the world at one time. Even throughout COVID they stayed in touch doing a lot of film stuff. They’re hoping to get back into the swing of things here soon.”\n\nAll those years of playing field hockey and watching others also taught Maci the value of diligence. She has been willing to put in the time to continuie to hone her own considerable skills.\n\n“It’s not an easy sport,” she said. “You have to work hard to figure out skills and everything. You always have to try hard.”\n\nThat’s especially true at her position, as an attacking midfielder who both provokes and finishes the attack but also is the first line of defense.\n\n“It’s a really challenging position because you’re playing offense but you’re playing defense and you’re also distributing the ball to your players,” she said. “You have to have a lot of game sense to play in the middle and direct your teammates and let them know where they should be going.”\n\nHaving already gone places and reached levels most field hockey players can only imagine, Maci Bradford aims to continue her growth and development. This summer she’ll begin seriously weighing the college scholarship offers that will besiege her.\n\nShe calls field hockey “a family tradition,” and continuing at the collegiate level will continue that legacy.\n\n“I just want to keep moving forward,” she said.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

The statute underscores that authority to regulate guns lies with the state and not localities.\n\nIn Delaware, you can't take guns into courthouses, Legislative Hall and state or federal buildings, unless you are a law-enforcement officer.\n\nThe issue is less clear on the municipal level. Dover and Wilmington believe they have the right to keep guns out. Citizens are screened when they enter the Louis L. Redding City/County Building in Wilmington. In Dover, officials are planning to screen people coming into Council chambers; they are just waiting on funding.\n\n\"Our main concern is to protect our employees. That's our top concern,\" said David Bonar, a Dover city councilman. \"There's no reason I can think of in the world for someone to want to bring a weapon into a government building or a city or county or any government chamber. That's just not appropriate.\"\n\nBut in some towns – like Newark – officials are less sure. Newark wants to take steps to protect people at Council meetings but is waiting to install screening equipment until it is clear what is permitted under the law.\n\n\"We just need to know what we're able to do because people are concerned,\" City Manager Carol Houck said of guns in Council chambers. \"It's not comfortable.\"\n\nOfficials around the country are tightening security in public spaces after horrific mass shootings, thwarted terror plots and, closer to home, the deaths of two women at the hand of a gunman at New Castle County Courthouse a year ago.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, towns also are precluded from regulating firearms. There, the Pennsylvania Municipal League has called for a ban on guns in municipal offices and chambers after a gunman fatally shot three people at a Ross Township Supervisors meeting in Monroe County last August.\n\nThe shooter, Rockne Newell, was upset because officials condemned his littered and dilapidated property, police said.\n\n\"I don't like the idea of guns at a meeting,\" Milford City Manager Dick Carmean said. \"I've never seen a fistfight break out, and no one's thrown a shoe at the mayor. But there's times when people can really get very upset, whether it's a $2 penalty on an electric bill or annexing the property next door.\"\n\nAttorney William J. Rhodunda Jr. was shocked to see guns in Newark's chambers last month, he said. The next day, he asked the city to investigate the situation.\n\nGiven the highly charged topics under discussion, particularly the controversial plans for a gas-fired power plant at a proposed data center project, Rhodunda imagined someone losing control and grabbing a gun from the closest holster, he said.\n\n\"Having a weapon at the meeting is a veiled threat,\" Rhodunda said. \"Either the General Assembly needs to change the law, or the city of Newark needs to decide what they want to run the risk of happening at their meetings. If someone were to get shot …\"\n\nPoll: Would you be comfortable sitting next to someone at a meeting wh...\n\nJohn Sigler, president of the NRA-affiliated Delaware State Sportsmen's Association, said the statute is \"relatively clear\" that municipalities are not permitted to regulate firearms in Delaware.\n\n\"The law speaks for itself,\" said Sigler, former state Republican Party chairman. \"The question is whether anybody is in the position to enforce it.\"\n\nTargeting local gun laws\n\nIt's legal to openly carry a firearm in public in Delaware or, with a permit, a concealed weapon.\n\nZingarelli, who belongs to the advocacy group Delaware Campaign for Liberty, said people should learn to be more comfortable around someone wearing a gun. He said a keycard security system is sufficient to control access to government facilities.\n\n\"You would only be making the environment more dangerous if you restrict people like myself from bringing a firearm in there,\" Zingarelli, a former U.S. Army combat medic, said of Council chambers.\n\n\"We can't let people further restrict our rights, because if we do, they're just going to set a precedent for restricting them more.\"\n\nEric Boye, state coordinator of Campaign for Liberty, said his group will fight local gun laws where it finds them. In recent weeks, members approached New Castle County and the town of Elsmere, pressuring both to rescind bans on firearms in public parks.\n\nCounty Council took no action. Elsmere is set to vote on a repeal Thursday, even though its ordinance dates to the early 1980s, and state law exempts those in place prior to July 1985.\n\n\"The people, we're awakening to a level that we weren't organized at before,\" Boye said. \"What's happening now is more of a long-term, sustained movement.\"\n\nIn Dover, his group has lobbied against legislation such as Senate Bill 23 and House Bill 62 that would allow Delaware municipalities to create firearm rules.\n\nGun advocates argue that navigating a patchwork of local gun laws is confusing, and that gun owners shouldn't be expected to know the municipal code each time they cross a town line.\n\nState Rep. Paul Baumbach, D-Newark, doesn't want all municipalities broadly regulating firearms but said towns should be able to restrict them in their buildings.\n\n\"I would not be comfortable in a City Council meeting if there were folks open carrying,\" Baumbach said. \"I'm not comfortable with open carry in our state, generally.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Dave Lawson, a gun-rights supporter, was disappointed to hear of gun owners \"flaunting\" their right to open carry at the Newark meeting, in part because of how it could rile up gun-control advocates.\n\nAs for how Newark could secure its building, Lawson suggests posting a sign outside.\n\n\"State law says that if it's posted, 'No Guns,' you can't do it,\" said Lawson, a retired state trooper who founded a Cheswold indoor firing range and gun shop.\n\nScreening the public\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Second Amendment does not prohibit laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in \"sensitive places such as schools and government buildings.\"\n\nThe open-carry demonstration in Newark was prompted by city talks about ongoing security upgrades and whether to hire a full-time security firm to screen visitors to the Municipal Building with metal detectors and X-ray machines.\n\nThose plans are on hold at least until officials clarify what they're allowed to do under the law, City Manager Houck said. Newark asked the Attorney General's Office to weigh in, but the state solicitor said Friday the office is not authorized by statute to provide legal advice to municipalities.\n\nFollowing a security assessment by the U.S. Marshal for Delaware last March, Newark installed reinforced doors, bulletproof glass and a security booth where guests must check in, show identification and declare their business with the city.\n\nPart of the concern over Newark's complex on South Main Street was the Aldermans Court, which is outside the state and magistrate court systems and, therefore, beyond the jurisdiction of the Capitol Police and constables, respectively. Newark Council recently OK'd a part-time bailiff for added court security.\n\nThe city also has experienced a breakdown in meeting decorum and civility in the last year, particularly since the disclosure of plans for the data center and gas-fired power plant at the former Chrysler site, officials said.\n\nThat has led to the presence of a police officer during the semi-monthly Council meetings. Officials are considering whether to send an officer when other commissions and boards convene, Houck said.\n\n\"Given the high emotions displayed at Council meetings, the police department ought to adopt a policy that people would have to check their guns with them and pick them up after the meeting,\" former Mayor Vance A. Funk III said.\n\n\"I feel that's a reasonable compromise. Let's face it: There's an armed officer right there for everyone's safety. What else do you need?\"\n\nPolice are also on duty during Wilmington, Dover and New Castle County council meetings. When a Dover official is concerned about public reaction to a contentious issue, a plainclothes officer will sit in the audience, Councilman Bonar said.\n\n\"What is a concern among law enforcement is the growing number of people who are applying for concealed-carry permits,\" Bonar said.\n\nThe number of permit applications increased nearly 30 percent last year from 2,739 in 2012 to 3,555, according to the Delaware Department of Justice.\n\nIn Wilmington, officials felt they needed more than just police presence to ensure the safety of officials and the public. Since the fall of 2002, everyone entering the Louis L. Redding City/County Building tower has to pass through metal detectors and submit to searches.\n\nFollowing the fatal shooting of a councilman at New York's City Hall the following year, an expanded lobby was built at the base of the tower to screen those headed to Council chambers.\n\nZingarelli and Boye are aware of Wilmington's policy but have not yet approached city officials to discuss it.\n\nCapitol Police installed metal detectors at the main entrance of Legislative Hall around the same time.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Lewis D. Schiliro said firearms generally are banned from government buildings in part for tactical reasons. Police arriving on a scene need to quickly identify the individual intending to do harm. Others carrying firearms – no matter how well-intentioned – could be mistaken as the active shooter.\n\n\"The officers need to know the only firearms in the building are those of law enforcement and the bad guy,\" Schiliro said.\n\nAlso, it takes significant training to use a firearm well in a crowded public place and under stress, he added.\n\n\"It creates more problems than it solves,\" Schiliro said. \"Unfortunately, the threat level we face today is different than 20 years ago. You have people taking guns into shopping malls, movie theaters and bringing weapons into city council meetings. From our standpoint, it's an officer-safety issue.\"\n\nContact Melissa Nann Burke at (302) 324-2329, mburke@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @nannburke.\n\nLOCALITIES RESTRICTED BY STATE LAW\n\n\"The municipal governments shall enact no law, ordinance or regulation prohibiting, restricting or licensing the ownership, transfer, possession or transportation of firearms or components of firearms or ammunition except that the discharge of a firearm may be regulated; provided any law, ordinance or regulation incorporates the justification defenses as found in Title 11.

He also seeks to improve the state’s “broken and underfunded education system” along with health care access and services.\n\nMeyer’s campaign expressed confidence in his candidacy and ability to win the seat, pointing to his widespread support and significant fundraising efforts.\n\nRELATED:Meyer leads among Democratic gubernatorial candidates, raising over $675K in donations\n\nYear-end campaign finance reports filed by the candidates in January show that Meyer has raised at least three times more than his Democratic opponents.\n\nMeyer has raised $675,357 last year compared with the $171,207 contributed to Hall-Long’s gubernatorial campaign, according to year-end campaign finance reports filed with the state Department of Elections. O’Mara raised $123,381 last year, campaign finance reports show.\n\nGot a tip? Contact Amanda Fries at afries@delawareonline.com.

Voting in the Sept. 10 primary began Wednesday, Aug. 28 and continues this week, running through Sunday, Sept. 8.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Editorial Board of DelawareOnline.com and The News Journal met with five of the six candidates seeking the state’s highest office. Each candidate brings strengths to their campaigns; each offers a different vision for the First State’s future.\n\nIn our conversations, each candidate acknowledged — and in some cases, shared — our ongoing frustrations about the pace at which legislation and change alike move in Dover. Most acknowledged that Delaware can do far better on issues like government transparency. And each of the five candidates we spoke with expressed a strong desire to move the Delaware electorate forward from the political polarization that has defined national politics over the last decade.\n\nWhile we will not endorse in the primary race — most Delawareans in both parties already likely know their own minds, we believe — we do offer undecided readers these impressions of the candidates we interviewed.\n\nMeet the candidates:These 4 statewide races have contested primaries in Delaware\n\nThe Democrats\n\nDelaware Democrats have managed through a summer that has been defined by a highly competitive contest for the top of the state ticket. Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, the political veteran who enjoys the support of the Delaware state party and many other establishment organizations within the Democratic milieu, faces competitive challengers in New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer and former state environmental secretary Collin O’Mara.\n\nAn August poll, conducted by Citizens for a New Delaware Way PAC, found Meyer leading the race, with the support of 27% of likely Democratic voters. Hall-Long netted the support of 23% and O’Mara followed with 11%. Still, some 31% of voters in the poll, conducted Aug. 8, were undecided. A later poll found Hall-Long's support slipping while O'Mara gained.\n\nThe Democratic race has been bruising, by all accounts. Hall-Long has faced bruising questions about her campaign finance and its history. In addition, developers unions and a New York compant with a longtime grudge have amplified attacks and pressure on all sides. The race has attracted considerable interest from donors — both in Delaware and outside the First State. In all, the campaigns have collectively raised more than $7 million, making the campaign one of the most expensive in state history.\n\nHere are some of our impressions of each candidate:\n\nCollin O’Mara\n\nThe former Delaware Secretary of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, O’Mara is a Bear resident who is now the CEO of the National Wildlife Federation in Washington. He left DNREC in 2014 and has waged an uphill battle with Democratic voters as a relative outsider.\n\nThat said, O’Mara represents a breath of fresh air for a Delaware Democratic Party steeped in custom and power. While Meyer and Hall-Long have gone on the offensive, O’Mara has preferred to position himself as a candidate who would challenge the First State’s long-held political norms.\n\nWe were especially taken with O’Mara’s interest in redefining the so-called Delaware Way. He supports — as do we — a rethinking of the way businesses is conducted in Dover both in terms of speed and transparency.\n\nO’Mara also said he’d use the powers of the Delaware governorship — among the more powerful in the country — to set an agenda that would tackle education funding, increased investment in climate change mitigation and clean energy jobs.\n\nDoing so, he said, would quicken the pace in Dover.\n\n“There’s not a will to get it done here if there’s pushback,” O’Mara said of the dynamic between the General Assembly and the administration of outgoing Gov. John Carney. “We don’t look at the benefits, so everything looks more expensive but that’s weaponized.”\n\nBethany Hall-Long\n\nThe lieutenant governor is always happy to share the story of her Sussex County roots and how they have shaped her perspectives as a leading Delaware Democrat. In our conversation, she cited her long experience as a nurse, educator, research scientist and politician and said her background and her longstanding service to the First State would guide her as governor.\n\nIndeed, Hall-Long’s command of the systems that deliver progress in Dover and Washington are strengths. Again and again, she mentioned collaborative efforts she’s mounted with lawmakers across the state and the nation to point to her capacity for success.\n\nTo her credit, too, she met our questions about the scrutiny she’s faced over questions about the history of her campaign finance. Forward-looking, Hall-Long said there was “no fraud” and expressed her hopes that Democratic voters would join her in an effort to “move forward.”\n\nOn policy, Hall-Long said she would focus on job growth and supporting Delaware’s small business. She spoke of her goal for Delaware to deliver on universal childcare and said she would create a cabinet-level position to address the needs of First State veterans and active-duty military personnel.\n\n“It’s not just about the policy,” Hall-Long told Delaware Online/The News Journal's editorial board members on Wednesday, Aug. 28. “It’s about having the capacity and the leadership to know where to take Delaware next.”\n\nMatt Meyer\n\nThe New Castle County Executive, first elected to office in 2016 as a political newcomer, is now the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for governor.\n\nMeyer’s ambitions for Delaware and for his own potential term as governor, shone through clearly in a conversation with our editorial board. He pledged to tackle education funding, to expand access to child care and affordable housing and discussed his desire to see Delaware become home to a medical school.\n\nMeyer also expressed frustration about the political culture in Dover — which he characterized as overly focused on catering to the needs of special interests rather than to cause of progress for average Delawareans.\n\n“It takes elected leaders who understand that our job, and my job, is to represent the people who don’t have a seat at the table, who don’t have a moneyed special interest in some decision making,” Meyer told us.\n\nAcknowledging that his resume does not include service in Dover, Meyer pointed to his success in building relationships with the New Castle County Council and with key players in county government to deliver progress. If elected, he said he would work quickly to build relationships with leaders in the General Assembly and in state government to build consensus around an agenda to drive progress.\n\nThe Republicans\n\nRepublicans also face a three-way choice as they select a nominee for governor. Members of the Delaware GOP will chose between state House Rep. Mike Ramone, former New York City police officer Jerrold Price and lifelong Bridgeville resident Bobby Williamson.\n\nOur editorial board met with two of the three candidates as voting got underway in the primary: Ramone and Price. Williamson, after repeated inquiry, did not respond for requests for an interview until this week — and cited his campaign’s inability to meet with us virtually due to bad WiFi access, an issue Williamson said was central to his campaign.\n\nGiven the Democratic Party’s longstanding grip on power across statewide office, the Republican race has attracted less attention — and far less financial support. Still, both Ramone and Price expressed their hopes to cool partisan rancor if elected. Neither mentioned former President Donald Trump in our conversations, even when asked about partisan alliances.\n\nHere are some of our impressions of each candidate:\n\nMike Ramone\n\nA veteran legislator in Dover who has long served in the state House of Representatives — he is now the House Minority Leader — Mike Ramone enjoys the endorsement of the Delaware Republican Party.\n\nRamone takes deep pride in his roots as a native Delawarean and said he believed his many — and sometimes controversial — experiences as an entrepreneur, along with his capacity for building relationships his party and across the aisle, would make him an effective governor. Indeed, at times, Ramone openly harkened back to a pre-Trump Delaware in which a socially moderate, fiscally conservative mindset prevailed among Delaware Republicans. Ramone said he believed that truly is still the case, even now.\n\n“I’m not deep blue, and I’m not scarlet red,” Ramone said, echoing stump speeches. “I’m Delaware yellow,” which he explained to be squarely in the middle of the political spectrum.\n\nRamone’s challenge, as we see it, will be to prove himself right — that Delaware Republicans, many in the thrall of the former president for much of the last decade — will accept a turn back to the political center.\n\nRamone made reasonable assertions about the state’s need to rethink its funding for education, investment in youth and in job growth when we talked policy. In addition, Ramone talked about what he characterized as an ongoing need for Delaware: he is committed to making the state more friendly to business at every level by reconsidering tax policy.\n\nJerry Price\n\nA former New York city police officer who retired to Lewes, Jerry Price told us his top priority as governor would be to focus on what he described as an ever-present crisis in public safety.\n\nPrice, who largely veered away from partisanship during our conversation, said that, if elected, he would work to convice Dover lawmakers to make significant investments in public safety and proposed adding police officers in departments across the state in an effort to create a more responsive and collaborative public safety network that could respond situationally to shootings and narcotics-related crimes, especially in Dover and Wilmington.\n\nOn social issues, though, it’s clear that Price is aligned with Republican culture warriors who want to roll back the clock on social issues like transgender rights. Price said he could not support transgender athletes competing in Delaware.\n\nOn policy, Price talked about the need for the First State to significantly reconsider the way it handles education funding and expressed his belief that schools are essential to building public safety. He has supported access to reproductive healthcare and for higher salaries for Delaware teachers.\n\nBobby Williamson\n\nWilliamson, who was unable to meet with our editorial board, has framed his candidacy around his deep roots in the First State. The Bridgeville resident is a fourth-generation Delawarean, according to his campaign website.\n\nAs DelawareOnline.com and The News Journal have reported, he has billed his candidacy around his identity as a political outsider who advocates for parental freedoms, children and small business. He has also said he supports preservation efforts across the state.\n\nWhen is the state primary election day in Delaware?\n\nThe primary election is Tuesday, Sept. 10.\n\nWhen is Election Day 2024?\n\nThe general election day is Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024.\n\nIs there early voting in Delaware?\n\nEarly voting continues until Sunday, Sept. 8.\n\nWhat do I need to vote early in Delaware?\n\nAt the polling site, a worker will ask you for proof of identity.

Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer and former secretary of Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Collin O’Mara – along with the Republican candidates – Jerrold Price, House Minority Leader Rep. Mike Ramone and Bobby Williamson – will each be facing a three-way race for First State voters next month.\n\nThe primary elections are set to take place on Tuesday, Sept. 10.\n\nThe winners of the Democratic and Republican primaries will then face each other in the general election, which is scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\nHere’s what we know about who has endorsed these candidates so far.\n\nUpcoming:Candidates for governor, congress to face off in Delaware Journalism Collaborative debates\n\nWho endorses Bethany Hall-Long?\n\nHall-Long has served as the state’s Lieutenant Governor since 2017, after spending over a decade in both the state Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nIf elected, Hall-Long aims to promote universal childcare and early education, increase access to affordable housing and expand the state’s workforce.\n\nSince announcing her candidacy, Hall-Long has received endorsements from several state officials – including current Governor John Carney – and several unions across the First State, including the Delaware AFL-CIO and the Delaware State Education Association (DSEA).\n\nAccording to DSEA President Stephanie Ingram, the organization supports Hall-Long in part because of her previous experience and dedication to improving the lives of all First State residents – specifically those of children and working families.\n\n“Lt. Gov Hall-Long shares our commitment to serving all of Delaware's students, and we are confident she will keep her promise to engage and partner with public school educators, parents and community members as we work together to strengthen public education in the First State,” Ingram, a fourth-grade teacher in the Colonial School District, said in a statement.\n\nAnd amid the release of a forensic audit of Hall-Long’s campaign finances this past July, many, including Senators Stephanie Hansen and Nicole Poore, have reaffirmed their support.\n\n“[Hall-Long] has the depth and breadth of experience in state government, and in the issues that matter most to Delawareans, that we need,” Hansen, who represents Middletown, said in a statement.\n\nPoore, who represents New Castle, also remarked on Hall-Long’s compassion and commitment in her years of public service, and how her track record should be driving this election, as opposed to simply merits.\n\nSen. Jack Walsh, who represents Christiana, who also endorsed Hall-Long, agreed, noting how she has a \"very deep understanding\" of Delaware's political landscape and a clear vision for its future.\n\nWho endorses Matt Meyer?\n\nA born-and-raised First Stater, Meyer was previously a small business owner and public school math teacher. He has served as New Castle County Executive since 2017.\n\nIf elected, Meyer intends to increase public safety, expand access to housing and healthcare and raise funding for public schools across the First State.\n\nOn Aug. 2, the American-Ethiopian Public Affairs Committee (AEPAC) unanimously voted to endorse Meyer’s campaign, specifically noting the executive’s previous business experience in Africa as a key factor for their support.\n\n“Given his life’s journey, from serving as the founder of a small business in Kenya to working as a diplomat in a war zone to teaching grade school math in our state’s classrooms, we are certain Matt Meyer is the right leader for Delaware and its growing Ethiopian American Community,” AEPAC executive chairman Mesfin Tegenu said in a press release that same day.\n\nThe AEPAC could not be reached for comment.\n\nFormer state chairman of the state Democratic Party Erik Raser-Schramm also endorsed Meyer, emphasizing his ability to consider new solutions and adapt to unexpected changes.\n\n“Sometimes when people are at a crossroads, they stop, or sometimes they turn back,” Raser-Schramm wrote in an op-ed for Delaware Online this past July. “As someone who worked with Meyer, I saw a leader who time and time again faced challenges head on, arrived at crossroads and saw the opportunity in adversity.”\n\nIn a statement to the press, Meyer's campaign also mentioned receiving support from the Delaware Democratic Party Pride Caucus.\n\nThe caucus also could not be reached for comment.\n\nRelated:This PAC says it doesn’t support candidates, but runs ad that lauds Matt Meyer\n\nWho endorses Collin O'Mara?\n\nThe first Democrat to file his candidacy, O’Mara currently serves as president and CEO of the non-profit National Wildlife Federation.\n\nAccording to his campaign website, if elected, O’Mara pledges to improve the state public education system, create sustainable jobs and help Delaware become the first state in the nation to achieve 100% clean energy and zero-net emissions.\n\nAccording to an Aug. 1 release, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) Action Fund and National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Action Fund collectively announced their endorsement for O’Mara.\n\nAs LCV Action Fund Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Tiernan Sittenfeld said in a statement, O’Mara has been a “tireless advocate” for both the environment and surrounding communities, and emphasized the need to have leaders who push for a cleaner, more sustainable future for all Delawareans.\n\nPresident and CEO of the NRDC Action Fund Manish Bapna echoed Sittenfeld’s sentiments, noting how O’Mara “knows how to bring people together to get big things done” amid an ongoing climate crisis, and will be considered “one of the nation’s greenest governors.”\n\nThat same day, LCV Action Fund, the NRDC Action Fund and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) Action Votes also announced an independent expenditure effort to help elect O’Mara in the Democratic primary election.\n\nAlong with other groups, these organizations intend to help “boost O’Mara’s candidacy” amid the ongoing race, including investing in running ad campaigns on both television and digital platforms.\n\nThe first endorsement for O’Mara’s campaign came from the Delaware Working Families Party this past spring.\n\nO'Mara's campaign also named additional endorsements from the Friends of the Earth Action Fund and the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund.\n\nAn in-depth look:Who has Working Families endorsed for Delaware governor, General Assembly?\n\nWho is endorsing GOP candidates?\n\nWith a Democratic dominance in state politics, the Republican slate of candidates for governor has fewer endorsements.\n\nThe Delaware Republican Party has thrown its support to political veteran Ramone. Ramone nor the Delaware Republican Party could not be reached for further comment.\n\nRamone, who represents Pike Creek, has held his seat in the House since 2008, and first announced his intentions to run in May instead of seeking reelection.\n\nWith no endorsements, Price asks those interested in contributing to his campaign to instead donate to St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital.\n\nA retired New York Police Department officer and Lewes resident, Price has a platform that includes advocating for insurance reform, expanding career readiness and vocational pathways and increasing the presence of law enforcement to combat violent crime.\n\nWilliamson appears to have support from community members, but no major endorsements.\n\nA lifelong Bridgeville resident and self-described businessman, Williamson intends to “advocate for law enforcement, public safety and reduction in crime,” support the growth of small businesses and defend protections under the Second Amendment, according to his campaign website.\n\nMore:Delaware's governor race gets crowded with 3-way primary for Republicans, Democrats\n\nOlivia Montes covers state government and community impact for Delaware Online/The News Journal.

Gov. Bethany Hall-Long's 35.9% and former state environmental secretary Collin O’Mara's15.6%.\n\nMeanwhile, state House Minority Leader Rep. Mike Ramone secured the Republican line against challengers former New York City and Rehoboth police officer Jerrold Price and lifelong Bridgeville resident Bobby Williamson.\n\nRESULTS:Delaware elections 2024: Check live for the latest primary election results\n\nMeyer’s success in the primary election is an upset to the Delaware political establishment that expected Hall-Long, as lieutenant governor, to be “next in line” for the governor’s seat.\n\nDelaware has not seen a governor's race upset like this since the 2008 Democratic Primary between then-Lt. Gov. John Carney and state Treasurer Jack Markell. Markell put up a fight, funneling millions of dollars into his campaign, and ultimately beat Carney in the primary election by 1,737 votes.\n\nNeither Markell nor Meyer were party favorites.\n\nEarly in Meyer's acceptance speech Tuesday night, he talked about how it was made clear when he got elected as New Castle County Executive that he was “not one of them.\"\n\nHe couldn’t sit by and let another election for governor go “without demanding better for everyone,\" he said.\n\n“We truly have changed the course of Delaware history,\" Meyer said. \"Let’s be honest, we were up against the endorsement of just about everyone.\n\n“Let’s be clear, what happened today had less to do with Bethany (Hall-Long) and less to do with Matt, and everything to do with Delaware.”\n\nRepublican primary results\n\nRamone, who has represented Pike Creek since 2008 in Delaware's House of Representatives, sailed through the Republican primary on Tuesday, securing over 70% of the votes.\n\nRamone’s campaign has prioritized advocating for healthcare reform, restructuring the state prison system and addressing ongoing opioid addiction.\n\nThroughout his time representing the 21st Senate District, Ramone has also served on state House administration, ethics, rules and veterans affairs committees.\n\nRamone, who was endorsed by the state Republican Party, will now face Meyer in the general election on Nov. 5.\n\n\"I am proud of the race we continue to run,\" Ramone said in a press release issued Tuesday night. \"I am not scarlet red or deep blue — I am Delaware yellow — and tonight we are one step closer to bringing balance back to Dover by focusing on Delaware, not politics.\"\n\nWith 99% of precincts reporting Tuesday night, Ramone took 72.5% of the vote, whereas Price captured 16.2% and Williamson took 11.3%.\n\nChallenges to Hall-Long's gubernatorial run\n\nPolls leading up to the Sept. 10 primary showed Hall-Long trailing Meyer by 13 points, with Hall-Long polling at 20% while Meyer was at 33%, according to a poll paid for by the Citizens for a New Delaware Way PAC and completed by Slingshot Strategies the week of Aug. 26.\n\nO’Mara remained at 11%, the same as a poll conducted by Slingshot Strategies at the beginning of August, with those who are undecided at 30%.\n\nThe Citizens for a New Delaware Way PAC, fueled by $1 million from New York translation company TransPerfect, went after Hall-Long for her campaign finance issues in attack ads and political mailers.\n\nThe spending is the latest in nearly a decade of TransPerfect CEO Phil Shawe’s high-dollar critiques of Delaware institutions that followed a 2015 decision by the state’s Chancery Court to order his company be auctioned off.\n\nThe damning element against Hall-Long's campaign for governor came in July when an independent audit by the state Department of Elections was conducted on the lieutenant governor’s past campaign finance reports.\n\nThe forensic audit conducted by Pennsylvania-based Forensic Litigation Consultants LLC’s Jeffrey Lampinski found Hall-Long's campaign finance reporting to be incomplete, inconsistent, inaccurate and misleading.\n\nThat report led to calls from other elected officials for a federal probe into her campaign finances and for a suspension of her campaign for governor.\n\nAfter the race was called Tuesday night, Hall-Long said she still feels that this was a “very negative campaign” − a sentiment she expressed in interviews leading up to the primary − and said that the “continuous, negative [and] false attacks played a major role” in this race.\n\nDespite this, she added that she is “so honored to serve this state,” and that she and her team “still have work to do” as the lieutenant governor.\n\nO'Mara, too, acknowledged the negativity of the governor's race this year, pledging to continue to work on \"critical issues of education equity, affordability, climate, and rebuilding\" the state's economy.\n\n\"While it's never easy to run as an outsider, we are incredibly proud that we ran an entirely positive, issue-based campaign during the most viciously negative primary in Delaware history,\" he said Tuesday night. \"We are deeply grateful to the hundreds of Delawareans who joined the campaign and believe in a better future.\"\n\nWhat to expect from Meyer and Ramone\n\nSince announcing his campaign, Meyer has long emphasized the importance of public service over self-interest.\n\nMeyer’s platform has also prioritized reform within the statewide public school system, increasing access to affordable housing and improving access to quality healthcare.\n\nMeyer has received endorsements from American-Ethiopian Public Affairs Committee (AEPAC), LGBTQ+ and Democratic Party activist Peter Rosenstein, as well as the editorial board from The Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nWhen asked how he’ll run his campaign now facing Ramone in the general election, he focused on education and affordability for all of Delaware.\n\n“There's no doubt that a large majority of Delawareans believe in the vision that the Democratic Party presents to this state,\" Meyer said. \"And bottom line is, they want schools that are higher quality. They want living that's more affordable, and we're gonna bring people together to present that vision to the people of this state.”\n\nRamone, who has represented Pike Creek since 2008, announced his gubernatorial campaign, opting not to seek re-election in the state House.\n\nRamone’s campaign has prioritized advocating for healthcare reform, restructuring the state prison system and addressing ongoing opioid addiction.\n\nThroughout his time representing the 21st Senate District, Ramone has also served on state House administration, ethics, rules and veterans affairs committees.\n\nRamone has also been endorsed by the Delaware Republican Party.\n\nMore on the candidates' priorities\n\nMATT MEYER:NCCo executive promises to focus on people vs. special interests in Delaware governor's race\n\nMIKE RAMONE:Delaware House minority leader aims to prioritize problem-solving in gubernatorial administration", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/05/matt-meyer-wins-race-delaware-governor/76082525007/", "title": "Matt Meyer wins the race for Delaware governor", "text": "Democratic candidate Matt Meyer will serve as Delaware’s next governor.

Before teaching, they worked as a legislative fellow for the State House Majority Caucus during the 2021 legislative session and as a policy analyst for the Delaware State Senate Majority Caucus during the 2023 legislative session.\n\nGould plans to run on the promises of advocating for sustainable development, creating more affordable housing and ensuring that land use decisions are designed to benefit historically neglected communities.\n\nIf elected, Gould would be the County Council’s first queer and nonbinary member.\n\n“I hope to make my family, friends, community, coworkers and neighbors proud by leveraging my privilege to encourage responsible development and positive, impactful change for those who need it most,” Gould said. “I truly believe that, if we strive to uplift everyone, our communities and businesses will thrive.”\n\nLongtime police officer to vie for Republican line for Delaware governor\n\nIn December, Price filed to run on the Republican line for Delaware governor in 2024.\n\nPrice is a retired New York Police Department officer, who moved to Delaware’s coast about 20 years ago. According to his campaign website, he later joined the Rehoboth Beach Police Department and has an extensive career in law enforcement.\n\nThe Republican gubernatorial candidate emphasized he would focus on insurance reform, nursing home financial fairness, drug crimes and rehabilitation, education and career readiness, and strengthening law enforcement.\n\n“My experiences have shaped my perspective, and I am compelled to address the pressing issues facing our beloved state,” Price said in his campaign literature. “Health challenges resulting from my past service limit my ability to patrol and protect, but they have not diminished my commitment to the well-being of Delawareans.”\n\nDover veteran vies for Republican line in congressional race\n\nDonyale Hall, a 53-year-old veteran, business owner and mother of 10, said she is seeking the Republican nomination for Delaware’s at-large U.S. House of Representatives seat.\n\nHall, a biracial African American woman from Dover who has run for political office before, said the platform she’s always run on resonates on any level.\n\nShe said she brings a “unique” perspective to the seat having served in the U.S. Air Force in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm; being a survivor of domestic violence; and overall understanding others who feel as though they have been forgotten or overlooked.\n\nHall also seeks to expand small business opportunities and improve the public education system.\n\n“I feel I bring unique vantage points to the things that I feel are problematic with our government,” Hall said. “I’m just continuing to forge a pathway that provides opportunity for people.”\n\nCarney considers mayoral run as Purzycki won't run for 3rd term\n\nWilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki, who easily won two terms as Delaware's largest city's mayor, announced he will not seek a third term, citing his age and desire to spend more time with family.\n\nRELATED:Carney expresses interest in Wilmington mayor after Purzycki announces he won't run in 2024\n\nPurzycki saw a city undergo tremendous economic development, while also struggling with ongoing crime. He previously served as the longtime executive director of the Riverfront Development Corp., seen as one of the architects in the development of the Wilmington Riverfront, and served on New Castle County Council in the early 1980s.\n\nFormer city treasurer Velda Jones-Potter announced her run for city mayor in March of 2023.\n\nFollowing the news of Purzycki not seeking reelection, Delaware Gov. John Carney said he is \"seriously considering\" running for the office.\n\n\"Tracey and I have lived in Wilmington for thirty years, and I care deeply about our city,\" he said on Wednesday. \"While I am focused on serving as Delaware's Governor, it's something I'm seriously considering.\"\n\nHall-Long announces run for Delaware governor\n\nLt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long has announced that she will run for governor in 2024.\n\nHall-Long, if elected, would be the state’s second female governor, following Ruth Ann Minner, who served in the early 2000s. She has spent two decades in public office.\n\nBACKGROUND:Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long announces 2024 run for governor. To face Matt Meyer in primary\n\n“There’s work to do to improve access to health care, create good-paying jobs, protect our rights and strengthen our education system – and I’m up for the challenge, because when you give a nurse a job -- that job gets done,” Hall-Long said in her campaign announcement.\n\nGay announces bid for lieutenant governor\n\nState Sen. Kyle Evans Gay, a Democrat representing North Wilmington, announced in late August the launch of her campaign for lieutenant governor, resulting in an even more competitive race for 2024.\n\nGay was elected to the legislature in 2020, when she flipped a Republican-held seat. The senator previously worked as deputy attorney general in the Delaware Department of Justice before going into private practice. Her campaign video, which featured her two young daughters, focused on parenting.\n\n“Delaware families know that raising kids is hard work, and it’s harder when the deck is stacked against working parents and working people,\" Gay said in her campaign announcement. \"It’s what drove me to run for the State Senate, where I worked to pass bills that make it easier for Delawareans to afford the basics and raise a family.\"\n\n“Delawareans know we have a lot more work to do,\" she said. \"That’s why I’m running for Lieutenant Governor: to make sure Delaware works for working people.”\n\nEugene Young to run for Congress\n\nEugene Young, former director of the Delaware State Housing Authority, announced this summer that he is running for Delaware’s at-large U.S. congressional seat.\n\nYoung, who made the announcement in a campaign email, has been viewed as a rising star in Delaware politics for years. If elected, Young would be the first Black man to represent Delaware in Washington, D.C.\n\n“I have a deep, abiding sense of commitment to the state and the people of this state because the state's done so much for me,” Young said in an interview. “So for me, it's about how I serve those men and women and families that make up this wonderful state.”\n\nBlunt Rochester enters as front runner to U.S. Senate race\n\nU.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, Delaware’s sole congresswoman, entered the 2024 U.S. Senate race Wednesday, June 21.\n\nBlunt Rochester, if elected, would become the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the fourth Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nREAD:Lisa Blunt Rochester, Delaware's sole congresswoman, will run to fill Carper's Senate seat\n\nThis announcement by Blunt Rochester has been highly anticipated, following U.S. Sen. Tom Carper’s retirement announcement in late May. The senior senator publicly called on the congresswoman to run – admitting she probably should have done so years ago.\n\nColleen Davis withdraws run for U.S. House seat\n\nColleen Davis, state treasurer, announced in July she would run for Delaware's at-large U.S. House of Representatives seat, but the statewide elected official on Feb. 28 said personal and family health concerns had prompted her to reconsider the run.\n\nDavis, 43, said she was withdrawing from the race after she and her family went through \"a great deal of difficulty,\" according to a post on her campaign's Facebook page. She said she recently learned that she had a genetic mutation that put her at an increased risk of cancer and has since had her ovaries removed and a double mastectomy performed.\n\nREAD:Democratic primary for US House seat down to 2 candidates after Davis drops out\n\n\"While I’m recovering well, this has all helped clarify my priorities at this time in my life,\" Davis said in an emailed statement. \"That family, and our health, always comes first.\"\n\nSarah McBride announces historic bid for Congress\n\nState Sen. Sarah McBride, the country’s highest-ranking transgender elected official, announced her candidacy Monday, June 26, to become Delaware’s next sole congresswoman.\n\nMcBride, if elected, would become the first trans person elected to federal office, catapulting the already nationally known politician to an even bigger stage. She would also be the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\n“It's clear that diversity in government is necessary for us to not just ensure we have a healthy democracy but also to truly deliver for people,” she said in an interview with Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nREAD:Sarah McBride announces run for US House seat to become first trans member of Congress\n\nRetired U.S. colonel to run for lieutenant governor\n\nDebbie Harrington, a retired U. S. Army colonel, will run for lieutenant governor in 2024.\n\nThe Middletown resident served in the Army for 25 years. In her retirement, she became an advocate for children with disabilities. Her daughter is visually impaired.\n\nHarrington, who has run unsuccessfully for other elected offices, is a vice chair of the state Democratic Party, as well as a part of Delaware State University's Board of Trustees, according to her website.\n\nShe is also vice chair of the Middletown Police Advisory Board.\n\nDorsey Walker announces bid for lieutenant governor\n\nRep. Sherry Dorsey Walker, a Wilmington Democrat, has announced her candidacy for lieutenant governor.\n\nDorsey Walker, who officially entered the race on Juneteenth, would become the state’s first Black woman to serve in this role. The representative previously ran for this seat in 2016, coming second to now Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long in the 2016 Democratic primary.\n\n“As Lt. Governor I will continue to be a boots-on-the-ground advocate for all Delaware citizens,” she said in her announcement. “My decision to announce on Juneteenth is symbolic of the advancements made by people of color, women, and those who seek the freedom that comes with change for the advancement of all mankind.”\n\nNew Castle County Executive Matt Meyer becomes first to announce bid for governor\n\nNew Castle County Executive Matt Meyer announced in early June that he will run for governor in 2024. He officially filed his candidacy on March 27.\n\nMeyer, who has been county executive since 2016, previously worked as a school teacher, attorney, entrepreneur and economic development adviser for the U.S. State Department in Iraq. He didn’t have much government experience before leading the state’s largest municipal government, which has an annual budget of about $300 million.\n\nREAD:New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer becomes first to enter 2024 governor's race\n\nHe signaled in his announcement that health care, affordable housing and education will be key issues in his campaign, noting the state “needs to move with greater urgency to tackle” these problems. Meyer has also been a polarizing figure. He has frequently publicly sparred with the county’s police union, which supported his opponent during his bid for county executive reelection in 2020.\n\nFormer DNREC Secretary Collin O'Mara first Democrat to officially file in gubernatorial race\n\nFormer Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary and current CEO of the nonprofit National Wildlife Federation became the first Democrat to file for the gubernatorial primary on March 13. He launched his campaign on the same day.\n\nIn his campaign announcement, O'Mara said he is running on a platform of fixing public schools; modernizing state infrastructure and economy; supporting working families and older Delawareans; addressing climate change; and passing amendments to protect Delawareans from discrimination, expand voting rights and widen access to health care.\n\nMORE:Former DNREC Secretary Collin O'Mara is first Democrat to file for gubernatorial primary\n\nFamiliar face Velda Jones-Potter launches Wilmington mayoral campaign\n\nFormer city treasurer Velda Jones-Potter announced her run for Wilmington mayor in March of 2023, launching the first mayoral campaign for the 2024 election in Delaware’s largest city.\n\nJones-Potter unsuccessfully ran for the city seat in 2020, trailing incumbent Mayor Mike Purzycki by just over 1,000 votes in the Democratic Primary. Purzycki captured 42.9% of the total vote, compared to Jones-Potter’s 35.6%. Former City Councilperson Justen Wright also vied for the Democratic nomination, garnering 21.5% of the vote.\n\nThe former city treasurer’s mayoral campaign touts a focus on making neighborhoods safer, empowering Wilmington residents and using city resources efficiently. Those efforts include:\n\nCreating an Office of Neighborhood Development to work across city departments and ensure needs of all neighborhoods are met.\n\nCollaborating with community and city public safety to address challenges in policing, fire and emergency services.\n\nImproving the city hiring process to promote diversity and establishing policies that promote social justice and economic equity.\n\nCreating policies to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in all transactions involving public funds.\n\nUpdating city facilities and infrastructure to implement smart-city technology and remove lead and other hazardous materials.\n\nWith Meyer gone, Marcus Henry, Karen Hartley-Nagle make play for New Castle County executive\n\nTwo familiar faces to New Castle County politics are vying for the county executive office.\n\nDemocrat Marcus Henry, son of former Sen. Margaret Rose Henry, began his campaign for county executive in April of last year.\n\nHenry has over 20 years of experience in public service and has worked for the past three county executive administrations, including as the general manager of the county Department of Community Services under current executive Matt Meyer and a brief stint as the county’s economic development director.\n\nHe has publicly stated his intention to bring transparency to the position and ensure that the county remains “a safe and flourishing home for residents, and an attractive destination for visitors.”\n\nThe Marcus Henry campaign did not directly respond to a request for comment.\n\nKaren Hartley-Nagle, current New Castle County Council President, announced her candidacy on March 24 of this year. She has served as council president for the past six years, with two left in her current term.\n\nHartley-Nagle previously served as a board member of Delaware Common Cause and the Coalition for Open Government and was a member of the New Castle County Board of Adjustment. She has publicly stated that as County Executive, her main focus would be on core services such as public safety, parks and recreation, libraries, land use and infrastructure.\n\nHartley-Nagle has come under scrutiny from her fellow council members in the past, and was under investigation for hostile work environment claims. As Council President she has focused on uplifting the county’s senior population and attracting business development to the area.\n\nCandidate enters Insurance Commissioner's race\n\nKayode Abegunde, a member of New Castle County's Financial Advisory Council, launched his campaign for insurance commissioner.\n\nAbegunde, a Democrat, previously lost in the primary to incumbent Trinidad Navarro, who has served in the role since 2016. The two will likely face off again in the primary. In his announcement, Abegunde said would \"bring more insurance products\" to Delaware and provide more options to veterans.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/17/delaware-election-governor-candidate-collin-omara-aims-to-build-legacy/74827463007/", "title": "Collin O'Mara aims to build a legacy in Delaware after decade in D.C.", "text": "Karl Baker\n\nSpotlight Delaware\n\nAI-assisted summary Collin O’Mara is running for governor of Delaware.\n\nHe is the last Democrat to announce his candidacy.\n\nO’Mara has spent the past decade working for the National Wildlife Federation.\n\nThis story was produced by Spotlight Delaware as part of a partnership with Delaware Online/The News Journal. For more about Spotlight Delaware, visit www.spotlightdelaware.org.\n\nFor most of the previous decade, Collin O’Mara hasn’t worked in Delaware. He also has never held an elected office in the state.\n\nAnd, he was the last Democrat last fall to announce his candidacy for governor.\n\nThose factors contribute to O’Mara’s biggest challenge in the race for governor: name recognition.\n\nHe is running against Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, who first made a name for herself with a long career in the state legislature, and New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer, who made a name for himself in leading the state’s most populous county through the COVID pandemic.\n\nAsked in April how he will effectively compete in the race with longtime Delawareans who each have significant public presences, O’Mara said he’s been meeting with advocacy groups across the state in an attempt to build a coalition around his left-of-center policies.\n\nO’Mara also argues that his competitors haven’t yet excited the electorate, despite their years of visibility.\n\n“There’s an opportunity for somebody who is outside the system to fill the vacuum,” he said, arguing he can gain traction with what he called a “much more detailed” policy stance.\n\nBy the end of the month, early results on his candidacy were mixed.\n\nOn April 30, the progressive Delaware Working Families Party endorsed O’Mara for governor.\n\nBut, on the same day, O’Mara attended a rally in Wilmington where community activist Keandra McDole spoke about her campaign to push for more Black judges to serve on Delaware courts.\n\nStanding tall behind her as she spoke were both O’Mara and Meyer – each seeking the elected position that would ultimately nominate the state’s next judges.\n\n“We need a governor in a position that we can work with,” McDole said during the rally. “And, that’s Matt Meyer.”\n\nBeyond a polite clap, O’Mara didn’t visibly react to the endorsement. Still, the episode highlighted the challenges facing his candidacy.\n\nO’Mara – who served as secretary of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control from 2009 to 2014 – said he anticipated such challenges when he announced his run for governor in December.\n\nIt was part of the reason why he lent the campaign $750,000.\n\nIt was a massive amount for politics in little Delaware where candidates often see bigger returns from attending community gatherings than from broadcasting ads on network television.\n\n“We wanted to signal that we’d be competitive from the beginning as a way also to instill confidence,” he said about his loan to his campaign.\n\nAsked how he funded the loan, O’Mara pointed to his career over the past decade outside of Delaware.\n\n“I’ve been paid very well by the National Wildlife Federation for going on 10 years now,” he said.\n\nThe organization’s public tax filings show his total annual compensation there has hovered around $400,000 in recent years.\n\nO’Mara also said his wife, Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, earns an even higher salary in her position as head of the immigration services nonprofit, Global Refuge. In 2022, the Baltimore-based organization reported her total compensation at over $500,000.\n\nLike her husband, Vignarajah has had political aspirations. In 2018 she ran a campaign to become Maryland’s next governor. Her loss in the primary was an outcome that the local news publication, Maryland Matters, attributed to her campaign going “underfunded.”\n\nWhile O’Mara and his wife still own a house in Maryland’s Washington, D.C., suburbs, he has lived in Delaware since 2009 and moved from Wilmington to Bear after buying a home there in September 2022.\n\n“The kids are in school here,” he said, referencing his two older of his three daughters.\n\nA conservation advocate\n\nIn 2014, O’Mara became president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation – a national nonprofit founded in 1936 that advocates for the protection of game, wildlife and public lands – after serving as Delaware’s chief environmental regulator during the previous five years under then-Gov. Jack Markell.\n\nAs the organization’s head, O’Mara traveled the country to highlight the policies it sought to promote, testified before Congressional committees, worked on proposals with federal officials and helped to raise additional funding.\n\nSince taking the helm, O’Mara has overseen a growing annual budget that has topped $100 million in recent years. Beyond staff salaries, that money has gone largely to programs for conservation advocacy and education efforts like the children’s magazine “Ranger Rick.”\n\nPast news stories from across the country have featured that advocacy around efforts of butterfly conservation, and wetland protection. Congressional records also show that the National Wildlife Federation spends tens of thousands annually to lobby federal lawmakers. Finally, the organization contributes to a slew of smaller local nonprofits and even to governmental authorities.\n\nUnder O’Mara’s direction in 2022, the NWF gave more than $2 million to a quasi-governmental entity that manages parks in the Los Angeles area. That same year, it gave about $100,000 to the Delaware Nature Society, as well as smaller contributions to several other environmental nonprofits in the mid-Atlantic.\n\nThe National Wildlife Federation also has had several subsidiaries, some with millions more in their annual budgets. And, at least one of them also paid O’Mara a separate salary.\n\nIn 2021, the organization’s political arm, the NWF Action Fund, reported compensation to O’Mara at $26,000, according to the organization’s most recent tax filing.\n\nUnconventional politics\n\nThe NWF Action Fund has made campaign contributions and endorsements that may surprise those who see it as a group aligned only with politically liberal causes.\n\nHighlighting that was its spending during the last election cycle, which had been funded by Sam Bankman-Fried – the now-disgraced former head of the crypto currency trading platform FTX.\n\nIn April 2022, Bankman-Fried gave the NWF Action Fund $810,000, according to federal election records. The donation was one of a spree of political contributions that he was directing then to politicians and organizations across the political spectrum.\n\nThe $810,000 also accounted for more than 97% of the NWF Action Fund’s contributions that year, according to the group’s federal election filings.\n\nOn the day it received Bankman-Fried’s money, the NWF Action Fund filed a federal report stating that it would spend about $91,742 for political mailers to be sent out to support the re-election of Arkansas Sen. John Boozman, a Republican.\n\nAbout a week later, Politico reported that the NWF Action Fund withdrew a spending pledge for Oregon Congressional candidate, Carrick Flynn, a Democrat who had separately benefitted from millions of dollars of Bankfried-Fried’s political advocacy.\n\nThe NWF Action Fund later announced it would contribute another $30,000 to Boozman’s campaign efforts. Later still, it pledged $50,000 to support the re-election of North Dakota Republican Sen. John Hoeven.\n\nFinally, in 2022, the NWF Action Fund endorsed a slate of candidates for Congress, including Sen. Katie Britt (R-Alabama), Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nevada), and Sen. John Thune (R-South Dakota).\n\nEach endorsement statement included quotes of support directly from O’Mara.\n\n“The people of South Dakota are fortunate to have a leader like Senator Thune in the U.S. Senate — and the National Wildlife Federation Action Fund is proud to endorse him for re-election,” O’Mara said in the group’s endorsement of Thune.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the contributions and endorsements, O’Mara said he’s “legally walled off from anything with the NWF Action Fund,” due to his current political campaign for Delaware governor.\n\nA spokesman for the NWF Action Fund said the 2022 contribution by Bankman-Fried supported efforts to build the fund’s “political program, including the support of our endorsed candidates from both parties.”\n\n“The National Wildlife Federation Action Fund supports candidates from both parties aligned with our work and values,” said the spokesman, Mike Saccone, in an email.\n\nBeyond political advocacy, the National Wildlife Federation also has a for-profit subsidiary called Garden for Wildlife that sells native plants online. A week ago, the company completed a “crowdfunding” stock offering, in which it says it raised more than $5.2 million.\n\nO’Mara said he has made no income and has no personal ownership in the company.\n\nA region’s bet on hydrogen\n\nO’Mara also said he makes no income from his role as chairman of an entity that seeks to carry out on a regional level President Joe Biden’s biggest energy initiative to date.\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub – or MACH2 – is a consortium of influential companies in the region, including DuPont, Bloom Energy, Croda, the Delaware City Refinery, and PSEG, the owner of the Salem nuclear power plant.\n\nThe consortium formed early last year to bid on a portion of the billions of dollars that Congress allocated within the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to incentivize investments in hydrogen fuel production.\n\nLast fall, the White House organized an event at the Port of Philadelphia where Biden announced that MACH2 and seven other regional organizations would receive hydrogen money. MACH2’s portion was $750 million.\n\nAlso speaking at the Philadelphia event was O’Mara. Though he had not yet announced his gubernatorial run, his speech there resembled the pomp and circumstance of a campaign launch for him.\n\n“The union-made hydrogen revolution starts right here, right now,” O’Mara said, while surrounded by political signs and shipping containers that read Bidenomics.\n\nAsked if he was the president’s chosen candidate for Delaware governor, O’Mara said, “I think the president has a strong relationship with all the candidates in the field.”\n\nMACH2’s exact plans have not been publicly released, but its promotional material states that the consortium of companies will partner to use electricity produced by offshore wind, solar, and nuclear to power that complicated chemical process of producing hydrogen.\n\nThat formula has drawn criticism from some environmentalists who argue that it is an inefficient use of green energy. O’Mara contends that a small portion of renewable energy should be reserved to produce hydrogen for heavy industries that rely on liquid fuels.\n\nThe pushback amounts to the second major alternative energy venture in Delaware that has sparked critiques from environmentalists.\n\nAnd, O’Mara has played a key role in each.\n\nFourteen years ago, while serving as DNREC’s secretary under Markell, O’Mara helped to bring the fuel cell manufacturer Bloom Energy to Delaware, which had suffered from the recent loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs.\n\nThough the plans had echoes of MACH2s proposal, the economic development deal that ultimately brought the company to the state became among the most controversial in Delaware history.\n\nMany have since argued that it was too expensive.\n\nEnvironmentalists criticized the deal for classifying Bloom Energy’s fuel cell generators as renewable energy, even though they run on natural gas.\n\nToday, Bloom Energy says it could power its generators on hydrogen fuel.\n\nFor his part, O’Mara notes that Bloom Energy employed 800 people in Delaware last year. He also stressed that he has never personally made money from Bloom Energy.\n\n“There’s nothing. There’s no financial ties at all,” he said.\n\nGet stories like this delivered to your email inbox by signing up for the free newsletter at spotlightdelaware.org/subscribe.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/31/candidates-delaware-governor-2024/74601098007/", "title": "Who are the candidates for Delaware governor?", "text": "Lifelong Bridgeville resident Bobby Williamson filing his candidacy to run for Delaware governor as a Republican sets up a three-way primary among Republican candidates.\n\nWilliamson will face state Rep.

Vaughn Bond Jr. also spoke at the gathering, often looking at family of homicide victims present. While he said police work is important in bringing criminals to justice, he said they still need the public's help.\n\n\"There's an urgency in the state of Delaware, not just the city of Wilmington, in the entire state of Delaware, for communities and police to come together,\" Bond said. \"There's an urgency for the community to come forward and to help us to solve these violent crimes that are taking place day in and day out.\n\n\"At the end of the day, regardless of how someone may feel about law enforcement, it's not about the Police Department. This is about the families, some of whom are represented here today.

He, too, was killed in Wilmington’s East Side neighborhood.\n\nTaquan Davis was fatally shot in Wilmington’s Hedgeville neighborhood on Sept. 12. The 19-year-old was shot in the 200 block of S. Harrison St. and later died at the hospital. Court documents say accused members of NorthPak attempted to kill Davis on the same night Ollier Henry was gunned down.\n\nShareef Hamilton was 21 when he was shot to death in the 1000 block of Delaware Ave. on Sept. 23. Emergency crews could be seen that night working on Hamilton outside the Dash In service station near Wilmington’s Cool Spring neighborhood.\n\nDakevis Reed was fatally shot, and a 17-year-old boy was critically injured, in the 100 block of Rose Lane in New Castle County’s Rosegate community. This shooting on Dec. 10 was the most violent day of a five-day stretch that saw 16 people shot across the state, seven of them fatally. On that single day, eight people were shot within a seven-hour period, including 29-year-old Reed.\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/11/18/wilmington-teen-northpak-gang-indicted-multiple-murder-charges-delaware/8671465002/", "title": "Wilmington teen linked to gang indicted on multiple murder charges", "text": "Another man has been indicted in an ongoing investigation against a Wilmington-area gang, identified as NorthPak by the Delaware Department of Justice, bringing the total number of people charged in this case to 15.\n\nIsrael Lecompte was indicted in early November, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Thursday, and was charged with 38 felonies, including murder.

He was diving, stretching, trying to get the ball over the goal line.\n\nJust like that, Seahawks' defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson knocked the ball out of his arms. The ball rolled slowly, agonizingly, through the end zone. Instead of a game-tying touchdown to start the second half, the Eagles came away with nothing.\n\nEagles running back LeGarrette Blount called it \"an unfortunate turn of events.\"\n\nIt was emblematic of the Eagles' night as they fell to the Seahawks 24-10 on Sunday night.\n\nToo many mistakes, too many penalties, too many missed chances. All of it led to the end of the Eagles' nine-game winning streak. The Eagles (10-2) also missed a chance to clinch the NFC East. And it doesn't get any easier as the Eagles will next face the Rams, who are 9-3, next Sunday in Los Angeles.\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\n\"Everything matters, particularly here down the stretch,\" Eagles coach Doug Pederson said. \"The beauty of the thing is that it's still in our control. Guys in the locker room are sick to their stomachs, obviously, for the loss. But at the same time, we have a great opportunity against another playoff-caliber football team.\"\n\nAnd that's the part that was so disappointing to the Eagles. As many mistakes as they made, they still had a chance, mainly because Wentz made some eye-opening plays in the second half, and wide receiver Nelson Agholor had a career game with 141 yards receiving.\n\nBut the mistakes conspired to doom the Eagles. There included Wentz's fumble, a holding penalty on Alshon Jeffery that negated a run by LeGarrette Blount down to the Seahawks 1 yard line, a missed 4th-and-3 late in the third quarter, and seven costly penalties for 64 yards.\n\n\"It’s definitely better when it’s a self-inflicted thing that you can correct,\" center Jason Kelce said. \"It’s not like, in my opinion, we were by far the worst team out there. We were the more undisciplined team, and that ended up culminating in putting us in a situation where we couldn’t win the game.\n\n\"I think it’s encouraging that as long as we get that fixed, we can beat a team like this, and we should beat a team like this.\"\n\nBut it also exposed how the Eagles can't afford those mistakes, especially against teams like the Seahawks (8-4) or the Rams. They couldn't take advantage of a Seahawks defense missing top defensive backs Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor.\n\nThe Eagles came into the game averaging an NFL-high 31.9 points per game. The Seahawks held them to three points through three quarters, when they trailed 17-3.\n\nBut Agholor, who had a career-high 141 yards receiving, caught a 51-yard strike from Wentz on 3rd-and-13 from the Eagles' 16, as Wentz scrambled to his right and threw just as Qunton Jefferson wrapped up Wentz's legs to bring him down.\n\nEAGLES: Determined to duplicate Seahawks' success\n\nHS FOOTBALL: Delmar fans celebrate state champs\n\nOn the next play, Wentz scrambled again and found Agholor in the end zone for a 27-yard TD, and the Eagles were within 17-10.\n\nBut Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson had some magic of his own. That included a scramble, then pitch to Mike Davis on 3rd-and-8. That play went for 23 yards.\n\n\"He’s a human joystick, man,\" Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said of Wilson, who went 20 of 31 for 227 yards and three touchdowns. \"Some of that stuff, he gets out of the pocket and your D-line can’t get to him ... He makes some great throws under pressure. And his ability to improvise … then he options, pitches it out. Those are things you can’t really prepare for.\n\nThe Eagles did not challenge whether that was an illegal forward lateral, which it might have been.\n\n\"In real time, it looked fine, it looked legit,\" Pederson said. \"We didn't get all the necessary looks. They hustled to the line. But at the same time, it looked good, and I trust the guys upstairs with those decisions.\"\n\nThe Seahawks eventually scored with 7:29 left to regain a two-touchdown lead. The Eagles had one last chance to get back into the game, but former Eagles cornerback Byron Maxwell intercepted Wentz in the end zone with 1:59 left to seal the win for the Seahawks.\n\n\"It's big for us to go out there and bounce back, don’t point the fingers and take care of our business,\" defensive end Brandon Graham said. \"It’s about us. We know what we have to clean up … It’s on us to do it, and we’re going to make sure we do it.\"\n\nHere are some other observations:\n\nErtz hurt, may have concussion\n\nEagles tight end Zach Ertz left the game in the third quarter with an apparent concussion. The Eagles faced a 3rd-and-3 from the Seattle 25 late in the third quarter when Wentz threw a quick slant to Ertz. He was well covered, and as he dove for the ball, his head hit the turf.\n\nErtz stayed down for a few minutes, then walked slowly off the field. He was taken to the locker room and didn't return. The Eagles didn't have an update on him after the game.\n\nSneaks automatic for Wentz\n\nWentz continues to be virtually automatic on quarterback sneaks, even though opponents have to know it's coming. He converted two Sunday night — one on 3rd-and-1 in the second quarter, another on 4th-and-1 in the third quarter.\n\nThat makes Wentz 12-for-12 on sneaks so far this season.\n\nTrailing rare for Eagles\n\nThe Eagles trailed at halftime for just the third time this season after falling behind against the Seahawks 10-3. The other times were on Sept. 17 against Kansas City when they were down 6-3 in their 27-20 loss, and on Nov. 19 at Dallas when they were down 9-7. In that game, the Eagles outscored the Cowboys 30-0 and won 37-9.\n\nThe Eagles trailed by 14 points in the second half, matching their largest deficit of the season. The Eagles also trailed by 14 in the Week 2 game against the Chiefs. They lost that one also.\n\nEllerbe active for 1st time\n\nDannell Ellerbe, the nine-year veteran whom the Eagles signed three weeks ago, was on the active roster for the first time Sunday night. That's because starter Joe Walker didn't play due to a neck injury. Najee Goode replaced Walker. He became the third player to start at middle linebacker this season. Jordan Hicks has been on injured reserve since Oct. 25.\n\nRookie WR Shelton Gibson was also active for the second straight week after sitting out the first 10 games. He apparently passed Marcus Johnson on the depth chart as Johnson was inactive for the second straight game. RB Wendell Smallwood was inactive for the third straight game. The other inactives were OL Will Beatty, DE Steven Means, DT Elijah Qualls and QB Nate Sudfeld.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Members of the gang who were arrested range in age from 15-23.\n\nThis is considered the \"largest indictment in memory\" by the Department of Justice in terms of the number of homicides and shootings involved in the charges.\n\nThe crimes include six slayings, five shootings with injuries and a bank robbery.\n\n\"The level of violence and brazenness alleged to have been exhibited by TMG members is shocking,\" Denn said. \"The number of shots being fired and the indiscriminate nature of the shootings are alarming.\"\n\nThe youngest alleged gang member, Raymire Briscoe, was 14 when he killed Dwayne Brown in the area of 10th and Kirkwood streets on May 8, 2014, according to court documents. Tymere Righter, 19, also was charged in connection with Brown's slaying.\n\n\"We want to send a message. ... There is no fame or glory to be had in using a gun,\" Denn said.\n\nFamily members of the gun violence were also in attendance and thanked law enforcement officials for their hard work in bringing their loved ones' killers to justice.\n\nBut no amount of closure will bring back their children, said Shareece White, whose 18-year-old son William Rollins was gunned down on Wilmington's streets.\n\nRollins was shot and killed at the corner of West 21st and Washington streets on Jan. 24.\n\n\"They didn't shoot my baby one time,\" she said through tears. \"They shot him multiple times.\"\n\nJohn Brisco, 18 – also known as \"Bin Laden\" – was charged with Rollins' death, as well as the murder of two other Wilmington men since 2013. He faces 21 charges, including murder, possession of a firearm, attempted robbery, among others, according to court documents.\n\nKadir McCoy, 17 – also known as \"D-Rose\" – also was charged with the murder of Rollins. He faces additional charges in relation to a slaying that occurred just days before that of Rollins, as well as robbery charges involving a WSFS Bank branch, carrying a concealed deadly weapon and others, according to court documents.\n\nRollins' mother pleaded with the community to come forward and speak up about what they see and hear in the streets – something Denn cited as key to making these arrests possible.\n\n\"It's not snitching,\" White said pausing. \"Save your own life. Because if you know something and they find out, they're coming for you next.\"\n\nWilmington homicide arrest rate triples\n\nGrowing up between the bullets in Wilmington\n\nWilmington Police Chief Bobby Cummings said Friday's arrests also pushed the city's homicide closure rate to 52 percent for 2015.\n\nJust last week, Cummings cited a 37 percent clearance rate for homicides this year — three times as many compared with 12 percent in 2014.\n\nTen of the 20 shooting homicides in the city this year have been closed with an arrest, Cummings said Friday.\n\nThe following individuals were indicted on 91 charges: John Brisco, 18; Raymire Briscoe, 15; Alexander Fitzgerald, 19; Bryant Hawkes, 20; Aquantay Garner, 19; Rylier Grayson, 20; Ronald Maddrey, 20; Kadir McCoy, 17; Tymere Righter, 19; Jacquez Robinson, 20; Randy Scott, 23; Jaymere White, 17; and Daymere Wisher, 16.\n\nThe indictment is thick and details criminal activity and gang participation from Jan. 1, 2013, to Aug. 26, 2015. Officials cite 45 different occasions during which gang members intimidated or engaged others in participating with the Touch Money Gang.\n\nOf those arrested, the following also were charged in unsolved murders from 2013 to 2015:\n\n• Brisco and Wisher – aka \"Day-Day\" – were charged with the murder of Ioannis Kostikidis, a security guard at the American Beauty School who was shot and killed during a robbery attempt at Sixth and Tatnall streets on Feb. 6 2013.\n\n• Brisco also was charged with the murder of 20-year-old Devon Lindsey, who was shot and killed on East 29th Street on Jan. 18.\n\n• Robinson, 20 – also known as \"Quez\" – was previously indicted in the murder of Malik Watson, who was killed on Ninth Street in New Castle on Nov. 26, 2014. Friday's announcement linked him to the gang activity, according to the indictment.\n\nThe city has seen 89 shootings this year, with 100 people hit. So far, the city is on par for killings compared with September 2014, but more shootings have occurred and more people have been injured in the crossfire.\n\nFamilies of those killed say their children were on their way to making changes and turning their lives around. Deshon Sellers had yet to celebrate his 18th birthday when he was shot and killed on East 24th Street near Carter Street on Feb. 16.\n\nHis mother, Lanita Brooks, said their family celebrated his twin sister's birthday this year but did so without their brother.\n\n\"In my 37 years, I've never experienced pain like that,\" she said.\n\nHer son left the house and within five minutes was fatally shot up the street, she said.\n\nFitzgerald, 19, was charged with murdering Sellers, according to the indictment.\n\n\"I knew my son wasn't going to make it,\" Brooks said through tears. \"He couldn't respond to me when I was there. ... I just want to say thank you to all of you all who worked on this case because without you this wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nCity officials recently credited the police department's involvement as one of five cities in the new federal Violence Reduction Network for helping raise the homicide arrest rate.\n\nThe network has provided additional resources, such as city police access to experienced federal government officials, collaboration with the state Office of the Attorney General to facilitate homicide arrests, as well as training for detective division officers in areas including homicide protocol, case management and crime-solving strategy.\n\nAnd the intensity of officers out on the street will be changing, Wilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams said Friday. As recently as last week, Williams said he advised the chief to to increase aggressive patrols and move people off street corners more often.\n\n\"Criminals stick together; law enforcement must stick together,\" he said. \"We have to stop looking at overtime dollars and things of that nature when people go out and commit heinous crimes and murder people. Life should not have a price on it.\"\n\nBut his resounding mantra, repeated numerous times Friday, was simple: Those coming to Wilmington to commit deadly crimes will be caught, one way or another.\n\n\"You come to Wilmington with a gun,\" he said, \"you're done.\"\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

His killer remains at large.\n\n\"You don't graduate from gangster. You don't retire from gangster,\" Wilmington Rev. Derrick Johnson told teens as he preached at the recent funeral of another teenager shot to death. \"You die or live the rest of your life in jail.\"\n\nA year ago, The News Journal documented how those age 12 to 17 are more likely to be shot in Wilmington than any other U.S. city, and how prosecutors believe the STK and OMB rivalry is responsible for much of that violence.\n\nGROWING UP UNDER FIRE\n\nWilmington: most dangerous place in America for youth\n\nWilmington suspects get younger, but their guns are more powerful\n\nYoung men charged as gang members rap about shootings, guns in music videos\n\nSince that September 2017 story, more than three dozen people 20 and younger have been shot in Wilmington. Nine of those have been fatal, and most, like Tunnell's murder, are unsolved.\n\nPolice do not report the names of victims of non-fatal shootings so it is unclear how many of those might be related to the STK and OMB rivalry. One indicted Shoot to Kill member was injured in a February shooting. Garcia, paralyzed from the neck down, was shot earlier this year.\n\nBut court documents and social media posts show that many young men continue to fall victim to this deadly rivalry.\n\nThis summer, prosecutors have indicted 17 accused OMB and STK members, primarily teens, on charges of felony gang participation.\n\nAll of those indicted for gang participation with OMB have previously been charged with such affiliation. The STK indictment adds new defendants to the gang's loosely defined membership.\n\nPrevious gang indictments included other heavy charges such as armed robbery and murder. The current round appears to be based largely on the defendants possessing guns and appearing together in music videos posted online as well as social media posts.\n\n“Under our current gang statute, even an Instagram post can be construed as promoting criminal activity by other members of the group,\" said Patrick Collins, an attorney representing two teens indicted in the most recent gang charges.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Justice declined to make prosecutors available for an interview on the indictment, and the full scope of the evidence against the defendants is unclear.\n\n\"Our prosecutors, working closely with law enforcement, have identified criminal street gangs as drivers of much of the violence in the city over the past several years,\" DOJ Spokesman Carl Kanefsky said in an email. \"Where the evidence supports criminal connections and multiple acts of violence, we bring gang prosecutions.\"\n\nThe names keep popping up\n\nOnline posts have been key to prosecutors establishing the existence of the OMB and STK gangs and their rivalry.\n\nThe groups are not like a traditional gang with a defined power structure and tangible goal such as drug sales. Prosecutors have described STK and OMB as bands of friends passing insults online and committing violence offline.\n\nEarlier this year, prosecutors used social media posts referencing gang slang and previous shootings as part of its successful effort to convince a jury that the murder of 15-year-old Brandon Wingo in 2016 was gang related.\n\nAt least part of the current indictment of STK members involves a music video depicting several accused gang members together.\n\nIn the videos, they rap openly about the violence, paying tribute to Jordan Ellerbe and Ryan Schneese. Young men from the Only My Brothers gang are believed to have carried out these shootings.\n\nOne YouTube video is listed in court records as evidence against those indicted as part of the Shoot To Kill gang. The video, titled “Bounce Out With That,'' is by the artist “Cbandz,” whose real name is Chaz T. Cowan, a 18-year-old charged as a member of STK.\n\nThe full video appears to have been removed from YouTube, but a 30-second clip is still available on Facebook. In it are references to “Jordan World,” shootings, robberies and drugs.\n\n\"Don't talk just shoot when we see the opps,\" Cowan states in the song. Police interpret the word \"opps\" to mean opposing gang members.\n\nAnother video posted online, titled “Letting Go” by the artist who calls himself “JordanWorldStoner,” features multiple young men who have been charged as members of the Shoot to Kill gang. The song itself talks about what these young men are willing to do for each other.\n\n\"I know that we gon’ slide and do drills for each other,” raps JordanWorldStoner. Prosecutors have reasoned in court that drills reference shooting.\n\nPart of the video is shot at the gravesite of David Bailey, who was killed last year in a Wilmington shooting. Police charged 17-year-old Aaron L. Miles with the murder of Bailey, whose cut-out appears in the music video.\n\nBailey’s mother, Tonya, said her son and Ellerbe knew each other through their groups of friends. Ellerbe was gunned down in 2015, and Tonya believes this perceived affiliation – and belief that Bailey was a gang member, too – got him killed.\n\nTonya Bailey was trying to move her son out of state when he was killed in 2017, shortly after being released from prison.\n\n\"My son died because of the gang violence, and it's not because he was a gang banger,\" Bailey said. \"It's because of who he was friends with.\"\n\nShe fears that the videos and social media posts will only continue the violence, especially when the music carries vague threats.\n\nMany of the young men who were friends with her son are paranoid of who may be shot next, especially in a city where surviving until your 18th or 21st birthday is \"making it,\" she said.\n\n\"It's sad that you have to walk on the streets in the city of Wilmington and be paranoid,\" Bailey said. \"I tell them, 'Focus on the gun violence and go higher in life. What do you want out of your life? Stop feeding into it.'\"\n\nIn the music video, as young men twist their hands into Js for Ellerbe, mimic shooting at the camera with their fingers and smoking blunts, they talk about their fallen friends.\n\n“I do this sh*t for Ry and I do this sh*t for Jordan. Can’t let them take my life, I bust my gun and keep it going. Can’t let them take my life, I bust my gun, I had to show them.”\n\nRyan Schneese's mother, Bethanne, hasn't yet gotten justice for her son's death, but she is hopeful that a new detective at Wilmington Police Department will find his killer.\n\nThe 21-year-old was shot twice on March 11 near Taylor and North Pine streets. He died two weeks later, after returning home from the hospital and falling ill.\n\nShe's doubtful that any of Ryan's friends will speak up.\n\n\"I used to tell him, 'They're no good, Ryan. Something is going to happen to you, and they're going to walk right past you and leave you,'\" Schneese said. \"But he never said anything about any gangs. He just always told me, because of Jordan, they don't like him.\"\n\nThat beef — and association with Ellerbe and his friends — is likely what got him killed. Schneese said police are looking into a young man connected with the OMB gang in his killing, but no charges have been filed.\n\nUntil Ellerbe was killed, Schneese said she didn't worry about her son's safety in Wilmington. He lived in the Hilltop neighborhood with his aunt and quickly befriended Ellerbe, who lived nearby. Prosecutors have described Ellerbe has an \"associate\" of STK gang members.\n\nNow, she's heartbroken over what she never knew.\n\n\"I didn't realize it was that deep,\" Schneese said of the violence surrounding her son. “It was over nothing.''\n\n“Just senseless crap,” she said.\n\nAugust 30th would have been Ryan’s 24th birthday. Schneese hopes to find a way to honor her \"miracle child,” a young man that survived numerous open heart surgeries, a pacemaker implant, and eventually, a heart transplant at 17.\n\nIn many ways, he was never expected to make it. She never imagined losing her son to gunfire.\n\nSchneese struggles to understand how the violence continues, especially when young men end up burying their friends.\n\n\"You’re so hurt because you lost your friend,” she said of the retaliatory violence, “but put yourself in another person’s position. Think about the family.”\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771, bhorn@delawareonline.com, or @brittanyhorn. Contact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787, xwilson@delawareonline.com, or @Ber_Xerxes.

The annual conference, coordinated in part by Wilmington Police Sgt. Bill Schmid, stretches the week and focuses on law enforcement, but expanded its first day this year to include those who see students where most of this behavior is beginning.\n\nBarrett, who has been working in gang prevention since 1999 when he worked as a school resource officer in Albany, New York, stressed that despite stereotypes portrayed in pop culture, groups of loosely affiliated teenagers are driving today’s gang culture. The teens use social media to insult and provoke each other, often resulting in gunfire that can be deadly.\n\nThe pattern matches a recent indictment of 28 young men, ages 16 to 21, for 109 felony charges including gang participation, assault and other charges in Wilmington.\n\nWhile the major organizations, like the Bloods and the Crips still exist, Barrett said it’s often the younger crews emulating what they see and hear in music videos and on TV that can be the most dangerous. Wilmington’s indictment explained a growing rivalry between the street gangs Only My Brothers, or OMB, and Shoot to Kill.\n\nSTORY: 6 teens added to Wilmington gang indictment; 28 arrested\n\nSTORY: Alleged gang member slips out side door of DOC center\n\n“We’re seeing a generation lost,” Barrett said, noting how many young men have been lost in Chicago neighborhoods and across the nation to gang violence. “We can’t keep saying they’re wannabes because, to me, a wannabe is a gonnabe. It’s just a matter of when.”\n\nThe information is even more important for educators to face, he said, especially because students are now carrying their frustrations from the streets into school. Because social media can reach anywhere, Barrett said, teachers and educators need to know what to look for and how to stop it when it comes into their purview.\n\nThe information – like recognizing gang signs, identifying traditional markings and understanding the lingo – isn’t new to most law enforcement officials working the streets, Schmid said, but getting it in front of teachers is a new step.\n\n“We, as law enforcement, can’t always be the enforcer all the time,” Schmid said, adding that many issues, especially those relating to gangs, may be visible within school walls. “They can educate them and help them work better with their problems while recognizing what’s in front of them.”\n\n“That way, we can let schools remain safe havens,” he said.\n\nThe conference will continue through Friday in Rehoboth. About 200 law enforcement officials flocked to the beach town for training and collaboration. That’s the only way to solve the problem, Barrett said – by working together.\n\n“We have gang problems no matter where you go,” he said. “Gangs are alternatives to the [traditional] family. … If there was an answer to this epidemic, I wouldn’t be here.”\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

News Journal\n\nTwelve days before Mother’s Day 2016, Tamra Bailey's phone lit up with messages and calls.\n\nThe news was grim. Her 25-year-old son, Tymeer, had been fatally shot near New Castle.\n\nOne year later, the same thing happened to her sister, Sherice Combs, when her son Bryan Brooks was gunned down in Wilmington.\n\nTheir sons were killed on April 25, one year apart – victims of Delaware’s gun violence epidemic that largely targets young African American men. The next place these women saw their sons was at the funeral home.\n\n“I know it’s rough for so many women. I just never thought...” Bailey said, trailing off. “I always used to say, 'Oh my God, I could not imagine that feeling.' ”\n\nNow, both sisters live it every day. They share a bond that is not uncommon in a city that has recorded more than 120 homicides in the last five years, where moms grieve the loss of a child or live in constant fear of their child being the next victim.\n\nDozens of these moms have found each other, gathering to meet in community centers and crowding into rowhome living rooms, the walls dotted with plaques and pictures of children they’ve lost.\n\nThey say they are the ones who understand each other’s grief and fear the most, their makeshift therapy groups marked with “mmhmms” and “that’s happened to me, too.”\n\n“I will say to rooms of white people: ‘Do you know anybody who's been murdered? Do you know anybody who's been to prison?’ and they will look at me like I’m crazy,” said David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. “I have never said that to a black friend or black colleagues and not have had essentially everybody respond with, ‘Well yes, of course.”\n\n“They do expect it. It is normal,” he said. “It’s the way community life in these places is and has been as long as anybody can remember.”\n\nIn cities like Wilmington, where the population doesn’t top 72,000 residents, everyone knows everyone – and everyone knows someone who has been affected by gun violence. Nationally, homicide remains the leading cause of death for black men ages 15-34, according to 2015 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most recent data available.\n\nThe chances of a mother knowing her child’s killer – or their parent – isn’t uncommon either. Nearly every mother in Wilmington can tell you who killed their son even if no arrest has been made. They’ve passed them on the street or attended barbecues together.\n\nThey may even still sit across the kitchen table from each other, depending on how long the friendship dates back.\n\n“She didn’t get up in the morning and make pancakes and tell (her son) to go kill someone,” said Dawn Mason. She said she has known the mother of her son’s killer for more than 20 years. The death of her 24-year-old son, Keith Mason, in Jan. 2015 remains unsolved.\n\nFor these mothers, Mother’s Day is just another reminder of the children they buried, and the pain that may never subside.\n\n“It’s so many mothers that’s going to follow us,” Tamra Bailey said, “that have already ... with the same story.”\n\nGoing through it alone\n\nInside the computer lab at the William “Hicks” Anderson Community Center, there weren't enough tissues to go around.\n\nThe faces of young men and the children they left behind stare back from photo collages made in their memory. Their mothers, often the only ones left to champion their justice, wear T-shirts emblazoned with a favorite photo and their child's nickname, accompanied by “R.I.P.”\n\nIt’s here, in groups called together by Facebook posts and late-night phone calls, that mothers convene.\n\n“I’m sure everybody in here that’s lost their child or any woman that’s lost their child,” Bailey said. “You might see me smiling but inside, basically I’m dying.”\n\nNearly all of the women gathered on a recent Saturday can name someone else who has also lost a child. And every one of these mothers gathered in a makeshift circle has yet to see an arrest in their child’s killing.\n\nYet all of them can describe details about the shootings – who was there, how many times their son was shot, who pulled the trigger – details relayed to them by friends or witnesses at the scene. None of these bystanders want to talk to police, but they’ll readily tell the mothers what and who they saw.\n\nThe streets talk, but not to law enforcement – and more murders go unsolved.\n\n“People don't want to deal with the police and they don't expect to get help from the police,” said Kennedy, who has long studied Wilmington and cities like it. “Not only do the cases not get cleared but people who are afraid of somebody, they don't call police either, which is another piece of this cycle of retaliation and trauma.”\n\nMore:Delaware shooting victim killed on anniversary of friend's death\n\nNationally, support groups formothers who lost relatives to violent crime don’t exist in the numbers that there are for parents of children lost to addiction or drunk driving. These mothers are left on their own, often feeling like they are the only one fighting to find their child's killer.\n\n“It is the people closest to the dead and the hurt who are most affected,” Kennedy said. “But it goes on and on and on and on. The community experience of the violence and the fear is just devastating.”\n\nIt happens in Fort Myers, Florida. In Rochester, New York. In Detroit, Michigan. And in dozens of cities throughout America where grieving families are not asked what happened to their child, but rather, what was he doing out at that hour and whether he was actually a victim, Kennedy said.\n\nIt is in these communities where society often asks families whether their child deserved to be killed.\n\n“When I started grieving, there was not any place for people of color to go to,” said 56-year-old Angela McClary, who started the Fort Myers, Florida-Lee County chapter of Parents of Murdered Children in 2016, two years after her son was killed.\n\n“A lot of people don’t know how to start their grieving and they don’t want their information to get out and they don’t want to get it out into the community in the wrong way.”\n\nIn the small city on the Gulf Coast about the same size as Wilmington, homicide numbers broke records earlier this decade, surpassing cities with far deadlier reputations like Compton, California.\n\nGrieving relatives feared not only for their safety but for relationships in the close-knit, historically African-American Fort Myers neighborhoods where many of the murders were concentrated and went unsolved, said McClary.\n\nAbout 1,400 miles away in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, three mothers who lost sons in a 2003 triple shooting maintain a memorial website in honor of the city’s homicide victims. The group, called Mothers Against Gun Violence, meets monthly to offer counseling and other supports to parents in need.\n\nAnd in Nashville, Clemmie Greenlee serves as the community’s rock, opening her heart and her home to families affected by the city’s violence. Greenlee lost her 29-year-old son, Roderiquez, to gun violence in 2003; her 18-year-old nephew in a fatal shooting three years ago; and her 18-year-old grandson, who was shot and killed in 2016.\n\n\"I had nobody to talk to (after my son's death) with all the pain and hurt and shock I was in,\" she said. \"I vowed to myself in the moments after he died, I would never let another mother go through the pain and shock alone as long as I was living.\"\n\n'I still need help now'\n\nInside a home in Wilmington's Riverside community last month, some moms crowded onto the couch with pictures of loved ones clutched in their laps. Others perched on stools, their legs twitching restlessly. A few leaned against the wall or settled on the floor, forming a makeshift circle as dusk fell outside.\n\nA Facebook call by Lanita Brooks drew about 18 people to the Wilmington home. Brooks had only expected two or three others. Though most didn’t know each other well, they recognized faces or last names as families began to share their stories. They were names that had dotted the obituaries in the past months and years, and silently connected them all.\n\nBrooks lost her 17-year-old son, Deshon Sellers, in 2015 when a member of the Touch Money Gang opened fire on him around the corner from their home, according to state prosecutors. The young man charged was indicted with 12 other members of the gang. In total, the group was charged in six Wilmington murders and five shootings, a small chunk of the 91 charges against them.\n\nThree years later, Alexander Fitzgerald, now 21, is set to go to trial this summer. But Brooks fears that justice may never be served.\n\nThe years since her son’s death have been nothing short of excruciating. The 40-year-old mother tried to kill herself after her son’s death but failed. Today, she remains on medication to help maintain an appetite, something she said she hasn’t had since her son’s killing.\n\nEach day, Brooks fights to keep her son’s memory alive, both in legacy and in law. She and her sister, Sharita Sewell, have accompanied state Attorney General Matt Denn to Legislative Hall on numerous occasions to help lobby for more restrictive gun laws.\n\n“I still need help now,” she told the gathered group tearfully, urging them to come together to support one another even if other government agencies seem to fail them.\n\n“It’s not fair because yes, Poppy (Deshon Sellers) was the victim but we’re all victims,” she said.\n\nSome mothers – like Jean Cameron, who lost her 31-year-old son, Clifton Thompson Jr. in Feb. 2016, and Beth Ann Schneese, who lost her 21-year-old son, Ryan, in March 2016 – fear closure may never come.\n\nReginald Waters, the man charged with Thompson’s killing, is scheduled to begin his trial Monday.\n\nSchneese said her son told her who shot him – wounds that led to his death about two weeks later. Police have not made an arrest.\n\n“I don’t have any hope no more,” she said, adding that her son’s death has upended her life. In addition to mental health issues, Schneese finds it nearly impossible to hold down a job in the wake of Ryan’s killing.\n\nMore:Growing up under fire: Wilmington, Delaware, leads U.S. in teen shootings\n\nIt is for all of these reasons that Brooks wants to unite this tragedy-stricken community. Her personal Facebook page has turned into a page for moms and family members to plan their next move.\n\nBrooks is trying to gather parents on June 2 at Grace United Methodist Church on North Washington Street to create a documentary about their loss.\n\nThe goal is to not lose touch with each other.\n\n“We gotta stick together,” Brooks said tearfully, “because it’s the only way we’re gonna stop this.”\n\n'I know all these babies'\n\nWhen Mother's Day comes, each mom will awaken and face the day without their child – some for the first time.\n\nJackie Kinard will visit Silverbrook Cemetery in memory of her son, Terrance, who was gunned down the day before Mother’s Day in 2016. Nearly 10 years before, gun violence took her 21-year-old son, Omar. The holiday, she said, will never be the same.\n\nDawn Mason will hit replay over and over again Sunday just to hear the sounds of her son, Keith, singing Tupac’s “Dear Mama” through her phone speakers. It’s all she has left of her son, who was the city's first murder victim of 2015.\n\nTondra Mangrum may barbecue, even if her grill master isn’t at his rightful spot. Her son, Jamar Kilgoe, was killed inside the Rose Hill Community Center in February 2015. Last year, on the day after Mother’s Day, her youngest son was left paralyzed from the waist down due to gun violence.\n\nThe list will continue to grow, they fear, if more isn’t done to address the root causes of Wilmington’s violence.\n\nShootings are down this year under the leadership of Wilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy, who pledged to bring a new strategy to the city to respond more quickly to shootings and identify those most likely to become targets.\n\nBecause much of this strategy plays out in police investigations, it is hard to say how successful the initiative has been in solving crimes. The department earlier this week pointed to a 63 percent reduction in gun-related homicides and a 61 percent reduction in shootings so far this year.\n\nThose numbers take into account Monday morning’s homicide that claimed the life of 35-year-old Khalif Friend, who was found shot to death in a vehicle.\n\nBoth Mayor Mike Purzycki and Tracy were cautiously optimistic about the numbers, especially heading into summer – when crime notoriously spikes with the temperature.\n\n“Neither the chief nor I know whether these improving numbers will continue throughout the year,” Purzycki said in a statement. “But it is encouraging to know that the WPD’s new emphasis on community engagement, intelligence-led policing, directed patrols and instituting the CompStat methodology are producing better results than we have seen in the past few years.”\n\nIt’s going to take a lot of work to undo the “horrific, historical prejudice and oppression and current, at best, racism and neglect” of largely black communities that has allowed violence to go unchecked for decades, said Kennedy, who worked with Tracy in the past.\n\nHe said while Wilmington is showing progress, the battle to undo the effects of gun violence can be slow and difficult work.\n\nMore:Wilmington suspects get younger, but their guns are more powerful\n\nTake the city’s latest homicide, a killing that struck Jackie Kinard as the latest blow in an already difficult week.\n\nKhalif Friend steadfastly brought the Wilmington mother flowers on the anniversary of her son, Terrance’s death. He would again appear on Mother’s Day, bearing gifts her two sons – victims of the city’s killings – couldn’t bring themselves.\n\nLess than two weeks before, Friend stood at the gravesite of Bryan Brooks and Tymeer Bailey, releasing balloons in honor of his cousins.\n\nNow, he’s another young man Kinard says the city stole from them.\n\n“It’s been a living hell,” Kinard said of her experience in Wilmington. “When I go to the cemetery, I don’t visit one son. I visit two.”\n\nAnd during those visits, Kinard quickly came to find she knew far more people buried in Silverbrook Cemetery.\n\n“Oh my god,” Kinard recalled thinking. “I know all these babies.”\n\nBetween her and her husband, Kelly Harrison, they can name about 15 to 20 mothers affected by the city’s gun violence, and another 50 who have lost someone. Harrison’s son, McKinley Harden, was stabbed to death in Wilmington more than a decade ago.\n\nStill, they can’t bring themselves to leave the city they’ve known all their lives. They argue they should not have to, that violence should not be able to run residents from the streets.\n\nEvery shooting rocks Kinard's and Harrison’s home. Kinard has a daughter and son, both of whom live in Wilmington, along with grandchildren and extended family and friends.\n\n“You go straight into panic mode,” Kinard said. “Is it my baby? Is it my family?”\n\nThis network of grief weaves through Wilmington and some of its suburbs, sliding inside households and leaving in its wake empty seats at dinner tables and photo collages from funerals held too soon. Kinard and mothers like her have too many empty chairs.\n\nStill, they hope. Still, they pray – that other mothers and families will never have to experience their pain, their loss.\n\nDespite all of the ways in which violence has ripped through her family’s lives, Tondra Mangrum knows that nearly every family in Wilmington is “going through something.”\n\nYet, she believes in forgiveness.\n\n“I got to,” Mangrum said, “because I want to see my son again. And if I don’t forgive, I’m not.”\n\nFollow Brittany Horn on Twitter @brittanyhorn", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/04/04/diamonte-taylor-faces-life-prison-murder-brandon-wingo/482441002/", "title": "Brandon Wingo shooter found guilty, faces life sentence", "text": "Diamonte Taylor faces life in prison after being found guilty of first-degree murder in the shooting death of 15-year-old Brandon Wingo.\n\nAfter deliberating for about two days, the jury on Wednesday returned guilty verdicts on charges of murder, assault, gang participation and aggravated menacing. Taylor had also been charged with shooting another person and threatening two associates of a rival street gang the month he killed Wingo.\n\nProsecutors said Taylor, 20, shot Wingo as part of a violent war between rival teen groups in the city in May 2016.\n\n\"It was insane: the back and forth between rival gangs that spring leading into summer and it had to stop,\" said Deputy Attorney General Mark Denney.\n\nTaylor was one of three alleged members of the Shoot to Kill gang indicted for several felonies including the death of Wingo, who was gunned down while walking home on Clifford Brown Walk from Howard High School of Technology.\n\nA former STK gang member said Wingo was killed as part of his gang's rivalry with the Only My Brothers gang and was targeted after he posted a message on Facebook disrespecting an STK associate.\n\nWhile more notorious gangs are bound by a common trade like drug dealing, prosecutors said the rivalry between the two street gangs played out in violent emotion on social media.\n\n\"This was not the type of gang that was centered around a business, or an enterprise or even drug dealing,\" Denney said after the verdict. \"It was centered around shooting and Shoot to Kill was a fitting name.\"\n\nProsecutors entered into evidence posts threatening violence against OMB members that showed STK members contorting their fingers to upside down Bs, meant as a sign of disrespect for the deceased Wingo.\n\nProsecutors showed the jury a Facebook post from after the murder that they said Taylor's co-defendant put up suggesting Wingo should have left his book bag at school so \"he would have been lighter on his feet.\"\n\nStudents who were walking with Wingo the day he died told the jury they were approached by a man in a black coat who killed Wingo, but prosecutors found it difficult to present witnesses that put Taylor specifically at the scene.\n\nOne woman who said she saw Taylor run from the scene contradicted herself numerous times while another student who identified Taylor told the jury she felt pressured by investigators to pin the shooting on him.\n\nEvidence putting Taylor at the scene and planning the murder largely came from Kevon Harris-Dickerson, a former STK member who was indicted alongside Taylor. After the verdict, Deputy Attorney General Matthew Frawley said Harris-Dickerson was an \"important\" part of the case.\n\n\"Someone like that is able to give you information you would not otherwise be able to ascertain unless you are talking to someone who is actually in the gang and can talk about motives, how they facilitated crimes and what their motives were,\" Frawley said.\n\nHarris-Dickerson told the jury Taylor and Zaahir Smith, 20, the other of the three indicted for the murder, discussed shooting Wingo or any other of STK's rival Only my Brothers gang after Wingo put a post on Facebook disrespecting a dead STK associate.\n\nHarris-Dickerson said the feud between STK and OMB began with the Jan. 2015 death of Jordan Ellerbe, an STK associate who took a bullet to the head when a gunman sprayed shots at him and other friends hanging out on a porch in the city's Hilltop neighborhood.\n\nProsecutors entered into evidence Facebook posts including pictures of STK members contorting their fingers into Js as a tribute to Ellerbe, whose murder has not been solved.\n\nHarris-Dickerson said he was driving with Taylor when they noticed Wingo walking home. Taylor wanted to shoot from the car but Harris-Dickerson said he exited the car with a black jacket and a 9mm handgun, which he said later became known as the \"Wingo dropper.\"\n\nHe said Taylor admitted to shooting Wingo in the head when they met immediately after the shooting. He told the jury Taylor laughed as they drove by Wingo's body on the pavement before police arrived.\n\nInvestigators said Taylor sent a message to a friend claiming he had just \"bodied\" a person shortly after Wingo was killed and Harris-Dickerson said the three fled to North Carolina afterward to avoid police attention.\n\nDenney said the tit-for-tat nature of the rivalry continued later that night when three juveniles were arrested carrying guns at a home they thought Taylor was at. The next night, the home was \"shot up,\" he said.\n\n\"The violence was out of control at that time,\" Denney said. \"It was back and forth. A lot of it was based on social media: the taunting, the promotion, the intimidation and it had to stop.\"\n\nBen Gifford, one of Taylor's defense attorneys, sought to discredit Harris-Dickerson. He pointed out discrepancies between his testimony and statements to the jury made by other witnesses. After the verdict, he declined comment pending Taylor's sentencing.\n\nDuring the trial, he noted the former gang member was facing life in prison plus 50 years if guilty of the charges he was indicted for in summer 2016.\n\nHe also noted Harris-Dickeson had more than a year to review evidence gathered by investigators and confer with his lawyer regarding the prosecution's theory before striking a deal and giving his statement to police in February.\n\n\"Kevon Harris-Dickerson put on a show,\" Gifford told the jury.\n\nIn return for his testimony, many charges against Harris-Dickerson were dropped. He will do eight years in jail outside the state and has agreed never to return to Delaware.\n\nTaylor's first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory life sentence. He was also convicted on charges in two other crimes in May.\n\nProsecutors said Taylor was the triggerman who shot a suspected rival gang member in the hip in the presence of two children. Surveillance videos show two men dressed in black approaching the scene on Wilmington's east side.\n\nHarris-Dickerson identified the men as Smith and Taylor and said Taylor shot the victim.\n\nDays after the shooting, Taylor texted a friend that \"I just scored on some crazy s*** babe but I don't think he died,\" prosecutors said. Another message presented by investigators features Taylor referencing \"when I hit\" the victim.\n\nHe was convicted of assault and reckless endangering for the shooting.\n\nTaylor was also convicted of aggravated menacing after two teens said he and Smith stalked them on the Church Street Bridge days after the Wingo shooting.\n\nThe two teens told police that they were approached by a car, Smith exited with a gun and one witness said Taylor was pointing at them for Smith to shoot.\n\nA text message prosecutors said was sent on Taylor's cell phone after said the gunman \"tired to blow but didn't shoot.\" Smith was arrested with a .22 handgun later that day.\n\nTaylor was acquitted of a robbery charge as part of the case as well.\n\nTwo men testified that Smith robbed them at gunpoint in May 2016 after they gave Smith and Taylor a ride to the gas station. The witnesses said Taylor was inside the car and prosecutors said he aided in the robbery.\n\nTaylor's prints were found on the car but his attorney said prosecutors had not presented enough evidence to show that Taylor was actively involved in the robbery.\n\nDenney said Smith will be tried for that crime as well as first-degree murder as an accomplice in Wingo's death later this year.\n\n\"He's next,\" Denney said.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

Thus far, the move has paid off in a big way.\n\nBarkley entered the team's \"Sunday Night Football\" meeting with the Los Angeles Rams among the league leaders in rushing yards.\n\nHe exits it on pace to break Eric Dickerson's decades-long single-season rushing record after enjoying a massive outing in Los Angeles.\n\nHere's what to know about Barkley's personal-best outing against the Rams and the record-breaking pace he is on during his debut season in Philadelphia.\n\nNFL WEEK 12:32 things we learned, including missteps that could cost some contenders\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nSaquon Barkley stats today\n\nBarkley had the most productive game of his NFL career on Sunday night. He logged a career-high 255 rushing yards on 26 carries and added 47 receiving yards on four catches in the 37-20 Eagles win.\n\nBarkley was productive from the jump against the Rams. He repeatedly ripped off solid gains during the first half, averaging 5.6 yards per carry in the first half and keeping Philadelphia's offense on a consistent schedule against Los Angeles' opportunistic defense.\n\nOn the first play of the second half, Barkley nearly doubled his first half production. He took the opening carry 70 yards for a score, following great blocking from the right side of his offensive line and Landon Dickerson into space. He wasn't touched en route to the end-zone.\n\nBarkley continued to be an explosive playmaker from there. He logged a 31-yard catch on a third-and-10 that set up a 13-yard Kenneth Gainwell touchdown before punctuating his career-best night with a 72-yard touchdown run to seal the game.\n\nBarkley's personal-best rushing performance came just over a month after he nearly eclipsed it against the New York Giants. In that contest, Barkley opted to bow out of the 28-3 blowout to allow his teammates to get work rather than chase the record.\n\nIn the closer 37-20 contest with the Rams, Barkley remained in and managed to clear his record, originally set against Washington in 2019. He also beat his previous career-high of 279 scrimmage yards from that outing, replacing it with his 302-yard total on Sunday night.\n\nMost rushing yards in an NFL game\n\nBarkley's 255 rushing yards were the ninth-most in a single game in NFL history, and the most by an NFL player since Jonathan Taylor's 253-yard outing against the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2021.\n\nBelow is a full look at the NFL's single-game rushing leaders:\n\nAdrian Peterson, Minnesota Vikings: 296 yards (2007) Jamal Lewis, Baltimore Ravens: 295 yards (2003) Jerome Harrison, Cleveland Browns: 286 yards (2009) Corey Dillon, Cincinnati Bengals: 278 yards (2000) Walter Payton, Chicago Bears: 275 yards (1977) O.J. Simpson, Buffalo Bills: 273 yards (1976) Shaun Alexander, Seattle Seahawks: 266 yards (2001) Jamaal Charles, Kansas City Chiefs: 259 yards (2010) Saquon Barkley, Philadelphia Eagles: 255 yards (2024) Jonathan Taylor, Indianapolis Colts: 253 yards (2021); DeMarco Murray, Dallas Cowboys: 253 yards (2011)\n\nSaquon Barkley rushing yards 2024\n\nBarkley has accounted for 1,392 rushing yards in 2024. That ranks No. 1 in the NFL, though it's worth noting that the NFL's No. 2 rusher, Derrick Henry, hasn't yet played his Week 12 game.\n\nThat said, Barkley has already had his bye while Henry has not. As such, Barkley remains on pace to lead the league in rushing yards during his first season with the Eagles.\n\nNFL single-season rushing record\n\nEric Dickerson still owns the NFL record for most rushing yards in a single season. He ran for 2,104 yards during the 1984 NFL season.\n\nOnly eight NFL players have logged more than 2,000 rushing yards in a single season:\n\nEric Dickerson, Los Angeles Rams: 2,105 yards (1984) Adrian Peterson, Minnesota Vikings: 2,097 yards (2012) Jamal Lewis, Baltimore Ravens: 2,066 yards (2003) Barry Sanders, Detroit Lions: 2,053 yards (1997) Derrick Henry, Tenenssee Titans: 2,027 yards (2020) Terrell Davis, Denver Broncos: 2,008 yards (1998) Chris Johnson, Tennessee Titans: 2,006 yards (2009) O.J. Simpson, Buffalo Bills: 2,003 yards (1973)\n\nBarkley is currently on pace to record 2,151 rushing yards during the 2024 NFL season. That would allow him to overtake Dickerson and break the NFL record.\n\nBarkley doesn't have much room for error, but if he can stay healthy, he might have a chance to make NFL history in his first year with the Eagles — whether it's by breaking the NFL rushing record or challenging for 2,000 yards on the ground.\n\nAll the NFL news on and off the field.

He was born on Feb. 9, 1997, in The Bronx in New York.\n\nWhere did Saquon Barkley go to school?\n\nBarkley attended Whitehall High School in Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania. He then attended Penn State.\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nRunning for the record:Is Saquon Barkley on pace to break the NFL single-season rushing record? Here's a look\n\nWhat is Saquon Barkley famous for?\n\nHe is an elite running back in the National Football League. He was the 2018 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and he's been to the Pro Bowl twice.\n\nHow high can Saquon Barkley jump?\n\nAt the NFL Combine in 2018, Barkley had an unofficial 41-inch vertical leap. While he may or may not be able to clear that height now, he did clear a Jacksonville Jaguars defender while leaping backward, so that's pretty good.\n\nHow many rings does Saquon Barkley have?\n\nNone yet, but his prospects this season with the Eagles are looking pretty good. The Eagles are tied with the Buffalo Bills with the third-best odds to win the Super Bowl.\n\nIs Saquon Barkley related to Iran Barkley?\n\nThe former boxer is the great-uncle of Saquon Barkley.\n\nIs Saquon Barkley related to Charles Barkley?\n\nThe current Philly football star isn't related to the former Philly basketball star.\n\nIs Saquon Barkley married?\n\nAccording to msn.com, Barkley is in a relationship with Anna Congdon and the couple has two children together – Jada Clare and Saquon Jr.\n\nHas Saquon Barkley ever played quarterback in the NFL?\n\nYes, during the fourth quarter during a 2022 game against the Chicago Bears. Barkley was forced into the role after Daniel Jones and Tyrod Taylor both were injured. Barkley moved into the quarterback and Joes entered the game as a wide receiver. With Barkley at quarterback, the Giants gained some yards on a run and eventually kicked a field goal for the final point in a 20-12 victory.\n\nWho is better, Saquon Barkley or Christian McCaffrey?\n\nWhile both are elite running backs, Barkley is pursuing the NFL single-season rushing record. McCaffrey, on the other hand, has battled injuries all season and is out for the year after injuring his knee on Dec. 1 against the Buffalo Bills. So, for this year, Saquon is better.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2024/12/13/eagles-saquon-barkley-role-aj-brown-jalen-hurts-passing-woes-steelers-eric-dickerson-nfl-record/76868288007/", "title": "Eagles Saquon Barkley's role in AJ Brown, Jalen Hurts passing issues", "text": "PHILADELPHIA − What often gets lost in this entire A.J. Brown-fueled Eagles' passing game debate is the player at the heart of it: running back Saquon Barkley.\n\nIt's no secret that the Eagles aren't passing the ball as much because of Barkley, who's on pace to break the NFL's single-season rushing record, set by Eric Dickerson with 2,105 yards rushing in 1984.\n\nThere's no bitterness about that. Barkley averages 125 yards rushing per game. He'll break Dickerson's record if he averages 121 yards per game over the Eagles' final four games, beginning Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nConversely, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is averaging just 21 pass attempts per game during the Eagles' nine-game winning streak. He threw for just 108 yards last Sunday in the Eagles' 22-16 win over the Carolina Panthers, one week after Hurts threw for 118 yards in the Eagles' 24-19 win over the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nBLAMING BG:Eagles have scapegoat for Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown friction, passing woes. Can they fix it?\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nPLAYOFF STAKES:Eagles can clinch more than NFC East title with win and some help. No, not the No. 1 seed\n\nAfter the win over the Panthers, Brown was asked what needs to improve.\n\n\"Passing,\" he said.\n\nThat began three days of controversy, fueled in part by defensive end Brandon Graham's comments on SportsRadio 94 WIP on Monday implying that Hurts' and Brown's relationship is strained. Graham walked that back the next day, followed the next day by both Brown and Hurts saying they're fine and that they're working to improve the passing game.\n\nOn Thursday, Barkley weighed in.\n\n\"It's not like it's not a problem for us,\" Barkley said. \"Obviously, we have to answer the questions ... But we're not sitting at lunch table talking about, 'Oh, we need to throw the ball more.'\n\n\"To be honest, you guys in the media are the ones kind of creating that narrative. Our focus is winning football games. And we're 11-2 right now. We got nine wins in a row. We know there's a lot we can continue to improve on because of the things we want to accomplish, and we got to keep on doing it.\"\n\nBarkley has no doubt that the Eagles can win with the passing game if an opponent, such as the Steelers, were to shut Barkley down. And that's possible, considering the Steelers have the fourth-ranked rushing defense in the NFL, allowing just 91.5 yards per game.\n\n\"Yeah, 100% confidence,\" Barkley said about the passing game. \"We have A.J. Brown. We have DeVonta Smith. We have Jalen Hurts ... If we’re throwing for 350 yards and we’re not rushing that great, would people still have the same conversations?\n\n\"It’s not real. What matters is winning football games. Yes, we want to do better. We know the kind of talent that we have.\"\n\nPerhaps the Eagles' drama this week was partially intended to get the Steelers thinking about the Eagles' passing game more, thereby taking some of their attention from Barkley. Or if the Steelers focus their attention on Barkley, then the Eagles will have to take advantage of the pass game.\n\nEither way, both Brown and Hurts admitted that Barkley has changed the Eagles' offense − for the better.\n\n\"When (a reporter) asked the question of what the offense can do better, obviously it’s not about running the ball,\" Brown said. \"(Barkley) is about to win MVP. Like, literally, what’s the other thing we do on offense? We have to pass the ball.\n\n\"That’s why I was bringing the awareness to everybody’s attention. This is something we can focus on. We know we can run the ball. Saquon is doing a great job. We’re not against running the ball. We love Saquon. Ask him what I tell him … during the game. Like, ‘Do your job,’ in the game.\"\n\nBarkley confirmed that Thursday, but he also knows that Brown can change a game too. It was something Barkley said he used to talk about with Daniel Jones during the past few years when he and Jones were teammates on the Giants.\n\n\"He's a freak of nature,\" Barkley said of Brown. \"He weighs the same as me. He's bigger than me and he can move like me. I just can't run routes like him. The most precious thing about AJ, to me, is every time the ball (comes to him), you got guys that catch the ball, (but) he catches the ball the ball does not move ...\n\n\"He's a heck of a player. A Hall of Fame caliber player and excited having him on my team.\"\n\nThe feeling is mutual for Brown toward Barkley. Now, it's up to the Steelers to figure out which one to stop. That, no doubt, will start with the Steelers trying to stop Barkley. And through all of the passing game controversy this week, the Eagles will still have to run the ball.\n\nBarkley knows it, Hurts knows it, and Brown and Smith know it. So do the Steelers.\"We gotta make (the Steelers) stop it,\" Barkley said about the running game. \"And if they can’t, they can’t. And if they happen to do it, we’re more than capable of being able to throw the ball and win football games.\n\n\"Whether we have 10 passing yards and 10 rushing yards, five picks, three fumbles, and we win the game 3-0 because the special teams played great and the defense played great, at the end of the day, we won the football game.\"\n\nTo Barkley, that's all that matters.\n\nEagles rule out punt returner Britain Covey\n\nWR/PR Britain Covey was ruled out of the game Sunday with a neck injury, meaning that CB Cooper DeJean will be the main punt returner. Covey missed last week's game with the same injury, which he suffered in the Dec. 1 game against the Ravens. Covey was limited in practice Wednesday, but practiced fully Thursday and Friday.\n\nEveryone else is eligible to play Sunday, including WR Johnny Wilson, who didn't practice Friday because of an illness.\n\nFor the Steelers, WR George Pickens, who leads the team with 850 yards, was ruled out with a hamstring injury.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Eagles RB's case not as good as you ...", "text": "There's no denying Saquon Barkley’s greatness.\n\nThere’s no denying he salvaged his career by signing with the Philadelphia Eagles this year – or, said differently, by escaping the New York (Little?) Giants. There’s no denying we’re all being treated to appointment football now that he’s been granted deserved prime-time stages – starting with his Eagles debut in South America (of all places) in Week 1 to his pair of marquee performances over the past 12 days – worthy of transcendent abilities that were compared to the (nearly) incomparable Barry Sanders’ when Barkley came out of Penn State in 2018.\n\nBut should he be the NFL MVP in 2024? Gotta deny him that one.\n\nIt’s perfectly understandable to link him to the league’s premier award for football excellence – though no running back has won it since 2012, Adrian Peterson the only runner so honored in the past 18 years. Yet to watch Barkley follow up his scintillating Week 11 showing, when he broke the Washington Commanders by incinerating their defense multiple times in the fourth quarter, to his tour de force Sunday night – a career-best (and club record) 255 rushing yards and more than 300 overall in front of a national audience is the stuff of legends (and bronze busts) – begets debates, shifting betting odds and plays into our (temporary) obsession with the shiny object du jour.\n\nEven Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay fueled the discussion following his team's 37-20 defeat.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\n“He's as good as there is as a slash runner, to be able to work edges and then be able to erase angles and be able to finish,” he said after watching Barkley render LA’s late-game defensive gambles oh so pointless.\n\n“That’s why he had the production that he had, and that's why he’s had arguably an MVP-type of season so far.”\n\nEagles coach Nick Sirianni said of No. 26: “He's got everything you look for in a back. He's been awesome, and he was awesome tonight.”\n\nMaybe, at some point, Barkley's candidacy becomes undeniable. With the benefit of the 17-game regular season, he's on pace to do what Peterson couldn't quite manage 12 years ago – namely, break Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record of 2,105 yards, set over 16 games in 1984. Barkley is on pace for 2,151, and the Eagles (9-2) might need him for all 17 games in a bid to overtake the Detroit Lions (10-1) in the race for home-field advantage and a first-round bye in the NFC side of the playoffs.\n\nHowever I’ve already taken my deep breath since watching Barkley as Hollywood's leading man for a night.\n\nAgain, the guy is awesome. The production, reliability, the humble attitude, breakaway speed, ankle-breaking cuts, the reverse hurdle – it’s precisely the type of package we crave in our sports stars. And it sure feels like Barkley has made the Eagles better.\n\nBut they’ve also made him better. Waaaaaay better.\n\nPhiladelphia is riding a seven-game winning streak and trails only the Lions in the NFC. Conversely, over the past three seasons, this is the Eagles’ worst 11-game start (they were 10-1 in both 2022 and 2023, when Barkley was still toiling in Gotham).\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field. Sign up for USA TODAY's 4th and Monday newsletter.\n\nAll due respect to Shady McCoy, Brian Westbrook, Wilbert Montgomery and others, Barkley is probably the best back the City of Brotherly Love has called its own since Hall of Famer Steve Van Buren delivered the first two of the franchise’s four titles three-quarters of a century ago. (And all due respect to Van Buren – he scored the only points in a blizzard in the 1948 title game and ran over the Rams for 196 yards in the ’49 championship round, LA apparently a historical feeding ground for Philly backs – but I’d take Barkley.)\n\nYet let’s remember that the true MVP(s) of the Eagles are almost certainly the five men doing the primary blocking for Barkley, symphonic mauling conducted by legendary offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland. This was a unit that paved the way for Miles Sanders, Barkley's backup with the Nittany Lions, to rush for 1,269 yards in 2022, after which he signed a hefty contract with the Carolina Panthers … and hasn’t been heard from since. This was a group that helped D’Andre Swift craft his only 1,000-yard season in the NFL last year before he joined the Chicago Bears. This is a quintet known for giving rise to the notorious “tush push” – the Philly frontal assault that produces first downs and touchdowns in short-yardage situations practically without fail.\n\nEven following the retirement of iconic center Jason Kelce – after a 2023 campaign that ultimately disintegrated with something akin to a locker room mutiny as Sirianni knee-capped his staff on the fly – Stoutland somehow seems to have made the front five better. Cam Jurgens has capably replaced Kelce. Following Barkley from New York, Mekhi Becton – a first-round washout as the Jets' left tackle – has reinvented himself by taking over the right guard spot vacated by Jurgens and, along with Jordan Mailata, gives Barkley a pair of 360-pounders to run behind. Per the NFL analytics website PFF, Mailata is the league’s preeminent left tackle. Left guard Landon Dickerson is likely headed to his third straight Pro Bowl, and right tackle Lane Johnson might be a first-ballot Hall of Famer whenever he’s done.\n\nNow it’s Barkley, averaging nearly 50 rushing yards more per game than he did during his time with the Giants, who is the beneficiary of this steak-and-cheese grinder that routinely pulverizes opponents into submission.\n\nI was able to witness the formula personally as the Eagles relentlessly pummeled the Commanders. Barkley was steady, if fairly unspectacular most of that night at Lincoln Financial Field – until the dam broke and he ran for a pair of touchdowns covering 62 aggregate yards in a 20-second span in the game’s final five minutes. He wound up with 198 yards from scrimmage.\n\nChicken? Egg? Hammer? Scythe? Line? Barkley?\n\n“We’ve found a rhythm offensively,” Johnson told me when I asked about their approach and success.\n\n“We love the big, explosive plays. We love handing the ball to Saquon and wearing teams down physically up front. When you can do that, it opens up the pass game, weakens the pass rush when you attack the guys the way that we do. So, complementary football.”\n\nAnd Barkley is a complementary piece here. That’s not to shade him one iota of the credit he's due, but …\n\n▶ For some reason, quarterback Jalen Hurts still does most of the short-area dirty work, eight of his 11 team-leading TD runs from 1 yard. (Barkley’s TD runs average 31 yards – amazing, including two from 70+ against the Rams – but he hasn’t taken it in from the 1-yard line yet.)\n\n▶ Call it a quirky stat if you like, but the Eagles are 8-0 when Pro Bowl wideout A.J. Brown is available yet 1-2 without him. And Barkley dropped a very catchable pass in Week 2 against the Atlanta Falcons that he himself cited as the reason Philadelphia lost.\n\n▶ A defense teeming with blossoming stars – one that fell apart and maybe even quit in 2023 following the departure of coordinator Jonathan Gannon for the Arizona Cardinals’ top job – is now ranked No. 1 overall with grizzled assistant Vic Fangio calling the shots.\n\n▶ Even Sirianni seems to have gotten out of his own way sufficiently enough that his job status is no longer a weekly discussion point. And say what you want about the polarizing HC, but he does have a highly enviable 43-19 regular-season record and is on the way to his fourth playoff appearance in four seasons – most of that success obviously predating 2024.\n\nBarkley is a superstar, a unicorn at his position, probably an eventual Hall of Famer. He’s an eminently valuable player for the Eagles.\n\nHe’s also a tailback playing for a team that might have been one questionable holding call away from beating the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 57 less than two years ago … without him.\n\nWith most profuse apologies to Mr. Barkley, the Buffalo Bills’ Josh Allen, Baltimore Ravens’ Lamar Jackson and maybe even Detroit’s Jared Goff should probably rest rather easy – none of those teams likely to survive without their respective quarterbacks, whereas the Eagles have already proven to be championship-caliber pre-Barkley. In a quarterback-driven league that tends to appropriately reward that all-important position, one of them probably will – and should – be the 2024 MVP.\n\nSorry, Saquon.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on X, formerly Twitter, @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2024/12/12/eagles-vs-steelers-predictions-our-expert-picks-in-pennsylvania-rivalry-jalen-hurts-aj-brown/76867590007/", "title": "Eagles vs Steelers predictions: Our expert picks in Pennsylvania ...", "text": "PHILADELPHIA − It's easy to forget that the Eagles are on a nine-game winning streak, that they're seventh in the NFL in total offense, and that they have a running back in Saquon Barkley who is on pace to set the NFL's single-season record for rushing yards.\n\nYet there is something amiss in Eaglesland as they get ready for their intra-state game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. That is the Eagles' 31st-ranked passing offense.\n\nAll of that came to a head this week, led by wide receiver A.J. Brown expressing his frustration following an unimpressive 22-16 win over the Carolina Panthers.\n\nJalen Hurts threw for just 108 yards, coming off a game against the Ravens in which he threw for 118 yards. Brown, meanwhile, went 58 game minutes without a single target from the second half against Baltimore until the final two minutes of the first half against the Panthers.\n\nEAGLES STAR RIFT?What Brandon Graham apology on AJ Brown, Jalen Hurts 'rift' says about Eagles collapsing\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nSAQUON THE BEST?Is Saquon Barkley already the best running back in Eagles' history? Ranking top 10 RBs\n\nAnd now, the Eagles have the Steelers, who no doubt will load up to stop Barkley. And Pittsburgh (10-3) is well equipped to do so, allowing an average of 91.5 yards per game on the ground, fourth best in the NFL.\n\nThey will no doubt want to force Hurts to throw. For Hurts, that could be a struggle even though the Steelers are 17th against the pass. That's because the Steelers have top pass rushers in T.J. Watt and Cam Heyward, and they're tied for the NFL lead in turnover differential at plus-17.\n\nConversely, Hurts has gone 8 of 9 games during the winning streak without a turnover, and he finds a way to win. The Eagles are 11-2 this season and 44-16 in games started by Hurts since the start of the 2021 season.\n\nSo don't tell Eagles coach Nick Sirianni about Hurts' struggles as a passer.\n\n\"What he’s done really well is taking care of the football at an outstanding rate,\" Sirianni said. \"He’s accurate with the football. He’s been able to make plays with his feet as things break down or something’s not open. So he’s done so many good things.\n\n\"The thing that doesn’t get said enough about Jalen Hurts is (his record). I think that’s pretty darn special.\"\n\nHere is how we see the game going:\n\nOur prognosticators are Martin Frank (Eagles beat writer/columnist, Delawareonline.com), Greg Giesen (sports strategist, Delawareonline.com), Tom McGurk (sports editor, Courierpostonline.com), Tom Moore (sports columnist, Phillyburbs.com), Bob Jordan (sports editor, app.com), Bert Bainbridge (sports betting analyst & columnist, Northjersey.com), Tom Haines (Pennsylvania state planning), Brad Myers (high school sports writer, Delawareonline.com), Kevin Tresolini, (college sports reporter, Delawareonline.com), Michelle Ganassi (audience director & die-hard Steelers fan, Delawareonline.com), Shane Brennan (New Castle County reporter, Delawareonline.com), Tom Rimback (sports writer, Courierpostonline.com), Brandon Holveck (high school sports reporter, Delawareonline.com)\n\nMartin Frank\n\nThe offenses and defenses will cancel each other out, meaning this game will come down to the kickers. And here, the Steelers have a huge advantage. Chris Boswell is an incredible 11-for-13 from 50 yards or more. Jake Elliott is 0-for-5. A 54-yard field goal with 3 seconds left to win? I'm going with Boswell.\n\nThe pick: Steelers 22, Eagles 20\n\nMichelle Ganassi\n\nYinz better believe it ... I am picking my Steelers. I expect T.J. Watt and the rest of the Stillers D to get after Jalen Hurts and stop Saquon Barkley's run game. It will be close, a nail-biter, but the Steelers will come out on top. Here we go!\n\nThe Pick: Steelers 24, Eagles 21\n\nTom McGurk\n\nThe drought will end this Sunday. The one with the Eagles' lackluster passing game? Nope. How 'bout Jake Elliott's kicking woes? Nah. Look for Pittsburgh to earn its first win in Philadelphia since 1965.\n\nThe pick: Steelers 20, Eagles 16\n\nTom Moore\n\nCan the Eagles win a physical game with their intrastate rival and increase the streak to 10? It's possible, but I don't see it happening.\n\nThe pick: Steelers 23, Eagles 20\n\nTom Haines\n\nCan yet another in-house, late-season rift derail the Eagles? Here in Negadelphia we brace for the worst, but this team can still count on Saquon Barkley and a well-coached defense.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 28, Steelers 20\n\nKevin Tresolini\n\nAh yes, the state championship game. It's a shame these two don't collide more often, but we native Pennsylvanians revel in this matchup, while yearning for a Super Bowl duel someday. The Eagles seem poised to have their win streak snapped, but am foreseeing big plays on defense swinging it toward the Birds.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 24, Steelers 19\n\nBob Jordan\n\nThe Eagles have looked vulnerable a couple of times during their nine-game winning streak, but when it comes to finding an opponent that will break the streak, Pittsburgh ain't it. Plus the Steelers may be without receiver George Pickens (hamstring) again.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 20, Steelers 10\n\nBrad Myers\n\nHow can so many Eagles fans (and a certain receiver) be unhappy during a nine-game winning streak? The win over Carolina wasn't pretty, but it's not always pretty in the NFL. Pittsburgh specializes in winning not-pretty games, so we're going with the Steelers.\n\nThe pick: Steelers 19, Eagles 17\n\nGreg Giesen\n\nAJ Brown and DeVonta Smith aren't receiving the attention they feel they richly deserve from Jalen Hurts. Well happy birthday to you, you'll get your shot on Sunday. With Pittsburgh's rushing defense among the best in the NFL and their pass defense being 17th, the Eagles receivers could finally feel the love on Sunday. Let's just hope Hurst doesn't become turnover-prone again.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 27, Steelers 17\n\nShane Brennan\n\nThe Steelers are a decent matchup for the Eagles. They have an aggressive defense that could rattle Hurts, but they don't have the offensive firepower to stick with the Birds. Saquon Barkley will run all over the defense in the second half.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 27, Steelers 14\n\nTom Rimback\n\nJust another typical week in Eaglesland. The kerfluffle over the passing game is a good thing only.in the respect.that it.comes in early.December rather than right before the playoffs. Expect.Jalen to target AJ right away and all will be good again.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 27, Steelers 18\n\nBrandon Holveck\n\nNo teams have ran the ball more on early downs than the Eagles (60.5% of first and second downs) and Steelers (57.9%) per NFL Pro. The teams have found similar winning formulas as run-first, defense-led squads. The bet here is that Saquon Barkley breaks for more explosive gains than the Steelers' combination of Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren.\n\nThe pick: Eagles 20, Steelers 13\n\nBert Bainbridge\n\nAs Martin mentioned above, this installment of the battle of Pennsylvania will come down to the place kickers, where Pittsburgh has the massive upper hand in Boswell over Elliott. In a matchup of organizations bound for the postseason and that have won a combined 16 of their previous 17 games, the Steelers (10-3) win a low scoring, field goal game affair outright as a road underdog, putting the pressure on the Bills (10-3) to win on the road in Detroit, against the NFC leading Lions (12-1) to hold onto the No. 2 seed in the AFC.\n\nThe pick: Steelers 20, Eagles 17\n\nOverall records\n\n10-3: Rimback\n\n9-4: McGurk, Jordan, Haines, Holveck, Tresolini\n\n8-5: Giesen, Frank, Moore\n\n8-4: Brennan\n\n7-6: Ganassi\n\n6-7: Myers\n\n5-7: Bainbridge\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

According to the latest NFL MVP odds, the favorite for the league's most prestigious award has its first odds-on-favorite of 2024.\n\nThe Denver Broncos and Cleveland Browns still play on \"Monday Night Football\" before Week 13 concludes, but there's a two-way race in MVP odds.\n\nQuarterback Lamar Jackson is the reigning MVP and has spent most of the season as the favorite, according to BetMGM's NFL MVP odds. That was until Week 11, when the Buffalo Bills knocked off the undefeated and defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs.\n\nJosh Allen of the Bills leapfrogged the field and has been the favorite in NFL MVP odds since, but Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has surged into the MVP race with five weeks remaining.\n\nNFL MVP odds\n\nHere's which players are the favorites for the NFL MVP award after 13 weeks of action, according to BetMGM on Monday:\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\n1. Josh Allen, QB, Buffalo Bills: -250\n\nAllen has never claimed an MVP award but has finished in the top five in voting in three of his last four seasons. He was the runner-up in 2020 behind Aaron Rodgers and a finalist in 2022 (third place) and 2023 (fifth place). After taking down the undefeated Chiefs in Week 11, he passed the reigning MVP Lamar Jackson as the favorite.\n\nThe Bills have won seven consecutive games and claimed the AFC East division title after their impressive 35-10 win on \"Sunday Night Football\" over the defending NFC champion 49ers. Buffalo boasts a 10-2 record and is in the race for the AFC's top seed. They will try to hunt down and catch the Chiefs (11-1) over the final five weeks.\n\nAllen is sixth in the NFL with 20 passing touchdowns. He has been a wrecking ball, rushing for 334 yards and six touchdowns. Allen has protected the ball this season with just five interceptions and one fumble. The Bills have scored at least 30 points in six straight games.\n\nAllen put his stamp on the award after taking down the 49ers on a snowy night in Orchard Park. His night was highlighted by a ridiculous play where Amari Cooper pitched the ball back to Allen, and he launched himself toward the pylon for a touchdown.\n\n2. Saquon Barkley, RB Philadelphia Eagles: +325\n\nThe last time a non-quarterback earned NFL MVP honors was in 2012, when running back Adrian Peterson won. He finished that season with 2,097 rushing yards. Before Peterson, it was LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006 when he had 28 touchdowns and more than 1,800 rushing yards. History suggests a quarterback will win, but Barkley is making his case as the Eagles have won eight in a row and are pushing the Lions for the top seed in the NFC.\n\nBarkley scampered for 107 rushing yards in the Eagles' win over the Ravens. He became the first player to rush for 100 yards against the Ravens' league-leading run defense. He has 1,499 yards on the ground through 12 games, putting him on pace to finish with 2,123 yards and break the single-season rushing record of 2,105 yards set by Eric Dickerson in 1984. Only eight players have reached hit 2,000 rushing yards.\n\n3. Lamar Jackson, QB, Baltimore Ravens: +1100\n\nThe Ravens have lost two of their last three games and head into their Week 14 bye after losing to Barkley and the Eagles. Jackson spent the first two months of the season as the favorite, but since losing to the division-rival Steelers in Week 11, 18-16, Jackson has tumbled behind Allen and Barkley.\n\nLast season, Baltimore claimed the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and Jackson earned MVP honors for the second time in his career. The Ravens are currently 8-5, and it will be difficult for Jackson to claim his third MVP award if they don't at least win the AFC North. Jackson is second in passing yards (3,290) and passing touchdowns (29)\n\n4. Jared Goff, QB, Detroit Lions: +1100\n\nGoff continues to lead the NFL with an astronomical 71.8% completion percentage. Drew Brees holds the record with his 74.4% mark in 2018. Goff is fifth in passing touchdowns (22) and eighth in passing yards (2,982).\n\nThe Lions have the best record in the NFC at 11-1 and lead the league in point differential. Detroit has won ten straight, and their 11-1 record is the best mark in franchise history in 12 games.\n\nDetroit's schedule down the stretch will give Goff a chance to show he is worthy of MVP honors. The Lions host the Packers on \"Thursday Night Football\" in Week 14. A clash with the MVP favorite Josh Allen and the Bills will follow. Goff's ultimate test is in Week 17, with a chance at redemption for the NFC Championship loss on the road for \"Monday Night Football\" against the 49ers. He can claim MVP honors if he continues to produce at a high level against these opponents.\n\n5. Patrick Mahomes, QB, Kansas City Chiefs: +2500\n\nThe two-time NFL MVP and reigning back-to-back Super Bowl MVP is on pace for the worst statistical season of his career. He's on pace for his fewest passing touchdowns in a single season (26), his most interceptions in a season (15), his lowest passing-yard total since 2019 – a season in which he played just 14 games – and the worst passer rating of his career (92.2).\n\nSince Mahomes fell short against Allen and the Bills in Week 11, the Chiefs have won two in a row against the lowly Panthers and Raiders over the last two weeks. However, the defending Super Bowl champs narrowly escaped both games. Mahomes has had zero turnovers in the last two games, but his stats are still far behind those of his counterparts. It will take a historic run over the final month for Mahomes to thrust himself into the MVP race.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2024/12/12/josh-allen-mvp-jared-goff-favorite-free-press-voter-poll/76928848007/", "title": "Josh Allen tops Jared Goff as MVP favorite in Free Press voter poll", "text": "For Scottie Montgomery, the criteria for NFL MVP is simple.\n\n\"Winner,\" the Detroit Lions assistant head coach said Wednesday. \"You got to be a winner, and winning games is what we're focused on and you get acknowledged and you get noticed when you win.\"\n\nThe Lions and Buffalo Bills (10-3) meet Sunday in a showdown between two of the NFL's winningest teams, which makes their quarterbacks – Jared Goff and Josh Allen – two of the front-runners for the league's most coveted award.\n\nAllen is the heavy Las Vegas favorite to win his first MVP at minus-450, according to BetMGM, and he dominated a straw poll of 12 MVP voters taken this week by the Free Press.\n\nGoff, playing on a Lions team many consider the best in the NFL, has the third-best odds and was one of six players who drew non-first place votes in the Free Press poll.\n\nAll things Lions: Latest Detroit Lions news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nAllen received 10 first-place votes, with Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley and Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson receiving the other two. Barkley, who is on pace to break Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record, received 10 second-place votes and one third-place vote.\n\nGoff received one second-place vote, three third-place votes and was on a split ballot for third place with two other voters. Allen (one), Jackson (two, and two split votes), Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (two) and Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold (one, and one split vote) also received third-place votes.\n\nAbout a quarter of the 50 voters who will select this year's Associated Press MVP responded to the poll.\n\n\"Goff is definitely MVP,\" Lions cornerback Carlton Davis III said Wednesday.\n\nAsked to explain his reasoning, Davis said, “I mean, what else is there to think about as far as a quarterback on a winning team? It’s a quarterback on a winning team and no matter how you slice it up, the proof is in the pudding. The quarterback is the head of the snake and if you’re successful it’s cause of him in some capacity, so he’s the one executing the offense, he’s the one leading them boys up and down the field. Making throws. Consistent. That would be my vote, maybe I’m biased but (expletive) that’s how I feel.\"\n\nGoff has played the best football of his career this season, leading the Lions to an NFC-best 12-1 record and 11 straight victories. He's completed a career-high 72.4% of his passes, and the Lions lead the league in points scored and rank second in total yards.\n\nLIONS ROOKIE REPORT:Terrion Arnold played 'best game of the season' vs. Packers\n\nBut while Goff has played MVP-caliber football most of the year, he hasn't put up the same sort of eye-popping numbers as some other MVP candidates – he's on pace to throw for just 4,270 yards – and he's surrounded in most cases by better talent.\n\nBarkley leads the league in rushing. Allen just became the first player ever to rush for three touchdowns and throw for three scores in a game. Allen and Jackson are considered more dynamic dual-threat players. And the Chiefs have the same record as the Lions with a lesser roster while Goff is playing with five other potential first- or second-team All-Pro players on offense in Penei Sewell, Frank Ragnow, Kevin Zeitler, Jahmyr Gibbs and Amon-Ra St. Brown.\n\n\"I've seen it all different type of ways, so I don't really know if there's a definition because it has looked different for different people in different times,\" Montgomery said. \"Statistically it's been the same for some people and some people statistics have not been the same and they've gotten it. So right now as a team, we're just concentrating on the Bills and trying to figure out a way to beat these guys.\"\n\nGoff never received an MVP vote in his first eight NFL seasons – before 2022, voters selected only an MVP winner; now they pick a top five for the award – and insisted Wednesday it's not a big deal for him to even be in the mix for the award.\n\n\"Sure, I’ve been playing well,\" he said. \"But a lot of guys have been playing well, though. If you’re a quarterback on a good team, you’re probably going to be in that conversation and it’s a credit to all the guys on the squad. We’ve had a really good year up to this point, we’ve got to finish it off. Sure, it’s cool to be recognized in some ways but it doesn’t really mean anything. I want to be holding that trophy at the end of the year, and I know that’s what matters.\"\n\nAllen finished fifth in MVP voting last year, third in 2022 and was runner-up to Aaron Rodgers in 2020, but like Goff is having one of the best seasons of his career.\n\nThe Bills revamped their offense this offseason, trading Stefon Diggs to the Houston Texans and letting Gabe Davis walk in free agency, yet Allen is on pace to throw for more touchdowns with fewer interceptions than he had last season and the Bills have runaway with the AFC East.\n\nHe has 3,033 yards passing, 23 touchdowns and five interceptions, with another nine rushing touchdowns through 13 games. Goff has thrown for 3,265 yards with 25 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.\n\n\"Josh Allen is a freak,\" Lions linebackers coach Kelvin Sheppard said. \"He’s right up there with our guy. Those are the elite of the elite in the league. We understand what we’re dealing with. This is a dual-threat guy. He can beat you from the pocket and outside the pocket. I mean, he brings it all to the table. I think he’s an ultra competitor. I mean, he lays it on the line for his team. Critical moments, he wants the ball. Those are the kind of guys you want to be around in this profession, and I know we’re going against him but I want to give him his credit. This guy is the real deal and we’re going to prepare for him as such.\"\n\nThe Lions need a win Sunday to stay ahead of the Eagles and Vikings in the race for the No. 1 seed in the NFC, while the Bills are trying to catch the Chiefs for homefield advantage in the AFC playoffs.\n\nHow both quarterbacks fare Sunday could influence the MVP race, though Lions coach Dan Campbell said that won't be on anyone's mind during the game.\n\n\"I guarantee you, that’s not Goff’s focus,\" he said. \"Winning the MVP, that’s icing on the cake, but I know for us, man, if you just focus on the win and what it’s going to take to win this game and whatever comes out of that, the individual accolades will follow. You’ll turn around and look back and you’ll realize, ‘All right, this is what’s transpired because we’ve won.’ So I’m not worried about it, he’s not worried about it, we’ve just got to find a way to win.”\n\nDave Birkett is the author of the new book \"Detroit Lions: An Illustrated Timeline.\"Order your copy here.

Win, and they would be tied atop the NFC West.\n\nThey couldn't capitalize on the opportunity. Instead, they were trampled by Saquon Barkley in a 37-20 blowout.\n\nThe Eagles (9-2), meanwhile, extended their win streak to seven games and further distanced themselves from their closest competition in the NFC East. The win — coupled with the Washington Commanders' wild loss to the Dallas Cowboys earlier on Sunday — builds a two-and-a-half-game advantage in the division with six weeks left to play. The Eagles remain in contention for the NFC's top playoff seed, as well, sitting a game behind the Detroit Lions (10-1).\n\nBarkley's performance certainly will boost his MVP candidacy — if voters are willing to select a player who isn't a quarterback for the award.

It was his second 70-plus yard touchdown run of the game. This one sealed the Eagles' ninth win of the season.\n\nMilton Williams strip sack forces Rams to punt\n\nAfter an offensive pass interference call on Puka Nacua set up a third-and-19, Williams got pressure on Matthew Stafford. He found his way into the backfield behind Jalen Carter and Milton Williams forced the ball out of Stafford's hands.\n\nLos Angeles center Beaux Limmer recovered the ball, but the Rams were forced to punt rather than try to go for it on fourth-and-33. Time is running out for Los Angeles to make the comeback with 5:13 left in regulation.\n\nRams convert another fourth down\n\nMatthew Stafford found Tutu Atwell for a 7-yard gain on fourth-and-3. The Rams remain alive, trailing by 16 with about seven minutes left in regulation.\n\nEagles 30, Rams 14: Jake Elliott makes 26-yard field goal\n\nThe Rams couldn't stop the Eagles from scoring, but they held them to a field goal. Jake Elliott made another chip shot, his third of the night, to give the Eagles a 30-14 lead with 10:30 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nA.J. Brown closes third quarter with 28-yard reception on third-and-10\n\nThe Rams nearly got the three-and-out they needed after their missed field goal. Instead, Jalen Hurts threw an accurate pass downfield to A.J. Brown, who about doubled the length of the reception with a nice after-catch run.\n\nThe Eagles offense now has 376 yards and counting to the Rams' 199. If the Eagles can score again, it will be hard for Los Angeles to get back into the contest, which Philadelphia currently leads 27-14.\n\nJoshua Karty misses 47-yard field goal\n\nJoshua Karty was called upon to try a long field goal after the Rams' red zone drive stalled out. He missed the kick right, marking the third consecutive game in which he had missed a field goal.\n\nThe Rams offense made Karty's first attempt of the game more difficult after committing a 10-yard holding penalty on third-and-3 and allowing Matthew Stafford to be sacked on the ensuing third-and-13. Now, it will be on their defense to prevent the Eagles from extending their 13-point lead.\n\nRams convert fourth-and-1 with 29-yard pass to Puka Nacua\n\nThe Rams decided to go for it on fourth-and-1 from midfield. Rather than run Kyren Williams up the middle, Los Angeles ran a play-action pass. Matthew Stafford his Puka Nacua for a gain, and the receiver ran with Isaiah Rodgers on his back for a 29-yard gain.\n\nThe Rams are now on the 21-yard line, threatening to score again. Meanwhile, the Eagles are tending to an injury to edge rusher Josh Sweat.\n\nMike Tirico injury update\n\nNBC announcer Mike Tirico revealed on air that he is nursing a torn Achilles. The broadcast showed an angle from inside the booth that revealed he has a boot on his left foot. He assured viewers that he is doing OK.\n\nTirico did not clarify exactly when he had suffered the injury.\n\nEagles 27, Rams 14: Kenneth Gainwell scores on 13-yard touchdown run\n\nAfter a 31-yard gain from Saquon Barkley on a screen pass, the Eagles put Kenneth Gainwell into the game to spell him. Gainwell got a carry on the next play and dodged a couple of Rams tacklers on a middle-of-the-field run to get his first touchdown of the season.\n\nJake Elliott converted the extra point to extend Philadelphia's lead to 27-14.\n\nDarius Slay injury update: Eagles CB ruled out\n\nDarius Slay suffered a concussion that will keep him out of the remainder of Sunday's game, USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon reports.\n\nSlay left the field after tackling Rams tight end Colby Parkinson following a 10-yard game. He was seen walking without his helmet on the sideline and didn't return for the rest of the drive.\n\nSlay was replaced by backup cornerback Isaiah Rodgers. The veteran from UMass was called for pass interference and then gave up a 2-yard touchdown.\n\nEagles 20, Rams 14: Matthew Stafford finds Demarcus Robinson for 2-yard TD\n\nThe Rams answer the Eagles' half-opening score. After a first-and-goal run by Kyren Williams was stuffed, the Rams ran a quick pass to Demarcus Robinson with Matthew Stafford rolling to his right. Robinson broke away from cornerback Isaiah Rodgers and made the catch in the end zone with ease.\n\nLos Angeles is now trailing 20-14 and has reversed the trend of its negative-yardage second quarter.\n\nMatthew Stafford, Puka Nacua connect on highlight-reel play\n\nStafford and the Rams are looking to answer Saquon Barkley's touchdown, and he connected with Puka Nacua on a beautiful pass to get into Eagles territory.\n\nMatthew Stafford feathered the ball into an incredibly small window between Darius Slay and the sideline. Nacua made the grab going to the ground despite Slay interfering with him. The entire sequence drew an amazed reaction from color commentator Cris Collinsworth, who credited Stafford for being able to thread the needle on the throw.\n\nEagles 20, Rams 7: Saquon Barkley runs for 70-yard touchdown on first play of second half\n\nThe Eagles started the second half with a bang. Saquon Barkley found a hole on the right side of the offensive line and burst through the middle of it untouched. That turned the game quickly, as the Rams are now trailing by 13 points.\n\nThe 70-yard scoring scamper represents the second longest rushing touchdown of Barkley's NFL career. Barkley is now up to 143 yards on 14 carries, good for a 10.2 yards per carry average.\n\nEagles' all-time sack leaders\n\nBrandon Graham moved up to No. 3 all-time on the Eagles' all-time sack leaders list with his first-half sack against Matthew Stafford. Below is a look at the top-five sack men in franchise history:\n\nNo other players in Eagles franchise history have more than 57.5 total sacks to their names.\n\nEagles halftime stats\n\nBelow is a look at the Eagles' statistical leaders at halftime of their Week 12 game against the Rams:\n\nJalen Hurts: 11-of-15 passing, 101 passing yards, 35 rushing yards, 2 total TDs\n\nSaquon Barkley: 13 carries, 73 rushing yards, 3 catches, 16 receiving yards\n\nA.J. Brown: 4 catches, 69 yards, 1 TD\n\nNakobe Dean: 5 tackles, 1 sack\n\nRams halftime stats\n\nBelow is a look at the Rams' statistical leaders at halftime of their Week 12 game against the Eagles:\n\nMatthew Stafford: 7-of-11 passing, 67 passing yards, 15 rushing yards\n\nKyren Williams: 9 carries, 51 rushing yards, 1 rushing TD, 1 fumble\n\nPuka Nacua: 4 catches, 45 yards\n\nBraden Fiska: 3 tackles, 2 TFL, 1 sack\n\nMatthew Stafford sacked on Hail Mary attempt to end half\n\nThe Eagles inexplicably tried to run the ball on a fourth-and-11 with seven seconds left in the first half and failed to convert. That gave Matthew Stafford a chance to take a shot at the end-zone with just two seconds left in the half.\n\nThe issue? Stafford didn't have the time needed to get a pass off. Josh Sweat got pressure on him quickly and brought him down before Stafford could escape. That allowed the Eagles to take a 13-7 lead into the second half, where Philadelphia will get the ball first.\n\nNakobe Dean runs over Kyren Williams to sack Matthew Stafford\n\nThe Eagles' pass rush is starting to become an issue for the Rams. Nakobe Dean came on a blitz and de-cleated Kyren Williams before wrapping up Matthew Stafford for a loss of eight yards.\n\nThe Rams waved the white flag on the drive following that sack, running the ball and punting it back to the Eagles, who will have 26 seconds left to try to get into scoring range.\n\nEagles 13, Rams 7: A.J. Brown catches 6-yard touchdown from Jalen Hurts to give Eagles lead\n\nThe Eagles finally scored their first touchdown on their third red-zone drive of the day. Jalen Hurts found A.J. Brown open breaking toward the left side of the end zone, and the veteran wide out managed to catch the pass, get two feet down and take a step before defensive back Quentin Lake punched it out of his hands.\n\nThe play was initially called an incomplete pass but replay review ruled that Brown had completed the process of the catch. That, plus an extra point, gave the Eagles their first lead of the game, 13-7, with 1:27 left in the first half.\n\nBrandon Graham sacks Matthew Stafford to force second consecutive three-and-out\n\nBrandon Graham, a 36-year-old veteran who has spent his entire 15-year career with the Eagles, continues to make plays in the 206th game of his career. He brings down Matthew Stafford to bring his career sack total to 77.5 and forces the Rams to punt.\n\nGraham put a solid hit on Stafford and avoided a body-weight penalty while sending the quarterback to the ground.\n\nRams 7, Eagles 6: Jake Elliott makes 31-yard field goal to cut into deficit\n\nThe Eagles once again stalled in the red zone and were whistled for three penalties on their final set of downs before settling for a field goal. Jake Elliott once again made the kick and cut the Rams' lead to one with 6:17 left in the first half.\n\nSaquon Barkley injury update\n\nSaquon Barkley took a hard shot on a 3-yard run early in Philadelphia's second drive of the second quarter. He was able to walk off the field under his own power, but his status will be worth monitoring. He was replaced in the contest by Kenneth Gainwell.\n\nBarkley returned to the contest seven plays later.\n\nEagles stop Rams, force three-and-out\n\nPuka Nacua nearly made a spectacular catch on second-and-4 for the Rams, but he couldn't reel in a one-handed grab going to the ground. Matthew Stafford threw consecutive incompletions to end the drive, and Los Angeles kicked the ball back to Philadelphia.\n\nThe Eagles will start their next drive with good field position on their own 36-yard line.\n\nRams sack Jalen Hurts to force first punt of game\n\nThe Eagles couldn't follow up their first-drive success with a quality second drive. Jalen Hurts was chased down by Rams rookie second-round pick Braden Fiske, who brought him down for a loss of 12 yards on third-and-6.\n\nLos Angeles brought the return back to their own 21-yard line, where the Rams will look to continue their offensive success from the first couple of drives.\n\nRams lead Eagles 7-3 after first quarter\n\nLos Angeles is defending its home field well through one quarter. The Rams racked up 117 yards of offense in the first half and reached the red zone on each of their two drives. They are averaging 8.4 yards per play compared to 6.7 for the Eagles in what is shaping up to be an offensive battle.\n\nJalen Hurts (5-of-5, 47 yards) has yet to throw an incompletion while Matthew Stafford is 5-of-7 for 56 yards through the air and ran for 15 yards on a scramble. Entering the game, Stafford had negative rushing yards for the season on 10 attempts.\n\nRams 7, Eagles 3: Kyren Williams punches in 1-yard touchdown run\n\nKyren Williams atones for his first drive fumble, taking a 1-yard carry into the end zone to give the Rams their first score of the day. It marks Williams' first rushing touchdown since Los Angeles' Week 7 win over the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nWilliams now has 45 yards and a score on six carries in the first quarter. He's on pace for just his second 100-yard rushing game of the season.\n\nDo the Chargers and Rams share a stadium?\n\nYes, the Chargers and Rams both call SoFi Stadium home. Rams owner Stan Kroenke built the stadium as part of the Rams' move to Los Angeles in 2016 and has rented it to the Chargers since 2017.\n\nIt is one of two NFL stadiums that is home to two teams — MetLife Stadium, home of Giants and Jets — is the other.\n\nEagles 3, Rams 0: Jake Elliott makes chip shot field goal to open scoring\n\nLike the Rams, the Eagles weren't able to find success in the red-zone after a quality opening drive. They settled for a 21-yard field goal that Jake Elliott made with ease to give Philadelphia a 3-0 lead.\n\nJalen Hurts went 4-of-4 passing for 43 yards on the opening drive while adding 11 yards on two carries. Saquon Barkley accounted for most of the rest of the offense, racking up 26 yards on five carries.\n\nEagles use 'Ronnie Stanley' call at line of scrimmage\n\nThe Eagles gave long-time Baltimore Ravens left tackle Ronnie Stanley a shout out during their first drive against the Rams. As Jalen Hurts came to the line, he yelled Stanley's name a couple of times, presumably to communicate a call to his offensive line.\n\nKyren Williams loses fumble on Rams first drive\n\nThe Rams had a nice first drive brewing, but Kyren Williams coughed up the ball on Los Angeles' first red-zone play of the game. The Eagles jumped on it quickly to create the turnover.\n\nInitially, the officials ruled that Williams was down by contact before the fumble. Nick Sirianni challenged the play — though the officials almost missed that he had thrown the red flag before the Rams quickly ran another play — and the call was overturned.\n\nWhat is 'Heaven Can Wait'?\n\n\"Heaven Can Wait\" is a 1978 sports fantasy movie about Joe Pendleton, a backup for the Los Angeles Rams, being mistakenly taken to Heaven by an inexperienced guardian angel who presumed he was meant to die in an accident. After the mistake is realized, Pendleton is transferred into a new body on Earth, that of multi-millionaire Leo Farnsworth. The story then follows Pendleton/Farnsworth's efforts trying to get the Rams a Super Bowl, with him as a quarterback.\n\nThe movie was nominated for nine Academy Awards and was evidently a favorite of actor Rob Lowe. He cited it for inspiring his love of the Rams in a monologue during NBC's \"Football Night In America\" pregame show.\n\nRams vs. Eagles start time\n\nDate : Sunday, November 17, 2024\n\n: Sunday, November 17, 2024 Start time: 8:20 p.m. ET (5:20 PT)\n\nThe Rams and Eagles game will wrap up Sunday's action for Week 12 of the 2024 NFL season with \"Sunday Night Football\" at 8:20 p.m. ET.\n\nRams vs. Eagles TV channel\n\nCable TV: NBC\n\nNBC Streaming: Peacock | Fubo\n\nNBC will broadcast the Rams vs. Eagles Week 12 clash.

SoFi Stadium is also home to the Los Angeles Chargers, who will host the Baltimore Ravens this week on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n\n➤ Ranking NFL's stadiums from 1 to 30: What we love (and hate) about league's venues\n\nRams vs. Eagles weather updates\n\nSoFi Stadium has a roof, but it is an open-air stadium on the sides, meaning the weather could have a minor effect on Sunday night’s game.\n\nIt is expected to be 51 degrees during Sunday night’s game, per Weather.com. There is an 8% chance of rain, 4 mph of wind and it is expected to be cloudy and eventually foggy during the evening. Overall, the weather shouldn’t have a significant impact on the playing conditions, save for it being a bit chillier than usual on the field.\n\nEagles' playoff odds\n\nAccording to BetMGM Sportsbook, the Eagles have odds of -10000 to make the playoffs entering Week 12. That gives Philadelphia an implied probability of 99.01% to qualify for the postseason.\n\nRams' playoff odds\n\nBetMGM Sportsbook has set the Rams' odds to make the playoffs at +310. The sportsbook also offers odds for Los Angeles to miss the playoffs at -400.\n\nBetMGM's odds imply a 24.4% chance of making the postseason.\n\nPhiladelphia's seven remaining opponents have a combined winning percentage of .486, per Tankathon. That gives the Eagles the 16th-toughest remaining schedule among the NFL's 32 teams.\n\nThe Eagles have three games remaining against teams with three wins or fewer, so it's easy to understand why NFL oddsmakers favor Philadelphia to make the postseason.\n\nBelow is a full look at the Eagles' schedule:\n\nWith seven games left to play, Los Angeles has the 11th-hardest schedule remaining, according to Tankathon. Their upcoming opponents have a combined record of 39-29, good for a .542 win percentage.\n\nIn addition to three divisional games remaining against each NFC West team, the Rams will have to face a couple of tough opponents in the next three weeks. Los Angeles has to face two teams contending for the top seed in their respective conferences: the Eagles and the Bills. Once the Rams get through that, three of their final four games are against divisional opponents.\n\nHere's who the Rams will face over the final seven weeks:\n\nNFL defensive rookie rankings: Rams' Verse, Eagles’ Mitchell make list\n\nIf you’re looking for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year favorites, then Sunday night’s Rams-Eagles matchup is for you:\n\n1. Jared Verse, DE, Los Angeles Rams (-190)\n\nWith his mix of pedigree and production, Verse is likely to be the favorite for the rest of the regular season.\n\n2. Quinyon Mitchell, CB, Philadelphia Eagles (+320)\n\nMitchell doesn't have the same production as other defensive backs but Philadelphia's getting the attention needed to move him up the order.\n\n3. Laiatu Latu, DE, Indianapolis Colts (+2000)\n\nLatu's pedigree has him third behind Verse and Mitchell but he's pretty far out of it, barring a second-half surge in production this season.\n\nView more rankings here.\n\nWhich NFL team has the most Super Bowl wins?\n\nThe New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl wins with six.\n\nPittsburgh and Dallas have the unique distinction of playing each other more than any other team combination in Super Bowl history with three matchups.\n\nThe Rams have played in five Super Bowls — winning two, most recently Super Bowl 56 against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Eagles have played in four Super Bowls — winning one against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 52.\n\nNFL franchises with most Super Bowl wins:\n\n➤ Super Bowl winners: All-time scores, results for NFL title game\n\nDo you like football?

The Commanders dropped to 7-4 and theirs dreams of becoming division champions are beginning to fade. Thursday night didn't look like a battle for first place, but rather an ode to the days of the \"NFC Least.\"\n\nSaquon Barkley continued to shine, rushing for 146 yards and posting two touchdowns while falling inches short of a third. If it wasn't clear by now, the Eagles will go as Barkley goes. The playoff push is on, but these Eagles will need to clean it up if they want to make some noise in January ... and February.\n\nThe upstart Commanders couldn't get anything going on Thursday night, but were able to mostly measure up against a far better opponent. Rome wasn't built in a day, but the Commanders are on the fast track to success in an area where everything moves at a snail's pace.\n\nHere's a look at how the action unfolded on Thursday night:\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nCommanders vs. Eagles highlights\n\nFinal: Eagles 26, Commanders 18\n\nCommanders' onside kick attempt fails\n\nZane Gonzalez doesn't have the magic foot as it's easily recovered by Dallas Goedert. The curtain is now closed and the Eagles will run out the clock to hold onto first place in the NFC East.\n\nCommanders-Eagles score update: Zach Ertz keeps Washington alive\n\nThe curtains are almost closed, but not entirely. Ertz finds the end zone against his former team and collects the two-point conversion for the Octopus to cut the Eagles' lead to eight. With just 28 seconds to go, Washington will need to recover an onside kick to have a chance. Eagles 26, Commanders 18.\n\nCommanders-Eagles score update: Saquon Barkley scores dagger TD\n\nThat was quick. Barkley gets his second touchdown in the last 20 seconds with a 39-yard run. It's curtains for Washington. Eagles 26, Commanders 10.\n\nJayden Daniels intercepted by Reed Blankenship\n\nThe wheels are completely off for the Commanders now, as Daniels tosses an interception to Blankenship. Philly can chew the clock and relax the rest of the way.\n\nCommanders-Eagles score update: Saquon Barkley scores\n\nSaquon Barkley might've just put this one on ice. He rushes in from 23 yard out to put Philly up 19-10 with just 4:58 to go. Dallas Goedert had the big 31-yard catch on this drive (though he nearly fumbled and was saved by fellow tight end Grant Calcaterra). After Washington's failed fourth-down try, it'll take a big effort to have a chance in this one. Eagles 19, Commanders 10.\n\nWashington gets aggressive but comes up short on 4th down\n\nFaced with the opportunity to take the lead, Washington elected to roll the dice and go for it on fourth down. The play is blown up in the backfield, with Jayden Daniels running out of room on the sidelines.\n\nCommanders-Eagles score update: Philly takes first lead with TD, but Jake Elliott misses extra point\n\nThe Eagles have finally broken through. Jalen Hurts finds pay dirt with 12 minutes left in the fourth quarter. The patented \"Brotherly Shove,\" or \"Tush Push,\" gets the job done once again. That moment of jubilation is short-lived, however. Jake Elliott continues his night to forget by pulling the extra point wide left. These things typically come back to haunt teams, so Washington might be feeling good now despite being down. Eagles 12, Commanders 10.\n\nEnd of third quarter: Washington maintains lead heading into final frame\n\nAnother fast-paced quarter comes to an end with really no changes. The Commanders are still nursing a four-point lead, while the Eagles' offense continues to be nothing but empty calories.\n\nCommanders-Eagles score update: Jake Elliott gets FG right back\n\nIf the Eagles were a car, they'd be getting checked out by the mechanic. Philly just can't stop stalling out, this time wasting a 74-yard drive to settle for three from Jake Elliott. The kicker is money from inside 50, knocking through this 31-yard try. Saquon Barkley's catch-and-run for 43 yards will be merely a blip on the highlight reel, but nothing good truly came out of it. Commanders 10, Eagles 6.\n\nCommanders-Eagles score update: Zane Gonzalez extends Washington's lead\n\nWashington scores on its opening drive of the second half, finishing it off with a 45-yard field goal from Gonzalez. Commanders 10, Eagles 3.\n\nJalen Hurts injury update\n\nA tough first half for the Philadelphia Eagles ended with a major injury scare.\n\nDespite controlling the time of possession and nearly running double the amount of plays, the Eagles trailed the Washington Commanders 7-3 at halftime. But the images at the end of the half were even more alarming.\n\nQuarterback Jalen Hurts was seen in the blue medical tent, presumably with the independent neurologist.\n\nThankfully for the Eagles, he jogged off the field at halftime and was cleared to return after a concussion evaluation.\n\nCommanders-Eagles score update: Philly cuts into Washington's lead\n\nThe teams traded punts for a majority of the second quarter, before the Eagles decided to put their foot on the gas. NFL fans can appreciate the work of Tress Way and Braden Mann, but it's unlikely fans are paying for Prime Video to watch a punter duel.\n\nEither way, Philly is finally on the board courtesy of a Jake Elliott field goal. He knocks it through from 21 yards out to avoid the boos that would've rained down from the Philly faithful if he'd missed a third kick in the first half. The Eagles got the ball all the way to the Washington 3-yard line before failing to punch it in. Commanders 7, Eagles 3\n\nJake Elliott stats\n\nElliott has been a good kicker for the Eagles, even knocking through a couple of 60 yarders in his career. However, distance isn't his forte this season. Elliott has attempted four field goals from 50 yards or longer this season, missing all of them. That will make life difficult for this Philly offense, knowing it can't trust its kicker to come through from long range. Elliott, like a basketball player, needs to see one go through before getting his mojo back.\n\nEagles' drive stalls, Jake Elliott misses another field goal\n\nIt's becoming a theme, but the Eagles weren't able to capitalize on great field position. Jake Elliott missed again, this time from 51 yards out. Philly tried some razzle-dazzle, but that was sniffed out by Frankie Luvu, who dropped Jalen Hurts for a big loss. Now Washington gets a chance at having good field position, looking to extend its lead.\n\nEnd of the first quarter: Commanders lead after 15 minutes\n\nThe Eagles controlled the time of possession and ran twice as many plays as the Commanders, but have nothing to show for it after one. They trail 7-0, but have the ball at the Washington 41-yard line when play resumes.\n\nCommanders-Eagles score update: Brian Robinson Jr. punches it in to give Washington lead\n\nWashington's first drive lasted a minute and ended with a quick punt. Washington's second drive lasted two minutes and ended with a touchdown. Brian Robinson Jr. finished it off with a 1-yard run to get the Commanders on the board. The running backs did the damage on this drive. Austin Ekeler's 34-yard catch-and-run set it up and Robinson's 18-yard carry got the Commanders down to the goal line.\n\nWashington leads 7-0.\n\nSaquon Barkley goes over 1,000 yards rushing\n\nA fantastic season for the star running back continues, as Barkley gets over the 1,000 rushing yard mark on an 8-yard carry to start the drive. He came up short in 2023 after posting 1,312 yards in 2022. Barkley has dealt with plenty of injuries, and inept offenses, during his career, but is back to star status in Philadelphia.\n\nBarkley's next challenge is to get back to 2,000 scrimmage yards, something he hasn't done since his rookie year in 2018. With seven more games to go, there's a real chance he's able to get there once again.\n\nCommanders start with a three-and-out\n\nWashington caught a break on the Jake Elliott miss, but was unable to do anything with its good fortune. A quick three-and-out took only about a minute off the clock before allowing Jalen Hurts and the Eagles to go back to work.\n\nEagles come up empty on opening drive after Jake Elliott misses field goal\n\nPhilly's opening drive got off to a promising start, with the big play being an A.J. Brown 32-yard catch-and-run. The drive quickly stalled after a penalty, forcing the Eagles to settle for three. However, Jake Elliott pushed his kick wide left on the 44-yard try. No score through five minutes.\n\nLandon Dickerson injury update: Eagles guard helped off field\n\nWe're just over a minute into tonight's festivities and we have our first injury of the night: Eagles left guard Landon Dickerson. He was rolled up on and limped off the field after a Saquon Barkley run. Tyler Steen is in to replace him for the time being.\n\nEagles vs. Commanders start time\n\nDate: Thursday, November 14, 2024\n\nThursday, November 14, 2024 Time: 8:15 p.m. ET\n\nThe Eagles and Commanders game will kick off Week 11 of the 2024 NFL season with \"Thursday Night Football\" at 8:15 p.m. ET.\n\nEagles vs. Commanders TV Channel\n\nLive stream: Amazon Prime Video\n\nAmazon Prime Video TV channel: Fox Ch. 29 (Philadelphia market) | Fox Ch. 5 (Washington D.C market)\n\n\"Thursday Night Football\" will exclusively stream on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nEagles vs. Commanders picks, predictions\n\nHere's how the USA TODAY Sports staff feels the Week 11 \"TNF\" matchup between the Eagles and Commanders will shape up:\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Eagles 27, Commanders 21\n\nEagles 27, Commanders 21 Tyler Dragon: Eagles, 26 Commanders 20\n\nEagles, 26 Commanders 20 Richard Morin: Commanders 26.

According to the Weather Channel, winds will max out at 8 mph while chances of precipitation are at 20% for the entire game.\n\nEagles vs. Commanders history\n\nThese NFC East rivals have met 178 times, including one playoff matchup. Washington leads the matchup all-time with an 89-84-5 record. However, the Eagles have dominated this matchup in recent history with Philadelphia winning 11 of the last 14 meetings.\n\nNFL draft 2025 order entering Week 11\n\nHere’s how the first round of the 2025 NFL draft stacks up entering Week 11:\n\nWho are the Thursday Night Football announcers for Amazon Prime Video?\n\nAl Michaels (play-by-play) and Kirk Herbstreit (analyst) will be in the broadcast booth for Prime Video, with Kaylee Hartung (sideline) and Terry McAulay (rules analyst) providing additional coverage.\n\nThe Prime Video pregame, halftime and postgame shows feature Charissa Thompson as host, as well as former NFL players Ryan Fitzpatrick, Tony Gonzalez, Richard Sherman and Andrew Whitworth as analysts.\n\nTaylor Rooks is the feature reporter for Prime Video's \"Thursday Night Football\" coverage. Albert Breer provides reports and analysis.\n\nAndrew Marchand, formerly of the New York Post, initially reported that Michaels' contract would be for three years and \"north of $30 million,\" but that number may have gone up.

Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott became the league's highest-paid player earlier this year, agreeing to a four-year, $240 million deal. Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson is the first non-quarterback on the highest-paid list after striking a four-year, $140 million contract extension this offseason.\n\nComplete list of the league’s highest-paid players\n\nOldest players in NFL in 2024\n\nJust four players in the 2024 NFL player pool surpass 40 years old: Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Bears tight end Marcedes Lewis, Rams kicker Matt Prater and Titans kicker Nick Folk.\n\nOnly Rodgers will turn 41 during the season, with a birthday coming the first week in December.\n\nHere's the full list of the top 11 oldest players in football:\n\nQB Aaron Rodgers, Jets: 40 years old (Dec. 2, 1983) TE Marcedes Lewis, Bears: 40 years old (May 19, 1984) K Matt Prater, Rams: 40 years old (Aug. 10, 1984) K Nick Folk, Titans: 40 years old (Nov. 5, 1984) QB Joe Flacco, Colts: 39 years old (Jan. 16, 1985) C/LS J.J.

With the threat posed by quarterback Lamar Jackson as a runner, Henry is killing NFL defenses with a league-leading 873 yards on 134 carries, a robust 6.5 yards per carry.\n\nHenry’s previous seven-game best was 869 yards in 2021, a season that got cut short by a foot injury that denied him a third consecutive league rushing title.\n\nAs things stand now, Henry’s rushing total is more than 200 yards ahead of the next-best backs, the San Francisco 49ers’ Jordan Mason (667 yards) and the Philadelphia Eagles’ Saquon Barkley (658 yards).\n\nSunshine State struggles:Billy Napier's football program surprisingly looks in better shape than FSU with Norvell\n\nIf Henry can stay reasonably healthy for another two or three seasons, he could very well move into the conversation among the NFL’s all-time greatest backs. Henry is already 30th all-time among NFL rushers with 10,375 yards, but he could squeeze into the top 20 and surpass Corey Dillon (11,241) by averaging 86.7 yards in the Ravens’ last 10 games.\n\nGiven Henry’s track record of durability, it’s not inconceivable he could join Emmitt Smith, John Riggins and Marcus Allen as one of five rushers to eclipse 4,000 rushing yards after the age of 30. Henry already has 1,026 yards, counting the 153-yard game he had on Jan. 7 against the Jaguars, three days after turning 30.\n\nCan Henry possibly threaten Smith’s all-time rushing record of 18,355 yards? Probably not, but if he plays until age 35 like Smith did, Henry has a legitimate shot to become the fifth back all-time to hit 15,000 yards.\n\nSo Henry is on pace to make all kinds of history, including a third NFL rushing crown, a feat accomplished by just eight players and none since the Minnesota Vikings’ Adrian Peterson in 2015.\n\nIf Henry wins the 2024 league rushing title, he would join Cleveland Browns fullback Marion Motley (1950) as the only 30-year-old to achieve that distinction and would be the oldest NFL player to do it.\n\nBy the end of his career, health permitting, Henry might compel NFL historians to put him on the Mount Rushmore of running backs.\n\nArmstead has been no bargain\n\nWhen the Jaguars signed free agent defensive lineman Arik Armstead to a three-year, $43.5 million contract, it created the expectation that he would fortify the trenches in a significantly impactful way.\n\nSo far, the evidence suggests the 31-year-old veteran is highly overpaid.\n\nThrough seven games, Armstead has one sack, two quarterback hits and 10 tackles, all numbers that project below his averages over nine seasons with the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nArmstead, who needed offseason surgery to repair a torn meniscus, is averaging just 33.0 snaps per game (48 percent). It’s easily the lowest of Armstead’s career since his rookie season in 2015 when he logged 23.5 snaps.\n\nIt’s understandable the Jaguars don’t want to overload him, but for a player who was guaranteed $28 million, that’s not a lot of bang for the buck.\n\nJaguars’ Gaziano misses dream sack\n\nNobody was happier about being elevated from the practice squad for the Jaguars' game last week against the New England Patriots than defensive lineman Joe Gaziano, a Boston native who was stoked to play against his hometown team.\n\nGaziano, an undrafted free agent playing for his third team, had a dream scenario unfold in the fourth quarter. He correctly read a Patriots play and broke free from his end spot, chasing after Drake Maye for what would have been his second career sack. But the rookie QB wisely flipped the ball at running back JaMycal Hasty’s feet to avoid a loss.\n\n“I really wanted that one,” said Gaziano. “i have a lot of friends from high school who are Patriots’ fans. I know they were watching the game. My family made it out to the game, so it would have been cool to get that sack at Wembley Stadium.”\n\nGaziano, who grew up a Patriots fan, savored the victory and an opportunity to see his first NFL action since a January game suiting up for the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nNow in his fifth NFL season, the Northwestern career sack leader (30 sacks) and three-time, All Big Ten performer went undrafted, mostly because he was a ‘tweener player. Teams couldn’t decide whether to play him as a big end or a three-technique tackle, and Gaziano played all those spots during his first three years with the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nUnder Ryan Nielsen, his coordinator with Atlanta, he plays the big end. If the Jaguars elevate him to the 53-man roster for two more games, Gaziano would earn a fifth accrued season and gain full NFL pension benefits.\n\nValenzuela was MLB rock star\n\nWhat a bittersweet week for Major League Baseball, having a dream World Series matchup between the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers, yet losing iconic pitcher Fernando Valenzuela at 63 to a reported battle with liver cancer.\n\nMore than any foreign-born player, the southpaw Valenzuela brought instant star power when he broke into MLB with the Dodgers, creating Fernandomania with his unique pitching style of looking skyward before delivering the ball to the plate.\n\nAs the only pitcher to win a Cy Young and Rookie of the Year in the same season (1981), the Mexican-born Valenzuela, a six-time All-Star through 1986, quickly became an instant sensation by uniting the Mexican community in Los Angeles with the baseball world.\n\nThough he’s not in the Hall of Fame, it’s impossible to have a conversation about the greatest international stars in baseball history without including the fabulous “El Toro.”\n\nDespite not being as accomplished as the likes of foreign-born players like Roberto Clemente, Mariano Rivera, Ichiro, Albert Pujols and Shohei Ohtani, there's no debating what Valenzuela did for baseball was every bit as impactful as those international stars. His level of popularity.during his prime years (1981-86) with the Dodgers was massive.\n\nValenzuela came along at a time when MLB was starting to lose its grip to the NFL as America’s most visible sport. Nobody created more fan fervor during a windup than “El Toro.” RIP, Fernando.\n\nWNBA officiating hurts credibility\n\nI’m rarely critical of officiating because it’s a tough job and close judgment calls in games often go both ways. Despite what fans think, the people in stripes rarely decide outcomes.\n\nHowever, what happened in the final seconds of the WNBA winner-take-all championship game with the New York Liberty and Minnesota Lynx was unconscionable.\n\nAs Liberty star Breanna Stewart started driving into the lane with five seconds left in regulation — her team trailing by two points in a game it eventually won 67-62 in overtime — she clearly shuffles her feet in a way that made it an easy call for traveling.\n\nInstead, the officials allowed play to continue and Stewart was subsequently awarded two free throws on a borderline foul call against Lynx forward Alanna Smith. She made both free throws to send the game into overtime.\n\nLynx coach Cheryl Reeve minced no words after the game, saying the WNBA title was “stolen from us.” Even Lebron James felt compelled to post this on X: “I’m sorry but that wasn’t a foul! Let the damn players dictate the outcome of a close battled tested game.”\n\nThe foul call wasn’t nearly as egregious as the mind-blowing lapse in judgment by officials to not whistle Stewart for traveling. It’s a shame a great WNBA season — buoyed by the star power of Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark and record TV ratings for the Finals Game 5 — ended with such a damaging blow to the league’s credibility.\n\nQuick-hitting nuggets\n\nIn case you wondered where the 96-yard punt return touchdown by the Jaguars’ Parker Washington last week against New England ranked in NFL history, only 10 other TDs off punt returns were longer. The record is 103 yards by the Los Angeles Rams’ Robert Bailey in 1994. ...\n\nCondolences to the University of South Florida athletic community on the shocking news that men’s basketball coach Amir Abdur-Rahim, 43, passed away Thursday from surgery complications.

He also led USF, which is scheduled to face Florida on November 4 at Vystar Veterans Memorial Arena, to a school-record 25 wins in his first year and the AAC regular-season title. ...\n\nWith Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson out for the season with a ruptured Achilles, it means his only win in 2024 will be an 18-13 victory over the Jaguars in Week 2 at EverBank Stadium.

It has been the mainstay of athletic training programs for decades. Bodybuilders and power lifters at the amateur and professional level have relied on this exercise as the core of their strength development programs.\n\nIt is almost lovingly referred to as the \"king\" of all exercises. Non-scientific claims abound that it actually exercises 200 different muscles in the body.\n\nThe debate about the squat goes far beyond the gym. In orthopedic research literature, there is much controversy about the safety and efficacy of the squat.\n\nConcern over injuries to the neck, back and knees has spawned many a research study to try and reach some conclusions as to whether the squat is really worth doing. I have had many patients over the years report to me \"my doctor told me to never do squats.\"\n\nThe results of these studies are varied. If you have enough time, you will find research that supports or refutes what you believe about this exercise.\n\nNow isn't that confusing?\n\nYet despite this apparent controversy, the exercise is still widely performed by athletes and fitness enthusiasts at all levels. There is no doubt that it is an extremely applicable and useful exercise for even basic mobility needs.\n\nIt does exercise the key muscles we use to rise from a chair or bed, climb the stairs or to even get a pot out of a low cabinet. To pick up your child from the ground is really a modified squat exercise. I routinely use it in my practice for rehabilitation of hip and knee injuries and surgeries.\n\nHere is what I do know about squats that is true beyond a doubt: Most people perform the exercise incorrectly.\n\nThat's right. I could walk into any fitness center or gym in the world and find that most people are not squatting properly.\n\nIncorrect form is what often leads to injuries that gives squats a bad name. In fact, in the past month, I have had two patients that have suffered back injuries from not using proper form with squatting.\n\nSo here is where most people go wrong:\n\n•The wrong upper body position: I often see the person with a more hunched forward posture in the upper body, almost looking like the bar on their shoulders is pushing them down to the floor. Keep your chin up as if you are looking at the ceiling. This first key position is critical, as it sets up the rest of the exercise.\n\n•The wrong lower back position: What leads to most of the back injuries associated with squatting is allowing the back to round outward. Keep the lower back arched inward in what is termed a \"neutral spine.\" This is the position that you would use to properly lift a heavy object from the floor.\n\n•Wrong position with knees: Keep your hips/buttocks back and don't let the knees project over your toes when you are in the low position of the squat. If you have done Numbers 1 and 2 correctly, you are on your way to making sure point Number 3 is done properly. If there was a string hanging down from the ceiling, your ear, knee and ankle bone should all fall on that line.\n\nWhen done properly, the squat may indeed, be the king of all exercises.\n\nJohn Bradley has been practicing orthopedic physical therapy for 27 years and is co-owner of Performance Physical Therapy and Fitness in Hockessin and Brandywine Hundred.

The Eagles could have as many as 10 picks in the 2020 draft, after having five in each of the past two years.\n\nThere will also be a new offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach after Mike Groh and Carson Walch, respectively, were fired last week.\n\nHere, then, is a look at several veterans on offense, and whether they should return or not:\n\nJason Peters, left tackle\n\nStay: Peters will turn 38 on Jan. 22, but he's still one of the better left tackles in the NFL. Sure, he led the team with 10 penalties. But as Peters said recently about whether he can still play: \"You tell me somebody that’s better than me, and I’ll walk away from the game.\"\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nThere's nobody better on the Eagles.\n\nGo: The Eagles drafted his successor in Andre Dillard in the first round last season. Dillard started three games when Peters was out with a knee injury. Dillard played well enough to show that he'll be ready in 2020. He spent his rookie season learning from Peters. He's ready to take over.\n\nVerdict: Peters is a free agent, and there's no way the Eagles are going to re-sign him for $6 million or more, and have Dillard sit for a second season.\n\nAlshon Jeffery, wide receiver\n\nStay: By releasing Jeffery, the Eagles would eat $26 million in dead money, unless they can trade him, which would reduce that by $10 million. Good luck trading someone who just had foot surgery and needs several months of recovery time.\n\nThe Eagles might be left to hope that if Jeffery is healthy toward the middle of next season, that he can contribute like he did in 2017.\n\nGo: Jeffery is coming off his worst season. He's also about to turn 30. And while he vehemently denied being the source of an ESPN report last October criticizing Wentz and the Eagles' offense, he and Wentz did struggle to find a comfort zone on the field.\n\nVerdict: If the best reason for keeping Jeffery is that the Eagles are going to be stuck with him because of his contract, then it's time for him to go. The Eagles drafted J.J. Arcega-Whiteside because of his ability to get 50-50 balls. It's time for Arcega-Whiteside to prove that he can handle it.\n\nDeSean Jackson, wide receiver\n\nStay: Jackson is the speed receiver the Eagles desperately need. In his one full game, the opener against Washington, he caught TD passes of 51 and 53 yards. There are few players in the NFL who can take off the top of a defense like Jackson, even at the age of 33.\n\nGo: The injuries. Jackson hasn't played a full season since 2013, and there's no telling how much longer he can continue to burn defenders deep. He's also coming off core muscle surgery.\n\nVerdict: The Eagles should bring him back, but also add another speed receiver, either in the draft or free agency (Robby Anderson of the Jets?).\n\nNelson Agholor, wide receiver\n\nStay: After a dreadful and injury-plagued season, it's hard to find a reason for Agholor to return unless the pending free agent is willing to take a one-year, prove-it type deal. Even then, it would have to be very team friendly.\n\nGo: It just hasn't worked for the Eagles' first-round pick in 2015, other than the Super Bowl season. It's probably best for both Agholor and the Eagles to move on.\n\nVerdict: Greg Ward showed that he deserves to return as the slot receiver after being the Eagles' leading receiver over the final five weeks of the season. Ward would also be much, much cheaper than Agholor. This is a no-brainer.\n\nJordan Howard, running back\n\nStay: Howard was the Eagles' lead running back before he was hurt on Nov. 3. He had 525 yards rushing, and with his bruising, straight-ahead style was the perfect complement to rookie Miles Sanders\n\nGo: Sanders established himself as a budding star, and will be the lead back next season. The Eagles also have Boston Scott, who like Ward, proved that he deserves a role next season. There's also Corey Clement coming back from shoulder surgery, although he's eligible for free agency.\n\nVerdict: Howard is eligible for free agency. Whether the Eagles want him back or not, it's hard to see Howard turning down the chance to start for another team for more money.\n\nHalapoulivaati Vaitai, offensive line\n\nStay: For three straight seasons, Vaitai has started multiple games in place of either Peters or right tackle Lane Johnson. He hasn't been great, but he was good enough for the most part when called upon.\n\nGo: The Eagles have enough depth on the offensive line. Matt Pryor played well enough at right guard in place of Brandon Brooks when needed, and Pryor can play tackle. And Jordan Mailata cross-trained at right tackle before spending last season on injured reserve.\n\nVerdict: Vaitai is a free agent, and some team out there will sign him to start. The Eagles won't pay starter money to keep him.\n\nJosh McCown, quarterback\n\nStay: McCown was already well respected in the Eagles' locker room, both for his experience and his work with Carson Wentz. Then he achieved hero status when he admitted playing the second half of the Eagles' playoff loss to Seattle with a torn hamstring that required surgery.\n\nAt 40, McCown was like another coach for Wentz, and he proved that he can still play. That's invaluable.\n\nGo: There is the age, and the surgery, and that McCown would fly home every Friday during the season to help coach his kids' high school football team. The Eagles also have Nate Sudfeld, who was going to be the backup before breaking his wrist in the summer, forcing the signing of McCown.\n\nVerdict: It's been a great run for McCown, who played 17 seasons, and he got a chance to play in a playoff game for the first time in his career. Sudfeld is a free agent also. Still, it's easy to see the Eagles signing another veteran backup QB, maybe even someone like Eli Manning, and bringing back second-year man Kyle Lauletta, who spent last season on the practice squad, as the No. 3.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

I encouraged [Under] Secretary [Allison] Hickey to reach out to the private sector ... [for] quality improvement processes that are very important for big organizations like that.\"\n\nHickey, he said, \"said that they've been doing that. They looked at other regional benefits centers that did similar work.\" For a moment, Carney was at a loss for words.\n\n\"They had issues with their mail processing, for God's sake,\" Carney said. \"It's just as basic as that.\"\n\nDuring a closed-door meeting with legislators, quality review specialist and whistleblower Kristen Ruell said little has changed since she testified before Congress two months ago. \"I'm seeing the same things, and it's worse than ever,\" Ruell said, according to a report in Stars and Stripes. \"Employee morale is at an all-time low.\"\n\n\"We're going to make some major changes — maybe fire people,\" Rep. Ralph Abraham, R-La., told Stars and Stripes.\n\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Regional Office manages the Wilmington benefits office, adjacent to the VA Medical Center near Elsmere. Itoversees the administration of benefits to 825,000 veterans in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, and has handled hundreds of Delaware-based veterans' claims.\n\nCarney said he left the meeting \"with kind of mixed feelings.\" He said he was impressed with Hickey, who seemed \"really focused on correcting the problems they've got there.\"\n\nOn the other hand, he said, \"On the other hand, it's really angering that it got to this point.\"\n\nNone of Delaware's three members of Congress are members of the veterans committees in the two houses. \"Ours is more of an oversight role, frankly,\" Carney said. \"And to do it well and effectively, you have get down in the weeds a little bit, understand what's going on, make sure that the data that you're given is accurate. And then just stay vigilant ... ask the right questions. That was a big part of today.\"\n\nThe delegation recently applied pressure on the Wilmington VA Medical Center. Carney, and Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons have written twice in recent months to Director Robin Aube-Warren, saying May 8 they want to see a \"full and timely explanation\" of the wait time issues the VA IG investigated last year but has yet to report publicly. The trio called on VA to release that report.\n\nIn addition to the Veterans Benefits Administration's Hickey, and Reps. Carney, Dent and Abraham, R-La., and chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, attending the Philadelphia meeting were Linda Halliday, VA's Assistant Inspector General for Audits and Evaluations; Diana Rubens, director of the Philadelphia office; and other officials.\n\nIn a statement released after the meeting, Dent and Abraham said the issues raised in the VA IG report \"exposed the personal and monetary costs that develop and thrive within an environment and structure that lacks true accountability.\" But, they added, \"While these specific issues occurred here in the Philadelphia Regional Office, the unfortunate reality is that they are not contained to a single facility or region and they speak to a broader need to reform the VA's internal culture to avoid further consequences at the national level.\"\n\nContact William H.

A collapse in the national economy. The death of a visionary founder.\n\nAny one of those crises might spell certain doom for a small company.\n\nBut Adesis, a contract research organization near New Castle, managed to endure all three in a single decade and come out the other side with plans to grow larger than ever.\n\n“The reality is, we all have a point of shutdown. It’s just a question of when,” said CEO and chief science officer Ving Lee. “That’s why the most important thing any entrepreneurial company can do is evolve new strategies and stay one or two steps ahead of your competitors.”\n\nOver its 24-year history, the company in the Southgate Center industrial park off Boulden Boulevard has evolved into a developer and manufacturer of specialized chemical compounds that drug makers and others use to achieve their next big breakthroughs.\n\nIn the last decade, five biotech companies have won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency to market advanced compounds that were created with the building blocks supplied by Adesis.\n\nThe privately-held company, which boasts annual revenues in the “double-digit tens of millions,” is in the process of adding a dozen new employees to its staff of 45 chemists and researchers as it looks to take advantage of new contracts that could result from pharmaceutical companies expanding their pipelines in the coming years.\n\nWhile Adesis is now growing to meet that demand, it was only a few years ago that the company appeared to be on the verge of collapse.\n\nLaunched in 1991 as CB Research, the company began with a narrow focus on a few types of chemicals, primarily the starting compounds for UV protectants used in intraocular lens implants that founder Chuck Beard had previously worked on at Johnson and Johnson.\n\nBut Beard’s ability to anticipate market trends set the company on a new path that it continues to follow today.\n\n“He recognized a decade before anyone else that there was going to be a decentralization of research efforts in the pharma industry,” Lee said. “He moved the company into becoming a true contract research organization and he was one of the godfathers that started this trend way before others jumped on the bandwagon.”\n\nA few years later, however, the company was dealt its first major blow when two former employees stole its catalog of recipes for creating those specialty chemicals. Using those trade secrets, as well as an intimate knowledge of the company’s customer base and pricing structure, the former employees launched their own business, which severely undercut their former employer.\n\nCB Research was forced to lay off more than 30 people – half of its workforce – before spending millions of dollars on a five-year legal battle it won in 2009. Although the Beard family and the firm – which changed its name to Adesis in 2005 – was eventually awarded more than $6 million in damages by the Delaware Court of Chancery, those funds have yet to be paid, Lee said.\n\nWhile that legal drama was unfolding, Adesis co-owners Beard, Lee and Andrew Cottone, the company’s vice president of chemistry, were running up massive debts just to keep their business alive. Meanwhile, the nation was on the verge of an economic meltdown as a result of the looming banking crisis.\n\nYet with nearly $590,000 in state financing and their own capital, the owners did the unthinkable by expanding the business with the addition of a 10,000-square-foot lab.\n\nThat facility opened Sept. 15, 2008 – the same day Lehman Brothers submitted the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, touching off what would become the Great Recession.\n\n“Most people thought we were fools to build another lab, but as the saying goes, the best time to start a business is when the economy is poor,” Lee said. “We wanted to be ready to regain the business and our confidence, and it turned out to be the best decision we ever made.”\n\nThat lab allowed Adesis to expand its research capabilities, which enabled the company to thrive as pharmaceutical companies began outsourcing their technological expertise during the economic downturn.\n\nToday, the research done in that lab allows Adesis to weather the cyclical nature of the business without having to make drastic changes to its personnel.\n\n“If we have a situation where a client comes forward and says ‘I need x number of chemists immediately,’ it gives us a reservoir of personnel that we can pull out of self-funded projects in order to service those programs,” he said.\n\nThose research programs also have allowed Adesis to build up a catalog of more than 1,800 chemical compounds, the majority of which were first created by the company.\n\nThe company’s ability to rapidly produce those compounds – which can retail for as much as $800 a gram – is what sets Adesis it apart from the competition, Lee said.\n\n“Most companies wait until they get enough orders for a chemical to produce a certain amount,” he said. “But in research, time is money. You want the answer as soon as possible, not in 12 months.”\n\nAdesis weathered its most recent crisis in 2012 when Beard succumbed to cancer.\n\nLee, who first met Beard when the two were lab partners at Ohio State University, has since taken over running the company, splitting his time between Adesis and other ventures in San Francisco.\n\nThe day-to-day operations are handled by Cottone, who now owns the company along with Lee and Beard’s widow, Caroline. Beard’s son Paul serves as the company’s director of business development.\n\nAdesis has had offers to relocate overseas or elsewhere in the country, including a $17 million inducement to move to Philadelphia.\n\nBut Lee said the owners are committed to continuing Beard’s dream in Delaware.\n\n“It’s a recognition in the outside world and internally that his value has not been exploited,” Lee said. “This company also has been through a lot and we consider our employees to be an investment. We’re not only investing in them, they’ve invested in us and we’re staying here with them.”\n\nContact Scott Goss at (302) 324-2282, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/03/29/wilmington-choose-17-new-red-light-camera-locations/465605002/", "title": "Wilmington to choose 17 new red-light camera locations", "text": "The new cameras, and the removal of some existing ones, bring the total number of red-light cameras to 44.\n\nDrivers in Wilmington would face more $110 fines if proposed red-light cameras are installed in 17 new locations.\n\nThe city said it would increase its intersection surveillance \"based on state-provided data on traffic accidents and violations within Wilmington,\" according to a budget summary released last week.\n\nThe effort will cost $200,000, the summary said, but will be \"more than offset\" by the estimated $1.5 million in fines the city will collect in the first six months of 2019.\n\nThe city has not yet determined where the cameras will go, the Mayor's Office said.\n\nA state law passed in 2016 requires municipalities to have a safety-based reason to install red-light cameras in a given location.\n\nThe state Department of Transportation gave the city a list of 31 intersections that do not have cameras and where \"high accident data is evident,\" said John Rago, Mayor Mike Purzycki's deputy chief of staff for policy and communications.\n\nThe location on the list with the highest red-light-related crash numbers is at Walnut and 11th streets, which saw 39 \"red-light running crashes\" from 2011 to 2015, according to a DelDOT report.\n\nMost of the considered sites had much fewer crashes. A site at Delaware Avenue and Washington Street experienced five such crashes in that time period.\n\nThe city will verify DelDOT's data in the coming weeks and will choose 17 sites.

He went back in front to stay with 14 laps left, holding off Kevin Harvick and Hendrick Motorsports teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. to get his 72nd career victory.\n\nHarvick, the series points leader who has already won twice this season, finished second.\n\nThe runner-up finish for Harvick comes after he was eighth in Martinsville in the last Cup race two weeks ago. That ended his run of eight consecutive races finishing first or second, the longest such stretch since Richard Petty did it 11 times in a row in 1975.\n\n\"I'm not disappointed at all, racing for wins is what we're here to do,\" said Harvick, who led 96 of the 334 laps but is without a win in 25 Texas starts. \"Nothing at all to hang your head about.\"\n\nThis was the fifth time in Johnson's last seven starts at the 11/ 2 -mile, high-banked track that he led at least 100 laps. This is fourth win in the span that also includes a runner-up finish in the spring race three years ago.\n\nEarnhardt, with his third third-place finish this season, gave Chevrolet a sweep of the top three spots in the first Sprint Cup night race this season.\n\nTeam Penske rounded out the top five in a pair of Fords, with defending race winner Joey Logano finishing fourth and Brad Keselowski fifth.\n\nHarvick, Logano and Martin Truex Jr., who finished ninth, are the only drivers to finish in the top 10 in all seven races this season. Keselowski got his sixth top 10.\n\nJeff Gordon, who in his last full season, is the only driver who has started all 29 Sprint Cup races at Texas since the track opened in 1997.

It is also the only track in his 768 career races where he has finished 43rd — last in the field — and it did that twice, in 1999 and again in 2008.\n\nUnlike after Johnson's win in November, the only postrace fireworks this time were in the sky.\n\nThere was late contact between Keselowski and Gordon in the race five months ago. That led to a post-race melee on pit road involving both of their teams, a fracas that broke out after Harvick pushed Keselowski into the fray.\n\nHarvick had led only eight total laps at Texas before starting on the front row Saturday night and leading the first 33 laps.\n\nHarvick and his Stewart-Haas Racing teammate Kurt Busch, the polesitter, combined to lead the first 79 laps before Gordon passed Busch for a brief time up front. Busch finished 14th\n\nThe only other driver with more than two Cup wins at Texas is Carl Edwards, a three-time winner.

Liberals in metropolitan areas were stunned that a man they had labeled a sexist and narcissist had won the presidency, while conservatives across rural America were delighted that an outsider was primed to ‘drain the swamp’ in Washington.\n\nIn densely packed and deeply Democratic New Castle County, the mood was gloom.\n\nWomen hoping to witness the first female president were crushed to watch Hillary Clinton lose to a man repeatedly accused of sexual abuse and harassment.\n\nDemocrats faced the grim reality that their victories during President Barack Obama’s tenure — the Affordable Care Act, agreements on global climate change and gay marriage, to name a few — could be erased by a resurgent GOP that will control not only the White House, but both houses of Congress and set the tone for the Supreme Court for years to come.\n\nMinority voters — African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Muslim Americans — grappled with the fact that the next president has been criticized for comments that were called racist and xenophobic, and who won almost entirely with the votes of white Americans.\n\nDenise Turner, a 45-year-old court case manager, said in Wilmington on Wednesday that she was afraid.\n\n\"I wish I had my passport in hand,\" she said \"I feel I have to protect myself.\"\n\nSo was Matthew Dougherty, 23, who lives in D.C. but is from Delaware.\n\n\"As a millennial and someone who's involved in public policy, it's terrifying,\" Dougherty said late Tuesday night at a Democratic watch party in Wilmington. He noted that Trump should experience little difficulty passing his agenda because Republicans will control both houses of Congress.\n\n\"If he lives up to what he said, it's going to be catastrophic,\" Dougherty said. \"Coming as a white upper-middle-class male, I'm terrified of what's happening right now.\"\n\nIn heavily Republican Sussex County, the mood was exultation.\n\nTrump supporters see the beginning of the end for a ‘rigged system’ against everyday Americans. Their next president, they believe, is a truth teller speaking to problems that government leaders have long ignored.\n\n“A lot of people laughed at us,” said Preston Parker, of Slaughter Beach, sporting his camo \"Trump Make America Great Again\" hat. \"I think we've got one way to go, and that's up. We need to get the country back together.\"\n\nEven though it was raining Wednesday morning, it was a perfect day for Bob Watts, of Milton.\n\nHe basked in the glow of victory.\n\n“You know how they say anyone can be president?\" he asked while standing outside the town grocery store Wednesday morning.\n\nThat's what happened with Trump.\n\n\"I’m tired but happy,” he said. “I couldn’t believe it. She (Clinton) thought she had won it.”\n\nAfter one of the ugliest, most divisive elections in history, Delawareans and Americans are wondering: Where do we go from here?\n\n“It’s not really a happy day,” said Gail Vincent, of Ellendale, who voted for Trump.\n\n“I feel like the county needs change . . . I think it is going to be difficult. I think there is a lot of bitterness.”\n\nAn emotional roller coaster\n\nAround 9 p.m. Tuesday night, Delaware's Democrats were clinking champagne glasses and chattering excitedly. Their party had easily won the highest offices statewide and held onto majorities in the General Assembly.\n\nBut as the night wore on, and after most Democrats had left the DoubleTree Hotel's ballroom in Wilmington, all eyes turned to the TVs. The cheering and chattering quieted as a shocking reality began to set in — Donald Trump was going to be the next president of the United States.\n\n“I’m going to have a stroke if he wins,” said Lisa Cornelius, a caretaker from the Bear area. “The amount of votes that he’s getting is surprising. For the things that he’s done, it just doesn’t make sense.”\n\nCornelius sat glumly at the edge of the stage behind the nearly vacant ballroom floor, scattered with confetti from the Democrats' celebrations earlier. As she watched the returns coming in on the big screens tuned to CNN, she said she was in shock.\n\nThe mood at the Republican election gathering on Tuesday night at Grotto Pizza in Dover was subdued early on as gubernatorial candidate Colin Bonini, then congressional candidate Hans Reigle gave their concession speeches.\n\nBut each time CNN reported Trump taking a key state in the presidential election, the crowd of about 100 would erupt, with high fives and hugs all around.\n\nAt one point, Bonini said, “this is really happening,” in reference to Trump’s unlikely victories in states that voted Democrat in the 2012 election.\n\nBonini feels Trump's victory vindicated the notion that political and media elites in Washington, D.C., are completely out of touch with everyday Americans. He said it was obvious in how national TV networks covered the vote.\n\n\"You could tell they were all just crestfallen,\" Bonini said of the anchors. \"Hillary Clinton is obviously extraordinarily unpopular, but I think what this proves is that the folks who run the show don't have any idea what America's about. Those guys should visit America sometime — it's a great place.\"\n\nRepublican voter Tony Slater, 37, voted for all the Republicans on his ballot.\n\n\"Thank God,\" the marketing professional said of Trump's victory on Wednesday morning. \"He's rough around the edges but... I truly believe he cares about America. It was falling apart.\"\n\nHillary Clinton conceded the race about 3 a.m., after Trump conclusively secured key swing states, including Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile shock initially crept across the faces of Democrats at the DoubleTree as state presidential tallies were announced, emotions turned philosophical for a few.\n\n“We would survive Donald Trump because we survived [George W. Bush],” said Jesse Heninger, a Democrat from Florida who worked on Lt. Governor candidate Ciro Poppiti’s campaign. “The country is strong, there’s checks and balances for a reason.”\n\nMark Smith, a Clinton supporter from the Newport area, is not a \"Democrat or Republican,\" he said. But with Trump's success, he's now worried how the U.S. will be perceived by people around the world.\n\n“I will hope that he will not be as extreme as he said he was,” said Smith, who works for Delaware public access channel 28. \"It’s like a reality check. Where are we at? What does this mean? How’s the world going to look at us?”\n\nMore than Trump\n\nWhat makes Trump's win particularly terrifying for Democrats — and exciting for Republicans — is the fact that he will have the backing of GOP majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nThat could be the death knell of programs like the Affordable Care Act, also known as \"Obamacare,\" which Democrats consider a great achievement for Obama, but which Republicans loathe.\n\n\"It's almost certain you will see major changes to the ACA ,\" said Wayne Smith, president of the Delaware Health Care Association and former speaker of the Delaware House. \"There's no doubt that a lot of people who enjoy whatever rates they are getting in the marketplace today under the ACA will face a disruption.\"\n\nTrump also could reverse immigration changes Obama started, such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which gives temporary legal status to immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children. It's not clear yet exactly what actions Trump might take on combatting illegal immigration.\n\nNevertheless, Yeni Martinez, a Georgetown resident and U.S. citizen who was born in Guatemala, said fear has been a common emotion among immigrants in the hours following Donald Trump's presidential election win.\n\n\"I'm even scared, and I'm a citizen now,\" she said.\n\nChange under Trump will be even greater because he will likely be able to appoint several Supreme Court justices during his tenure. Since Republicans refused to approve Obama's nominee to the court, Trump automatically gets to appoint one justice and could possibly get several more, said Rod Smolla, dean of the Delaware Law School.\n\nIf several liberal justices die or retire and Trump replaces them with conservatives, it could mean a sea change in the rules surrounding guns, abortion and gay marriage, to name a few issues.\n\nDelaware passed a bill allowing same-sex marriage in 2013, so gay couples here could still be wed if the Court overturned the ruling. But Steve Elkins, president of CAMP Rehoboth, says it would be a huge problem for gay spouses to move to or travel extensively in states where their marriage would not be recognized.\n\n\"It's a wake-up call for all of us,\" Elkins said of Trump's win. \"It's scary, to be honest.\"\n\nSome veterans, on the other hand, welcomed the change that could come from a Trump presidency, hoping he will overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has repeatedly failed former soldiers.\n\n“He will appoint a body to conduct a full investigation into the VA, drain the swamp and do away with those doing a marginal job –– replacing them with people who can get things done for our veterans,” said 72-year-old Vietnam War veteran David Pent. “He’ll get in there for the veterans and make the needed changes.\"\n\nAnd if you're a conservative unhappy about the increasing size and scope of government, the newfound power in the GOP should be thrilling, Arlett argues.\n\n\"We have the White House, we have the Senate, we have the House and we are going to have the Supreme Court,\" he said. \"That hasn’t happened in a very long time and it is exciting to think about what is accomplishable with that.\"\n\nReporters Christina Jedra, Molly Murray and Jerry Smith contributed to this story.\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428, or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.

Kempczinski described it as \"a small format concept with all the DNA of McDonald’s but its own unique personality.\"\n\nIt seems the company plans to lean into the space-based, futurism-of-the-past aesthetic associated with CosMc's character from the late '80s and early '90s. McDonald's has had success with the nostalgia market lately, having rolled out adult Happy Meals last year before reintroducing the Hamburglar in April and Grimace in June with a special birthday meal and a purple shake.\n\nWhen does CosMc's open?\n\nThe initial location in Bolingbrook, a town about 30 miles outside Chicago, will open this month. In an email, McDonald's told USA TODAY that eager fans can expect to see the doors open this week.\n\nMcDonald's plans to open approximately 10 CosMc’s pilot locations by the end of 2024.\n\nCosMc's:McDonald's reveals locations for chain's new spinoff restaurant and menu\n\nCosMc's locations\n\nMcDonald's had not revealed exact locations for the rest of the rollout beyond the inaugural Bolingbrook, Illinois store. According to the announcement, patrons in the Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio metro areas can expect to see more locations popping up in the coming months.\n\nWho is the character CosMc?\n\nAs previously reported by USA TODAY, CosMc hasn't appeared in the McDonald's universe in more than 30 years.\n\nAs previously described, a 1987 commercial called \"The Story of CosMc,\" is available via the YouTube archives and includes Ronald McDonald and Grimace, who come across a strange object that's landed in McDonaldland. Hands and a head clad in a silver suit pop out and CosMc (pronounced Cosmic) appears, saying he \"popped in from outer space on a trade mission.\"\n\nAfter making a series of perhaps undesired trades with the other characters to get his hands on a cheeseburger and some fries, CosMc is summoned back with a giant magnet by Ronald before settling in for a picnic with the others.\n\nA round, googly-eyed orange character, CosMc looks alien-like with two antennae placed on top of his head and a chrome space suit complete with multiple sets of arms sticking out of each side. He can even fly courtesy of his space suit.\n\nMcDonald's has yet to make clear if the mascot itself will return to restaurants as part of the concept launch.\n\nAdult Happy Meals are back:Kerwin Frost Box offers 6 new McNugget Buddies toys at McDonald's\n\nWhat is on the CosMc's menu?\n\nMcDonald's has not announced what will be on the CosMc's menu. However, Chicago-area real estate investor Iman Jalali claims to have captured images of a menu board outside an upcoming CosMc's in Illinois. The photos were shared on social media and obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nAccording to the photos, the drive-thru menu features teas and lemonades, coffees, slushies and frappes and signature fruit drinks called \"Galactic Boosts.\" Drinks like a Turmeric Spiced Latte, Churro Frappe and Sour Cherry Energy Burst are some of the items listed.\n\nFood items included a Spicy Queso Sandwich, a Creamy Avocado Tomatillo Sandwich, Pretzel Bites and Savory Hash Brown Bites. The list appears to also bring back all-day breakfast with classic items like the Egg McMuffin, Bacon McMuffin with Egg and Sausage McMuffin with Egg. Traditional McFlurry flavors also made an appearance.\n\nJalali said the photos were taken in Bolingbrook, a town roughly 30 miles outside of Chicago, where the first CosMc's is set to open. While passing by what was once a Boston Market, he noticed the shiny new four-lane drive-thru complete with digital menus. Interested to see more, Jalali said he approached the location to see a team of actors and cameras filming a commercial, meaning he was only able to snap a few photos from a distance.\n\nJalali was unable to glean any further information and McDonald's did not immediately respond to the request for comment from USA TODAY. It is unclear if all or any of the items on the board are intended to be served upon launch.\n\nReporting contributed by Mike Snider, USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/09/05/mini-mcflurry-mcdonalds-packaging/75084647007/", "title": "McDonald's introduces mini McFlurry, new eco-friendly lids", "text": "Starting next week, McDonald’s is rolling out the Mini McFlurry − a small serving of the chain's sweet treat.\n\nThe fast-food restaurant also announced it's making efforts to be more eco friendly and is stepping up “its commitment to sustainability by phasing out plastic McFlurry cup lids.\n\n\"Both the Mini and Regular McFlurry will now be served in a more environmentally friendly four-flap cup, which will help reduce waste and advance our goal of sourcing 100% of primary guest packaging from renewable, recycled or certified materials by the end of 2025,\" the company said. “Whether classic Oreo is your go-to, you’re more of an M&M’S loyalist, or you love to try our limited-time special flavors… this is one more delicious way to enjoy the McFlurry.”\n\nThe mini treat sweet will be available in to participating restaurants across the U.S for a limited time.\n\nMcDonald's new eco-friendly cups now available internationally\n\nMcDonalds said the eco-friendly cups are already available in some of its international stores in Canada and Indonesia.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\n“Packaging updates like this matter,” the company's' Chief Impact Officer of North America Michael Gonda said. “Not only is this a fun new way for our U.S. fans to enjoy the McFlurry; we're also moving one step closer to fulfilling our packaging and waste commitments.”\n\nWhat are McDonald's limited-time McFlurry flavors?\n\nMcDonald’s limited time McFlurry sensations include the Kit Kat Banana Split McFlurry featuring vanilla soft serve blended ice cream with banana and strawberry clusters and chocolatey, crunchy pieces of Kit Kat wafer bites.\n\nThe McFlurry creation was unveiled months after McDonald's introduced the Grandma McFlurry, a dessert inspired by grandmas everywhere.

The fast-food giant plans to keep it on the menu for awhile.\n\nIn June, McDonald's began offering the limited-time $5 Meal Deal, which comes with a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, a four-piece order of Chicken McNuggets, small fries and a small soft drink.\n\nThe special combo served as a response to customers who remained concerned about the increased cost of fast food. McDonald's had faced some backlash over price increases – including reports that one McDonald's at a Connecticut rest stop was charging $18 for a Big Mac combo meal.\n\nMcDonald's now plans to keep the $5 Meal Deal around longer after sales of the combo have exceeded expectations and approval from lower-income customers – those hit hardest by increased food prices – have helped shift \"sentiment towards the brand around value and affordability,\" McDonald's USA President Joseph Erlinger said Monday during a call about the company's quarterly financial performance, according to a transcript from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nMost of its U.S. restaurants (93%) will have the deal on the menu into August, and the company is working to extend the deal even longer, Erlinger said.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nThat value meal strategy also has been adopted by competitors such as Burger King, Taco Bell and Wendy's.\n\nPancakes aplenty:IHOP is bringing back its all-you-can-eat pancake deal for a limited time: Here's when\n\nMcDonald's sales decline for first time since 2020\n\nThe $5 Meal Deal extension comes as McDonald's reported a decline in sales for the first time in more than three years.\n\nDeal-conscious consumers staying away from the restaurant chain in the April-to-June 2024 period contributed to a 1% decline in global sales, the company reported Monday. It's the first decline in global sales for McDonald's since the fourth quarter of 2020, a year in which the U.S. economy had its sharpest annual drop since 1946.\n\nSales in the U.S. fell 0.7% during the second quarter of 2024, while international sales fell 1.1%, the company said.

The company plans to continue its tests through the end of 2024 before offering it in more markets, he said.\n\n“Our team of chefs from around the world have created a more satiating burger to meet customer demand and to deliver on our ongoing commitment to menu innovation,\" the company said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"We'll be testing this burger in a few markets this year this summer, ensuring that it has universal appeal.”\n\nGood news for McCrispy chicken sandwich fans\n\nMcDonald's is also expanding the availability of its McCrispy chicken sandwich to more markets.

Where can America's flagship go?", "text": "The SS United States, often called America's Flagship, was ordered to leave its Philadelphia berth\n\nThe ship has been moored in Philadelphia for 28 years, until an eviction lawsuit in 2022\n\nThe future of America's last ocean liner is now uncertain, with scant few months to find a new home or get scrapped\n\nA federal court has issued a 53,000-ton eviction notice for a Delaware River ship.\n\nThe hulking and historic SS United States, a thousand-foot-long ocean liner tied for 28 years to Pier 82 behind a South Philly Ikea, will need to find a new home by Sept. 12, a federal judge ruled this month. The ruling follows a yearslong court dispute over the vessel's berth after landlord Penn Warehousing first told the ship to leave the Port of Philadelphia in 2022.\n\nIf the ship can't find a new home, say its stewards, the nonprofit SS United States Conservancy, the historic ship will risk being lost forever.\n\n\"The ruling makes clear this iconic American symbol is in peril,” said conservancy President Susan Gibbs, whose grandfather, William Francis Gibbs, designed the ship.\n\nOften called \"America's flagship,\" the SS United States is a marvel of engineering, the longest and largest ocean liner ever built in America and holder of a transatlantic naval speed record that remains unbroken to this day.\n\nBut the onetime \"speed queen of the seas\" can no longer move under her own steam, making any moves costly and difficult to arrange.\n\nThe ship will have to move nonetheless, or be sold for scrap or scuttled into a reef, after this month's judgment in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n\n“The judge’s decision gives us a very limited window to find a new home for the SS United States and raise the resources necessary to move the ship and keep her safe. We must do both to avoid the tragic fate that countless supporters from around the world have worked for over a decade to prevent,” Susan Gibbs said in a statement.\n\nThe ship is the United States' last remaining historic ocean liner, according to the conservancy. It hosted four U.S. presidents and celebrities from Marilyn Monroe to Walt Disney. The conservancy has for more than a decade tried unsuccessfully to find a permanent moorage for the SS United States as a floating hotel, museum, entertainment complex, or all of the above.\n\nThe Sept. 12 deadline will approach quickly. Here's how we got here and what's next for the SS United States.\n\nFrom the decks of the SS United States:'America's flagship' under threat of eviction in Philly. But its owners have big plans\n\nSS United States' landlord raised the rent in 2021, then told the ship to leave\n\nThe SS United States has long been an unlikely tenant on the Delaware River: Neither the conservancy nor its landlord expected the boat's berth by the Ikea to be permanent.\n\nBut until 2021, the unlikely marriage was much more amicable. That year, the landlord Penn Warehousing hiked the rent by double.\n\nThe SS United States Conservancy declined to pay, arguing first in letters and then in court filings that they’re model tenants who’d dutifully paid the same $850 a day they'd agreed upon more than a decade ago — and that their lease with Penn Warehousing had no provisions for sudden and unilateral rent hikes.\n\nLawyers for operators Penn Warehousing & Distribution argued the historic ship’s owners owed back rent in the full amount, and that the ship caused damage to the pier.\n\nIn the background, according to the text of the court ruling, officials from the Port of Philadelphia had leaned on Penn Warehousing to remove the SS United States, saying the ship had damaged the pier.\n\nThe eviction notice arrived in the same year that the port, run by an independent agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, announced vast plans for an expansion and total overhaul of PhilaPort.\n\nIn their 2022 lawsuit against the ship, Penn Warehousing sought both eviction and hundreds of thousands of dollars in back rent. SS United States sought to stay, and continue to pay the lower rent they'd agreed to in 2011.\n\nNeither got what they wanted.\n\nIn a tightly argued ruling, Judge Anita B. Brody said the ship's conservancy did not have to pay a higher rent they never agreed to, and it owed no back rent. But the ship also was not allowed to stay forever, against Penn's and PhilaPort's wishes.\n\nAnd so, the historic SS United States will now have 90 days to get out.\n\nThe SS United States' future is now in jeopardy\n\nOn June 20, spokespeople for the SS United States Conservancy issued a call to arms to donors and others who care about the future of the last great American ocean liner.\n\n\"Our goal with this campaign is to save this great symbol of American pride and innovation. We have very little time, and we face many challenges, but we draw energy and inspiration from the SS United States' own resilience and enduring ability to bring people together,” Gibbs said in a statement.\n\nFor more than a decade, the conservancy has pursued plans to set up the ship as a floating attraction, much like the Queen Mary, a British ocean liner with an equally troubled financial past, which just reopened to the public as a hotel and museum in California in 2023.\n\nPrevious owners of the ship tried to turn the vessel into a time-share cruise ship, a Hawaiian passenger liner, a floating hotel, a casino, an offshore entertainment complex or a hospital ship.\n\nAll plans for the SS United States so far have fallen through, including those of the conservancy, which has launched fundraiser after fundraiser just to keep the boat moored on the Delaware River.\n\nIn 2023, USA TODAY Network reported from the decks of the ship, as Gibbs laid out her belief that her nonprofit could save the ship by turning its more than 500,000 usable square feet into a floating hotel complex, to be moored in whatever major U.S. city could accept it.\n\n“The vision is a hotel, an event space — with really amazing food and beverage opportunities, as the developers like to call it,” Gibbs told USA TODAY Network. “Like a Mad Men-style lounge. As well as, of course, a museum and innovation center.”\n\nEarlier this year, the conservancy released an optimistic vision board showing the possibilities if the ship were to be taken to New York. But those plans take time, Gibbs stressed. And time is what the SS United States no longer has.\n\n“Our search for a new temporary or permanent location has been ongoing and began well before the litigation, but if a dock cannot be found in the coming weeks, we’ll be forced to commit to reefing or scrapping the vessel,” stated Warren Jones, a member of the conservancy’s board who once rode on the ship as a passenger.\n\nConservancy spokespeople say the ship has faced adversity again and again, and remained above water. The nonprofit has petitioned President Joe Biden and other elected officials to help save the ship — but if the president is interested, he hasn't said so publicly.\n\nLast year, Gibbs outlined the simple case to keep the ship in existence.\n\n“There is no other American ocean liner left,” Gibbs said, while standing atop the ship’s highest deck last year. “She was the greatest ship in her day, and she remains so now. And it's just so important to preserve our history as a nation.”\n\nMatthew Korfhage is business and development reporter in the Delaware region covering all things related to land and money: openings and closings, construction, and the many corporations that call the First State home.

Of these, roughly 19 million have a felony conviction, as reported by the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonpartisan think tank based in Easthampton, Massachusetts.\n\nBlack Americans are incarcerated at a rate about five times higher than whites, while Latinos are 1.3 times more likely than whites to be incarcerated.\n\nTim Thomas, research director at the University of California, Berkeley's Urban Displacement Project, said oversight and screening policies by federally funded housing providers can disproportionately harm Black and brown people.\n\n\"Housing is such an important component to recovery from the mark of a criminal history and getting back on your feet,\" he said.\n\nFudge's directive to the agency builds on HUD's 2016 memo under the Obama administration, which cautioned housing providers that overly broad criminal history-based policies could result in disparate impact.\n\nMany private landlords also refuse to provide housing to people with criminal records.\n\nPeople with criminal records aren't a protected class under the Fair Housing Act of 1968, a landmark law that made it illegal to discriminate against people from renting or buying a home, securing a mortgage or seeking housing assistance. As written, the law protects people from discrimination only on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability and familial status.\n\nThe end result often affects entire families, as women, children, grandparents and siblings can be denied housing if they live with a relative who has a criminal record.\n\n\"I think there's a case to be made for offering those with a record protection under the Fair Housing Act,\" said Peter Hepburn, a professor of sociology at Rutgers University in New Jersey and an analyst with the Eviction Lab at Princeton University.\n\nFudge said criminal records should be considered to the extent that applicants pose a current risk to people or property and these risks need to be weighed against other factors.\n\n\"Criminal histories are used to screen out or evict individuals who pose no actual threat to the health and safety of their neighbors,\" Fudge wrote.\n\nSome experts said landlords need more technical assistance and support to deal with the specific needs of previously incarcerated people.

For developments on the CEO's death investigation, visit USA TODAY's article on the case for Wednesday, Dec. 11.\n\nThe suspect charged with murder in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson will fight extradition to New York as new details about the possible motive were coming to light.\n\nThrough attorney Thomas Dickey, Luigi Mangione, 26, indicated he would contest extradition during a hearing Tuesday at the Blair County Courthouse in Pennsylvania. Mangione was denied bail, which the judge said he could contest as well within 14 days.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's office confirmed to USA TODAY that it would seek a governor’s warrant for Mangione's extradition, and Dickey made it clear Mangione would oppose it.\n\n\"We're going to fight this along the rules and with the constitutional protections that my client has,'' Dickey told reporters, adding that Mangione planned to plead not guilty to the charges.\n\nHandcuffed and wearing an orange jumpsuit, Mangione arrived at the courthouse in a police vehicle and yelled out a statement that appeared to include the phrase \"completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people'' as sheriff's deputies led him away.\n\nAn arrest warrant filed Tuesday in New York City said Mangione faces charges of second-degree murder, two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second-degree, criminal possession of a forged instrument, and criminal possession of a weapon in the third-degree.\n\nThe Ivy League graduate from a well-to-do family was arrested Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a customer at a McDonald's spotted him and alerted the restaurant. Police searched Mangione and found a fake New Jersey driver's license and a \"semi-automatic pistol\" with a silencer, both made by a 3D printer, as well as \"written admissions about the crime,\" according to the warrant.\n\nAt a news conference on Monday, authorities said three hand-written pages found on Mangione revealed a possible motive for the shooting. While police officials did not provide details about the writings, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said they revealed \"ill will toward corporate America.\"\n\nMangione's arrest brought to a close an exhaustive search for the masked gunman who on Wednesday shot and killed Thompson, a 50-year-old father of two, outside a Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan where the executive was set to attend an investor's conference.\n\nMany people made public statements in support of Thompson, his family, and the capture of his killer, but others on social media celebrated the demise of a powerful figure in an industry often criticized for its denials of healthcare coverage.\n\nIn a news conference Monday night, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said, “In America, we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint.\"\n\nPolice report: Shooter planned attack as 'symbolic takedown'\n\nAn internal intelligence report from the New York Police Department said the alleged gunman saw himself as a martyr against \"corporate greed\" and the insurance industry, multiple news outlets reported, including The New York Times and CNN.\n\n“He appeared to view the targeted killing of the company’s highest-ranking representative as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and ‘power games,’ asserting in his note he is the ‘first to face it with such brutal honesty,’” the report said, according to multiple outlets.\n\nThe New York Police Department has not responded to USA TODAY's request for the intelligence report.\n\nThe report is said to detail parts of the three pages of writing police discovered when they searched Mangione after finding him at a McDonald's in Altoona on Monday.\n\nWhite House condemns violence targeting 'corporate greed'\n\nThe White House on Tuesday condemned violence targeting \"corporate greed\" following the arrest of Mangione, and later offered condolences to the Thomson family and his loved ones\n\n\"We condemn violence in the strongest term,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a news briefing. \"Violence to combat any sort of corporate greed is unacceptable.\"\n\nSome on social media have glorified Mangione's alleged actions as a statement against a health care industry they say is corrupt for denying coverage to Americans who can't afford it.\n\nJean-Pierre said the Biden administration is grateful to law enforcement for apprehending the subject.\n\n\"We stand ready to provide further support, if needed,\" she said, declining to comment further on the pending case.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nPhotos show suspect at McDonald's\n\nThe Pennsylvania State Police on Tuesday released surveillance images showing the alleged gunman at the McDonald’s in Altoona where he was arrested Monday morning. The photos show the suspect wearing a brown beanie, a dark-hooded jacket, and a medical mask. In one image, he appears to be eating a hash brown. There's also a photo of Mangione in a holding cell.\n\nOfficials said a customer at the McDonald’s recognized Mangione and notified an employee, who then called local police. Investigators were still working to piece together Mangione’s recent movements.\n\n“Law enforcement continues to seek the public’s help in gathering information on Luigi Mangione’s travel and recent whereabouts in Pennsylvania,” state police wrote in a post on the X platform that included the new surveillance photos. “We ask anyone with information to call 1-800-4PA-TIPS or submit a tip online.”\n\nFriends remember Mangione as 'thoughtful'\n\nMangione's friends from his time in Hawaii in recent years were stunned and saddened when they learned the engaging, caring young man they knew was suspected of cold-blooded murder, according to the Honolulu Civil Beat, a nonprofit news organization that covers the state.\n\n“He was just such a thoughtful and deeply compassionate person at everything he did,” said Jackie Wexler, who went to college at Penn with Mangione and became friends with him at the Surfbreak co-living community in Honolulu where Mangione spent the first six months of 2022, Civil Beat reported.\n\nSurfbreak founder R.J. Martin said Mangione helped organize a book club in the community and went rock climbing with him despite persistent back pain from a misaligned vertebra.\n\nFriends indicated that chronic pain limited the daily life of someone who was otherwise a very active person. Mangione's profile on X shows a background image of an X-ray with what appears to be screws and plates inserted in a lower back.\n\nMartin said Mangione stayed in touch after moving away and even shared photos taken after his back surgery. Consistent with reported comments from others who know Mangione, Martin said his friend cut off contact in the summer. “He went radio silent in June or July,” Martin said.\n\nAn employee at TrueCar told Reuters that Mangione worked at the car-buying website as a data engineer from 2022 to late 2023. In mid-2023, Mangione took about two months off for what the employee's manager described as back-related issues.\n\nThe employee, who asked not to be named, described Mangione as \"incredibly smart\" and very friendly to his co-workers. He said that the company offered employees health insurance through UnitedHealth, as well as other choices, such as Aetna.\n\nMerchandise raises controversy, claims of glorifying violence\n\nFrom T-shirts and hoodies to coffee mugs and shot glasses, merchandise referring to the suspected gunman in the killing of a UnitedHealthcare executive on a Manhattan sidewalk is popping up on the internet.\n\nOnline sellers, looking to cash in on the sympathies that some have expressed for Mangione, have drawn criticism. Online marketplaces generally prohibit the sale of items that glorify violence, but that prohibition does not extend to all Mangione-related merchandise.\n\nAmazon told USA TODAY it has pulled merchandise using the phrase for violating company guidelines. A search now only yields links to the 2010 book “Delay, Defend, Deny: Why Insurance Companies Don’t Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.”\n\nEtsy, an online platform where the \"Deny, Defend, Depose\" ornament is listed for sale, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n— Jessica Guynn\n\nPolice on alert for copycat attacks on executives\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in different parts of the country are on heightened alert that the Thompson killing in New York City has spawned threats or calls to action against corporate executives and their families.\n\nIn Colorado, a law enforcement bulletin warned authorities that the attack may be used as \"messaging and propaganda\" to share ways to target other health care companies, WLS-TV reported. It urged companies to review their security measures to safeguard their executives.\n\nIn Chicago on Monday, a sign that said “Deny Defend Depose” was hung on a bridge spanning the city’s iconic DuSable Lake Shore Drive. Those were the words written on bullet casings found at the scene of Thompson's shooting, authorities said.\n\nChicago police launched an investigation after someone sprayed \"Kill your CEO\" on the walls of multiple North Side businesses over the weekend, local stations reported.\n\n− Medora Lee\n\nWhy Mangione is charged with second-degree murder\n\nWhat is the difference between first and second-degree murder in New York?\n\nUnder New York state law, second-degree murder is a charge of intentional murder, said Anna G. Cominsky, a professor at the New York Law School and director of its criminal defense clinic. “Murder in the first degree is intentional murder with a special circumstance,” Cominsky said.\n\nFor example, a person can be charged with first-degree murder if suspected of intentionally causing the death of a person among a special category that includes law enforcement officers and first responders, a witness to a crime to prevent that person from testifying, and a person killed during one of a group of crimes that includes robbery and sexual charges.\n\n“They’re both class A-1 felonies,” Cominsky said. “Both carry the possibility of a life sentence.”\n\nNew York has no death penalty, so life in prison is the maximum penalty, Cominsky said. While it is possible Mangione could be charged with federal crimes, she said it's unlikely, given the New York County District Attorney's office has jurisdiction in the case.\n\n− Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nUnitedHealthcare CEO killing:Who gets the $60,000 reward and what would need to happen\n\nMan who spotted suspect at McDonald's: 'I just can’t believe it'\n\nA man who saw Mangione in the Altoona McDonald's said he thought it was a joke when his friend said \"Don’t that look like the shooter from New York?\"\n\nLarry, who declined to provide his last name, told multiple news outlets outside the restaurant on Tuesday that he was shocked to find out the man was the suspect police had been trying to locate. “It’s unbelievable,” Larry said, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “I just can’t believe it.”\n\nA frequent patron of that particular McDonald's, Larry said he saw Mangione order food and sit in the back of the restaurant. He did not interact with Mangione and left to go to church. He said he came back when he heard an arrest was made.\n\n\"The group of us thought it was more of a joke and we were kidding about it,\" he said. \"But then as it turned out, it was him.\"\n\nSuspect rejects some allegations in first court appearance\n\nMangione did not enter a plea when he appeared in a Pennsylvania court Monday evening. He did reject several claims made by Pennsylvania prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors said Mangione was found with several thousands of dollars in cash, a portion of it in foreign currency, CNN and The Associated Press reported. The suspected gunman disputed the amount and suggested it may have been planted, according to CNN and Fox News.com.\n\nMangione also denied knowing about sophisticated criminal tactics, CNN reported, particularly the use of a Faraday bag, which blocks electronic devices from electromagnetic signals.\n\nWho is Luigi Mangione?\n\nMangione was the 2016 class valedictorian at the Gilman School, a prestigious private school in Baltimore where tuition can run nearly $40,000 annually. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020 with a combined master's and bachelor's degree in computer engineering and spent a summer at Stanford University working on a pre-collegiate program.\n\nMangione is from a well-known Baltimore family.

He was arraigned and jailed without bail.\n\nAuthorities said they found a 3D-printed handgun and a silencer when they searched Mangione's backpack upon detaining him at the McDonald's.

Mangione was wearing the signature blue surgical mask the shooter was wearing in New York City surveillance footage and seated at the back of the restaurant using a laptop, the Altoona Police Department complaint added.\n\nPolice discovered the identification card Mangione produced — for a Mark Rosario of New Jersey — was fake, at which point he identified himself, according to the criminal complaint. Law enforcement found a black 3D-printed pistol and silencer in Mangione’s backpack, according to charging documents.\n\nFrye, six months on the job, said Mangione \"was very cooperative.\" Mangione is being held without bail in Pennsylvania, according to Pennsylvania court documents.\n\nThe Altoona McDonald’s was the suspected killer’s latest stop in a several-day trek around Pennsylvania that included stop-overs in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, according to state police.

Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said the three-page document included no other targets but expressed \"ill will toward corporate America.\"\n\nMangione had a ghost gun, which can be assembled at home and is difficult to trace, Kenny said. The gun may have been made on a 3D printer and capable of firing a 9mm round, he added.\n\nAuthorities uncovered numerous videos and photos of the person of interest from which they developed a precise timeline for his escape from the shooting scene and flight from the city.

An Ivy League graduate. And now a person of interest in the killing of the United HealthCare CEO that's captured the attention of the nation.\n\nMangione — law enforcement’s person of interest captured in Pennsylvania — has an impressive resume and Ivy League education, with the kind of affluent and influential family ties that can often pave a path to a successful future. But now Mangione, who hasn't been charged in the crime, finds himself at the unlikely center of a murder investigation that has sparked a conversation around health care in the U.S. and how untraceable \"ghost guns\" and silencers can be assembled via a 3-D printer.\n\n\"Even early on the class of 2016 was challenging the world around it,\" says Mangione in his Gilman School valedictorian speech in Baltimore. \"The class of 2016’s inventiveness also stems from its incredible courage to explore the unknown and try new things.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Mangione was personable, witty, and confident. The news of his arrest shocked the leaders of the prestigious schools he attended.\n\n\"Luigi Mangione’s suspected involvement in this case is deeply distressing news on top of an already awful situation,\" Gilman's Head of School Henry Smyth wrote in a statement. \"Here on campus, our focus will remain on caring for and educating our students.\" Read more here.\n\n— Michael Loria and Chris Kenning, USA TODAY\n\nMagione appeared to approve of 'Unabomber' manifesto\n\nAn online post by a reviewer who appeared to be Mangione was highly supportive of a manifesto written by Ted Kaczynski, known as the \"Unabomber\" who killed three people and injured 23 in a series of mail bombings between 1978 and 1995.\n\nThe Goodreads review from January 2024 was written by a user with a profile name \"Luigi (lnmangione)\" and the same photo Mangione used in other social media profiles.\n\n“It’s easy to quickly and thoughtless write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies,'' the reviewer said. \"But it's simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.\"\n\n— Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nWhat is a ‘ghost gun’ and are they legal?\n\nNew York City officials said early information indicated the firearm seized with Mangione was a so-called ‘ghost gun’ that may have been created on a 3D printer.\n\nThe term refers to un-serialized firearms that are manufactured at home with do-it-yourself kits. Critics of the firearms say they are problematic because they are not traceable like traditional firearms with serial numbers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has announced a federal rule to require manufacturers of the kits to perform background checks and mark the weapons with serial numbers – the same requirement of standard gun producers.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court held arguments in October about the regulation, which could be struck down. The ruling would not impact the legality of \"privately made firearms\" by individuals, which are legal for personal use as long as they're not sold or transferred.\n\nThe number of suspected ghost guns recovered by law enforcement and submitted for tracing to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives increased by more than 1,000% between 2017 and 2021. The number more than doubled from 2020 to 2021.\n\nAlumnus Mangione bringing unwanted attention to Penn\n\nOutside Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, reporters gathered and University of Pennsylvania students and West Philadelphia residents rushed by, but no one wanted to talk about Mangione, at least not on the record.\"No comment,\" a young man said brusquely as he walked into the brick twin house, past the red cups and a beer can on the porch. He let the door slam behind him. No one answered the bell.Penn student Paige Nolan said her father, who works near the scene of the shooting in Manhattan, called her when he heard the news. \"He was really curious and wondered who it was,\" Nolan said.\n\nNatasha Yajadda, also a student at the school, said she was surprised someone from an educated, privileged background “would take such violent action.”“It brings attention to the school, and not in a good way,” she said. Neither she nor Nolan, though, thought the alleged actions of one graduate would harm the prestigious university’s reputation.— Phaedra Trethan\n\nInvestigators hail crucial role of public in finding person of interest\n\nTisch, the police commissioner, said the tip from the McDonald's employee in Thompson's slaying is the third recent case in which the public has helped police. A tip also helped with the investigation of a recent triple stabbing in Manhattan and a gunpoint robbery in Queens, during which an NYPD officer was shot. Tisch said the tips \"led to the recovery of crucial evidence.”\n\n\"We should never underestimate the power of the public to be our eyes and ears in these investigations,\" Tisch said.\n\nWhile investigators recovered \"an enormous amount\" of forensic and video evidence in the case, Kenny told reporters Monday the lynchpin came after the release of the photos of the person of interest, which went viral on social media. Hundreds of tips poured in after authorities released the photos and offered $60,000 in reward money for information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nIt's extremely common for the public to help police identify suspects in all kinds of crimes, which is why the relationship between the police and the community is so important, said Joe Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n\"Considering how much money was on the table with the reward money, I mean, the whole country was looking for this guy. He had no friends,\" Giacalone said.\n\nEx-FBI profiler on the investigation: This is not a TV show\n\nFormer FBI profiler Mary Ellen O’Toole told USA TODAY on Monday that she was not surprised at the length of time the investigation took despite the scores of police and FBI agents working the case.\n\n“We expect these cases to be solved overnight, like they do in a TV show. But this is not TV and these cases take more time than that,\" O’Toole said.\n\nO'Toole said fake money from a Monopoly game found in the suspect's backpack had concerned her.\n\n\"He knew the police would find it,\" she said. \"If he thinks this is a game, he may not understand the egregiousness of what he has done. And he may have other targets.\"\n\nPressure on law enforcement to solve crime\n\nChristopher Dennison, an associate professor of sociology and criminology at the University at Buffalo, says the shooting prompted widespread discussion about inequities in the U.S. health care system that likely placed added pressure on authorities to solve the crime. But those pressures aside, time is always of the essence, he said.\n\n\"The chances of finding the offender significantly decrease as we get further away from the incident,\" Dennison said. \"In the end, the last thing anyone wants is for this case to turn into another D.B. Cooper.\"\n\nSuspect was tracked to a bus station\n\nThompson, 50, was shot Wednesday on a Midtown street outside a hotel where he was set to speak at an investment conference. Surveillance cameras show a shooter firing multiple times from behind Thompson at close range at about 6:45 a.m.\n\nPolice, primarily through surveillance cameras around the city, tracked the suspect's movement as he fled on foot before mounting an electric bike and riding into Central Park. He caught a cab around 7 a.m. on the Upper West Side and was seen on video at an uptown bus station about 45 minutes later, NYPD's Kenny said.\n\nThe latest photos of the suspect, released late Saturday, appear to have been taken from a camera in the cab and show him wearing a blue medical mask and a hooded jacket. In one photo, he appears to be looking through the partition from the back seat; in the other photo, he is on the street.\n\nPreviously released photos have provided a relatively clear view of his face.\n\nTo them, slain UnitedHealthcare CEOBrian Thompson was a local farm boy\n\nBrian Thompson's roots go back to rural Iowa\n\nTo the world, Thompson was the leader of a major corporation and a brilliant executive whose death last week ignited a massive manhunt. But residents of Hamilton County, Iowa, knew Thompson as a friend, neighbor and classmate. Thompson, 50, was raised on a farm between the small town of Jewell and the even tinier town of Stanhope and graduated from the communities' shared South Hamilton High School in 1993.\n\nTaylor Hill says he and Thompson grew close in their middle and high school years before Thompson left for college at the University of Iowa. They played golf, basketball and baseball together, trading sports cards and making mix tapes of the hits they listened to while growing up.\n\n\"He was one of the smartest kids, if not the smartest, and I would say the smartest person I've ever known,\" Hill said. \"He was probably smarter than half our teachers. And the thing with our teachers is they knew it, too.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\n− Kyle Werner, Des Moines Register\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/11/luigi-mangione-unitedhealth-ceo-shooting-suspect-updates/76913433007/", "title": "UnitedHealthcare CEO killing: Police say gun linked to Luigi Mangione", "text": "Editor's note: This page is a summary of news on the arrest of Luigi Mangione in connection with the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson for Wednesday, Dec. 11. For developments on the CEO's death investigation, visit USA TODAY's article on the case for Thursday, Dec. 12.\n\nThe investigation into the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson gained steam Wednesday as law enforcement officials said a gun found in the possession of shooting suspect Luigi Mangione and fingerprints from near the scene of the crime closely link him to the attack.\n\nNew York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said investigators matched the gun Mangione had in his backpack when arrested Monday in Pennsylvania to three shell casings discovered where Thompson was shot in midtown Manhattan.\n\nAt a public safety news conference Wednesday, Tisch also said fingerprints matching those of Mangione were found on a water bottle and an energy bar wrapper close to last Wednesday morning's assault. Police have said the gunman stopped at a Starbucks before the attack and used cash to buy a bottle of water and protein bars.\n\nThose items were recovered and analyzed for forensic evidence, officials said.\n\nThe breaks in the case come after Mangione's lawyer, Thomas Dickey, said his client intends to oppose extradition to New York and plead not guilty to all the charges, including a count of second-degree murder filed by prosecutors in Manhattan.\n\n\"We're going to fight this along the rules and with the constitutional protections that my client has,\" Thomas told reporters, later adding: \"I haven't seen any evidence that says that he's the shooter.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News on Wednesday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg expressed confidence Mangione would be extradited and left the door open for more charges.\n\n\"We will get the defendant here and bring him to justice through our court proceeding,\" Bragg told the network, adding: \"As we learn more about motives and other things like that ... there may be additional charges.\"\n\nNotebook describes plans for the killing and rationale, reports say\n\nPolice discovered a spiral notebook they say belongs to Mangione with detailed plans for the killing of Thompson as well as the rationale for the attack, multiple outlets reported, citing police sources.\n\nThe notebook, which was first reported by CNN and confirmed to the New York Times and New York Post, includes a passage in which the author concluded that a bomb \"could kill innocents\" and instead decided on launching an attack \"at the annual parasitic bean-counter convention.\"\n\n\"It’s targeted, precise, and doesn’t risk innocents,\" the notebook says, according to the outlets.\n\nThe notebook included a to-do list and references to the Unabomber, whose manifesto received a glowing review from a Goodreads user appearing to be Mangione.\n\nAfter Mangione's arrest, officials said investigators discovered three handwritten pages that speak to the alleged gunman's motivation. While police officials did not provide details about the writings, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said they revealed \"ill will toward corporate America.\"\n\nA warrant filed in Manhattan says police found \"written admissions about the crime\" when they searched Mangione.\n\nPolice investigating possible back injury, insurance claims\n\nInvestigators said they were looking into a possible back injury Mangione had suffered and whether his insurance claims were denied.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News, Kenny said Mangione may have sustained a back injury on July 4, 2023. In writings found when Mangione was arrested Monday, he mentioned the injury as well as UnitedHealthcare.\n\n\"He was posting an X-ray on his social media. Some of the writings that he had, he was discussing the difficulty of sustaining that injury,\" Kenny told the outlet. \"So we're looking into whether or not the insurance industry either denied a claim from him or didn't help him out to the fullest extent.”\n\nMangione's friends from his time in Hawaii in recent years indicated that chronic pain limited the daily life of someone who was otherwise a very active person, according to the Honolulu Civil Beat, a nonprofit news organization that covers the state. Mangione's profile on X shows a background image of an X-ray with what appears to be screws and plates inserted in a lower back.\n\nR.J. Martin, the founder of a co-living community in Honolulu where Mangione spent the first six months of 2022, said Mangione stayed in touch after moving away and even shared photos taken after his back surgery. Consistent with reported comments from others who know Mangione, Martin said his friend cut off contact in the summer.\n\n“He went radio silent in June or July,” Martin said.\n\nHealth insurance companies facing moment of reckoning\n\nThe backlash against the healthcare industry that has followed Thompson's killing has caught the attention of insurers, who seek to comprehend their customers' outrage and also protect their executives.\n\n\"I think all of us are taking a step back and trying to understand what's happening with patients and their experiences,\" said Caroline Roan, chief sustainability officer at Pfizer PFE.N, calling the homicide \"a tragedy of epic proportions.\"\n\nPolice said they found a manifesto handwritten by Mangione railing against health insurance executives and reportedly saying, \"These parasites had it coming.''\n\nIn light of last week's attack and increased threats, health insurers are taking steps to keep their executives safe, such as removing their photos from company websites and exploring enhanced security measures.\n\nAmazon Pharmacy Chief Medical Officer Vin Gupta said the industry needs to be more responsive to its customers, but emphasized there's no justification for actions like the fatal assault on Thompson.\n\n\"Our health system needs to be better ... There's a lot of things that should cause a lot of outrage,\" Gupta said, adding: \"Last week was horrifically shocking. Are there going to be copycats? That is unacceptable. We need people to speak out that false moral equivalences must not be accepted.''\n\nAdams says suspect will be prosecuted 'to the fullest extent'\n\nAt a public safety news conference Wednesday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams thanked detectives who investigated Thompson's shooting. While he did not mention the suspect by name, Adams said, “We look forward to prosecuting him to the fullest extent of the law.”\n\nMangione’s lawyer has vowed to fight extradition to New York and expects his client to plead not guilty to all charges currently filed against him.\n\nOn Tuesday, Manhattan prosecutors unveiled a warrant in which Mangione was charged with second-degree murder, two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second-degree, criminal possession of a forged instrument and criminal possession of a weapon in the third-degree.\n\nPenn professor regrets praising Mangione\n\nAt Mangione’s alma mater, an assistant professor who appeared to express support online for his vigilante actions now says she regrets it.\n\nJulia Alekseyeva, who teaches English and media studies at the University of Pennsylvania, seemed to be alluding to the accused killer when she touted the “icon we all need and deserve” in an Instagram story this week.\n\nAlekseyeva also appears in a TikTok video next to the caption: “have never been prouder to be a professor at the University of P3nnsylvania.” On the video, she moves her finger to the beat of a song from “Les Miserables’’ about downtrodden soldiers rising up in battle.\n\nMangione, a 2020 graduate of Penn, has been celebrated by some on social media for allegedly attacking the leader of a healthcare insurer, but typically not by instructors of young people.\n\n“These were completely insensitive and inappropriate, and I retract them wholly,’’ Alekseyeva said on the X platform about the postings. “I do not condone violence and I am genuinely regretful of any harm the posts have caused.”\n\n− Zachary Schermele\n\nPeople offer to pay Luigi Mangione's legal bills, lawyer says\n\nPeople have contacted the office of the attorney representing Mangione and offered to bankroll the suspect’s legal bills.\n\nIn an interview on CNN’s “The Source with Kaitlin Collins,” Dickey said he had not seen the emailed offers himself but said “my understanding from my staff is people are doing that.” He told the outlet that people “were exercising their right to free speech and they're saying that's the way they're supporting my client.”\n\nFollowing Thompson’s death, many people on social media glorified the suspect’s alleged actions as a statement against an industry often criticized for its denials of health care coverage.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a Tuesday news briefing, \"Violence to combat any sort of corporate greed is unacceptable.\"\n\nQuestions swirl in Luigi Mangione's Maryland hometown\n\nIn a suburb of Baltimore, Thomas J. Maronick Jr. sat in his law office struggling to understand why the promising scion of a prominent local family sits in jail and has been charged with the murder of a health care CEO.\n\nFor decades, Maronick worked with other members of the Mangione family, which owned local country clubs and the radio station where Maronick hosted a talk show. But he said Tuesday he was in the dark about what could possibly have changed for the young man – and when.\n\n“I want to know the same things that everyone would like to know. How a young man from wealth and privilege who had the world in front of him, how this could possibly have veered astray if these facts are true?” Maronick told USA TODAY, echoing a question that hung heavy in Mangione’s hometown.\n\nGiven the family’s status, Mangione’s arrest sent a shockwave through the community of Towson and surrounding areas near Baltimore. Still, Maronick said, many were still waiting for further puzzle pieces to fall into place as they tried to comprehend the arrest.\n\n“It's a terrible situation and obviously, a terrible tragedy,” Maronick said. “But at the same time, the accused deserves the presumption of innocence. That's the defense attorney in me saying that, of course, but, hopefully that's what happens.”\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg and Chris Kenning\n\nMore:In Luigi Mangione's Maryland hometown, questions swirl about an unlikely murder suspect\n\nLuigi Mangione's mother filed missing person report in San Francisco\n\nMangione's mother filed a missing person report with the San Francisco Police Department last month, trying to find a son she had not heard from since July, according to multiple media reports.\n\nThe missing person report was filed Nov. 18, according to the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner. When asked about the report, Robert Rueca, a spokesperson for the SFPD, did not comment and referred questions to the New York Police Department.\n\nOfficials previously said Mangione lived in San Francisco after college, noting that his last known address was in Hawaii.\n\nIn 2023, he left his work at California-based TrueCar, an auto marketplace site, a company spokesperson told USA TODAY. Mangione's mother mentioned the company in the report as the last place she knew her son had worked, the outlets reported.\n\nPolice on alert for copycats targeting executives\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in different parts of the country are on heightened alert that the Thompson killing in New York City has spawned threats or calls to action against corporate executives and their families.\n\nIn Colorado, a law enforcement bulletin warned authorities that the attack may be used as \"messaging and propaganda\" to share ways to target other health care companies, WLS-TV reported. It urged companies to review their security measures to safeguard their executives.\n\nIn Chicago on Monday, a sign that said “Deny Defend Depose” was hung on a bridge spanning the city’s iconic DuSable Lake Shore Drive. Those were the words written on bullet casings found at the scene of Thompson's shooting, authorities said.\n\nChicago police launched an investigation after someone sprayed \"Kill your CEO\" on the walls of multiple North Side businesses over the weekend, local stations reported.\n\nContributing: Medora Lee, Joey Garrison, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/09/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooter-reward/76867850007/", "title": "Reward in search forUnitedHealthcare CEO's killer: Who gets it?", "text": "Six days after the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a Manhattan street, police announced Monday they had a suspect in custody after a robust campaign asking for the public's help in identifying the shooter.\n\nThe search intensified over the weekend when the FBI joined the New York Police Department in the investigation, adding an additional $50,000 reward to NYPD's $10,000. With information flooding in, the NYPD ultimately said a tip from a McDonald's restaurant employee allowed authorities to identify and locate the suspect, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione.\n\nMangione was arrested on five charges in Pennsylvania Monday, but has yet to be charged in relation to the killing itself, as of Monday evening. Police said Monday that a search found Mangione in possession of fake IDs, a \"ghost\" gun and silencer and clothes and a mask matching the suspected shooter.\n\nMore:People are obsessing over the man charged with murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO. How did we get here?\n\nWith law enforcement agencies lauding the tip given by the McDonald's employee as crucial, questions have arisen as to the offered rewards and who will end up getting them. Here's what would need to happen for the up to $60,000 in rewards to be paid out.\n\nUpdates:Person of interest detained by police in UnitedHealthcare CEO killing\n\nWho is the 'person of interest' arrested in CEO shooting?\n\nMangione, 26 was initially detained as a person of interest Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania on gun charges. Mangione has not been charged with murder or other crimes related to the CEO's killing, as of Monday evening.\n\nNew York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said he was found with a gun, mask and fake identification card \"consistent\" with items believed used by Thompson's killer.\n\nThe man was identified Monday based on a tip after he was recognized by a McDonald’s restaurant employee, Tisch said. The employee told police they saw him around 9:15 a.m. in the restaurant \"acting suspiciously\" and carrying multiple fraudulent IDs, as well as a U.S. passport.\n\nNYPD, FBI offer a combined $60,000 for UnitedHealthcare shooter\n\nThe NYPD initially offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Thompson's shooter. Over the weekend, the FBI added the shooter to the Most Wanted list and publicized an additional $50,000 reward.\n\nHundreds of tips poured in after authorities released multiple photos and offered $60,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nWho would get the reward for turning the killer in?\n\nAt this point, no one is entitled to the award and likely won't be for a while.\n\nWhile law enforcement agencies are asking for the public's assistance in finding the shooter, not just any tip that proves useful will be rewarded with the $60,000. A tip would have to not only lead to the arrest of a suspect, but a conviction as well.\n\nUntil a trial can be held and a perpetrator is convicted in a court of law or at least indicted, no one will be eligible for the reward.\n\nHow are rewards determined and paid?\n\nTo be eligible for a reward through the FBI, you would first have to be nominated by a U.S. investigating agency such as the Department of Defense or the FBI to receive the reward, according to the FBI's website. A person who provided information cannot self-nominate.\n\nAn interagency committee then reviews the nomination and its legal eligibility. If it is determined that the information provided merits a reward, the suggestion is passed on to the Secretary of State, who makes the final decision. In federal cases, the Attorney General must also agree.\n\nThe FBI generally does not announce that a reward has been paid out. The agency does not share information received as part of the investigation, nor does it disclose identity information about individuals who receive payment, though it does submit a confidential report to Congress.\n\nBeing found eligible for or even being approved for a reward does not guarantee the receipt of a specific amount of funds. Reward payment amounts are based on multiple factors, the FBI says, including the value of the information provided, the level of threat mitigated by the information received, the severity of danger or injury to U.S. persons or property presented by the threat, the risk faced by a source and his/her family and the degree of a source’s cooperation.\n\nA payment to a source may be any amount up to the total dollar amount of an advertised reward offer.\n\nAs far as the NYPD, the rewards program is executed through Crime Stoppers, where tips can be anonymously called in at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or online at crimestoppers.nypdonline.org. After submitting information, tipsters receive a unique reference number.\n\nBecause law enforcement agencies do not gather other identifying information about tipsters, those hoping to receive a reward will have to call back or go online to check the status of the investigation using this reference number, according to the NYPD and Crime Stoppers websites. If a reward is being offered and the New York City Police Foundation and/or Crime Stoppers Board of Directors approves one related to their tip, the caller will then be instructed as to how to receive it.\n\nWould McDonald's employee that reported 'person of interest' get the reward?\n\nMangione, the suspect named in the investigation, has not been charged with Thompson's murder, as of Monday evening.\n\nTo receive the FBI reward, the McDonald's worker would first have to be nominated by an involved agency and then be approved through the committee. If the Secretary of State were to agree, they would then determine how much money the information provided by the employee is worth, up to but likely not totaling the $50,000 advertised.\n\nIn both the case of the NYPD and FBI, rewards are only paid after an arrest and importantly, indictment or conviction, depending on the situation and agency.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Nick Penzenstadler, Jonathan Limehouse, N'dea Yancey-Bragg, Jorge L.

He was born to parents Louis and Kathleen Zannino Mangione and grew up in the state.\n\nAs USA TODAY previously reported, his late grandfather, Nicholas Mangione Sr., developed real estate and owned country clubs, nursing homes, and a radio station, while his late grandmother, Mary Mangione, was a philanthropist who served as a trustee for the Baltimore Opera Company, on the county tourism board and with groups such as the American Citizens for Italian Matters. His mother owns a funeral home in the area.\n\nHis cousin, Nino Mangione, is a Republican member of the Maryland House of Delegates. Nino Mangione released a statement on Monday following the arrest.\n\n\"We only know what we have read in the media,\" the statement read. \"Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest. We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.\"\n\nWhere did Mangione go to high school, college?\n\nIn 2016, Mangione graduated as valedictorian from Gilman School in Baltimore, a prestigious private high school where tuition can cost nearly $40,000 annually.\n\nIn 2019, he spent a summer as a counselor for a Stanford University pre-collegiate program.\n\nIn 2020, he graduate cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania with a combined Masters's and Bachelor's degree in computer engineering, according to his LinkedIn.

Conditions, he said, are likely to change unpredictably. The Bureau of Meteorology issued an \"extreme\" fire danger forecast for the north of the state on Friday.\n\n\"That’s why we’re again asking people in high-risk areas to leave ahead of time,\" Andrews said. \"I can’t stress this point enough. The fewer people we have there, the better for everyone.\"\n\nMore than 70,000 people already have fled the most fire-prone areas in the last week, Andrews said.\n\nAustralia fires:How you can help the victims and animals of the Australian bushfires\n\nThe Rural Fire Service in neighboring New South Wales warned residents of several coastal towns that winds were likely to once again drive blazes toward the coast. Summer vacationers have been forced to flee beach towns in recent weeks, sometimes racing to beaches for rescue ahead of the flames.\n\nIn the state of South Australia, the towns of Parndana and Vivonne Bay were evacuated after a second major escalation in the Kangaroo Island bushfire. One day earlier, Morrison had said that \"a third of the island has obviously been decimated,\" but that \"two-thirds of it is open and ready for business.\"\n\nThe Country Fire Service has estimated that up to one-third of the 1,700-square-mile island has been ravaged by flames.\n\nMorrison, under political siege amid complaints he did too little, too late to combat the catastrophe, said Thursday his government will provide $1 million to each of 42 of the most severely bushfire-affected areas in the states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland to help quickly rebuild vital infrastructure \"and strengthen community resilience.\"\n\nAnother $18 million will be set aside to provide additional support to larger council areas that are facing the most significant damage, he said.\n\nThe fires started burning in September, months before the normal December-March fire season. Morrison put the death toll at 27 and said more than 2,000 homes have burned across an area larger than the size of West Virginia.\n\nThe money will help to rebuild roads and infrastructure and employ staff to \"hold events which bring the community together and bring tourists back to town,” Morrison said.\n\nLong term, the National Bushfire Recovery Agency will provide more than $2 billion to aid in reconstruction. In New South Wales, which has seen of the worst blazes, the state government announced $1 billion recovery fund in addition to $231 million already provided to combat and cleanup after the fires.\n\n\"Times like this unite us and bring out the best in people,\" New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.\n\nThe U.S. is sending more than 150 firefighters and wildfire specialists to help Australian firefighters conquer the blazes.\n\n“We’ve utilized their expertise in the past and welcome the opportunity to reciprocate,” U.S. Forest Service Fire Director Shawna Legarza said in a statement.\n\nMore on Australia's wildfires\n\nOver 1 billion animals feared dead in Australian wildfires, experts say\n\nTeen firefighter is among dozens accused of igniting fires that have ravaged Australia\n\nUS escalates travel warning in wake of 'one of the worst' bushfire seasons", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/06/18/weather-forecast-tuesday-heat-wave-storms-snow/74133426007/", "title": "Extreme weather Tuesday will include more scorching heat ... and ...", "text": "Millions of people across the U.S. were under weather advisories on Tuesday as nearly every region of the country faced extreme conditions, from searing heat across the Midwest and Northeast, powerful thunderstorms over the Plains region, heavy rain along the Gulf Coast and below-freezing temperatures throughout the Northwest.\n\nDry conditions and strong winds also stirred up dangerous wildfires in California and New Mexico, forcing the evacuation of thousands.\n\nFrom eastern Iowa to the Atlantic Coast of Maryland and up to northern Maine, heat advisories were set to take effect at noon and remain active through Thursday and Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Much of the Midwest and Northeast, beginning Tuesday afternoon, will be hotter than Florida. Dozens of cities are likely to set new daily heat records over the week, the weather service said.\n\nAll of western New York will face heat index values, or \"feels like\" temperatures, as high as 104 degrees. In parts of Indiana and Michigan, the apparent temperature could fall between 95 to 100 degrees during the week. In Washington D.C., meteorologists anticipate heat index values up to 101 degrees on Tuesday.\n\nThe scorching temperatures will bake several major cities including Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York City.\n\nWhile hot weather is not uncommon this time of year, the magnitude of the heat wave and its early arrival is notable.\n\nThe weather service warned that the duration of the heat and the lack of relief overnight will increase \"the danger of this heat wave beyond what the exact temperature values would suggest.\" Among the main concerns are those without adequate air conditions, especially across the north as residents are not as accustomed to periods of persistent heat.\n\nThe dayslong heat dome, which occurs when persistent high pressure traps heat over an area, is expected to last through at least Friday, the weather service said.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ New York Gov. Kathy Hochul activated the State Emergency Operations Center in anticipation of four days of record heat in the state. Areas north of New York City could reach a “feels like” temperature of more than 100 degrees through Friday, Hochul’s office said in an announcement on Tuesday.\n\nMore:Summer spectacle: Earliest solstice in 228 years coming Thursday\n\nSchool closing early due to heat\n\nThe extreme heat prompted some schools to shutter classroom doors this week, starting summer break early.\n\nSchool officials in Worcester, Massachusetts, around 45 miles west of Boston, canceled classes on Thursday and Friday in response to temperatures forecasted to climb above 90 degrees.\n\nThe cancellation means summer break will start early in the district after students take off Wednesday for Juneteenth, Worcester Public Schools Superintendent Rachel Monárrez wrote in an announcement on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, schools in Rochester, New York, will dismiss students three hours early on three days this week after a heat advisory went into effect for the area on Monday, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported. The schools also canceled after-school activities.\n\nHeat safety tips\n\nHeat is the deadliest form of extreme weather, killing more people on average than floods, tornadoes and hurricanes. Here are some tips on how to safely brave scorching temperatures.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control, the National Weather Service and other agencies recommend that people avoid being outside during the hottest time of the day when there's active heat advisories in effect. For those who don't have that option, experts suggest working in the shade as well as taking frequent breaks and drinking plenty of water.\n\nDuring periods of extreme heat, temperatures inside unpowered vehicles can reach deadly temperatures in minutes. People should never leave children or pets inside cars unattended, especially during a heat wave, the weather service says.\n\nPeople at greatest risk are young children, elderly people, outdoor workers and those who have chronic diseases, mental illness or take certain medications that make it difficult to regulate their body temperatures, the CDC said. Additionally, those who may not have access to reliable AC are at risk, as are others who live in areas called urban heat islands that are warmer due to more pavement and buildings – and less green space.\n\nExperts previously told USA TODAY it's best to check in on those who may be vulnerable with heat.\n\nWildfires in New Mexico and California force evacuations\n\nAmid scorching temperatures, wildfires raged across California and the Southwest.\n\nNew Mexico residents were forced to evacuate their homes on Monday as two wildfires blazed across the southern part of the state.\n\nAuthorities urged people in the village of Ruidoso, around 180 miles south of Albuquerque, to leave their homes immediately as the South Fork and the Salt fires consumed tribal land.\n\n\"Please do not try to gather belongings or protect your home - GO NOW,\" the village posted on X.\n\nThe two fires had burned through a combined 18,800 acres and had not been contained at all as of Tuesday morning, the village said in an update on its website. A complex team would arrive in the afternoon to fight the flames, according to the update.\n\nSeveral shelters were opened at local churches, schools, and other locations in the town.\n\nWindy and dry conditions also stirred up wildfires in California on Monday as evacuation advisories were issued for some areas near Los Angeles.\n\nAuthorities evacuated around 1,200 people from Hungry Valley Park as the Post Fire blazed near Gorman, around 66 miles north of Los Angeles. Almost 1,700 personnel had been deployed to fight the fire, which had consumed more than 15,600 acres by Tuesday morning.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection warned that weather conditions, including strong winds, posed a challenge to firefighters. Power lines, dams, and oil pipelines were at risk of damage.\n\nAs potential tropical system approaches, Texas faces deluge\n\nAs the Northeast grapples with heat, thunderstorms will spread across the central and western Gulf Coast on Tuesday after a tropical storm watch was issued for swaths of Texas and Louisiana, the weather service said.\n\nDownpours are expected to dump 3 inches of rain across much of eastern Texas, with higher totals reaching 15 inches closer to the coast. The rain is associated with a tropical cyclone system forecasters expect to become Tropical Storm Alberto before lashing eastern Texas on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe service issued an advisory for a potential Tropical Cyclone One on Monday, marking the first alert of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nAcross southeast Texas, rainfall rates will be between 1 to 3 inches per hour, with total rainfall amounts averaging 2 to 5 inches, the weather service said. The heaviest rainfall is expected to occur between Tuesday night and Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations,\" the weather service warned. \"Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.\"\n\nThunderstorms to lash the central U.S.\n\nBetween the extreme heat in the Northeast and cool air in the Northwest, the central U.S. faces rounds of strong thunderstorms that could cause flooding and potential tornadoes.\n\nStorms will develop over a corridor from Nebraska to Minnesota and up into Canada through Tuesday morning, according to AccuWeather. Flood watches were active across the Upper Plains, with meteorologists expecting 3 inches of rain throughout the region. The heaviest downpours were expected to arrive in the morning.\n\nBy Tuesday night, potent thunderstorms could develop into parts of Kansas, raising the threat of flash floods as up to 4 inches of rain could fall in parts of the state, according to the weather service. Minneapolis is included in the zone where thunderstorms could unleash hail, high winds and downpours, AccuWeather said, adding that an isolated tornado or two cannot be ruled out.\n\nSnow to fall in the Rockies; sub-freezing temperatures in forecast\n\nAs the Northeast faces some of its hottest temperatures in years, states across the western U.S. were under winter weather advisories.

In Great Falls, Minnesota, an additional inch of wet snow was anticipated.\n\nMeanwhile, parts of Oregon, Nevada and Utah faced below freezing temperatures.\n\nThe weather service office in Reno, Nevada, issued a hard-freeze warning through Wednesday evening as temperatures as low as 27 degrees were forecast. Meanwhile, temperatures were expected to plummet to 30 degrees in communities north of Salt Lake City on Tuesday. In southern Oregon, forecasters said temperatures could fall to 27 degrees.\n\n\"Take steps now to protect tender plants from the cold,\" the weather service said. \"Those that have in-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above- ground pipes to protect them from freezing.\"\n\nNational weather radar\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Anthony Robledo and Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/07/10/thousands-flee-wildfires-burning-us-and-canada/463985001/", "title": "Thousands flee wildfires burning in the US and Canada", "text": "OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) — Wildfires barreled across the baking landscape of the western U.S. and Canada, destroying a smattering of homes, forcing thousands to flee and temporarily trapping children and counselors at a California campground.\n\nHere's a look at the wildfires blackening the West.\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nTwo major wildfires in California have sent nearly 8,000 people fleeing to safety.\n\nAbout 4,000 people evacuated and another 7,400 were told to prepare to leave their homes as fire swept through grassy foothills in the Sierra Nevada, about 60 miles north of Sacramento, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said Sunday.\n\nThe fire burned nearly 8 square miles (20 sq. kilometers), destroyed at least 10 structures and damaged critical infrastructure, leading Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency to provide assistance to local authorities.\n\nFire spokeswoman Mary Ann Aldrich said additional homes were destroyed overnight. An inspection team is trying to determine the extent of the damage.\n\nThe area burning was about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Oroville, where spillways in the nation's tallest dam began crumbling from heavy rains this winter and led to temporary evacuation orders for 200,000 residents downstream.\n\nIn Southern California, at least 3,500 people evacuated as two fires exploded in size at separate ends of Santa Barbara County and a third one threatened homes near a town in San Luis Obispo County.\n\nOne of the fires grew to 12 square miles (31 square kilometers), traversing a mountain range and heading south toward coastal Goleta.\n\nThere was minimal containment and flames shut down State Route 154, which is expected to remain closed for days. At least 20 structures burned, but officials didn't say if they were homes.\n\nSarah Gustafson, who moved from Washington to California seven months ago, was out running errands when she saw the pillar of smoke rising near her home. She rushed to retrieve her six cats and then spent the night at a Red Cross shelter.\n\n\"It was terrifying,\" she told the Los Angeles Times. \"The sky was orange and black, you could see flames up on the ridge.\"\n\nAbout 90 children and 50 counselors were stuck Saturday at the Circle V Ranch and had to take shelter until they could be safely evacuated. Buildings have burned but officials weren't yet sure if they were homes.\n\nCrews were also using an air attack against another blaze about 50 miles north that exploded in size to 37.5 square miles (97 square kilometers). About 200 rural homes east of Santa Maria were evacuated after the fire broke out Saturday and was fed by dry gusts.\n\nSome of the firefighters working to contain that blaze were sent to nearby San Luis Obispo county when a fire broke out Sunday and threatened numerous structures near the town of Santa Margarita. Officials said the fire burned at least 200 acres.\n\nELSEWHERE IN THE WEST\n\nFirefighters have been able to build containment lines around about half the wildfire that forced the evacuation of hundreds of people near Breckenridge, Colorado. The fire has not spread since it broke out Wednesday and was still less than a square mile (about one-third square kilometer) Sunday.\n\nIn rural Arizona, fire officials say three homes were among 10 buildings that were burned. The wildfire there has led to the evacuation of the entire town of Dudleyville, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) southeast of Phoenix.\n\nA wildfire burning in near Summer Lake in south-central Oregon has destroyed a hunting cabin and an outbuilding.\n\nAnd in Nevada, fire officials have ordered evacuations for a wildfire that is near the same area where another blaze has already burned for days.\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nFirefighters were contending with more than 200 wildfires burning in British Columbia that had destroyed dozens of buildings, including several homes and two airport hangars. The three biggest fires, which ranged in size from 5 to 8 square miles (14 to 20 square kilometers), had forced thousands of people to flee.\n\n\"We are just, in many ways, at the beginning of the worst part of the fire season and we watch the weather, we watch the wind, and we pray for rain,\" outgoing Premier Christy Clark told reporters in Kamloops.\n\nRob Schweizer, manager of the Kamloops Fire Centre, said it had been an unprecedented 24 hours.\n\n\"We probably haven't seen this sort of activity that involves so many residences and people in the history of the province of B.C.,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/01/colorado-wildfire-updates-evacuation-residents-limit-driving/74629121007/", "title": "Denver fires force evacuation, residents told to limit driving", "text": "CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS: A previous version of this story misidentified the employer of Mark Techmeyer, a spokesperson for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.Firefighters across Colorado battled intense heat and dangerous conditions on Thursday in a battle to gain control of several blazes that forced hundreds of evacuations, destroying several homes and causing at least one death.\n\nFour major wildfires started burning between Monday and Wednesday and have raged across thousands of acres of dry land, fueled by intense heat and strong wind gusts. The fires were sparked along the foothills of the Front Range, a part of the Rocky Mountains that runs from central Colorado into Wyoming, passing near several major cities including Denver.\n\nTogether, the Alexander Mountain Fire, Stone Canyon Fire, Quarry Fire and Lake Shore Fire have burned over 9,000 acres, and vary widely in size, with the Alexander Mountain Fire and Stone Canyon Fire claiming the vast majority of territory. However, the Quarry Fire and Stone Canyon Fire are burning closer to Denver and the town of Lyons, north of Boulder.\n\nOn Thursday, thousands were under evacuation orders as several wildfires remained near 0% contained. The Denver area was covered in a thick layer of smoke, and temperatures are expected to reach a sweltering 98 degrees Fahrenheit on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“Everybody should be worried right now, there’s a huge fire and it’s difficult to fight,\" said Jefferson County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Mark Techmeyer at a press conference Thursday morning.\n\nThe Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment urged residents in the Front Range corridor to limit their driving, saying exhaust from non-electric cars will negatively affect air quality, which could reach \"unhealthy\" levels from \"ozone and fine particulate matter concentrations.\"\n\nIn California, the Park Fire continued spreading in the northern part of the state and was 18% contained as of Thursday, according to Cal Fire.\n\nFirefighters battle tough terrain\n\nOfficials in Jefferson Country, Colorado, which includes parts of Denver, said Thursday that firefighters are working desperately to control the flames, but that steep terrain is making their jobs harder. Techmeyer said in all his years responding to wildfires in Colorado, the massive Quarry Fire is \"one of the tougher ones\" because of steep gulches that force firefighters to make grueling climbs.\n\n“This fire is not going to be won in the air. Because of the terrain, this will be won on the ground,\" Techmeyer said.\n\nFirefighters managed to prevent the fire from growing Wednesday night, Techmeyer said, and no structures were lost.\n\nFive fighters were injured Wednesday, Techmeyer said, four from heat exhaustion and one who suffered a seizure.\n\nFire-battling resources are thin in and around Denver, officials said Thursday, because everyone is already deployed against the flames. Techmeyer likened the conflict to a tough football game, in which a coach can't rely on a deep bench of backup players.\n\n“Somebody goes down, it’s difficult,\" he told reporters Thursday.\n\nFire could worsen if it jumps major road\n\nIn Jefferson County, emergency responders said their top goal is preventing the Quarry Fire from jumping across Deer Creek Canyon Road, which runs southwest to northeast through parks, ranches and scenic areas west of Denver.\n\nTechmeyer said Thursday morning firefighters are working intensely to prevent the fire from spreading north across the road.\n\n“This fire cannot jump over to the north side,\" Techmeyer said. \"We’ll have a whole other situation on our hands if that happens.\"\n\nPark Fire rages in California\n\nOn Thursday, more than 6,000 firefighters and 40 helicopters were deployed against the Park Fire, which continued to burn over 390,000 acres.\n\nCalifornia also received resources from Utah and Texas to help battle the flames, according to Cal Fire, as dangerous fire weather conditions rapidly escalate in mountain canyons just east of Chico, California.\n\nCal Fire said Thursday a devastating combination of heat, low humidity and dry winds could make the fire worse in coming days.\n\n\"Today will mark the first of several days where fire weather will become increasingly critical,\" Cal Fire said.\n\nOn Thursday, temperatures are expected to reach the 90s and low 100s, according to Cal Fire, and humidity will drop to under 20%.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/18/wildfires-new-mexico-map-ruidoso/74133454007/", "title": "New Mexico wildfires map: Ruidoso residents forced to evacuate", "text": "Two wildfires burned through thousands of acres in New Mexico and residents were ordered to evacuate as the fires developed rapidly.

Again.\n\nIt was May 14, and authorities had given her two hours to throw important belongings in the car and flee Fort McMurray, her hometown. She headed to her brother’s house in Edmonton, about four and a half hours away, as a wildfire edged toward her neighborhood. Again.\n\n\"At least we could take some of our valuables,\" Byrne, 65, told the Free Press days after her return. \"The last time we ran for our lives, really. And we lost everything.\"\n\nThe last time was the Horse River Fire in May and June of 2016, the worst wildfire in Canadian history. That blaze caused $9.9 billion Canadian in damage (about $7.23 billion U.S.) and destroyed more than 2,400 houses and buildings in and around Fort McMurray — including Byrne's home.\n\nLess than eight years later, wildfire was again at Fort McMurray's doorstep.\n\nAbout 2,100 miles away, Detroit resident Toyia Watts spent weeks of last summer enveloped in a murk of Canadian wildfire smoke.\n\n\"It was bad — it was so foggy and smoky in our neighborhood, and I didn't know where it was coming from until the news broke it down,\" she said.\n\n\"I didn't know we could get that quantity of smoke coming into the Detroit area from far up in Canada.\"\n\nWatts, 69, said she has asthma, and the smoky days kept her mostly in her house. She worries about the impact on her community's quality of life if summers like 2023 become more frequent.\n\n\"Especially for people like me with allergies, with asthma; kids playing in the fields, just people who want to walk outside,\" she said. \"It's a big issue.\"\n\nCanada has a wildfire problem — research shows its wildfires are growing in intensity and area burned. Last year, it reached nightmarish proportions — and became America's problem, too.\n\nCanada didn't just break its wildfire records in 2023, it obliterated them. Nearly 58,000 square miles of the nation burned — an area about the size of Illinois — in more than 6,500 wildfires coast-to-coast from April to October, according to revised numbers from the Canadian Forest Service.\n\nThat more than doubled Canada's previous wildfire record and was more than seven times the nation's historical average. The smoke from those fires caused unhealthy air quality in American cities in the Northeast, Midwest and Plains throughout the spring and summer of 2023.\n\nSomething has changed in Alberta, Byrne said.\n\n\"I've been here 44 years,\" she said. \"If we saw a fire on the side of the highway, that was no big deal. We'd always see fires here, but nothing as big as these. We never lived in smoke — last summer it was so smoky here, it was ungodly.\"\n\nWhat caused Canada to burn last summer? Is it going to happen more, making smoke-choked summers the new normal there and in the U.S.? Can anything be done about it? The Free Press, with support from the Pulitzer Center, this spring traveled across Canada, from its Atlantic to its Pacific coasts, venturing into its seemingly endless forests, to try to help answer those questions.\n\nA changed forest collides with a changed climate\n\nCalling Canada’s wildfires in 2023 unprecedented doesn’t capture the magnitude of what happened, said Michael Flannigan, a professor specializing in wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia.\n\n\"Sometimes we have bad fire in the west, sometimes in central Canada and occasionally in eastern Canada. But at times in 2023, the whole country was basically on fire,\" he said.\n\n\"I've been working fires fairly closely since the 1970s. I have never seen a situation like we saw in 2023.\"\n\nThe conditions leading up to 2023's cross-country inferno have been building in Canada for more than a century. Two key factors are involved, Flannigan and other experts say:\n\nHuman-driven climate change has caused temperatures to rise and soil moisture to decrease, and has intensified extreme weather that helps whip up fires.\n\nGenerations of putting out wildfires to protect cities and industries has broken the natural cycles of fire in the forest, leading to much denser tree populations and accumulated dry, dead materials on the forest floor that act as fuel.\n\nCanada's area burned in wildfire has doubled since the 1970s — \"if you include 2023, we can say it's quadrupled,\" Flannigan said. The western U.S. has also quadrupled its area burned in wildfires in that time, for much the same reasons.\n\n\"The increases we are seeing are due almost exclusively to climate change,\" Flannigan said. \"A warmer world means more fire.\"\n\nAnd it means a more frequent public health issue in America. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency compiles an Air Quality Index, measuring the five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide — all of them health hazards, all worsened by or potentially present in wildfire smoke. The higher the index number, the worse the air.\n\nDetroit's worst Air Quality Index daily score in 2022 was 133. The city had nine days last summer that met or exceeded that mark, with a high of 200, one point below the index category of “Very Unhealthy,” according to EPA data.\n\nThe air quality was even worse in Philadelphia and New York. Smoke from Quebec wildfires on June 7, 2023, caused \"Very Unhealthy\" air quality in those two U.S. cities, with Philadelphia's score of 290 just 10 points below \"Hazardous,\" EPA's most severe Air Quality Index category, a condition where the health of anyone who breathes the air is at risk.\n\nThe FAA issued a ground stop for flights at LaGuardia Airport in New York that day due to poor visibility from the thick Canadian wildfire smoke. And researchers reviewing data from 53 hospital emergency departments in New York found asthma-related ER visits increased nearly 44% over those smoky few days around June 7.\n\nCanadian wildfire smoke similarly caused air quality to plummet in other U.S. cities throughout the Northeast and Midwest, south to cities like Nashville and west into the Dakotas.\n\nNew research by the nonprofit World Resources Institute's Global Forest Watch Initiative and the University of Maryland found the 2023 Canadian wildfires released 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide — nearly four times the carbon emissions of the global aviation sector in 2022.\n\nOne of the world's largest forests\n\nTo begin to understand Canada's wildfire threat, first understand the vastness of Canada's forests. With about 1.4 million square miles of forest land, Canada is the third-most forested country in the world, trailing only Russia and Brazil. Canada's forest is 15 times the surface area of all of the Great Lakes combined.\n\n\"I got a lot of calls in the summer when the smoke was everywhere — 'Why aren’t you putting out these fires?' \" Flannigan said.\n\n\"You fight all of your fires in the western United States, and the area burned has quadrupled there. Just because you fight them doesn’t mean you can put them out.\"\n\nCanada's is the largest remaining intact forest on Earth, even larger than the Amazon rainforest.\n\n\"People around the world probably don't really comprehend just the scale of the forested area that we have,\" said Richard Carr, a physical scientist and fire research analyst with the Canadian Forest Service in Edmonton.\n\n\"You can get into the northern parts of the provinces and the territories and there's places where you could drive for several hours without running across a town — just huge expanses of forest with not many people there. So trying to put a fire out in that takes a lot of time to get people and equipment into those areas, if it's even necessary.\"\n\nCanada's predominant forest type is boreal, a cold-hardy ecosystem dominated by cone-bearing evergreen trees: various types of pine, larch, spruce and fir, along with nonconiferous poplar, birch and aspen. The forests tend to grow very densely, the tree canopy allowing little sunlight through to the forest floor. Canada's boreal forest stretches from the Yukon near Alaska east to Newfoundland and Labrador on the Atlantic Coast, more than 1.2 billion acres.\n\nA changing climate increasing temperatures and reducing moisture, and a thickening forest where fires are often combated and put out, have primed conditions for larger, more intense wildfires, Flannigan said.\n\n\"A lightning strike that hits the ground or a tree in the 1950s maybe doesn’t even start a fire,\" he said. \"And today, because things are drier, it starts a fire that grows to 20,000 acres.\"\n\nSome fire experts and scientists have been aware of the problem — and its increasing intensity — for decades.\n\n\"It is clear that a successful record of fire suppression has led to a fuel buildup in the forests of British Columbia. The fuel buildup means that there will be more significant and severe wildfires, and there will be more interface fires (reaching human structures) unless action is taken.\" That was the finding of a blue-ribbon panel's report to the British Columbia government in January 2004, following a record-breaking year of wildfires the previous summer in which about 1,000 square miles of the province burned.\n\nMore than 10 times that area, nearly 11,000 square miles, burned in British Columbia wildfires last summer.\n\nThe report on the 2003 wildfires recommended a much more significant effort be undertaken on fuel reduction in the forests. It mostly went unheeded, said Robert Gray, a co-author of the report and wildland fire ecologist.\n\n\"Certainly, those initial problems we identified have not been addressed,\" he said.\n\nGray runs his own company, RW Gray Consulting based in Chilliwack, British Columbia, that works with groups and local governments on understanding and mitigating their wildfire risks. He's done similar work on the American side of the border.\n\nSince the time of that report on the 2003 wildfires, the forests have piled up even more fire fuels, Gray said. A significant mountain pine beetle epidemic about 10 years ago killed more than 77,000 square miles of forest in British Columbia, he said, leaving dry, dead trees that create an even better recipe for large wildfires.\n\n\"And then over that 20-year period, climate change has really kicked into overdrive,\" he said.\n\nCanada had its warmest summer on record last year, dating to the start of national recordkeeping in 1948, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada, the nation's equivalent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The temperature from May to July 2023 exceeded Canada's previous national temperature records for the two-month period by 0.8 degrees Celsius, about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIncluding May and September, each province and territory in Canada recorded its warmest five months on record, with the exception of its Atlantic region.\n\n\"So we've got the bottom-up problem, the fuels, which has not gotten better; and then we have the top-down side which is the weather and climate,\" Gray said.\n\nQuebec saw nearly 17,400 square miles burned in 2023 wildfires, a record for area burned in the province. A study last year by researchers with the Canadian Forest Service; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Imperial College in London, United Kingdom; the University of Quebec at Montreal; and others found that due to its impact on hotter temperatures, less moisture and more extreme weather, \"climate change made the cumulative severity of Quebec's 2023 fire season to the end of July around 50% more intense, and seasons of this severity at least seven times more likely to occur.\"\n\n\"Peak fire weather like that experienced (in 2023) is at least twice as likely, and the intensity has increased by about 20% due to human-induced climate change,\" the study found.\n\nRecord-setting coastal wildfire: 'That doesn't happen in Nova Scotia'\n\nThe Atlantic coast community of Barrington, Nova Scotia, is dubbed the Lobster Capital of Canada. Many of the city's 6,600 residents have some tie to lobstering; modest house after house has stacks of rectangular lobster traps in the driveway. A daily, steady flow of fishing boats moves into and out of the nearby harbor.\n\nA foggy marine layer descends over the area almost every night, and often multiple times a day. Firefighters here said they've watched that atmospheric moisture from the ocean and nearby lakes snuff out small wildfires without them even needing to deploy their hoses. Barrington - Port La Tour Fire Chief Paul Thomas has worked for the department for more than four decades, since 1980. He couldn't recall a wildfire that took longer than a day to put out.\n\nThen came May 26, 2023 — the start of the largest wildfire in Nova Scotia's recorded history.\n\nWhat happened near Barrington Lake that day isn't fully clear, at least to the public — though local speculation has run rampant. But according to Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources and Renewables, a local man, Dalton Clark Stewart, 22, of Villagedale, Shelburne County, was charged under the province's Forests Act with:\n\nLighting a fire on privately owned land without permission of the owner or occupier.\n\nFailing to take reasonable efforts to prevent the spread of a fire.\n\nLeaving a fire unattended.\n\nStewart has pleaded not guilty and the case is pending in a provincial court. If convicted, he could face a fine of up to $50,000 Canadian and/or up to six months in prison.\n\n\"At the time the fire started, it was very dry, windy and low humidity — just the perfect storm of bad conditions for a fire,\" said Dwayne Hunt, fire service coordinator and director of the emergency management office for the Municipality of Barrington.\n\nA provincial Natural Resources firefighting crew, along with a local department, were on the Barrington Lake fire that afternoon and evening, and seemed to make headway with it, Hunt said.\n\nThe crews stopped their work overnight, a standard practice, and the Natural Resources crew returned the next day — Saturday, May 27, 2023. That's when the fire got away from them, Hunt said.\n\nThe crews told Thomas they expected the wildfire to spread to the Clyde River and the community's main route, Highway 103, by Sunday morning, May 28. It reached both just after midnight that night. Emergency officials evacuated affected homes.\n\nAir temperatures didn't drop, and humidity didn't fall overnight. At midnight, the fire was crowning, spreading through the tops of trees, the most intense type of wildfire, Hunt said.\n\n\"That doesn’t happen in Nova Scotia,\" he said.\n\nSunrise on Sunday brought many more evacuations. The relentless wind kept shifting directions, and the fire zigged and zagged, destroying homes and cottages as it went, doubling back on areas it had earlier passed and spared.\n\n\"This fire just kept growing in every direction,\" Hunt said.\n\nBy that weekend, it was the largest wildfire Thomas had seen in the area in his more than four decades of fighting fires there. It would grow and spread for another week out of control, ultimately burning more than 90 square miles — relatively small by the standards of big wildfires in Quebec, Alberta or British Columbia, but the largest wildfire ever in Nova Scotia.\n\nAt one point, three fire crews extended 16, 100-foot sections of hose into the woods to spray down trees and try to suppress the fire. A Natural Resources helicopter pilot radioed in that the fire was headed in their direction, out of control and fast. The crews were forced to uncouple their hoses, leave them lying on the forest floor, and beat a retreat.\n\n\"Before the fire ever got to a house, it was so thick and so hot, the smoke, you couldn’t fight it,\" Barrington-Port La Tour deputy fire chief Arthur Doane said.\n\n\"There was no way you could stand in front of it, or stand to the side and put water on it. The smoke was so thick and so hot, it was super-heating everything before the actual flames got there. Even if we were there when a house caught fire, we wouldn’t have been able to put it out. The smoke was so thick you couldn’t see your hand in front of your face.\"\n\nBy Monday, May 29, 2023, the wildfire had doubled in size, Hunt said. By nightfall Monday, it had doubled in size again.\n\nResponse was complicated by wildfires popping up in other parts of Nova Scotia, pulling away resources, including one on May 28, 2023, in Halifax that forced the evacuation of thousands and ultimately damaged or destroyed more than 200 homes and other buildings.\n\nFire officials thought they would have to evacuate thousands in Barrington as the fire bore down on the community. Then on Saturday, June 2, 2023, at last nature gave the firefighters a break. A steady rain developed that helped bring the fire under control.\n\n\"Without that rain, we might have lost hundreds of homes,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe fire took another two months to fully extinguish. Over 100 properties were damaged, including some 31 camps, cottages and houses. Twelve primary residences were destroyed, and seven of the homeowners didn't have insurance, Shelburne County senior safety coordinator Shawna Symonds said.\n\n\"We were completely overwhelmed. We were not prepared for something like this,\" she said.\n\nFire victims who lost their homes pick up the charred pieces of their lives\n\nBarry Doane, a resident of nearby Goose Lake, received a call on Saturday, May 27, 2023, from his son, who was frantically packing up and evacuating his cottage on Barrington Lake.\n\n\"He said, 'The fire is coming your way,' \" Barry Doane said. \"I just didn't figure it would.\"\n\nDoane — no known relation to Barrington - Port La Tour deputy fire chief Arthur Doane — began to see helicopters descending on the lake a stone's throw from his house, scooping buckets of water to drop on the incoming fire.\n\nThat afternoon, a first responder came to Doane's door and told him he might have to evacuate \"within a couple of hours,\" Barry Doane recalled.\n\nAbout five minutes later, the first responder was back. \"You need to leave now,\" he said.\n\nBarry Doane grabbed his cat, some cat food, a suitcase full of clothes and not much else. He figured he would be back soon.\n\nOver the week that Barry Doane stayed with a friend, rumors spread of different houses being destroyed. But he heard from a few fire and law enforcement personnel who had passed through the area that his home was intact. Later, he heard it wasn't.\n\nBy the time he was able to return about a week later, he found his home destroyed. Doane had no insurance.\n\n\"I just sat in my truck and cried,\" he said. \"I started raking through stuff and it was useless. It was just so much of a mess.\"\n\nDoane now lives in a modular home, rebuilt over the ashes of his former residence through the assistance of Shelburne County, the province of Nova Scotia and the Red Cross. Traumatic reminders of the fire surround him everywhere — blackened trees, a boat trailer with charred wooden beams and melted taillights.\n\n\"I dream of good things when I go to bed,\" he said. \"But then it's 3 a.m. and thoughts of the fire come back, thinking about what you lost.\n\n\"Just little things play tricks on your mind.\"\n\nDoane is thankful for the community support he has received: clothes, blankets, furniture and more. But he's concerned he may potentially have to take over mortgage or rent-to-own payments on his home after a couple of years' grace from the Red Cross.\n\n\"I'm 72 years old this July,\" he said. \"With all my expenses and everything, where's it going to come from, or where am I going to go? It gives you uncertainty about the future.\"\n\n\"You've got to get out\"\n\nNorma Mcgray, then 88, lived near Clyde River her entire life. On Sunday, May 28, 2023, she went to church that morning, and saw smoke from the Barrington Lake wildfire in the air. By the time she returned from the service, her street was blocked and fire trucks were everywhere.\n\n\"They were knocking on my door, saying, 'You've got to get out,' \" she said. \"They kept yelling at me to get out.\n\n\"You didn't know what to take; you didn't have time to take anything. But I did go back and grab my important papers. They were still yelling at me to get out, so the fire must have been close. They had a sense of urgency in their voice.\"\n\nShe stayed with a friend who had an apartment in Barrington. Still not knowing the fate of her house, Mcgray spent her time volunteering at the local Lions Club where she was a member, feeding fellow displaced residents and helping get donated items to them.\n\n\"I could not just sit around and do nothing,\" she said.\n\nAfter a week, Mcgray learned her trailer, her home since 1975, was destroyed in the blaze. When she finally got to return to the site, everything was gone. \"I was just devastated,\" she said.\n\nMcgray, now 89, lives in a senior apartment in Barrington that opened up within a few weeks of her being displaced. It's the lost memories that affect Mcgray the most — the photo albums full of pictures of her son's graduation, or his time in the military, compiled when digital images weren't around, she said.\n\nShe also lost most of her favorite jewelry, but not all of it. As the emergency officials were yelling for her to evacuate, as she went back in to grab important documents, \"I got halfway across the living room and I thought about the ring that my son had bought me from Europe,\" she said.\n\nShe got the ring, as well as another prized jade ring. But everything else, all of the items collected over a lifetime, are gone. Nothing from her past colors the place where she will probably live out her remaining days. \"I'm not the only one; everybody whose house burned lost the same kinds of things,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm here now. I mean, this is nice, but it's not home. But you're glad to find a place.\"\n\nA city of more than 20,000 flees wildfire\n\nAmong the record-shattering aspects of Canada's 2023 wildfire season was the number of people it displaced. Approximately 232,000 people had to leave their homes across the country — a number greater than the 10 largest wildfire evacuations since 1980 combined.\n\nIn Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, the entire city of more than 20,000 residents was forced to evacuate for three weeks.\n\nThe fire threatening the city had started in mid-July. But when strong winds pushed the fire beyond a line that public safety officials were comfortable with, the community scrambled to evacuate, Mayor Rebecca Alty said.\n\n\"Looking at the weather forecast, the fire subject matter experts made the recommendation that we do a whole-community evacuation on that Wednesday,\" Aug. 16, she said. \"It looked like the fire was going to reach our boundary by about Friday. With only one way in and out of Yellowknife by road, there was also that need of, if the fire is going to threaten the community, we have to move sooner rather than later.\"\n\nThe city was lucky the mass evacuation wasn't even more of a logistical nightmare, Alty said.\n\n\"A week later, I think we would have had even more residents in town because school was just about to begin again, so there were still a lot of people that were on vacation and out of town,\" she said. \"And with the fires being as close as they were, we had poor air quality for a couple of weeks. So some folks had already left town just to get to better air quality.\"\n\nThe majority of residents drove out of town once the evacuation order was issued, and those without their own vehicles were flown out on government-chartered aircraft. Evacuation of the local hospital and nearby senior care facilities were the most challenging, and the Canadian military assisted where needed, Alty said.\n\nFor those without friends and family to drive to, care facilities and hotel rooms were arranged in Alberta, with the closest reception center about 18 hours away. For some, it was more of a financial challenge than others, Alty said.\n\n\"It was a lot like COVID — we were all in the same storm, but different boats,\" she said.\n\n\"Some residents had an 'evac-cation' of three weeks off, a great time to spend with family and friends. For others, it was very difficult financially. Three weeks in a hotel with a family of five, it gets challenging.\"\n\nOne of the largest wildfires in Quebec's record-breaking 2023 occurred near Chibougamau, the largest town in Nord-du-Québec, the largest but least populous of 17 administrative regions of the province. The region has nearly 290,000 square miles of land area, about 55% of the total land area of Quebec, but with only about 0.5% of the province's population.\n\nThe town of about 7,600 residents was forced to evacuate in early June, and residents were away for six days before the all-clear to return was issued.\n\n\"The fire was at around 20 or 25 kilometers from Chibougamau but we had the impact of the smoke,\" Mayor Manon Cyr said. \"SOPFEU (the provincial wildfire fighting agency) was worried that they didn't have any control on the fire and they were unable to guarantee the safety of our population.\"\n\nNormally, nightfall brought more humidity, less wind and less dryness, Cyr said. But that wasn't happening.\n\nLike many remote communities in Canada's vast forests, Chibougamau has only one route in and out, Cyr said. Wildfires nearby are not uncommon.\n\n\"But every time (in the past) it was not like it was last summer — the size of it, the lack of control, they were quite different,\" she said.\n\nA multibillion-dollar problem\n\nThe total cost of the 2023 wildfires across Canada in damage, response and recovery, is still being calculated.\n\n\"It’s into the billions of dollars,\" said Harjit Sajjan, Canada's minister of emergency preparedness.\n\nThe stunning Canadian wildfire season of 2023 didn't cause a seismic shift in Canadian government thinking or action, Sajjan said. Previous years of megafires had already done that: Fort McMurray in 2016; the 1,300 wildfires in British Columbia in 2017 that burned 4,600 square miles of the province, displaced 65,000 British Columbians and cost the province more than $564 million Canadian; the 323-square-mile wildfire in Lytton, British Columbia, in June and July 2021 that led to two deaths, more than 1,000 evacuations, and more than $200 million Canadian in costs.\n\nThe Canadian government launched the Firefighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate program beginning in 2022, providing $256 million over five years to provinces and territories to purchase wildland firefighting equipment and increase capacity to prepare for and prevent fires.\n\nCanada has also invested hundreds of millions of dollars in WildFireSat, a monitoring satellite set to be launched by 2029, that will monitor Canada's wildfires from space and provide real-time data to managers determining what fires need prioritizing, and where.\n\nThe nation's efforts include an expansion of FireSmart, a program providing training and resources for citizens to better prepare their homes and properties to withstand wildfires, such as clearing ignitable materials from near their homes.\n\nBut all of those efforts don't lower summer temperatures, or combat drought, or increase winter snowpack to saturate the ground in spring that keeps coming earlier than ever.\n\nPublic Safety Canada on June 12 issued an updated forecast for the 2024 wildfire season, predicting high wildfire risk to continue over coming months, especially in regions of the country continuing to experience intense drought such as northwestern Alberta, northeastern British Columbia and southern Northwest Territories, as above-normal temperatures are predicted throughout the summer.\n\nThe work will continue on how to better prevent, predict, respond to and recover from wildfires, Sajjan said.\n\n\"If these situations are going to occur — and the scientists are telling us that they will — then we need to be looking at preventing the impacts of those wildfires, especially on people and on property,\" he said.\n\nCanada and the U.S. should prepare to see more fire and smoke going forward, Flannigan said.\n\n\"Not every year is going to be a bad fire year; some years are going to be cooler and wetter as Siberia gets the heat wave, or Europe gets the heat wave, and that's where the problems are,\" he said. \"But our fire activity is going to increase.\"\n\nWildfire is a natural occurrence that can actually improve the health of forests. But unnatural conditions through fire suppression and a warmer, drier climate have caused wildfires burning too large, with shortening gaps between wildfires in the same location, Flannigan said.\n\nAbout 5% of Canada's massive forestland burned in 2023.\n\n\"People say, 'If the fire increases, the forests are going to disappear.' And they are right,\" Flannigan said. \"It may well be that is happening already in certain places where you get repeat fires too close together.\n\n\"We are going to see more fires. And if the forest does disappear, what replaces it? Grasslands? Shrub lands? Grass can burn every year — in fact, grass can burn twice a year.\"\n\nSaid Sajjan, \"The reality is, we are dealing with this. We have to learn and get better at how we live with it.\"\n\nDetroit Free Press reporter Keith Matheny and photographer Eric Seals are the Pulitzer Center's 2024 Richard C. Longworth Media Fellows.

Kate Brown issued an executive order declaring an abnormal market disruption Thursday, which allows the Attorney General and Oregon Department of Justice to investigate businesses where price gouging is reported.\n\n“During a statewide emergency, it is absolutely unacceptable to price gouge Oregonians who have already been hard hit and are facing devastating loss,” Brown said in a statement.\n\n'War zone':Deadly wildfires rage in Western states: At least 23 dead, hundreds of thousands evacuated\n\nOSU-Cascades professor Todd Montgomery said price gouging in hotels is harder to define than it is in other industries.\n\nHe said demand-based pricing systems for many hotel chains allow them to change their prices nearly instantaneously.\n\nEvacuees:Fire evacuees desperate for information, but little to be found\n\nMany chain hotels automate their pricing on a real-time basis, and prices can surge in minutes.\n\n“Price gouging is a hard, hard thing to define because it’s so relative,” Montgomery said. “It’s even harder to prove.”\n\nHotels are limited on their highest prices by \"rack rates,\" the maximum they charge for a room when demand is highest.\n\nGrand Hotel to pay customers for eclipse reservation problems\n\nMontgomery said the \"rack rates\" are often capped by a government or city ordinance, but consumers rarely pay that much for a room as they’re normally heavily discounted.\n\nWith no state fair this year, demand for hotels in the past few weeks was soft; in the days after the wildfires, most hotels have been sold out\n\n“Once again, it becomes is that price gouging or is that just a normal part of business?” Montgomery said.\n\nEvacuations:Oregon wildfires: See full list of evacuation levels, orders county by county\n\nThe hotel industry was one of the hardest hit in Oregon during the pandemic.\n\nIt lost 15,700 of its 25,200 jobs by April, according to the Oregon Employment Department.\n\nWhile hotels in some areas of the state such as Central Oregon and the Oregon Coast have slightly rebounded over the summer, some hotels in Portland have issued notices with the state that they are making some of their layoffs permanent.\n\nRecovery:Brown, Merkley await federal response to request for aid in fighting and recovering from wildfires\n\nA few months ago, some hotels in Salem were closed entirely.\n\nWednesday night, there were few parking spots available at any of those hotels.\n\n“Supply was already at some of its lowest points in years due to COVID,” Montgomery said. “A lot of travel companies are on the financial brink because of COVID.\"\n\nWhile the hotels may make a short-term gain by charging more, the hotels that raise their rates to the maximum during a natural disaster risk long-term losses of goodwill.\n\n\"When you’re on the financial brink already, this is truly a remarkably bad situation that is incredibly complex,\" Montgomery said.\n\nBrown's order allows for businesses found in violation of price gouging to be issued fines, and other actions can be taken by them.\n\nA similar order by Brown on retail businesses in March after the COVID-19 pandemic netted a number of citations and fines.\n\n\"To any who would take advantage of neighbors in need, the Governor's order on price gouging is a reminder that the Oregon Department of Justice will stop them in their tracks,\" Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said in a statement.\n\nPeople who believe they have been forced to pay excessive prices for essential goods and services can report them to the Department of Justice at 877-877-9392 or www.OregonConsumer.gov.\n\nMany of those who were forced to evacuate their homes don't know how long it will be until they can return home.\n\nTucker feels fortunate he was able to get his recreational vehicle from his home and park it at the State Fairgrounds in Salem.\n\n“Our fifth wheel is at the fairgrounds and if we have to stay Friday night, we’ll be camping at the fairgrounds,” Tucker said.\n\nBill Poehler covers Marion County for the Statesman Journal.

Authorities in Oregon say more than 500,000 people statewide have been forced to evacuate because of wildfires - over 10% of the state’s 4.2 million population.\n\n\"Unprecedented weather conditions have created emergency situations near wildfires throughout California, Oregon, Washington and other states,\" the National Fire Information Center warned. \"Almost half of the large fires reported today have evacuation orders in place.\"\n\nAs of Friday, at least 19 deaths have been reported in California, three in Oregon and one in Washington state. In Northern California's Butte County, Sheriff Kory Honea said at least 10 people have died, including seven more added to the death toll Thursday. Dozens are missing and hundreds of homes were feared destroyed by a series of blazes 125 miles northeast of San Francisco called the North Complex fires.\n\nSeveral people have been critically burned and thousands more homes were threatened. At least 20,000 people were under evacuation orders or warnings in Plumas, Yuba and Butte counties.\n\nJohn Sykes, a 50-year resident, fled with his car and some clothes. He watched the town of Berry Creek burn from about a mile away.\n\n“The school is gone, the fire department’s gone, the bar’s gone, the laundromat’s gone, the general store’s gone,” Sykes told the Sacramento Bee. “I’ll never go back. ... I never want to see California again.”\n\nThe fire also threatened Paradise, a town devastated in 2018 by the deadliest inferno in state history, the Camp Fire. More than 80 residents died and almost 20,000 buildings were destroyed in that blaze.\n\nCalifornia ablaze: Striking satellite imagery shows how the fires are unfolding\n\nIn the Sierra National Forest, authorities say it will likely be at least a week, and possibly a month, before the Creek Fire is controlled sufficiently to permit residents to return. The fire has displaced tens of thousands of Californians, and the Red Cross was helping evacuees find hotel rooms because many people prefer them to group shelters during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nFire officials have not yet released detailed maps of the fire damage but say at least 60 homes and 278 commercial-residential structures were destroyed. Rocky Alec, 22, and Kristen Kipp, 21, had to abandon their trailer home near Mammoth.\n\n\"You couldn’t really see anything. There was smoke everywhere. We were in too much smoke to see flames,\" Alec said. “At first we were like it was just another fire. Then it got real.”\n\nIn Southern California, fires burned in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. But severe Santa Ana winds forecast for the area were weaker than predicted.\n\nThe El Dorado Fire, which has burned about 20 square miles in San Bernardino County, was listed as 23% contained Thursday. Almost 1,000 firefighters were \"actively engaged in structure protection and successfully defended multiple structures,\" Cal Fire said.\n\nHomes have been lost, however, and damage-assessment teams were working to confirm the number of homes and businesses and their locations. Fire officials said the blaze was sparked by a pyrotechnic device used during a \"gender reveal\" event Saturday.\n\nWinds may die down, but smoke and fire threat will persist\n\nThe strong, gusty winds over the West weakened Thursday and should continue to do so over the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\n“We’re encouraged that the wind activity appears to be dying down,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said. “The rest of the week looks a little more favorable.”\n\nThat is good news for a state where 14,000 firefighters remain on the line of 29 major wildfires. The last few weeks have been grueling, as has much of a year during which California has already endured six of the 20 largest wildfires in its history, including three of the top four.\n\nSince January, wildfires have burned almost 5,000 square miles in California, easily a record for the state. There have been 12 fatalities, and over 3,900 structures have been destroyed.\n\nAt least seven weeks remain in the prime fire season, and low humidity combined with warmer temperatures forecast in coming days will be enough for elevated fire concerns to remain, according to the Weather Service.\n\nIn addition, a stagnant air mass will likely keep areas of smoke in place across the Northwest, Great Basin, California and other areas across the West dealing with the wildfires, resulting in continued poor air quality, AccuWeather said.\n\nSome more substantial relief may be on the way for the Northwest by early next week as a storm system approaches the coast, potentially bringing some welcome rainfall, according to AccuWeather.\n\n'We could hear the trees exploding': At least 7 dead as wildfires rage across West\n\nOregon and Washington state also have struggled with historic blazes, and wind-driven fires were also burning in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.\n\nLargest amount of uncontained fire\n\nIn Oregon, a series of fires killed three people and forced residents to flee flames, smoke and destruction. Gov. Kate Brown said hundreds of residences have been destroyed. She said emergency responders were \"inundated\" and urged residents not to call 911 to report smoke or ash clouds. Evacuees poured into the state fairgrounds in the capital city of Salem, many bringing their animals.\n\nBrown said more than 900,000 acres have burned across the state in the last several days – nearly double the amount of scorched terrain in a typical year. More than 80,000 people have had to flee their homes, and the count may increase, she said.\n\n“We have never seen this amount of uncontained fire across the state,” Brown said.\n\nThe Oregon Office of Emergency Management said 39 wildfires were burning in the state by Thursday morning, a number that shocked officials.\n\nJonathan Weir defied evacuation orders as flames 30 feet high shot from the trees in Phoenix, a town of 4,000 residents near the California border. His home was destroyed.\n\n“There were flames across the street from me, flames to the right of me, flames to the left of me. I just watched everything burn,” Weir said.\n\n'Looked like a war zone' along Interstate 5\n\nFires were burning in seven Oregon counties, and the Almeda Drive Fire in southern Oregon prompted evacuation orders in much of Medford, a city of about 80,000 residents.\n\nTruck driver Troy Wood said he was driving north on the I-5 and saw a path of destruction as he approached Ashland, a few miles southeast of Medford.\n\n\"It looked like a ... war zone,” Wood said. “You could see burned out gas stations and buildings on fire.”\n\nIn Washington state, Gov. Jay Inslee toured the devastated farm town of Malden, about 35 miles south of Spokane, and said wildfires have charred nearly 937 square miles of terrain.\n\n“We’ve had this trauma all over Washington,” Inslee said, according to KHQ-TV. “But this is the place where the whole heart of the town was torn out.”\n\nInslee placed the blame for the rash of fires squarely on climate change. He promised \"steps to defeat\" the impact of global warming.\n\n\"We are not going to surrender the future of this state to climate change,\" he said. \"We are stronger, smarter and more resilient than that. And I’ll be thinking of these fires and the communities they're impacting when we take our next steps to defeat climate change.\"\n\nBacon reported from Arlington, Va.

After checking the status of his 7:05 a.m. Delta Air Lines flight to New York – which was pushed back nearly three hours – he rebooked another flight at 9:15 a.m.\n\nHe later learned his original flight had been canceled. Ortego was among the thousands of passengers around the world facing delays, cancellations and problems checking in as airports and airlines were caught up in a massive IT outage that grounded U.S. flights early Friday.\n\n“I was already planning to sleep,” said Ortego, who works in health care. “Now I'm just hoping to make it onto a flight.”\n\nInside the airport, there was more chaos than a typical travel day as airlines recovered from the outage. Many screens were blank except for an error message and airport personnel made announcements directing questions about flights to airlines.\n\nAll U.S. airlines issued travel waivers for those affected to easily rebook their plans. Those who opted to cancel can rest easy knowing the Department of Transportation classified the cancellations and delays as controllable, thus airlines are responsible for upholding the commitments they've made to customers when it comes to policies like rebooking or hotel and meal vouchers as the mess gets sorted out.\n\n- Nathan Diller\n\nImpact on the economy\n\nThe outage isn’t expected to have any effect on the broader economy unless it persists for days.\n\n“At this point, the IT outage is more a nuisance than an economic event,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “If it drags on into early next week, the economic damage will begin to mount.”\n\nIf the outage is limited to a day or two, canceled flights can be rebooked and banking transactions can be completed later.\n\n“There is plenty of time for activity to be recovered over the remainder of the month,” says Jonathan Miller, senior U.S. economist at Barclays.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nOutage impacts US public transit websites, ticketing\n\nMajor cities were generally able to keep trains and busses running, but tech issues have been causing problems with ticketing and other tech systems, leading to delays in some cases.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported website and other tech issues, but said trains and buses were running as scheduled.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City reported problems with \"customer information systems\" but said it's buses and trains were unaffected. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it was not affected but urged riders who might be using public transit to any area airports to check with their airlines before traveling for updates.\n\nNew Jersey Transit said some of its ticketing machines may have been impacted but its buses and trains were, for the most part, running on time. Some trains were out of operation Friday due to repairs that had to be made because of the intense heat that blanketed the region all week.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported Friday morning that commuter rail lines were affected, though it noted traffic is typically lighter on Fridays than other days. Delays on some lines were as long as 45 minutes, the Tribune reported. Chicago Transit bus and rail service was not affected but some CTA customers were unable to add value to their payment cards via the app or machines overnight, but the issue has been resolved.\n\nSome transit systems, including Metro Transit in Minneapolis and Cincinnati Metro reported temporary disruptions to websites, trip planners, social media and other applications but no impact to its bus or trains.\n\n- Phaedra Trethan\n\nDespite summer break, schools disrupted by IT issues\n\nThe CrowdStrike outage crashed some computers at colleges Friday and hampered a popular software for enrolling students in K-12 schools for the fall.\n\nThe University of Rochester, a private school in New York, told students to keep rebooting their systems until the problem was fixed. The University of Alabama’s technology office said its campus computers using Microsoft Windows crashed. Rutgers University and the University of Kentucky also reported disruptions.\n\nDespite the summer break, K-12 schools in Maryland and Kansas said they were having problems with PowerSchool, a widely used software for grading and student enrollment. An update posted to the company’s webpage Friday morning said the outage was impacting all its major products, including its enrollment feature.\n\n- Zachary Schermele\n\n911 call centers disrupted\n\nState and local law enforcement agencies across the country reported disruptions to 911 services after the outage hit.\n\nNational reports of 911 outages peaked at more than 100 on Friday just before 3 a.m. according to Downdetector.\n\nAgencies in at least seven states reported temporary outages, including the St. Louis County Sheriff's Office and Faribault Police Department in Minnesota, 911 systems New Hampshire, Fulton County, Indiana, and Middletown, Ohio.\n\nNon-emergency and 911 calls to multiple dispatch centers in Alaska \"were not able to be answered\" for around seven hours overnight, Austin McDaniel, communications director for the Alaska Department of Public Safety, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\n\"Dispatch centers switched to analog phone systems or to partner dispatch centers that were not impacted to continue taking calls,\" he wrote. Systems in the state were back up as of 4:23 a.m. local time.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department was also impacted ‒ 911 call centers could take calls, but had to dispatch officers manually, the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission said in an email to USA TODAY that it was aware of reports of disruptions to 911.\n\n\"We’re closely working with other federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of these service disruptions.”\n\n- Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBiden briefed on global outage as federal agencies assess impacts\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with the cybersecurity firm, as well as with impacted companies and agencies, according to the White House. Biden will receive \"sector-by-sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,\" the White House added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it is working to \"fully assess and address system outages.\"\n\nDHS added it's working alongside the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as well as CrowdStrike, Microsoft and federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to get a grasp on the incident and its impacts.\n\nOver 2K US flights canceled amid outage\n\nSeveral U.S. carriers, including American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, issued ground stops for all their flights early on Friday due to communication problems, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe FAA said operations were no longer impacted as of 10:53 a.m. ET, but it continues to monitor the situation and warned the global IT issue could continue to affect flights this weekend.\n\nThere were more than 2,500 U.S. flights canceled and more than 7,900 delays as of 3:25 p.m. EDT, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nMost airlines were able to resume operations as the morning progressed, but many said they expected disruptions to continue throughout the day.\n\nRead more about the outage's travel impacts\n\nHospitals cancel nonemergency services\n\nHospitals across the U.S. and overseas were impacted by the outage, which forced some to cancel elective surgeries and halt visitations as well as outpatient services.\n\nMass General Brigham in Boston canceled previously scheduled nonurgent surgeries, procedures and medical visits, according to a statement sent to USA TODAY. In the same area, Tufts Medical Center told media outlet WHDH it’s still assessing the outage’s effect on clinical and surgical operations.\n\nIn Texas, Ben Taub Hospital and Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital suspended \"hospital visitation and patient information,\" citing a \"Microsoft Windows failure,\" according to a statement from Harris Health System. Cincinnati Children's Hospital said many of its Microsoft-based computer systems are down because of the outage, which forced the hospital to cancel early morning appointments.\n\n\"We are in touch with the hospital field and the federal government and monitoring the situation closely to better understand its scope and impact,\" said John Riggi, the American Hospital Association's national adviser for cybersecurity and risk.\n\nTwo hospitals in northern German cities canceled elective operations scheduled for Friday but continued to provide patient care and emergency services.\n\nOutages exposes fragility of internet infrastructure\n\nWhile there were reports of companies gradually restoring their services, analysts weighed the potential of what one called the biggest-ever outage in the industry and the broader economy.\n\n\"This is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world’s core Internet infrastructure,\" Ciaran Martin, Professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government and former head of the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre, told Reuters.\n\n\"IT security tools are all designed to ensure that companies can continue to operate in the worst-case scenario of a data breach, so to be the root cause of a global IT outage is an unmitigated disaster,\" said Ajay Unni, CEO of StickmanCyber, one of Australia's largest cybersecurity services companies.\n\n– Reuters\n\nOutages ripple far and wide\n\nFrom the United Kingdom to Singapore, the effects of tech outages were far-reaching on Friday.\n\nBritish broadcaster Sky News went off-air and train companies in the U.K. reported long delays.

By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/04/hurricane-helene-death-toll-aftermath-live-updates/75509868007/", "title": "Hurricane Helene death toll may rise; power outages persist: Updates", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Hurricane Helene's aftermath for Friday, Oct. 4. For the latest news, view our updates file for Saturday, Oct. 5.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. ‒ Rescue crews across western North Carolina searched Friday for scores of missing people following Helene's historic deluge that ravaged the Southeast, killing more than 200 people, swallowing whole towns and leaving thousands without power or drinkable water.\n\nThe storm washed out hundreds of roads and damaged bridges across the southern Appalachians, leaving residents in already isolated communities stranded amid widespread power outages and communication blackouts. Federal, state and local authorities across the region pushed further into the mountain suburbs, including those surrounding Asheville, clearing roads as food, water and other aid was airdropped to residents in need.\n\nCitizen-led volunteer groups in the mountains of western North Carolina have supplemented officials' disaster relief operations, delivering aid to stranded communities on-foot and by helicopter and mule trains.\n\nAt 226 confirmed fatalities as of Friday, Helene is the fourth-deadliest hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. mainland since 1950. The deadliest is Katrina, which killed 1,392 people in 2005, followed by Audrey in 1957 at a death toll of 416. Third on the list is Hurricane Camille in 1969, a Category 5 storm that made landfall along the Mississippi Coast and claimed 256 lives.\n\nThe Asheville Police Department said Friday that 270 of 300 people reported missing have been found alive and well. Police are working on 75 active missing persons cases in the city, with assistance from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHelene's death toll surpassed the milestone of 200 on Thursday, according to a USA TODAY analysis. At least seventy-two fatalities were reported in Buncombe County alone, which encompasses Asheville and many surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nMeanwhile, residents throughout the Southeast were grappling with the storm's immense damage.\n\nDena Banks, 41, lingered near the steps of her home in Barnardsville, North Carolina, and tried to imagine what it might look like to rebuild.\n\n“We lost everything,\" Banks said, standing beside her mud-caked belongings that were scattered across the porch and grassless yard. \"The house has got to be knocked down because it was waist deep.”\n\nFlyovers and satellite images:North Carolina, Florida before and after Hurricane Helene\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ North Carolina officials updated the state's death toll to 115. South Carolina reported 46 deaths. Thirty-three fatalities have been reported in Georgia, 19 in Florida, 11 in Tennessee and 2 in Virginia.\n\n∎ Federal climate records are safe from Helene's aftermath, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Friday. NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, headquartered in Asheville, N.C., has confirmed that all of its staff has been accounted for, and its data holdings – including its paper and film records – are safe.\n\n∎ More than 720,000 homes and businesses across the Southeast remained without power Friday evening, mostly in Georgia and the Carolinas. Outages from Helene peaked at more than 4.5 million reports last week, according to the USA TODAY outage tracker.\n\n∎ Despite the destruction wrought by Helene in parts of Western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is open with limited closures.\n\n∎ Dolly Parton's vast charity has arrived to aid Americans impacted by Hurricane Helene. On Friday, the Sevierville, Tennessee, native announced a partnership with Walmart to assist with relief efforts after the storm. Parton announced a $1 million donation to the Mountain Ways Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to providing immediate assistance to Hurricane Helene flood victims.\n\nYellow jackets, mosquitoes add to the misery\n\nOne overlooked impact of Helene's destruction in Western North Carolina stings more than others - literally.\n\nBecause of the high winds and catastrophic flooding brought by Helene to the region, hundreds of thousands of yellow jackets find themselves in the same predicament as many of western North Carolina's human residents. The insects' homes have been destroyed.\n\nMatt Bertone, an entomologist at North Carolina State University, explained that yellow jackets are social insects that nest in the ground. If they don't have a home, they're going to be agitated and aimlessly flying around.\n\n\"So, basically, if their nest is destroyed, then they have nowhere to go back to,\" Bertone said. \"If they've escaped, if they haven't drowned, they're gonna be out and about, not knowing what to do.\"\n\nIn addition to the yellow jackets, Bertone said there's a good chance for an increase in mosquitoes due to the standing water left in Helene's wake.\n\n\"The water is where they breed, and anytime you have lots of standing water you're gonna have breeding sites for mosquitoes, so there certainly are more puddles and water just in containers and places that have been flooded,\" he said.\n\n– Iris Seaton, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nHelene damage estimates heading north of $30 billion\n\nStaggering estimates of economic losses are emerging amid Helene’s wake across the Southeast.\n\nEarly wind and storm surge losses are estimated between $30.5 billion and $47.5 billion, stated CoreLogic, a California-based provider of financial and consumer analytics.\n\nThat includes wind loss, insured and uninsured storm surge, and inland flood loss for residential and commercial properties across 16 states, the company said Friday. Insured losses are estimated at between $10.5 billion to $17.5 billion.\n\nDamage to homes without flood insurance is to be expected during infrequent intense flood events, said Jon Schneyer, CoreLogic’s director of catastrophe response. Much of Helene’s damage was outside designated special flood hazard areas, so it’s going to be “challenging to realize the full extent of impact to uninsured homeowners.”\n\nIn hard-hit Buncombe County, North Carolina, where there were 140,000 housing units before the storm, only 941 flood insurance policies were active in August, said Swiss Re, a global provider of insurance and reinsurance.\n\nVery little of the flood damage caused by Hurricane Helene in the South will be covered by insurance, said Monica Ningen, CEO of U.S. Property & Casualty Reinsurance at Swiss Re. That will “make the task of rebuilding the communities impacted all the more difficult.”\n\nWhile the number of people and housing units in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina has increased by 10–15% over the past 10 years, Swiss Re said, the number of national flood insurance policies has decreased.\n\n– Dinah Voyles, Pulver, USA TODAY\n\nForecasters eye system in Gulf, also monitoring Kirk and Leslie\n\nForecasters continue to monitor several tropical systems in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn the Gulf, a developing storm promises to bring heavy, potentially flooding rain to Florida starting Sunday and lasting into much of next week. Meteorologists still aren't sure yet if the system will become a named tropical storm, or even potentially a low-end hurricane.\n\nOut in the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Kirk and Tropical Storm Leslie continue to spin far from land.\n\nLarge swells from Kirk could bring life-threatening surf to the East Coast of the U.S. by Sunday, the hurricane center said, also potentially threatening oceanfront homes in North Carolina.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Newport/Morehead City, North Carolina, said \"next week, long period swell from distant Hurricane Kirk could bring a threat for an elevated rip current risk, high surf, and ocean overwash to vulnerable areas and where dune structures have been compromised across oceanside portions of the Outer Banks.\"\n\nAnother system, Tropical Storm Leslie, is expected to reach hurricane strength by Saturday, but is no threat to any land areas as of Friday morning, the hurricane center said.\n\n– Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nBarnardsville residents forge ahead as best they can\n\nStanding on her porch, Tammy Hensley spoke on the phone with an accountant, trying to navigate the tangle of federal aid available to her and her neighbors after Helene tore through the region, bringing devastation to the small, Buncombe County community of Barnardsville.\n\n\"We're making it, but it's hard,\" she said.\n\nHensley, 58, has lived in Barnardsville her entire life, and never had she imagined the water could get so high. Her 1970s one-story brick house was destroyed. Some mobile homes had jumped their foundations. Stray porches splintered across her front yard. She said everything inside was coated in layers of mud.\n\n\"None of these trailers are livable,\" she said. Of the property's 14 trailers, all residents had gotten out safely, but two were still living there, despite the wreckage. There's \"nowhere else to go,\" Hensley said.\n\n'Just trying to survive:'Barnardsville residents look toward rebuilding after Helene\n\n– Sarah Honosky, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nBaby storms into the world as Helene ravages North Carolina\n\nBaby Phoenix made an unforgettable debut. It was 1:51 a.m. Sept. 27 and Helene was starting to tear across western North Carolina as Jewelia Crowe, 28, gave birth to her son.\n\nTen weeks premature, Phoenix weighed just 2 pounds 10 ounces. Crowe told the Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY Network, he cried until he settled into her arms.\n\nJust two minutes later, he was taken away and rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit. Almost immediately, according to Crowe and her fiancé Samuel Dillard, a transformer exploded outside, and a nurse let out what Dillard called \"a God-awful scream.\"\n\n“You could see the whole NICU light up,” he said.\n\nBut Phoenix was safe. The generators inside Asheville’s Mission Hospital had kicked in. The power stayed on, and despite the unfolding disaster and the pressure it put on the hospital and its staff in the days that followed, Phoenix has thrived.\n\nRead the full story here:Baby storms into the world as Helene rips Western North Carolina\n\nHelene's wrath renders most homes in North Carolina town uninhabitable\n\nBeacon Village was built in the 1920s for workers employed by the now-defunct Beacon Blanket Company, once one of the largest blanket manufacturers in the world.\n\nBefore Helene, 77 bungalows still dotted town east of Asheville. After the storm, only 11 are habitable.\n\nOn Thursday, homes and cars were caked with mud as people cleared pathways to their homes to salvage what was left.\n\nDerek Hughes, a longtime resident, said his neighbors used canoes and kayaks to rescue people. In one home, a hole could be seen in the roof where rescuers punched through to save people stuck in the attic. “Water was coming in both directions,” Hughes said. “It hit us like a freight train and then it was gone.”\n\nJoi McPherson, who was clearing mud-covered belongings from her home on Thursday, said the residents were not able to get any evacuation warnings because they didn’t have cell service. By the time they received some warning, it was too late.\n\n“It started at 7 (a.m. Friday) and by 11 we were afraid we were gonna die,” she said.\n\n– Kelly Puente, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\n'Catastrophic damage' hinders utility repairs in NC\n\nParts of western North Carolina ravaged by Helene will need to wait longer for power restoration as the widespread damage has hampered crews working in the mountainous region, officials said.\n\nDuke Energy crews have repaired 1.2 million outages in North Carolina since the storm struck the state late last week, said Bill Norton, a spokesperson for the utility company. As of Thursday, 170,000 homes and businesses in the North Carolina mountain region remain without power, including 78,000 in Buncombe County.\n\nAbout 105,000 customers without power live in areas where Helene inflicted “catastrophic damage,” Norton said, adding that it will take more time to get power restored in communities where grid infrastructure was washed away and roads collapsed.\n\nNorton added that heavy damage to transmission infrastructure is causing restoration delays. A substation that serves the leafy Asheville enclave of Biltmore Village, for example, was almost completely submerged in floodwater. “That substation alone is going to take 3-4 months to repair,” he said. In the meantime, the company brought in a 200,000-pound mobile substation from Garner, North Carolina, to power homes and businesses in the area.\n\n“This has been a storm like we have never seen in our history,\" Norton said.\n\nVice President Harris to travel to North Carolina\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Saturday will travel to North Carolina to areas damaged by Helene and receive an on-the-ground briefing about the recovery efforts.\n\nHarris – who visited Augusta, Georgia, earlier in the week – is expected to provide updates on federal actions being taken to support emergency response and recovery efforts in North Carolina and other southeastern states.\n\nPresident Joe Biden visited North and South Carolina on Wednesday and toured sites impacted by the storm in Florida and Georgia on Thursday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Monday visited the Georgia city of Valdosta.\n\nNorth Carolina and Georgia are both key battleground states in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nHelping Helene survivors:Here's how to donate\n\nNC hospital director describes hectic, heroic work for Helene victims\n\nDr. Matt Riester and his wife were about to head out of town to celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary when Helene's record-setting rains began to wallop Asheville.\n\nFlood waters were raging and Riester's house went dark. The medical director of the emergency department at Asheville's Mission Hospital scrapped his plans and rushed to work, maneuvering past uprooted trees and downed power lines.\n\nWhen he walked into the hospital, it was a hectic sight. Patients poured in through the emergency room entrance, some with make-shift bandages and slings. One person had caution tape wrapped around an injury as a tourniquet. The hospital, which treats 275 patients on a typical day, attended to 600 and many of them were very ill, the doctor said.\n\nFor days, the hospital has remained filled with patients as staff and volunteers work dayslong shifts, taking to mats and air mattresses for a few hours of sleep.\n\n\"A lot of the emergency room staff, nurses, the doctors, respiratory therapists and techs, everybody, we're all in the same boat,\" Riester said. \"We all have families. We all have houses. Many people had damage to their houses and a lot of people who were here when it initially hit, they didn't leave the hospital for days.\n\nMore:Hospital director describes frenzy as Helene victims poured into ER\n\n– Beth Warren and Jacob Biba, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nDayslong search stretches on after 'wall of water' tore a couple apart\n\nFive days after Tropical Storm Helene ravaged Western North Carolina, Anthony Vanoy sat along Buck Creek in rural McDowell County and watched as a search and rescue team combed through a towering pile of debris searching for his friend, Julie le Roux.\n\nBefore the search and rescue team arrived, Vanoy and a friend spent hours searching for le Roux themselves. Found among the debris, Vanoy said, was one of le Roux's paintings – it was of flowers.\n\nOn the morning of Sept. 27, a “wall of water and rocks and tree debris” barreled through a neighbor’s home where le Roux and her fiancé John Norwood were sheltering. The couple was swept downstream, where Norwood was found pinned among debris, nearly a four-minute walk from his home.\n\n“I crawled around screaming, looking for her, and I just couldn’t find her,” Norwood told ABC News earlier this week. As of Wednesday, le Roux still hadn't been found.\n\nVanoy and Norwood are among hundreds of people searching for loved ones in the aftermath of Helene. Earlier in the week, officials said they've received some 600 missing person reports – a number that's since come down as rescue teams push further into isolated communities and communications are restored.\n\nRead the full story here:A 'wall of water' tore a couple apart. Their friend is aiding in the search.\n\n– Jacob Biba, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nInside the race to alert residents ahead of Helene\n\nAs Helene gathered strength in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, officials with the National Weather Service and authorities in western North Carolina tracked the storm's path and intensity.\n\nThe situation looked so dire that by Wednesday, Sept. 26, officials in Buncombe County declared a local state of emergency for low-lying areas. While urgent warnings were posted on the county's Facebook page, no evacuations were ordered. Meanwhile, the nearby National Weather Service office held daily conferences with local officials, warning of the flood danger posed by the storm.\n\nOn Sept. 26, Buncombe County officials held a virtual news conference, warning residents of the forecast of “catastrophic” and “historic” flooding and suggested, for the first time, that residents in flood-prone areas should evacuate. “We cannot stress enough the seriousness of this situation,” County manager Avril Pinder said. “If you live in a flood prone area … you should take action now – right now.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, Sept. 27, as reports of flooding were becoming widespread, Buncombe County issued a mandatory evacuation order that beeped into phones via the Integrated Public Alert & Warning System, or IPAWS, FEMA’s system for local emergencies.\n\nBut at that point, it was too late to get out, said Clay Chaney, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Weather Forecast Office in Greer, South Carolina. “By the time you get a flash flood emergency, it’s way too late to evacuate,” he said. “At that point, your only option is to go to higher ground.”\n\nRead the full story here:Inside the race to alert residents of Helene's wrath\n\n– Rick Jervis, Chris Kenning and Daniel Dassow, USA TODAY\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, USA TODAY; Marcus K.

That total largely fell throughout the day.\n\nGov. Peter Shumlin said he would tour the devastation by helicopter Saturday morning.\n\nGreen Mountain Power alone brought in 900 line workers and tree trimmers from every state in New England, plus New York and Canada, to support restoration efforts, Schnure said. That compares with 100 outside crews who arrived to help after the 1998 ice storm, which primarily struck Chittenden and Grand Isle counties, Schnure added.\n\nBy 5 p.m. Friday, the number of Green Mountain Power customers without electricity had fallen to just above 10,000. During the course of the storm, which began Tuesday, about 112,000 customers lost power because of the heavy, wet snow that toppled trees, branches and power lines.\n\nOther utilities Friday evening reported a total of about 10,000 outages.\n\nWith the ice storm and with 2011's Irene, the broader level of devastation was greater: Communities were cut off, blackouts lasted a week, roads crumbled amid widespread flooding, and homes and bridges collapsed into raging rivers. But those storms struck a narrower geographic band, Schnure said.\n\nFrom a standpoint purely of utility-related damage, she added, this week's snowstorm has proved worse.\n\n\"This is probably the longest continual damage we've ever seen,\" she said. \"This is all over the state, and it's continuing.\"\n\nAs temperatures hovered around freezing, trees were weary under the weight of cement-like snow. Branches are snapping and falling onto power lines, creating new outages as crews work to make repairs. Some workers have made fixes in the same spots multiple times, Schnure said.\n\nThe next problem will be as snow melts, and newly unburdened branches snap back.\n\n\"Irene did devastating damage, but we knew what we needed to do, and we fixed it,\" Schnure said. This time around, \"we don't even know when the outages are going to stop occurring.\"\n\nElsewhere, Washington Electric Co-op says customers have been hit hard by the storm because of the remoteness and high elevation of areas the company serves.\n\nThe most outages Friday evening were reported in Chittenden County, followed by Rutland and Washington counties.\n\nView Hyperlapse video of road conditions Friday traveling along Monkton-Bristol Road southbound between Meader Hill and the intersection with Hardscrabble Road.\n\nEARLIER COVERAGE\n\nFRIDAY STATEMENT FROM GREEN MOUNTAIN POWER\n\nColchester – \"I've never seen anything like this.\" That's what GMP lineworkers are reporting from the frontlines of the winter storm, which began Tuesday night and continues to ravage nearly every corner of Vermont. Wet, heavy snow clings to branches and power lines, and with each passing hour and day the likelihood of a tree breaking and a resulting outage increases. As quickly as crews can make repairs, new outages continue to occur. Until temperatures increase and the sun shines to help melt the snow, this pattern will continue.\n\nChet Farrell, a long time chief lineworker at GMP said, \"In my 23 years as a lineworker, I can't remember such a tough snowstorm! We've got wires down everywhere and after several days of snow, trees are still coming down. But it is really great getting to be restoring power to our customers – I find that very satisfying.\"\n\nGMP reports significant progress with more than 800 lineworkers and tree trimmers supported by hundred of GMP staff working around the clock to make repairs. The company reports that this is the worst storm it has encountered in recent history for outages, surpassing the ice storm of 1998 and 2011's Tropical Storm Irene. GMP has taken unprecedented steps to speed repairs, mobilizing more crews than ever before from all over the region and even calling in recent retirees to help manage crews and assist in the call center.\n\n\"As we enter the fourth day of this incredible storm we want Vermonters to know that we are doing everything we can to get repairs done quickly and safely,\" said Dorothy Schnure, GMP's spokesperson. \"We know that this has been a very difficult time for those impacted. Some customers have been without power since Tuesday evening. The damage is extensive and widespread.\"\n\nGMP has had a total of 112,000 outages as a result of the storm. It has restored 98,000 and has 14,000 still without power at this time.\n\nRoger Hill, meteorologist of Weathering Heights Consulting and Radio Vermont said, \"This is the wettest snowfall I have ever experienced since coming to Vermont in 1986. Normal nor'easters are typically powdery snow with a 20 to 1 snow to water ratio. Below 10 to 1 it starts to collect on lines and this storm is 5 to 1. I have never seen that combination in Vermont. There are 2 cubic inches landing on branches and power lines. This is more like an ice storm than a snow storm.\"\n\nGreen Mountain Power offered the following additional important safety tips:\n\n· Never operate portable generators inside the home, garage or other enclosed buildings as they require adequate ventilation to prevent the buildup of carbon monoxide(CO).\n\n· If you encounter a downed line, always stay clear of the line and report it to GMP right away. Emergency personnel should also be contacted.\n\n· Shelters have been opened up in some of the hardest hit areas. To locate the shelter nearest you, call 211.\n\n· Check in on neighbors as the storm enters its third day to ensure their safety and warmth.\n\nAs the storm restoration progresses, GMP will keep customers updated through Facebook, Twitter and media announcements. The multi-day nature of this storm is making restoration predictions particularly challenging especially while we are still experiencing more outages from downed trees.

What to know about airline refunds, policies\n\nDoug Witten, an assistant professor of computer science at Wayne State University, warned that the incidents were an example of just how vulnerable and interconnected our digital systems are and why threat protections from criminals, terrorists and foreign nations are so vital.\n\nWitten, who was stuck in traffic Friday on the Blue Water Bridge to Canada, said the chaos was just a sample of what could happen if intentional harm were deliberately inflicted on the nation's — or the world's — cyber systems.\n\nA report last year from the Government Accountability Office reinforced Witten's observation, noting that federal systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks, adding that \"protecting cyber critical infrastructure,\" such as the power grid, is essential.\n\n\"What I'm scared about, as a cybersecurity professional, is what could happen,\" Witten told the Free Press by phone. \"If this were an attack, we wouldn't be recovering from it.\"\n\nA senior Biden administration official said Friday the White House had been convening agencies to assess impacts to the federal government’s operations and entities around the country and was ready to provide assistance as needed.\n\nWebsite problems to grounded planes\n\nFor some businesses, such as DTE Energy, one of the nation's largest utilities, the disruption only interfered with its website and mobile application functions for a few overnight hours, which might have made the problem seem worse than it actually was, but, the company said, was quickly resolved.\n\nOther companies, such as major airlines, faced potential disaster.\n\nThe update that triggered the fiasco was to a product connected to Austin-based cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, Reuters news reported. The cybersecurity firm said it was aware of the problem, which also appeared to interfere with Microsoft’s Windows Operating System, but, Microsoft had said, had been corrected.\n\nThe chaos was so widespread because the software is used by many of the nation's biggest businesses. CrowdStrike, in a promotional video, has said it is used by over half of \"Fortune 500\" companies, the largest U.S. businesses ranked by revenue by Fortune magazine, according to a USA Today report.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, who the White House said it was in contact with throughout the outage, took to social media early to assure the public the problem was caused by a glitch, a failed update, and not something more sinister.\n\n\"This is not a security incident or cyberattack,\" Kurtz said in a statement released at 5:45 a.m. on X. He referred customers to the company's tech support for the latest updates. \"The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\"\n\nKurtz added that the company is \"working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted,\" and recommend \"organizations ensure they’re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels.\"\n\nDTW is a 'madhouse'\n\nPeople at Detroit Metro described the airport as tense and chaotic, initially, but by early afternoon, the atmosphere was more calm and orderly.\n\nPam Schlaff, of Clinton Township, who was set to fly to Honolulu and join the Norwegian Cruise Line, a group trip booked five months in advance, waited outside the Edward H. McNamara Terminal at Detroit Metropolitan Airport Friday, as her Delta Air Lines flight was delayed three times.\n\n\"It's irritating, and it's stressful,\" she said. \"We were looking forward to having a great time.\"\n\nAnother couple in her group was moved to a flight departing Detroit on Saturday.\n\nThe flight delays also disrupted their hotel check-in in Hawaii, and the group is facing refund challenges.\n\nOne TV journalist called the airport \"a madhouse\" early Friday with computer check-in terminals down, and Delta — one of the three major airlines, the others were American and United, with grounded flights — at \"a complete standstill\" with just one line open for passengers to check bags.\n\nFederal Aviation Administration said the agency was \"closely monitoring\" the issue, and several airlines requested help. InsureMyTrip, a Rhode Island company that compares insurance rates, said it expected a surge in travel insurance claims nationwide, urging policyholders to file right away.\n\nBy about 1:30 p.m., McNamara Terminal was more orderly with anxious passengers waiting in seats or at baggage claims. Evans Terminal was busier, with travelers still waiting for flights: some standing in crowded lines; others sitting in seats and on the floor.\n\nDetroit Metro airport spokesman Randy Wimbley, who said he was inundated with inquiries, told the Free Press \"some of the airlines\" were affected, but operations are \"returning to normal,\" adding \"only the airlines can say when the issue will be completely resolved.\"\n\nCustomers, he said, \"should check their flight status with their airline before heading to the airport.\"\n\nThe Airport Authority, which oversees Detroit Metro, Wimbley added \"doesn’t have a tool to track the number of cancellations and delays.\" and the \"flight status is fed to our displays in our terminals, but not aggregated anywhere.\"\n\nFlightAware, a database that tracks flight information, noted that tens of thousands of flights were delayed worldwide, with many canceled nationwide. Throughout the morning, the number of delays continued to tick upward globally, and at about 11 a.m., at Detroit Metro it showed 59 delays, and 26 cancellations.\n\nDelta, which uses Detroit as a connecting hub, said by about 8 a.m. it had resumed some departures, although, additional delays and cancellations were expected. The airline added it issued a travel waiver for all customers who have booked flights departing Friday.\n\nAnd American Airlines issued an apology.\n\nGlitch slows bridge, tunnel traffic\n\nOn the Ambassador Bridge, between Detroit and Windsor, traffic was moving, but barely, as a result of the outage. Just before 9 a.m., vehicles appeared to be going about 10 mph into the U.S. and moving a little faster — about 25 mph — into Canada, based on what a Free Press reporter could determine.\n\nTraffic also slowed — more for people entering the United States than leaving — in the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel.\n\nFinancial services, trades disrupted\n\nOn a large financial services scale, global companies from Australia to India and Germany warned of disruptions, including market trades that failed to go through, news outlets reported.\n\nComerica Bank — which is now headquartered in Dallas, but had, at one time, been based in Detroit — told the Free Press that its systems \"were impacted by the event,\" but the financial institution's \"recovery actions overnight mitigated the impact to our customers,\" and that by morning \"all critical systems are healthy.\"\n\nPNC Bank, based in Pittsburgh, sent a statement to the Free Press on Friday morning indicating it was unaware of \"any direct impact\" from the software problem. PNC said it was still assessing \"impacts to third and fourth parties,\" and \"working to support our customers who may be experiencing issues.\"\n\nSome Chase customers said the bank's systems were down with no estimate for when they'd be operational.\n\nMSU Federal Credit Union said its systems were \"up and running,\" according to a statement from April Clobes, the credit union’s president and CEO. \"A few isolated desktops were affected, but there was no major impact on our members.\"\n\nHospitals scramble to fix systems\n\nThe software glitch also caused disruptions at Corewell Health, Michigan’s largest health system, which includes 21 hospitals across much of the Lower Peninsula, along with the insurance provider Priority Health. Some procedures and appointments could be delayed for patients.\n\n\"Many of our computers and systems are affected by the current global technology issue,\" said Corewell, which was created when the Beaumont Health and Spectrum Health systems combined in 2022. Corewell offered assurance that \"our teams are assessing the situation and working together to care for our patients\" and \"our hospitals and emergency rooms are open.”\n\nBy 3:30 p.m. Friday, Corewell said some computers and systems disruptions remained, but that it had \"many solutions in place that allow us to continue to care for our patients.\"\n\nThe University of Michigan Health system — which includes the Ann Arbor-based University of Michigan Medical Center campus, along with U-M Health Sparrow in mid-Michigan — also reported tech disruptions, spokeswoman Mary Masson said.\n\nShe released a statement Friday morning that attributed tech issues to the software glitch, adding \"there may be delays in trying to connect with our services,\" but added \"operations are continuing, and we are not canceling procedures or appointments at this time.\"\n\nDetroit-based Henry Ford Health also acknowledgedproblems connected to the CrowdStrike update: \"Like so many, we are experiencing some disruptions due to a global technology outage. Our team continues to work diligently to restore all of our systems. We are able to continue to care for our patients.\"\n\nBy 5 p.m. Friday, Henry Ford said most of its systems had been restored, but \"patients may experience some delays as our partners work to restore their own systems.\"\n\nTrinity Health spokesperson Bobby Maldonado said the Livonia-based organization “was made aware of issues with some workstations and applications with Windows-based devices running CrowdStrike” early Friday morning. “As soon as the issue was identified, updates were halted and standard protocols to restore service and communicate with colleagues were implemented. We expect a quick resolution to any issues across our health care system.”\n\nThe Free Press asked for details from Corewell, U-M Health, Henry Ford Health and Trinity Health about which parts of hospital operations were affected, which procedures and appointments were likely to be delayed and how long it might be before the disruption is resolved, but didn't get detailed responses.\n\nA spokesperson for the Detroit Medical Center, a for-profit eight-hospital health system based in Detroit, told the Free Press its practices were unaffected.\n\nGovernments services affected\n\nEven various municipal, state and educational services were affected.\n\nRoyal Oak said the city's computers, which use Microsoft, went into repair mode, showing the blue screen. The Detroit suburb's phone lines were down until the afternoon, although emergency 911 was still operating, and many city employees, the city said, were unable to access their city email accounts.\n\nState departments and agencies also were affected, with the Michigan Department of Technology, Management & Budget — formerly Michigan Department of Management and Budget — announcing Friday its systems were down, but it was working to bring them back online.\n\nAnd the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency confirmed its phone and online chat services were not working, although its online system, the Michigan Web Account Manager, was still operational. Technicians, the agency said, were attempting to resolve the issue, but there was no timeline for a resolution.\n\nStill, if there were an upside, the tech disruption did give students at Henry Ford College in Dearborn a three-day weekend, as the school announced on its website it would be closed Friday. All of the classes on its campuses and even remote classes were cancelled.\n\nFree Press staff writers Susan Tompor, Liam Rappleye and Adrienne Roberts contributed.\n\nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/09/07/oregon-wildfires-pge-shuts-off-electricity-5-000-near-mount-hood/5742842002/", "title": "Oregon wildfires: Widespread power outages across Willamette Valley", "text": "Power outages were reported across the Willamette Valley Monday evening, from the Portland metro area where winds gusts were recorded around 47 mph at Portland International Airport to the Santiam Canyon\n\nPortland General Electric announced they were working to restore service to about 49,000 customers due to high winds causing downed wires.\n\nSimilarly, Pacific Power said about 45,000 customers were without power in 146 outages across the state by 8 p.m.\n\nMETCOM dispatch agency reported emergency dispatchers were busy fielding reports of vegetation fires and other weather hazards and urged residents to not call 911 unless they are experiencing a life threatening emergency.\n\nNeed to report an outage or weather hazard?\n\nPacific Power: On the web at PacificPower.net/outage, text OUT to 722797 or call 1-877-508-5088.\n\nOn the web at PacificPower.net/outage, text OUT to 722797 or call 1-877-508-5088.

But there are no plans to deploy the U.S. military to help with the task, according to the official.\n\nAssad's regime repeatedly used chemical weapons against the rebels and his people during the civil war, according to human rights monitors, and U.S. officials. Syria says it has destroyed its stocks, but if the munitions remain it is unclear who will gain control over them.\n\nAt a U.N. Security Council briefing Thursday on Syria's claim, U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu said Syria's assertion could not be fully verified. Nakamitusu cited 19 \"unresolved issues\" in the country’s declaration.\n\n“I reiterate that this is extremely worrying,” Nakamitsu said.\n\n75 targets hit in US strike on Syria against ISIS\n\nWith Biden's authorization, a strike on a “significant gathering” of ISIS fighters was launched Sunday which hit 75 targets. The strike also dropped 140 munitions on the site, a senior administration official said during a National Security Council call on Sunday with reporters\n\nThe official did not offer precise details of the targets saying an assessment of the strike had been completed yet.\n\nISIS has been trying to reconstitute in a broad area known as the Badiya Desert in Syria, according to the official.\n\n“We have worked to make sure they cannot do that. And so, when they try to gather, when they try to train, and we see it, which we do, we take them out,” he said.\n\nThere happened to be a “fairly broad gathering” and the president made a decision to launch a strike, the official said.\n\nBiden: U.S. forces launched precision strikes in Syria targeting ISIS\n\nBiden said Sunday that the fall of Damascus has heralded a period of “risk and uncertainty,” and that the U.S. will work with its partners and the stakeholders to “seize an opportunity” and manage the risk. He said the Islamic State − ISIS − might try to take advantage of the political chaos to create a haven for terrorists.\n\n“We will not let that happen,\" Biden said. He said U.S. forces on Sunday conducted a dozen precision strikes within Syria, targeting ISIS camps and ISIS operatives.\n\nThe U.S. will engage with all Syrian groups, including within the process led by the United Nations, to establish a transition to an independent and sovereign Syria, he said.\n\nU.S. to maintain presence in eastern Syria\n\nU.S. National Security Council Spokesperson Sean Savett said Biden was \"closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners.\"\n\nDaniel Shapiro, deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, said Sunday that the U.S. will take measures necessary to prevent a resurgence of ISIS, which had gained a foothold in Syria before essentially being driven out by U.S. and coalition forces in 2019.\n\nShapiro said the U.S. plans to maintain its presence in eastern Syria, and he called on all parties to protect civilians, particularly minorities, and to respect international norms.\n\n“We remain focused on ensuring that ISIS cannot regroup and pose a threat again, either regionally or globally,” Shapiro said.\n\nWhat's happening in Syria?What to know about the complex, long-simmering civil war\n\nSyrian prime minister offers olive branch to rebels\n\nUnverified footage published on social media appeared to show residents of Damascus and other cities pouring onto the streets, dancing and chanting, \"Assad is gone.\" Rebels said they would swiftly free political prisoners.\n\nSyrian Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali said he wants Syria to be a \"normal country that builds good relations with its neighbors and the world.\" He said he wouldn't flee, wants to peacefully transfer power, and is willing to work with any new leadership chosen by the people.\n\n\"I am in my home, I did not leave it because I belong to this country,\" he said.\n\nTrump says US should stay out of Syrian chaos\n\nTrump said in a post on X and his social media platform that the U.S. should have nothing to do with the war in Syria.\n\n\"THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,\" he wrote. \"LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED.\" Trump later followed that post up by saying Assad had fled Syria because Russia was no longer willing to protect him. Russia, he said \"lost all interest because of (its war in) Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Assad is gone,\" he wrote.\n\nWhat's happening in Syria?\n\nHours earlier, rebels announced they had gained full control of the key city of Homs after only a day of fighting.\n\nThe fall of Homs came after a new Syrian rebel offensive that started about 10 days ago. It gave insurgents control over Syria's strategic heartland and a key highway crossroads, severing Damascus from a coastal region that's key to the power of Assad's Alawite sect. The Alawites are a Muslim minority group who have ruled Syria for decades.\n\nHoms is also where Assad's Russian allies, who enabled him to stay in power during a 13-year-old civil war that has killed an estimated 300,000 civilians, have a naval base and air base. Russia provided Assad's government with vital air cover. Assad was also propped up by Iranian-backed militants including Hezbollah fighters.\n\nBut analysts say that Assad was effectively left to fend for himself because Russia was distracted by its war in Ukraine and Lebanon-based Hezbollah has been under intense pressure from an Oct. 7-related conflict with Israel.\n\nSights on Damascus:Syrian rebels claim key city of Homs\n\nWhat do we know about Bashar Assad?\n\nAssad inherited Syria's leadership from his father Hafez, a powerful military dictator who leaned heavily on the nation's feared security services to crush dissent and suppress all challenges to his rule.\n\nWhen the younger, Western-educated Assad, who studied to be a dentist, took over from his father in 2000 there were hopes Syria might chart a new reformist course for its citizens and ties with the international community.\n\nThose hopes faded fast.\n\nWhat began as a series of hopeful pro-democracy protests in Syria in 2011 ballooned into a devastating and intractable conflict that contributed to one of the most severe refugee crises since World War II.\n\nReporter's notebook:Walking with Syria's refugees\n\nAssad regime punctuated by violence, torture\n\nSyria's war has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, displaced millions, and helped spur the rise – then entrenchment, then toppling – of the Islamic State terrorist group.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, humanitarian groups, and Syria watchdogs, Assad's violence has taken many forms: imposing starvation sieges on rebel-held areas; repeatedly bombing, with Russian assistance, hospitals, and civilian infrastructure; arresting and torturing thousands of activists, bloggers, and civilians, then holding them at secret prisons deep underground, where they languish without trial.\n\nHe has also allegedly used chlorine bombs and sarin gas — chemical weapons — against opposition fighters, killing children and civilians.\n\nPutin, Ukraine, long-range missiles:Why there's talk about WWIII\n\nAssad's downfall: What happens next in Syria?\n\nAssad's toppling raises hard-to-answer questions about what comes next for Syria. Early reports indicated Assad fled to Russia. Moscow has been known to give shelter to exiled authoritarians and dictators. The two countries have a bond shaped by their opposition to the West during the Cold War and nurtured by Moscow's more recent attempt to have a more assertive foreign policy on the world stage.\n\nGeir Pederson, the United Nations special envoy to Syria, called it a \"watershed moment.\"\n\n\"To those displaced, this moment renews the vision of returning to homes once lost,\" he said in a statement. \"To families separated by war, the beginnings of reunions bring hope. To those unjustly detained, and the families of the detained and the missing, the opening of prison doors reminds us of justice’s eventual reach.\"\n\nMohammed Albasha, founder of Basha Report, a Virginia-based consultancy specializing in Middle East affairs, said the critical question for Syria is how effectively the rebels can establish control and manage the transition of power.\n\n\"Will Syria follow the path of Libya, descending into prolonged chaos? While many questions linger about the nation's future, one thing seems certain: today likely marks the end of the Assad regime.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/12/09/syrian-president-assad-flees-country-as-rebels-take-over-the-excerpt/76858677007/", "title": "Syrian President Assad flees country as rebels take over | The Excerpt", "text": "", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/12/06/syria-rebels-take-hama-city/76817335007/", "title": "'Your time has come': Syrian rebels take major city as thousands flee", "text": "Syrian rebels overtook the western city of Hama, their second major victory since they swept Aleppo last week, as thousands fled the city of Homs ahead of the Islamist insurgents.\n\nThe rebel group, called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, had advanced to the countryside around 3 miles north of Homs, Syria's third largest city, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor.

Roughly 1,400 of them live in Dearborn and more than 800 in Detroit. Many also live in Macomb and Oakland counties, with more than 400 Syrians in Sterling Heights and almost 600 in Troy. The community is diverse with different faiths, denominations, ethnicities and views about Syria's government.\n\nSince the Syrian uprising against al-Assad started in 2011, there have been rallies in metro Detroit both in support of al-Assad and against him. The Syrian American Christian community has expressed concern about opposition fighters they see as extremists. Syrian American priests in metro Detroit could not be reached for comment in recent days, but have previously expressed concern about some of the rebels.\n\nMartini and other Syrian Americans in metro Detroit have worked for years to bring attention to human rights abuses in Syria. One of the groups involved in lobbying efforts was United for Syria, based in Flint.\n\nSome Syrian Americans from Michigan have gone to Syria or neighboring nations to help with relief efforts. Others assisted with Syrian refugees who arrived in Michigan.\n\nAt least two metro Detroiters died while in Syria over the past dozen years. In 2013, Nicole Mansfield of Flint became the first American known to be killed while in Syria. She was with opposition forces at the time of her death. Also, a former Dearborn resident was killed in Syria in 2014 while fighting for Hezbollah, a Lebanese group allied with al-Assad that the U.S. labels as a terrorist organization.\n\nDr. Yahya Basha, of West Bloomfield, grew up in Hama, a city in Syria that was leveled in 1982 by al-Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad. When he heard the news that Hama was liberated from control by Syrian government forces, Basha was elated, but worried. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for half a century and Basha was worried about what he and his supporters may do in coming weeks.\n\n\"I am cautiously happy because I fear what could happen,\" Basha told the Free Press late Friday. Over the past decade, he often had his hopes for a free Syria crushed as Iran and Russia aided al-Assad in the leader's efforts to defeat the opposition.\n\nAt a coffee shop in West Bloomfield on Thursday night, a celebration was held by Syrian Americans after Hama was freed. A flier for the event with a photo of a historic water wheel in Hama read: \"42 years waiting for justice - Hama has been liberated from Assad's dictatorship. Come celebrate with community!\"\n\nBasha said that several of his cousins were killed in 1982 when the government crushed Hama.\n\n\"Every time I remember the stories, the details of it, I cry at all the ache,\" said Basha, who is the founder of Basha Diagnostics in Royal Oak and a longtime Arab American community leader in Michigan.\n\nBasha said \"I want to celebrate the departure of Assad and his killing machine.\" The doctor adds that he hopes the people who fled Syria to escape al-Assad and the war can return, \"that people get back to their homes with some dignity.\"\n\nBasha was one of several Syrian Americans who spoke on a call last week with Richard Grenell, a former acting director of national intelligence under President-elect Donald Trump who has done outreach in metro Detroit's Arab American communities this year to help Trump's presidential campaign. Basha has met repeatedly for decades with politicians and U.S. officials who handle foreign policy to discuss Syria. He met in Warren with Trump in September, saying he asked his campaign to help prevent Russia, Iran and Hezbollah from interfering in Syria.\n\nSome Syrian Americans planned to rally Sunday afternoon, celebrating the end of al-Assad's rule, starting at the Islamic Center of Detroit, a Detroit mosque, and then proceeding with a caravan to the Henry Ford Centennial Library in Dearborn.\n\nMartini said many Syrian immigrants in Michigan have been emotionally affected over the decades.\n\n\"We're all traumatized people,\" she said. \"Syrian people are all traumatized people. Whether you lived there during the revolution or you didn't, like someone like me — I've been here since the end of '92 — we are all traumatized.\"\n\nOther Syrian Americans have been more sympathetic to the Syrian government because they believe it was more progressive and protective of all groups in Syria. A rally in support of al-Assad was held in Dearborn in June 2011 at a Lebanese American center. On the wall at the rally hung a large banner with a photo of a smiling al-Assad, his hand waving to the crowd. It read: \"Syria Believes in You.\" In Michigan's Lebanese American community, there are varying views about al-Assad.\n\nOther protests supporting the opposition were held in previous years outside the Troy consulate offices of Syria's government, which was closed about a decade ago. Hundreds of Syrian Americans rallied in a Birmingham park in Oakland County in September 2013 calling upon President Barack Obama to take action against al-Assad.\n\nMartini was 13 years old in 1978 when the Muslim Brotherhood battled with al-Assad's forces in Aleppo. She recalled that government soldiers went door to door looking for books written by the founder of the Brotherhood, arresting or killing people they found with the books. Martini said that at one point, a soldier with a rifle entered her bedroom to search for the books.\n\n\"I woke up to to see a young man standing next to my bed with a Kalashnikov on his side, looking through my books,\" she said. \"It was the scare of my life.\"\n\nNow that al-Assad's reign has ended, \"I'm worried about what's going to happen next, the fight and struggle for power,\" she said. \"We have certain Islamist factions that are within the rebels that scare me.\"\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group labeled as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government, played a key role in overthrowing al-Assad's government forces in recent weeks.\n\nIn addition to Christians, other groups in Syria, such as Shias, Alawites, Kurds and Yazidis, have expressed concern about some of the rebels. Al-Assad was part of the Alawite community, a group seen as heretical by some opposition fighters.\n\n\"We want a democracy,\" Martini said. \"I want people in Syria to live like we live here, a secular democracy, and it's going to be a struggle to get there. … A country that lives through dictatorship for so long, it's not going to be an easy transition, so that's what I'm anxious about.

Here’s a look at how the conflict started:\n\nWhat’s the recent history in Donbas?\n\nWar broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Intense fighting left portions of Luhansk and Donetsk, in the Donbas region, in the hands of Russian-backed separatists. Russia also annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that sparked global condemnation.\n\nRussian-backed rebels seized a government building in Donetsk, Ukraine on April 11, 2014. Efrem Lukatsky/AP/FILE\n\nThe separatist-controlled areas in Donbas became known as the Luhansk and the Donetsk People’s Republics. The Ukrainian government in Kyiv asserts the two regions are, in effect, Russian-occupied. The self-declared republics are not recognized by any governments, other than Russia and its close ally Syria. The Ukrainian government refuses to talk directly with either separatist republic.\n\nThe Minsk II agreement of 2015 led to a shaky ceasefire agreement, and the conflict settled into static warfare along the Line of Contact that separates the Ukrainian government and separatist-controlled areas. The Minsk Agreements (named after the capital of Belarus where they were concluded) ban heavy weapons near the Line of Contact.\n\nLanguage around the conflict is heavily politicized. The Ukrainian government calls separatist forces “invaders” and “occupiers.” Russian media calls separatist forces “militias” and maintains that they are locals defending themselves against the Kyiv government.\n\nMore than 14,000 people have died in the conflict in Donbas since 2014. Ukraine says 1.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with most staying in the areas of Donbas that remain under Ukrainian control and about 200,000 resettling in the wider Kyiv region.\n\nHow has Putin stoked the conflict?\n\nThe separatists in Donbas have had substantial backing from Moscow. Russiahas long maintained that it has no soldiers on the ground there, but US, NATO and Ukrainian officials say the Russian government supplies the separatists, provides them with advisory support and intelligence, and embeds its own officers in their ranks.\n\nMoscow has also distributed hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to people in Donbas in recent years. Western officials and observers have accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of attempting to establish facts on the ground by naturalizing Ukrainians as Russian citizens, a de facto way of recognizing the breakaway states. It also gives him a reason to intervene in Ukraine.\n\nLast week, the Russian parliament recommended that the Kremlin formally recognize parts of the LPR and DPR as an independent states, another escalation in rhetoric that US officialssaid at the time demonstrated that Putin has no intention of abiding by the Minsk agreement.\n\nUkraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine would “not stop until we free our territories in Donbas, Crimea, until Russia pays for all the damage it caused in Ukraine.”\n\nPutin has long accused Ukraine of violating the rights of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine, and has said it was within Russia’s rights to militarily intervene to protect them.\n\nIn recent weeks, Putin has alleged that “genocide” was being committed in Donbas. His allegations aren’t new, but the timing is of concern to Western policy-makers, who fear a repeat of a 2008 conflict in Georgia.\n\nBy invoking genocide, Putin was echoing Russia’s false claim that Georgia committed genocide against civilians in the breakaway republic of South Ossetia in August 2008. During that brief conflict, Russia launched a massive military incursion that pushed deep into Georgian territory.\n\nAs it was in 2014, the Donbas region is now the crucible of the conflict between east and west, between Putin’s drive to reassert control – weakening the Ukrainian state – and the growing aspiration of Ukrainians to join the fold of European democracies.", "authors": ["Tamara Qiblawi Nathan Hodge Tim Lister Ivana Kottasová", "Tamara Qiblawi", "Nathan Hodge", "Tim Lister", "Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/12/07/trump-syria-conflict-russia/76839061007/", "title": "Trump says US should stay out of Syrian conflict", "text": "WASHINGTON – President-elect Donald Trump warned on Saturday that the United States should not intervene in the latest conflict in Syria, where rebel forces opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime are waging a new offensive in the country’s long-simmering civil war.\n\n“Syria is a mess, but is not our friend,” Trump said in a post on his social media site, Truth Social, on Saturday morning. “THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and millions have fled overseas in the decade since the war started.\n\nA ceasefire was brokered in 2020 between Russia, which has supported Assad during the war, and Turkey, which has backed the opposition, paused fighting in the war.\n\nBut last week, rebel forces, called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, captured Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, and have since seized control of the entire southwestern region of the country. On Saturday, insurgents reportedly entered the suburbs surrounding the capital of Damascus, where Assad and other government officials reside.\n\nRussian forces have carried out air strikes against the rebel group since fighting picked back up over the last week.\n\nAnalysts say the eruption of new fighting is likely a direct consequence of the hostilities between Iran-backed Hezbollah, an ally of Assad, and Israel in nearby Lebanon.\n\nLeaders from Russia, Turkey and Iran are expected to meet in Doha on Saturday to discuss the renewed conflict, a Turkish diplomatic source told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. has around 900 troops in Syria's east and northeast.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/12/01/syria-civil-war-what-know/76687144007/", "title": "What's happening in Syria?

However, Assad in a speech Saturday vowed to defend the country's \"stability and territorial integrity.\"\n\nSyria's civil war grew out of Assad's brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2011. More than a decade later, about half a million people have been killed, according to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group. Millions of Syrians have fled overseas. Key infrastructure lay in ruins. A web of Syria's neighbors and countries around the world have backed either Assad's government or various rebel opposition groups to varying degrees.\n\nSyria's war:How barbarity, confusion and indifference helped Bashar al-Assad prosper\n\nHere's what to know about the complex war.\n\nWhy has Syria's civil war re-erupted now?\n\nA cease-fire brokered by Turkey, which supports the opposition, and Russia, which backs Assad, has been in place since 2020. But the fresh rebel offensive started last week as anti-Assad fighters sought to take more government-controlled territory. Rebels claimed this was in response to an uptick in attacks from Assad's forces.\n\nHowever, analysts say the eruption of new fighting is likely a direct consequence of what's been taking place outside Syria's borders. That includes Iran-backed Hezbollah – an ally of Assad – and its major hostilities with Israel in Lebanon. Russia's war in Ukraine has also influenced the region.\n\n\"Hezbollah has been weakened by its recent conflict with Israel. Russia remains entangled in the war in Ukraine and faces economic strain. Iran is stretched thin, with its ground lines of communication and regional allies under direct attack,\" said Mohammed Albasha, founder of Basha Report, a Virginia-based consultancy specializing in Middle East affairs. \"Against this backdrop, Turkey and its allies are seizing the moment.\"\n\nWho's fighting who? And why?\n\nA Sunni Islamist militant and political group named Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, and its allies have been leading the latest rebel offensive. HTS has historic, though now splintered, connections to both al-Qaida and the Islamic State terror groups. HTS wants to topple Assad, expel Iran from the area and pursue its own extremist ideology.\n\nAssad's chief military supporters have been Russia and Iran. Russia entered the conflict in 2015 to shore up Assad's struggling regime. Russia's leader Vladimir Putin wanted to assert his country's power on the world stage and act as a counterweight to the U.S., which at the time was arming and providing air cover for a motley crew of anti-Assad rebel groups, including Kurds in Iraq and Syria, who were simultaneously waging war against the Islamic State.\n\nSyria conflict explained:How did we end up here?\n\nIran has long backed the Assad regime, funneling money and fighters to it through Hezbollah. It does this to pursue its national security aims, which include using Syria to pressure its neighbor Israel, Iran's arch-enemy.\n\nTurkey, Syria's northern neighbor, has thrown its weight behind anti-Assad opposition groups because it wants to contain Kurdish secessionist movements in the region, including in Turkey, where separatists have for decades waged what the government describes as terror attacks. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also faces growing domestic political pressure to deport Syrian refugees who have fled to Turkey in droves since the war's start.\n\nWhat does the fighting mean, and what happens now?\n\nAssad's regime is entrenched. His government as of last week controlled approximately 70% of Syrian territory, according to the United States Institute of Peace, a think tank. The surge in fighting from a mostly dormant cease-fire raises the possibility of yet another violent and volatile front in the Middle East after a fragile cease-fire in Lebanon between Hezbollah and Israel and the ongoing fight in Gaza between Iran-backed Hamas and Israel.\n\nWhether Assad's government can survive, and prosper, may ultimately depend on how much intervention there is from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, all three of which have enabled him to stay in power.\n\nSyrian rebels sweep into Aleppo:army says dozens of soldiers killed\n\nAyman Abdel Nour, a former friend of Syria's leader from their college days studying medicine in Damascus and the editor-in-chief of All4Syria, a leading independent news outlet, said that in recent weeks Assad has resisted efforts by Russia to get him to meet with Turkey's Erdogan ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's second term.\n\nThis meeting, Nour said, would be aimed at finding a longer-term solution to Syria's 13-year-old simmering civil war – in particular its underpinning by non-state actors such as Hezbollah at a time when Trump has signaled he wants to withdraw the remaining 900 U.S. troop in Syria who counter Iran's influence.\n\n\"The rapid gains by rebel forces, combined with the maneuvering of external powers with conflicting interests, leave Syria's future precariously uncertain,\" said Albasha.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/asia/sri-lanka-crisis-rajapaksa-flee-protest-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Gotabaya Rajapaksa: How Sri Lanka's runaway President went from ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThey were once seen as heroes of the nation, the almost mythical warrior-king leaders who defeated the separatists in a bloody civil war.\n\nYet the final days of Sri Lanka’s Rajapaksa dynasty tell a very different tale.\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday, embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa made a hurried exit from the South Asian nation, days after thousands of angry protesters broke into his official residence, swam in his pool, and demanded he finally go.\n\nHe had been expected to resign later that day, but Gotabaya Rajapaksa didn’t wait around to make it official. Instead, before dawn, he boarded a military plane leaving Colombo, the commercial capital of the crisis-hit country, and fled to the Maldives.\n\nHis departure is a historic moment for the island nation of 22 million, which the Rajapaksas had ruled with an iron fist for much of the past two decades before losing the faith of their once adoring citizens.\n\n“The sight of Gotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing Sri lanka on an air force plane represents (the downfall) of this family,” said Ganeshan Wignaraja, senior research associate at the British think tank, ODI Global.\n\n“Their legacy I don’t think is a positive one. But one hopes that Sri Lanka will move on in a new direction.”\n\nWith jubilant Sri Lankans still swimming in the presidential pool, singing in the presidential dining room and dancing around the opulent presidential grounds, it is clear many share that optimism – at least for now.\n\nWhat happens during the next 24 hours will do much to determine the country’s future, with Rajapaksa’s long-term intentions remaining as yet unclear.\n\nProtesters at Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's official residence in Colombo on July 12. Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe rise of the Rajapaksas\n\nAs the country takes its first steps in its brave new era, experts say it would do well to consider what went wrong with the last one – starting with the rise and fall of the Rajapaksas.\n\nGotabaya Rajapaksa is not the first member of the family to have been president. His brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, who like Gotabaya was widely considered a “war hero” among the majority population, was elected President in 2005 and achieved near legendary status in 2009 when he declared victory in the 26-year civil war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels.\n\nFormer Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, left, and his brother Basil Rajapaksa, right, during a campaign in the suburb of Kirillawala, Sri Lanka, on April 4, 2010. Chamila Karunarathne/AP\n\nThat victory gave Mahinda Rajapaksa an almost inexhaustible well of political capital to draw on and he would go on to enjoy a 10-year grip on power during which he was venerated by Sri Lanka’s Sinhalese Buddhist majority. He was popularly referred to as “appachchi” – the father of the nation – and people would often bow when he walked past and fear for him when he was unwell.\n\nFor much of his term, Mahinda Rajapaksa ran Sri Lanka like a family business, appointing his brothers to key positions; Gotabaya as Defense Secretary, Basil as Minister of Economic Development, and Chamal as the Speaker of Parliament.\n\nMahinda Rajapaksa, left, with his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 2019. Tharaka Basnayaka/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nAnd while the good times were rolling, despite gripes about nepotism, the brothers remained popular. The country saw years of growth, fueled by the government’s vast borrowing from overseas to fund public services.\n\nBut the good times weren’t to last.\n\nBrief hiatus and comeback\n\nWhile the civil war did much to create Mahinda Rajapaksa’s legend, it also contained the first signs of his downfall.\n\nAccording to a 2011 United Nations report, government troops were responsible for abuses including the intentional shelling of civilians, summary executions, rape, and blocking food and medicine from reaching affected communities. The UN report said “a number of credible sources have estimated there could have been as many as 40,000 civilian deaths.”\n\nMahinda Rajapaksa’s government has always vehemently denied such allegations.\n\nHowever, its problems began to mount.\n\nThe human rights concerns went beyond the war. Political opponents accused Mahinda Rajapaksa of giving tacit approval to far-right Buddhist groups and Sri Lanka’s Muslim and Tamil minorities feared a wider crackdown on their communities.\n\nAt the same time, anger at Mahinda’s perceived cronyism grew as signs of economic trouble emerged and it became clear that there would be a price to pay for the government’s earlier largesse.\n\nBy 2015, Sri Lanka owed China $8 billion, and Sri Lankan government officials predicted that accumulated foreign debt – both owed to China and other countries – would eat up 94% of the country’s GDP.\n\nThat year, Mahinda Rajapaksa lost a close presidential election to his one-time health minister.\n\n“Sri Lanka is a democratic country and people were shocked at that extent of attempting cronyism,” Wignaraja said. “This combination of (nepotism) and mismanaging the economy… people were upset they elected these people.”\n\nThat might have been enough to finish off a lesser dynasty, but not the Rajapaksas.\n\nGotabaya Rajapaksa with his wife Ayoma, on the outskirts of Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 2019. Eranga Jayawardena/AP\n\nIn April 2019, Islamic militants killed at least 290 people in a string of bombings at churches and luxury hotels. A panicked country turned back to the one family they knew that had a proven record on national security.\n\nIn November of that year, Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected as the country’s new President. And like his brother, he saw governing as a family affair.\n\n“People have once again imposed their full confidence in us,” Mahinda Rajapaksa said after a landslide victory in parliamentary elections a year later.\n\n“We will fulfill their aspirations and will always value the confidence they have placed in us.”\n\nGotabaya appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa shortly after.\n\n‘Fall from grace’\n\nStill, as had happened to his brother, cracks began to emerge in Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s presidency as questions over his government’s economic management continued to grow.\n\nExperts say Sri Lanka’s economic problems were not entirely the government’s fault – but its woes were made worse by a series of bad decisions.\n\nMurtaza Jafferjee, chair of Colombo-based think tank Advocata Institute, said the vast borrowing spree Sri Lanka embarked on to fund its public service coincided with a series of hammer blows to the Sri Lankan economy, from natural disasters such as heavy monsoons, to man-made ones.\n\nFacing a massive deficit, Rajapaksa slashed taxes in a doomed attempt to stimulate the economy.\n\nBut the move backfired, instead hitting government revenue. Ratings agencies then downgraded Sri Lanka to near default levels, meaning the country lost access to overseas markets. Sri Lanka then had to use its foreign exchange reserves to pay off government debt. This affected imports of fuel and other essentials, which sent prices soaring.\n\nOn the streets, the Rajapaksa’s once adoring public found themselves unable to feed their families or fuel their vehicles. Now people must queue for hours for fuel, often clashing with police and military as they wait. Supermarkets shelves are barren. Medicine supplies are running dangerously low.\n\nAnd it is the Rajapaksas they blame. For months, angry Sri Lankans have taken to the streets, accusing Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa of mismanaging the economy.\n\nPeople throng President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's official residence three days after it was stormed by anti government protesters in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on July 12. Rafiq Maqbool/AP\n\nThose protests began peacefully but turned violent in May, prompting Mahinda Rajapaksa to resign as Prime Minister. But his decision did little to quell frustrations – and his brother remained in power as the President.\n\nFor weeks Gotabaya clung on, apparently unwilling to let the dynasty fall. But ultimately he had no choice, as the lavish home he once used to entertain power brokers was taken over by crowds escaping the heat in his sparkling swimming pool and holding picnics on his sprawling lawn.\n\nAs Wignaraja pointed out, the imagery was a fitting end to an era.\n\n“You have this idea that the ruling elite are living very lavishly, while being very corrupt, and the ordinary person is in grave difficulty,” Wignaraja said.\n\n“To go from being perceived as heroes, to being chased out of your own home is unthinkable. It’s a complete fall from grace.”", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/07/02/talks-as-ukraine-fighting-worsens/12033425/", "title": "Ukraine agrees to second cease-fire as fighting worsens", "text": "Oren Dorell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nUkraine and Russia agreed Wednesday to a second cease-fire, as the Ukrainian military continued fighting insurgents in the country's eastern provinces.\n\nForeign ministers from those two countries plus Germany and France, meeting in Berlin, announced a plan to reopen talks by Saturday \"with the goal of reaching an unconditional and mutually agreed sustainable cease-fire.\"\n\nThe agreement comes after five Ukrainian troops and hundreds of pro-Russian separatists were killed as government forces engaged in more than 100 clashes since late Monday night when Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ended a unilateral, 10-day cease-fire.\n\nThe four foreign ministers, in their statement, stressed \"the necessity of a sustainable cease-fire, to be agreed upon swiftly.\"\n\nThe agreement would involve Russian cooperation with Ukrainian forces on border security, the return of key border crossings to Ukrainian control, and free access to international monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in which Russia is a member.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after the talks in Berlin that the cease-fire should not be used to give the military time to regroup and bring in reinforcements.

Sixth St. last week through his affiliate company, Cincinnati Development III LLC, for $10 million. The Indianapolis-based developer has been trying to acquire the 600,000-square-foot modernist structure since 2018.\n\n\"The acquisition of this property has been a long and bumpy road for Birkla Investment Group,\" said Doug Moormann, vice president of Development Strategies Group, which represents Birkla on the hotel. \"They are thrilled to have gained control of the building and are eager to work to stabilize the property and provide for a safety environment for the public, but also to get to work on the renovation.\"\n\nThe sale comes less than five months after Cincinnati City Council voted to deny the former Terrace Plaza Hotel local landmark designation. Preservationists had been pushing for landmark status for years, noting the building's fame as one of the first high-rise commercial projects in the United States after World War II. Denying the building the local landmark status meant that its next owner − who is now Birkla − wouldn't have to go through the city's Historic Conservation Board to alter its controversial, windowless facade known as the \"brick box.\"AIready on the National Register of Historic Places, the Terrace Plaza Hotel was also listed in 2020 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of the 11 most endangered properties in the country. Despite these acknowledgments, its original design from 1948 is not protected.\n\nOver the last five years, Birkla has made his plans for the 18-story building clear: He wants to renovate the ground-floor retail portion, turn floors one through seven into parking and the hotel tower into apartments.\n\nMoorman said Birkla is considering conducting a market analysis to determine if the two top floors of the \"brick box\" may be used for a different purpose such as office space. The Terrace Plaza Hotel's original Gourmet Room is going to be brought back to life, too, helmed by the restaurant group that operates downtown's Prime Cincinnati.Cincinnati architecture firm Reztark Design Studio has been brought in on a conceptual design.\n\nBuy that dream house: See the best mortgage lenders\n\nBut before all these changes happen, Birkla has to stabilize the building.Vacant for 14 years, both the exterior and interior of the building have fallen into serious disrepair after the hotel's last major tenant, Hilton, moved out. A chunk of the facade fell onto a parked car in 2018, and a pipe burst the following year, causing significant water damage. Moormann said the drywall has molded and there have been high amounts of asbestos found through the block-long property.\n\nIts previous owner, Cincinnati Terrace Associates LLC, a subsidiary of Brooklyn, New York-based JNY Capital, bought the building in 2018 for $9.5 million, but plans to redevelop quickly fell through. The company then started racking up several code violations against the deteriorating condition of the building, leading the city to file a public nuisance lawsuit against the owner in 2019. This eventually led to the property nearly being sold at a Hamilton County Sheriff’s foreclosure auction in 2021, but the owner defaulted on the mortgage, filed for bankruptcy and later lost control of the building.\n\nThe Hamilton County Landbank temporarily held the property and recently transferred the deed to Birkla's company.One of the many issues surrounding the aged structure includes the instability of its Sixth Street awning, which is one of the city's top priorities in ensuring pedestrian street safety. The city also wants Birkla to remove the metal cooling tower on top of the building. Moormann said the developer plans to address these issues before moving forward with the development plan. Details on when interior demolition and remediation will begin are expected to be determined soon. The building's current street-level tenants ‒ Batsakes Hat Shop, Wendel's and H&D Beauty Supply ‒ will be relocated ahead of construction.\n\nSydney Franklin reports on the business of real estate in Cincinnati.

The law has already supported repairs on more than 2,400 bridges, according to the US Department of Transportation.\n\n“Without the new BIL funds, we would have been scrambling to find the money to quickly replace the Fern Hollow Bridge, and other important projects would have been impacted,” said Wolf in a statement released in October when Biden returned to Pittsburgh to see the bridge repair progress.\n\nIn Nebraska, a state transportation official told lawmakers on Tuesday that a long-delayed, 600-mile expressway system could be completed four years ahead of schedule.\n\nThe official credited the federal infrastructure law as one of the main reasons the department was able to accelerate work, according to a report from the Omaha World-Herald.\n\nHere’s how the infrastructure law works\n\nMore than $185 billion from the infrastructure law has been announced and is headed to states, tribes, territories and local governments, with thousands of specific projects identified for funding thus far, according to the White House.\n\nThe funds are delivered in two ways: through formula programs that send money directly to states and through competitive grant programs that require state and local agencies to apply.\n\nA lot of the formula programs have long been sending federal money to states on an annual basis, but are now delivering much more funding for the five-year period covered by the infrastructure law.\n\nFor example, the Federal Highway Administration released nearly $60 billion to states in October through 12 formula programs to support investment in roads, bridges and tunnels; carbon emission reduction; and safety improvements. That’s an increase of $15.4 billion compared with fiscal year 2021, the last fiscal year before the infrastructure law was implemented.\n\nDozens of major, specific projects have been selected for funding through grant programs over the past year. Funding for the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America grant program (known as INFRA), which is meant for freight and highway projects of national or regional significance, increased by more than 50% this year. About $1.5 billion was released for 26 transportation projects in September.\n\nIn August, the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity program, known as RAISE, released $2.2 billion for 166 specific road, bridge, transit, rail, port or intermodal transportation projects across the country. In 2021, the program could only afford to fund 90 projects.\n\nThe infrastructure law also created new funding programs, like the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, which released $615 million to states this year. That money can be used for installing public electric vehicle charging stations.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2021/02/11/jacksonville-beach-beach-bowl-reopen-after-7-5-million-remodel/4454741001/", "title": "Historic Beach Bowl to reopen in Jacksonville Beach after $7.5 ...", "text": "An iconic Jacksonville Beach landmark for 60 years is on the road to reopening after it abruptly closed a little more than a year ago to the dismay of Northeast Florida bowlers.\n\nThe historic Beach Bowl at 818 Beach Blvd. is getting a $7.5 million overhaul including renovations, remodeling and upgrades.\n\nThe Jacksonville Beach Board of Adjustment on Feb. 2 approved the restoration project proposed by Jacksonville-based H&H Enterprises Inc., which owns the bowling alley.\n\nAs part of the project, Beach Bowl will expand its footprint, adding a two-story restaurant with rooftop dining, according to a site plan included in the company's application to the city.\n\nThe existing building will be expanded by about 6,200 square feet to accommodate the new restaurant, the site plan showed.\n\nA projected opening date hasn't been announced.\n\nH&H Enterprises officials did not immediately return Times-Union requests for comment.\n\nMayor Christine Hoffman told the Times-Union that a revamped Beach Bowl is welcomed as an asset to the community.\n\n\"Bowling alleys appeal to all ages and so families will certainly benefit from this entertainment option!

Dodge and Son Memorial Fountain sat dormant for at least a decade. Mayor Mike Duggan said the fountain was once a spectacular landmark of Detroit but faced many challenges over the years.\n\n\"One of Detroit's serious deficiencies over the years has been its lack of commitment to great public spaces,\" Duggan said. \"Great public spaces can unite a community, bringing in people from all walks of life, and it can shape the identity of a city and it has been hard to watch over the years as the great public spaces of Detroit declined. Palmer Park, Rouge Park, Chandler Park, but no public space declined more than Hart Plaza and the Dodge Fountain.\"\n\nThrough the 1980s, Hudson's closed, whose site now holds an under-construction but soon-to-be flashy skyscraper; Michigan Central Station closed; businesses left, and maintaining Hart Plaza and the fountain wasn't a city priority, Duggan added.\n\n\"It continued to deteriorate, and since the city went into bankruptcy in 2013, it hasn't worked at all,\" Duggan said.\n\n'Paint can stuck' in jets\n\nThe fountain first began running in 1976, Duggan said. But, over time, when crews programmed the fountain to show different water and light configurations with computers, the jets stopped working.\n\n\"It was turned off for two years when they programmed the computers and they bragged in the 1970s about a computer-run water fountain. You can imagine how that went, and it was off and on through the 1980s,\" Duggan said. \"It was a running joke in the city in the late '70s and early '80s over the fact that they couldn't get it to work right. And, eventually, they just gave up.\"\n\n\"There was a point in the '80s where the entire fountain shut down because a paint can was stuck in the jets. The city wasn't doing basic maintenance,\" Duggan said. \"As I understand, they basically rebuilt everything to 2024 standard, not a 1978 standard. And hopefully the computers of our generation work better.\"\n\nRestoration costs\n\nIn a $9 million renovation project for Hart Plaza, the fountain alone needed nearly $7 million. The city used ARPA money to fund $6.7 million of restorations, which included removing metal panels from the dome, installing nozzles, waterproofing Hart Plaza and repairing jets, lighting and plumbing.\n\nThe federal grant financed 184 lights, 144 misters, 22 down jets, three spray rings and 72 panels.\n\nWho was it named after?\n\nThe iconic fountain was named after Horace E. Dodge, who founded the Dodge automobile brand with his brother John Dodge. His widow, Anna Thomson, donated $2 million toward the fountain, designed by Isamu Noguchi, according to the Detroit Historical Society.\n\nThe Dodge brothers grew up helping their father build marine engines in his machine shop. The family moved to Detroit in 1886 and in 1901 opened a machine shop, Dodge Brothers, getting their first major opportunity when the Olds plant burned in Detroit and Ransom E. Olds hired the brothers to supply 3,000 auto transmissions.\n\nThey began supplying parts exclusively to the Ford Motor Co., and in 1914, they left and created their own car company.\n\nWhen will the fountain operate?\n\nEvery day from 11 a.m.-2 p.m. and 5-10 pm. from at least May to October, depending on the weather.\n\n'Highlight' of Movement Festival\n\nThe fountain was activated during the 2024 Movement Festival, however, Duggan said the water only flowed downward.\n\n\"Everybody said the fountain was the highlight of the Movement festival,\" Duggan said. \"Most Detroiters don't realize the fountain is supposed to go up, but it's been so many years since that's happened. They haven't seen it.\"\n\nDetroit's electronic music festival has been running for 25 years, said Sam Fotias of Paxahau Events, drawing in thousands of attendees to \"celebrate Detroit's rich musical history and honor its legacy as the birthplace of techno.\"\n\n\"This year was extra special to see the fountain completely restored ... and to see the amazing response and emotional engagement by our attendees who have been used to seeing it shut off over the last 10 or 12 years,\" Fotias said.\n\nCouncilman Fred Durhal III said Hart Plaza is indicative of the city's recreational areas and spaces that hold events throughout the year.\n\n\"I remember being a little kid, running around playing in this fountain when my father worked right across the street in the Coleman A. Young Municipal Building. And I remember coming down here with my daughter, and one of the first questions she asked was, 'Why does the fountain not work?' Durhal said, calling the restoration celebration a \"special day\" to him.\n\nPhil Talbert, who provides project consultations through Total Access Events and previously worked for the city, recalled the fountain being his first task in 1977 as an urban core student.\n\n\"Me and the fountain became friends, and we have been friends from the the 27 years I spent with the city,\" Talbert said. \"I've seen this new, I've seen it weathered, I've seen it worn, but I get to see it new again. That's something that you can say is an honor and a privilege. So let the water flow. Let the lights go again. But let's make sure it's going for a new generation.

The bridge would need to be rehabilitated every 24 years, leading to a $16.8 million pricetag over the course of 85 years.\n\nJefferson Avenue Footbridge rehabilitation and life-cycle options\n\nSeven council members and more than 60 community members were present at the meeting held Tuesday night at the Savoy Ballroom on Commercial Street.\n\nNo official vote was taken but council members Phyllis Ferguson, Jan Fisk, Ken McClure, Mike Schilling, Tom Prater, Craig Fishel and Craig Hosmer reached a consensus that preserving the original footbridge was the way to go.\n\nTheir decision allows the city's Public Works department to begin the design phase of the project.\n\nDesign is expected to take six months and cost about $200,000, according to City Manager Greg Burris.\n\nBurris said the design will be paid for by the 1/8-cent transportation sales tax.\n\nThe city will also begin creating a funding plan for the bridge, by looking at private and public sources of money, Burris said.\n\nCouncilwoman Ferguson said, \"It's going to take all of us reaching into our pockets, tapping our friends on their shoulders and reaching into theirs too ... Collectively we will be able to do something that will make us proud all throughout the city.\"\n\n'The Eiffel Tower of Springfield' faces costly repair — or demolition\n\nIn October and November the city held public meetings and distributed online and paper surveys about the footbridge.\n\nOut of the 349 people who filled out the survey, 87 percent said they want the city to preserve the original structure.\n\nOther options included demolition or construction of a replacement bridge.\n\nThe second most popular option — which received 8 percent of votes — was providing a full rehab of the bridge now, then building a replacement in the future. That option would initially cost $2.8 million, with a cumulative cost through the year 2102 of $8.4 million.\n\nSeveral community members spoke to council during Tuesday's meeting.\n\nSpringfield resident Tim Havens said he thinks millions of dollars could be better spent elsewhere.\n\n\"If we were going to preserve something from the past, I would like to preserve Bill's Place,\" Havens said, talking about a drop-in center with services for the homeless that closed in December. Bill's Place was operated by Burrell Behavioral Health on Commercial Street.\n\nHavens talked about how the Springfield fire chief said his department needs more funding to protect citizens who live in the northwest part of town, where the response is slower and the fire death rate is higher.\n\n\"We don't have enough firemen, don't have enough policemen. We're going to have to come up with money for a jail pretty soon,\" Havens said. \"There are a few things we just have to save but what are we going to do with (the footbridge)? Decorate it for Christmas? Kids don't care about the bridge. Maybe we won't tear it down but our grandkids will.\"\n\nThe vast majority of speakers argued in favor of preserving the bridge.\n\nKrista Rosenbaum, who said she lives near the north end of the footbridge, said she and her two sons walked across the bridge \"several times a week\" when it was open.\n\n\"It is part of our history for our young kids coming up too,\" Rosenbaum said. \"My sons, eight and five, they ask when the footbridge is going to open all the time.\"\n\nCommercial Street resident Christine Schilling urged council \"to see beyond what the cost is.\"\n\n\"The value of this bridge is very symbolic. It's an icon,\" Schilling said. \"As a bridge it joins periods of history. It joins north and south.\"\n\nSchilling said the bridge also generates income for the city. She said she has met out of town and even international visitors who have come to Springfield to see the footbridge.\n\nSpencer Jones with Great River Engineering presented a brief history of the footbridge.\n\nThe Jefferson Avenue Footbridge was built in 1902 and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.\n\nThe city built the footbridge and two underpasses in an effort to keep a railroad company, a major employer, from moving away from Springfield, Jones said.\n\nIn 1901 the railroad company threatened to move its headquarters because pedestrians and other traffic moving across the tracks hindered operations, according to Jones.\n\nThe 562-feet long footbridge cost $8,500 to construct originally.\n\nJohn Sellars, the executive director of History Museum on the Square, said the footbridge represents a time when the railroad played a big role in the growth of Springfield.\n\n\"The bridge needs to be preserved because it's one of the last touchstones of an industry that made this city what it is today,\" Sellars said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/04/27/breck-walking-wells-avenue/100988190/", "title": "Breck: Walking Wells Avenue", "text": "Karl Breckenridge\n\nAs the RGJ revises the Sunday print paper, I’m submitting this column that mimics one I wrote in 2001, with some minor changes for clarity:\n\nSouth Wells Avenue was once a happenin’ little shopping area. New, modern buildings were being built to accommodate merchants seeking a compromise between downtown and the Park Lane/Shoppers’ Square malls — then the only two malls in Reno. South Wells Avenue is arguably 22 blocks long, too far to walk, so for this morning we’ll hopscotch around instead of going block by block. The inspiration for all this? Twofold: The Reno City Fathers — and Mothers — were toying with a major redesign of Wells Avenue in 2001, with new landscaping, street lighting and single lanes leading into traffic go-arounds at several locations. Secondly, a landmark restaurant that opened during the heyday of the street, closed a week or so before this column originally ran — a landmark that started and ended an era. I’d like to recall what the street once meant to our town’s economy and lifestyle:\n\nCruising through newspaper ads, old Yellow Pages, city directories, county records and other clutter pointed us toward the mid-1970s as the earlier glory years of Wells Avenue. It’s seems eerie that McDonald’s, which opened in June of 1975 on the corner of Colorado River Boulevard, could ever close, but it did. The Wells Avenue McDonald’s was the third in Reno, following closely behind the original store on Keystone and the second on Oddie Boulevard (both those structures replaced in coming years.) Across Wells Avenue was Wayne’s Drive-In, soon to become a casualty of Mickey D’s proximity. The Deluxe Laundry north of McDonald’s was one of McKenzie Construction Company’s first buildings in Reno, ca. 1952, and was resurrected as a Midtown café that moved to West Street Market.\n\nRestaurants — good ones — abounded on Wells Avenue. A favorite watering hole for business people was Posey Butterfield’s, later Rapscallion, on the corner of Vesta Street. A Mandarin Café was across from McDonald’s, great Chinese, no relation to the classic Mandarin downtown. We once wrote of old service stations becoming the best restaurants in Reno, and the Gulf Oil station that became Froggy’s Lunchbox, just north of McDonald’s is one of them. (You may know it better as P.J. and Company). The base chapel was hauled down from Reno Air Base, later Stead, to the northeast corner of Vassar and Wells, then bricked over and made into Little Flower Church somewhere between 1949 to 1951, depending on your resource. Now a bank, it was banker Sid and Vera Stern’s macaroni joint in Wells Avenue’s heyday, proving that all good Wells Avenue buildings, including Catholic churches, start or end as restaurants. Then we have the restaurant that became an office building, the Dairy Queen just north of Vassar; if you look real hard you can see where we ordered Peanut Buster Parfaits. And we can’t forget Juicy’s on Ryland, for a great burger in the lube bay.\n\nSouth of Posey’s was Humphrey’s Furniture, a fairly large store. Another major furniture store in Reno was Baker’s Furniture south of Arroyo Street, which had its origin as an Eagle Thrifty drug store. It then became Baker’s, then Good Morning Furniture, then closed, but now lives on once again as a retail store. Eagle Thrifty moved across the street into a new building, with the greatest shopping variety in Reno, a true super drug store. Name it, they’d have it in that great basement of theirs. That store, as did all Eagle Thrifty’s, became a Raley’s, and that Wells Avenue location remains open and bustling as a grocery store. Many small retail buildings were built in the 1960s, some pretty clever and well-designed. Check out the building on the southwest corner of Wells Avenue and Roberts Street: the late architect Web Brown, a good friend of mine and a research asset to this column, incorporated five distinct architectural styles into one retail building. Landlords had little trouble finding quality, long-term tenants, in all categories of merchandise — Brundidge’s Art Supply, GoodTimes Clothes, Lear-Higdon Opticians, Tapis Tree Needlework. Crown Electronics, Wok-on-the-Wild Side kitchen stuff, Whippy’s Golf Shop, Reno Ski Shop. Pants Etc., Earl’s Western Wear, Sierra Custom Sound, Greco’s Music Store, Murdock’s, and Sierra Cyclery were a few, all opening in that 1960s time window. Aids Ambulance operated out of a building at Stewart Street, their name proving to have an unfortunate connotation in years to follow.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nAnd services — a half-dozen pet stores, another half-dozen cleaners, beauty shops and barber shops galore, Corrigan’s and Ryan’s saloons and the storied Wonder Bar, dentists and optometrists, Art Remple Television, a Valley Bank and a major post office (at Ryland, now a hock shop). Many government offices — state and federal — were in the small buildings around Posey’s, forming a de facto public office sector of Reno. A block-square vacant lot that a thousand kids played ball in north of Wonder Street was owned by LaVere Redfield, the water table about four inches below the ground hampering its use as a building site until 1999. There was Cornwall Insurance Adjustors, and at the rhyming diners, Eato’s Burritos and Pat-Your-Belly-Deli, I draw the line.\n\nSouth Wells Avenue was a great street, and could be again. In the years following World War II, 37.2 percent of the schoolkids in Reno lived within two blocks of either side of the street and continue to harbor a fierce loyalty to it even today. The Wells Avenue Gang — a group formally organized a couple decades ago by the late and great Clark Santini — meets regularly and will probably read this and regale me, of the Whitaker Park bunch, with tales of their youth and their earliest gang activity in town.\n\nBut this is not a column validating their aberrant behavior, rather a plea for all to remember fondly the many businesses and merchants who populated South Wells Avenue, and congratulate the city for the redevelopment effort and all who do business there today.\n\nI ended that 2001 column with the following line that I’ll leave intact now: “The Reader-of-the-Week award goes to Debbie Hinman, who recently located yet another little all-metal El Reno Apartment at 326 W. 11th St., putting our search at 11 found out of 17 original units.” (And we’ve since found them all!)

New proposal weighs in.", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO – Each year, millions of majestic orange and black monarch butterflies make an extreme, multi-generational 3,000 mile migration across the United States, flocking to wintering grounds in California and Mexico. Beloved by children, the iconic species is instantly recognizable and found almost entirely in North America.\n\nThe fluttering insects could also be gone by the time today's grade-schoolers are grandparents.\n\nUnder current conditions, the butterflies are estimated to have a 99% chance of going extinct in the western part of the United States by 2080 and somewhere between a 56 and 74% chance of extinction in the east, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n\nWhich is why Fish & Wildlife has proposed listing the iconic insects as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n(Endangered species are considered close to extinction and get significant protection, while threatened species are considered on their way to being endangered – but aren't there yet. The threatened designation gives the government more leeway when working to protect a species.)\n\n“Despite its fragility, it is remarkably resilient, like many things in nature when we just give them a chance,” said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams.\n\nThe designation could help conservationists protect habitat critical to the brightly-colored butterflies' survival.\n\nIn a press release issued by the service, wildlife officials said public input is being sought until March 12, at which point the Fish and Wildlife Service will make a final decision about listing the species as threatened.\n\nThe final decision will be in the hands of the incoming Trump Administration. In 2020, during the first Trump administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service found that monarchs were threatened with extinction but did not list them because other species were more high-priority.\n\nIf you love monarchs, plant milkweed\n\nOne reason monarchs have struggled is that their primary food source, milkweed plants, is disappearing. Milkweed once commonly grew in rural areas across the nation but new herbicides, development and overall loss of habitat have significantly decreased the food source for the caterpillars that become monarchs.\n\nOne thing Americans who love monarchs can do is plant milkweed, said experts. It's the only plant that monarchs will lay their eggs on and is an important part of their diet.\n\n“This science-based decision is a national call to action for all Americans to save this majestic species by joining forces to plant native milkweed and nectar plants all across the nation – our yards, schools, parks, rights-of-way, businesses, places of worship, working lands, and so much more,” Collin O’Mara, president and CEO, National Wildlife Federation, said in the Fish and Wildlife release.\n\nThe pretty plant, which sports pink, purple or orange flowers, gets its name from the milky sap inside the stems and leaves.\n\nDespite its name, milkweed is not a weed but a wildflower, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nCommon milkweed, Asclepias syriaca, has a wide native range in the United States.

Because of the species’ general habitat use and wide distribution, all sectors of society have an opportunity to participate in a broad range of conservation efforts throughout the butterfly’s range,” the service said.\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

On Tuesday, the petitioners, a group called Wild Earth Guardians, filed a lawsuit complaining that the service was long overdue to respond to their petition.\n\nFish and Wildlife, part of the Department of the Interior, said Wednesday that it had determined that the Joshua tree's habitat is primarily on federally managed land, and has seen \"no major contraction in populations\" in the last 40 years. Joshua trees are found not only in California but also in Nevada and Arizona.\n\nFederal wildlife officials on Wednesday also declined to protect eight other species across the U.S., citing commercial and scientific data. The determinations come two days after the Trump administration unveiled changes to how the Endangered Species Act will be implemented, including ending a ban on considering economic impacts and decreeing that climate change impacts should not be considered.\n\nSecretary of the Interior David Bernhardt has called the changes “improvements to regulations\" and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has praised the changes, saying they would ease the regulatory burden on the American public.\n\nAgency: Joshua trees have 'enough resiliency'\n\nThe decision from the Fish and Wildlife Service's Carlsbad office reviewed the primary stressors to Joshua trees, among them wildfire, invasive plants, effects of climate change, and habitat loss. However, because the two species of Joshua tree, Yucca brevifolia and Yucca jaegeriana, still occupy their historical ranges of roughly 12 million acres, there is “enough resiliency in the population despite threats acting on them,” the service said. The species native to Joshua Tree National Park, Yucca brevifolia, has a historic range of 6.4 million acres, the service said.\n\nTaylor Jones, the biologist and advocate who authored the petition, expressed frustration with Wednesday's decision.\n\n“It appears that this administration is ignoring the science because they don’t believe in climate change,” Jones said. “This is blatant disregard of the climate crisis.”\n\nJones' petition cited climate models indicating the Joshua tree could lose roughly 90% of its habitat in the next 80 years, should the most severe climate conditions bear out. The gradual warming and drying of Southern California, which could see average maximum temperatures in July rise by as many as five or six degrees, could reduce the Joshua tree population in California to one small refuge in the center of Joshua Tree National Park.\n\nIt is unclear whether the agency agrees with the projections cited by Jones, though the findings state that “future stochastic and catastrophic events would not lead to population- or species-level declines in the foreseeable future.” A more detailed examination of the climate change impacts is still to be released, and will include the agency's own 80-year projections.\n\n“This administration has a history of climate-change denial,\" Jones said. \"President Trump called climate change a hoax, and Bernhardt discounted climate change when opening up public lands to oil and gas development. Denial of protections to Joshua trees fits that pattern.”\n\nChanges to the Endangered Species Act\n\nThis week's changes to the Endangered Species Act for the first time allow authorities to compile and review economic impacts of protecting a particular species during the review process; end blanket protections for animals newly deemed threatened; and reduce the scope of assessments during the listing review process. Instead of blanket protections for threatened species, officials said they will require “species-specific regulations for protective status.”*\n\nLegal challenges are expected by California and other states, as well as environmental groups.\n\n“Even as we suffer an extinction crisis and a climate emergency, the Trump administration continues to serve only narrow corporate interests,” said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “By shooting down protections for these imperiled plants and animals, Trump officials are displaying contempt for America’s natural heritage.\"\n\nMore:Joshua trees, monarch butterflies among species that may be impacted by Endangered Species Act change\n\nMore:Riverside County report deals blow to Paradise Valley, a proposed 'new town' near Joshua Tree park\n\nWednesday's decision on the Joshua tree was not made public as a result of Wild Earth Guardian's court filing on Tuesday, according to a Department of Fish and Wildlife spokesperson, Jane Hendron. Wild Earth Guardians said in a statement Wednesday it plans to file another lawsuit appealing Tuesday's decision.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) responded to Tuesday's announcement by saying: \"The iconic Joshua tree defines the California desert, but it could be lost forever if the administration has its way.\" Feinstein also criticized the Trump administration's rule changes for the Endangered Species Act.\n\nBee, mussels, blackbird also rejected\n\nBesides the Joshua tree, the Fish and Wildlife Service said Wednesday it would decline to extend protections to another tree, freshwater mussels, reptiles and insects across the United States.\n\nPetitioners were seeking protections for species including:\n\nthe Arapahoe snowfly\n\nthe brook floater and smooth pimpleback (two types mussels),\n\ngolden orb spider\n\nthe seaside alder, a tree\n\nthe tricolored blackbird\n\nthe yellow-banded bumble bee.\n\nThe agency asked the public \"to submit to us at any time” any new, relevant information on the status of the species or their habitats.\n\nCommercial as well as scientific information was used in the decisions not to protect the species, the federal agency said. Critics say economic impacts should not be allowed to outweigh biological and other research. Home developers, farmers and others have long argued that economics should be weighed as well.\n\nThe brook floater, a North American mussel, has historically been found from Georgia to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, clustered in sand pockets behind boulders and stream banks. The medium-sized mussel has been wiped out of approximately half of its U.S. locations, making the Canadian population “an important global stronghold for the species,” according to Fisheries and Oceans Canada. U.S. wildlife officials said there are also resilient populations in North Carolina and Maine.\n\nMore:Imperiled by climate change, Joshua trees could be declared a threatened species\n\nMore:How Minerva Hamilton Hoyt saved Joshua Tree park for future generations\n\nCalifornia’s tricolored blackbirds have declined by nearly 90% since the 1930s because of the destruction of wetlands and grasslands, pesticide use that wipes out their insect prey base and loss of nest sites during agricultural operations, environmentalists say. Federal officials said the fact that the bird is protected by California as an endangered species is adequate.\n\nYellow-banded bumblebees, once common in the American Midwest and East Coast and in southern Canada, have declined due to pesticide use and large swaths of habitat lost to development, conservationists say. Federal officials said: \"In the species’ current condition, there is occupancy across the majority of the yellow-banded bumble bee’s historical range.\"\n\nThe seaside alder tree lives in riparian and marshy areas in the East, where it may be threatened by salt-water intrusion via sea-level rise due to climate change. A separate population in Oklahoma is threatened by cattle grazing. But the tree has adequate, diverse habitat and populations, and is equipped to adapt to future change, the wildlife service said.\n\nThe Siskiyou Mountains salamander lives in the Klamath-Siskiyou region of Oregon and California, primarily in old-growth forests. It is threatened by U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management plans to increase logging, according to environmental biologists. Federal officials said that environmental groups had not presented \"substantial\" information to support their contention that fires, logging, mining and other factors were imperiling the salamander's existence.\n\nThree creatures — the golden orb spider, smooth pimpleback mussel and Arapahoe snowfly — were determined to no longer be genetically distinct species. Curry, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said the government appeared to have properly relied on science that determined they are subgroups of larger species.\n\nTrump has protected 18 species to date\n\nThe Endangered Species Act, signed by President Nixon in 1973, covers more than 1,600 species in the United States and its territories. The Trump administration has now protected 18 species and declined protections for more than 60 species, said Curry. Eighteen is the lowest number of species protected by any president this far into a first term, she said.\n\nDuring the eight years of the Obama administration, 360 species were protected under the Endangered Species Act. Under President Bill Clinton's two terms, 523 species were protected.\n\nUnder President George H.W. Bush, who served one term, 232 species were protected. Under President George W. Bush, who served two terms, 62 species were protected.\n\nDuring Ronald Reagan's eight-year presidency, 254 species were protected.\n\n*Clarification: This story has been clarified to explain more clearly about the role economic impacts will play in the Endangered Species Act process and how protections will be extended to species listed as threatened.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/01/19/no-longer-endangered-bald-eagles-still-closely-watched-connecticut/6511351001/", "title": "No longer endangered, bald eagles still closely watched in ...", "text": "Strapped with three Nikon cameras, Jeffrey Vlaun scanned the skies over the Norwich harbor last week, ready to capture shots of bald eagles in action.\n\n“I started looking about three weeks ago and noticed a few here and there and since then they built up to probably about a dozen,” Vlaun told The Bulletin.\n\nVlaun, a gaming commissioner at Foxwoods, has lived in Norwich since 1994 and said as a hobby he likes to take pictures of all types of birds; but his favorite are the birds of prey: owls, osprey, peregrine falcons, and, of course, bald eagles.\n\n“I just like watching them come in for the bunker [fish],\" he said. \"And they have been landing close, too: on poles at the marina; and you can actually see them eating a fish and taking off again.\"\n\nBrian Hess is the supervisor of the Wildlife Diversity Program at the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.

Adding to this, another 125 million acres are at risk in the foreseeable future as warming temperatures create opportunities for expanded agriculture in the Northern Great Plains, while woodland encroaches upon grasslands in the Southern Great Plains.\n\nBut the implications extend far beyond land loss, cultivating an even greater concern for native wildlife and the broader ecosystem.\n\n“Temperate grasslands are the most imperiled ecosystem on Earth,” said Kristy Bly, a restoration manager for the World Wildlife Fund’s Northern Great Plains program. “And outside of some recent efforts in our small world, they are overlooked.”\n\nCurrently, the Endangered Species Act identifies more than 50 species of prairie wildlife — predominantly native grasses, forbs and insects — as either endangered or threatened. Texas Parks and Wildlife further acknowledges more than 100 rare, endangered or threatened species on the High Plains, many of which do not formally receive federal protections, contradicting decades-long recommendations from conservationists and biologists.\n\nAmong those that are widely considered short-listed: the western burrowing owl, monarch butterfly, swift fox and black-tailed prairie dog, a keystone species that now occupies less than 2% of its historic range — a decline attributed to years of intentional poisoning for the purpose of agriculture and development.\n\nFurther, the National Audubon Society reports grassland bird populations have plummeted by 60 to 70% since the 1960s, while at the same time, native pollinators face alarming declines due to extensive habitat loss and changing weather patterns — and the ongoing use of neonicotinoid continues to jeopardize their survival.\n\nAlready, the black-footed ferret has been extirpated from Texas since the 1980s, and the Great Plains wolf and Plains grizzly bear have long been extinct.\n\nAnd experts say the crisis is only becoming more dire.\n\n“I think what it really boils down to is the choices of humans,” said Patrick Lendrum, senior science specialist for WWF’s Northern Great Plains program. “Are we going to coexist with wildlife? Where are we going to find space for ourselves and the wildlife around us? It truly is up to us of what that looks like.”\n\nPart One:Silent Plains: With a history of neglect, grasslands have become the forgotten ecosystem\n\nMore:Bison decline contributed to dwindling prairie landscape on Great Plains\n\nHuman impact and native grasslands\n\nOnce home to free-roaming herds of bison and leaping pronghorn, the Great Plains is now a shadow of its former self, embodying the story of disappearing wilderness in North American grasslands.\n\nFor decades, agricultural and ranching activities, energy development, and urban expansion have taken precedence over the imperative need for grassland conservation efforts, leading to habitat fragmentation and the near-collapse of a once-thriving landscape.\n\nBut most experts attribute the initial impacts to inventions of the Industrial Era that led to the rise in these industries and the removal of bison, one of the region's most ecologically essential species for their crucial role in maintaining the ecosystem through their grazing that facilitated seed and grass dispersion.\n\n“There are three inventions that made it possible for farmers to come out on the Plains,” said Mark Stoll, a professor in Texas Tech’s history department. “The railroad, the classic windmill and barbed wire. After these three inventions? You could say the West was doomed.”\n\nWhile the rapid decline of bison herds had its roots a century earlier, and the situation worsened as conflict escalated among Plains tribes and European settlers, Stoll said the introduction of the first transcontinental railroad further intensified the issue.\n\nThe railroad's construction not only disrupted bison routes, dividing them into northern and southern herds because of their reluctance to cross the tracks, but it also shifted the role of bison into a primary food source for railroad workers. Concurrently, commercial hunters clung to the opportunity afforded by the railroad's accessibility and slaughtered more than a million bison annually.\n\nBut beyond their impact on bison herds, the railroads played a pivotal role in increasing human settlement, contributing to the expansion of agricultural activities and overall development in the region.\n\nIn Texas, an 1854 law agreed that the state provided 16 sections of land — of 640 acres each — per every mile of railroad, according to the Texas State Historical Association, which they later sold to farmers.\n\nIn one attempt, a 1915 land promotional — issued by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company — boasts the profitability of the land and its iconic traits: tillable and rich soil; sufficient slope to curb flooding; watersheds and creeks; and little growth of trees and shrubbery.\n\n“Hence its readiness in adaptability to crops, without delay,” the promotional reads. “It has not infrequently occurred, on account of this very nature of the land, that crops of sufficient abundance have been produced upon the sod of the first year, to pay the purchase price of the land.”\n\nAs a result, much of the remaining prairies were rapidly converted into ranches and farms — and little of these claims stand true today.\n\nRussell Martin, who at the time was still serving as the wildlife diversity biologist for Texas Parks and Wildlife, also agreed that traditional agriculture was the most significant driver for the decline of grasslands. And in a paradox of its own making, he stressed the ongoing degradation of grasslands now endangers the very foundation upon which these industries depend.\n\n“The biggest issue is the large expanses of cropland,” Martin said. “When we convert large expanses of areas – entire counties – of pure cropland, then that creates a barrier for animals to be able to move from one grassland area to the next grassland area, because there is effectively a large desert-like area of not suitable habitat. Especially in this part of the world, that conversion from grassland to cropland at a large scale, and in large patches, that is the major driver of the habitat fragmentation, habitat loss and habitat degradation that we’re talking about.”\n\nAccording to WWF’s most recent Plowprint analysis, which utilized data from 2021, the Great Plains saw more than than 1.6 million acres converted into croplands in 2021 alone. Since 2009, 53 million acres have been converted to cropland. In total, plow-up has overtaken more than 32 million acres of grasslands since 2012, when WWF first began tracking grasslands conversion across the region.\n\nWhile WWF’s Bly and Lendrum both recognize the crucial role of conservation for the well-being of humanity, they also emphasize the importance of striking a balance between conservation and agriculture, especially in the Great Plains, which provides a sizable portion of the nation’s food and fiber.\n\n“I think a lot of (the public misperception) comes from a lack of connection from people understanding where their food comes from,” Bly said. “I think if there was an appreciation of where their beef comes from, where their corn and soy products come from, where their wheat comes from, then they would want to protect this ecosystem. That connection has been lost over time as we have moved into this urban industrialization era. And I think there is a responsibility to do that — to make those connections again.”\n\nIn addition to the consequences met from land conversion, Stoll added that the introduction of barbed wire and perimeter fences to protect crops and cattle also marked a pivotal turning point in the decline of grasslands.\n\nThese barriers hindered the mobility of grazers and other migratory species, disrupting historic movement patterns that had persisted for centuries across the plains and posing significant challenges in accessing forage and other necessary resources. As their traditional routes became obstructed, the local landscape saw increased biodiversity loss.\n\nBut in more recent years, as agriculture has slowed in the Southern Great Plains, population growth and increased fossil fuel production have further taxed the landscape, causing additional habitat loss for native species, including the lesser prairie-chicken and dunes sagebrush lizard.\n\nAt the same time, renewable energy sources are also not without their environmental footprints and can lead to significant habitat fragmentation, said Jon Hayes, who serves as the executive director for Audubon Southwest and vice president for the National Audubon Society.\n\nWith the U.S.'s proposed target of transitioning the nation's power to 80% renewable energy by 2030, in an attempt to reduce air pollution, concern of their environmental impact strengthens.\n\nFor instance, large-scale solar farms occupy vast spaces of land and leave limited resources available for wildlife. A 2019 study conducted by the Yale Center for Business and the Environment indicates that utility-scale solar development is projected to have a land footprint of 3 million acres by 2030, posing challenges to habitat of thousands of species.\n\nIn wind energy, there are (mostly fruitless) concerns about bird collisions, but a more pressing issue, Hayes said, is that turbine maintenance activities can inadvertently introduce invasive plants and shrubs to grasslands during travel, further disrupting the natural ecosystem necessary for native species.\n\nSpecies at the Heart of Debate\n\nAmid the sweeping landscapes of grasslands, certain species have emerged as focal points in a decades-long debate between industry experts and conservationists. Now, these creatures find themselves entangled in a complex web of interests — and their fate intertwined between economic pursuits and environmental conservation.\n\nThe lesser prairie-chicken, for instance, stands as a stark example with its population plummeting by 97% in recent decades. Inhabiting primarily the Permian Basin — the hotbed of the nation's petroleum production — this species has ignited a longstanding battle between conservationists and fossil fuel stakeholders.\n\nSince it was initially proposed for federal listing in 1995, there's been a series of listing and delisting conditions, court mandates and fruitless recovery endeavors. The most recent attempt to overturn the species’ federal protections took place in April when the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources voted to use the Congressional Review Act to delist the species.\n\nCongress votes to delist lesser-prairie chicken, but Biden veto threat looms\n\nDuring the April 27 markup, Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, remarked his doubts on the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act — a belief consistent with much of the Republican party's long-standing criticism of the legislation’s impact on industry and private property rights.\n\n\"The Endangered Species Act is an important part of our history, but it's also an outdated part of our history,\" Westerman said, noting the law was established in the 1970s. \"I believe we have an incredible responsibility to steward our rich diversity of wildlife here in America and care for them in ways that allow them to flourish for generations to come. But I disagree with my colleagues when they are adamant that listing a species is the only way to ensure its survival. In fact, we've seen the opposite is often true.\" (The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service disputed the claim.)\n\nThe chairperson cited examples to align with his assertion, including the scenario of the West Coast-based three-inch fish, which, according to Westerman, has received millions of dollars in federal funding but has seen little benefit in species recovery.\n\nHe had also pointed out that federal protections of the northern spotted owl have not benefited the survival of the species, which is losing habitat to wildfire. Over the last several decades, wildfires have increased in frequency and severity around the globe. Experts primarily attribute these natural disasters to climate change, which research shows is a direct impact of fossil fuel production.\n\nIn May, all 49 Republican senators, including Texas' Sen. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, supported the resolution to delist the species. U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia was the sole Democrat to vote in favor, resulting in a Senate vote of 50-48.\n\nA parallel trend emerged in Congress, with a vote of 217-206, in which every affirmative vote for advancing the proposal came from Republicans.\n\nAfter garnering approval from both, President Joe Biden vetoed the resolution in late September, underscoring the deep-seated divisions surrounding the species’ conservation status.\n\nA White House statement ahead of the decision read: \"Overturning common-sense protections for the lesser prairie-chicken would undermine America’s proud wildlife conservation traditions, risk the extinction of a once-abundant American bird, and create uncertainty for landowners and industries who have been working for years to forge the durable, locally led conservation strategies that this rule supports.\"\n\nSimilarly embroiled in controversy is the dunes sagebrush lizard, a species whose need for federal safeguards was identified by conservationists over four decades ago, particularly due to its proximity to West Texas oilfields.\n\nIn July, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed federal listing of the species under the Endangered Species Act, and in a swift response, U.S. Rep. August Pfluger, R-San Angelo, introduced the \"Limiting Incredulous Zealots Against Restricting Drilling\" Act, or the LIZARD Act, which sought to curtail federal oversight, shifting the responsibility for safeguarding the species to individual and industry-led initiatives.\n\n“On the campaign trail, President (Joe) Biden promised to kill the fossil fuel industry, and that’s about the only promise we can count on him keeping,\" Pfluger stated in the news release announcing the LIZARD Act. \"His latest tactic — listing the dunes sagebrush lizard as an endangered species so he can shut down drilling in the Permian — is just the latest in a string of assaults on the Permian Basin and our way of life. The President wants to control private property in Texas. Not on my watch. My legislation protects energy security and jobs in the Permian by nullifying his latest attack.\"\n\nThe species was first proposed for listing in 2010, according to Defenders of Wildlife, but advocates began to cast light on the species' dire situation in the early-1980s.\n\nLocated only in the Permian Basin, critics believe the government's hesitance to offer federal protections stems partly from political pressure from fossil fuel interests, which are largely to blame for the lizard's endangerment.\n\n“Like too many other species, this little imperiled lizard found itself in the middle of a very large fight over what should have been reliance on best available science and not pressures from private interests,” Andrew Carter, Director of Conservation Policy for Defenders of Wildlife, said at the time.\n\nPollinators in Peril\n\nNorth American prairies are among some of the most intricate and diverse ecosystems on the planet – interconnected by thousands of fauna and flora species. But that number declines as the landscape increasingly battles habitat degradation from human activity.\n\nWith hundreds of grass, forb and shrub species, the richness in the landscape’s biodiversity, in a way, has masked the decline of some significant species populations – particularly pollinators – said Vikram Baliga, who is the manager of Texas Tech's Greenhouse and Horticultural Gardens and an assistant professor of practice in plant and soil sciences.\n\nNative bees, beetles, wasps, flies and butterflies serve a crucial role in the Great Plains, where they contribute to the successful cultivation of crops – ranging from vegetables and fruit to fiber. Yet, these pollinators bear some of the greatest pressure from the very industry that depends on their services most.\n\nA recent study in Science Advances stated that pollinator insects have shrunk by 61% due to the “interactive combination of agriculture and climate change,” which have resulted in a decline in habitat of flowering plants and warmer-than-usual temperatures. The use of neonicotinoids also threatens pollinator services and, consequently, native biodiversity.\n\n“A resilient, strong ecosystem has a lot of checks and balances,” Baliga said. “There is so much diversity in our native ecosystems, that the long-term decline (of some native pollinator species) was maybe not noticed as readily, because there were backup species. Think of it as a Jenga tower. You pull a couple blocks, and the tower keeps standing so you don’t really notice. Eventually, you pull the wrong one and the whole thing collapses.”\n\nIn the Great Plains, the most notable “backup species,” Baliga said, is the honeybee, which is nonnative and was introduced to the U.S. as, essentially, livestock in the 1600s.\n\nAs local habitats shrink due to land conversion, managed honeybees and native bees have less space to interact and acquire resources, yet honeybees have a broader diet and can feed on a wide variety of plants while approximately 20 to 45% of native pollinators, such as bees, rely solely on native flora and specialized host plants.\n\nAt the same time, while honeybees are important in the production of numerous crops, they comparatively play a more restricted role in pollinating native plants, and as generalists, could potentially aid in the reproduction and spread of invasive plant species.\n\nAnother insect that depends on flowering plant diversity is the monarch butterfly, where the last couple of decades have seen sharp declines in the sizes of overwintering populations in overwintering grounds in central Mexico.\n\nWhile the precise magnitude of their decline remains a subject of debate, expert opinions range from a concerning 30% to a staggering 90% since the 1990s.\n\nAs a candidate species, the future of the iconic species continues to await an official listing from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2024. Yet, even before this official verdict, some conservation organizations have already designated the species as endangered, including the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nRegardless of these differing official statuses, there is a widespread consensus among experts: the monarch butterfly remains in jeopardy.\n\nMartin acknowledged that a multitude of factors have contributed to the decline of the monarch butterfly, citing urban development, drought, and the impending climate crisis as significant drivers.\n\n“But what’s really driving their decline is definitely habitat loss and degradation,” Martin previously told the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. “There’s a bunch of stuff that contributed to the (long-term) decline, like the conversion of grassland to agriculture that happened in the Midwest several hundreds of years ago. But in the last 30 years, there’s been more and more herbicide and pesticide use as our farms have become more commercialized.\n\n“And there’s really been a steep decline in the species over the last 20 or so years,” he added.\n\nAs the urgency to protect pollinators grows, experts like Baliga are reevaluating the narrative that has surrounded them for the past several decades.\n\nFor instance, while the widespread motto to \"save the bees\" has been a vital call to action, it has inadvertently overshadowed other native pollinator species, each with their unique ecological roles. This skewed focus, Baliga said, has created unforeseen challenges for less spotlighted yet equally essential bees.\n\n“I think the way that we have talked about pollinators over the last 30 years is good in some ways, but it’s also been really detrimental to pollinator health and pollinator biodiversity,” Baliga said. “Because when people say, ‘Save the bees,’ everyone thinks of honeybees. But the fact is, we have dozens of species of native bees, and when you have this narrow host range for something like a little native sweat bee or a squash bee, all those feeding sites are already full of honeybees and that creates a lot of competition. It’s putting pressure on already vulnerable species.\n\n“I don’t think it’s bad that we’ve spent 30 years talking about the honeybees. We have to get people interested, and some of these charismatic fauna and charismatic plants are their door into it and makes them care, and caring is important. I think we just need to be telling the rest of the story,” he added.\n\nRestoring the landscape\n\nMost experts agree that it's not plausible for North American grasslands to ever return to their original state. But their optimism remains in the idea that preserving small patches of prairie can still serve a meaningful purpose, often underestimated by many.\n\n“The problem is that prairies have a PR problem,” Baliga said. “I think if we want to make sure we get to keep experiencing this planet and being a part of this planet, then we have to take some big steps and be aggressive with the way that we alter our own lives. Around here, a lot of that starts with prairie restoration and pollinator management and reduction in pesticide use.”\n\nPlus, as restoration efforts increasingly unfold, he said there are many additional facets to consider — ranging from the impacts of increasing temperatures on native species to the accessibility of seed for historic flora.\n\nOverall, he said he has noticed an upward trend in restoration practices as more of the population begins to recognize the importance of native prairie.\n\n“We’ve done a great job over the last 30 years,” Baliga said. “And we’re making progress.\n\nAs a conservationist and rancher in Central Texas, David Hillis, director of the University of Texas' College of Natural Sciences, shared a similar optimism while acknowledging the cultural and economic significance of the agriculture industry, particularly in Texas.\n\nHillis noted there is a positive trend in the industry as ranches and landholdings begin to recognize the significance of grasslands and shift toward more sustainable practices.\n\n“We’re actually turning the corner and are making some progress on bringing grasslands back,” Hillis said. “They’re critical for lots of reasons. They’re important for biodiversity. They’re important for water filtration. They recharge our aquifers. They’re important for carbon storage and carbon sequestrations. There are just lots and lots of reasons why grasslands are critical. And we have hammered grasslands enormously in the last 100 years, so now the question is: What’s the future hold?”\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has also increased emphasis on sustainable agriculture, encouraging farmers and ranchers to promote environmental stewardship through a range of conservation practices, including integrated pest management, crop diversity, agroforestry — which can serve as windbreaks and buffer strips for native pollinators — and several soil conservation methods, including strip cropping, reduced tillage and no-till.\n\nHillis added that rotational grazing of cattle — now the region's primary grazers — is also essential for maintaining the health of prairie ecosystems by preventing overgrowth and promoting biodiversity, which in turn, can provide habitat and sustenance for a portfolio of wildlife from small insects to large mammals. A recent study by the USDA Economic Reserve Service revealed that 49% of ranchers and cattle producers in the Northern Plains and Western Corn Belt and 25% in the Southern Plains have already adopted rotational grazing.\n\nAdditionally, many in the industry believe the practice of regenerative agriculture, which emphasizes crop rotation and reduced ploughing, is the solution that will promote a paradigm shift. Though the concept has become riddled in controversy among scientists in recent years, due to its failure to prove itself a long-term solution for soil carbon capture, it does serve other ecological benefits, including land preservation and reduced water usage.\n\n“It’s not all hopeless,” Hillis said. “I think there is a lot of potential for bringing grasslands back. People are now aware of the importance of grasslands and the beauty of grasslands. So, I do think there’s some hope for the future.”\n\nEchoing a similar sentiment, Bly and Lendrum also shared a message of hope.\n\nThrough WWF’s initiatives alone, they aim to conserve a minimum of 100,000 acres of native grasslands and restore at least 150,000 acres of degraded habitat to ensure the preservation and connectivity of these vital prairie lands.\n\nAlready, they have seen progress in their efforts.\n\nNot only are they hopeful in the work they pursue in WWF’s Northern Great Plains Program, but they highlight the important roles of other organizations that value the importance of U.S. prairies and grasslands, such as Defenders of Wildlife, the Center for Biological Diversity and Audubon.\n\n“There are already a lot of great stewards of the land out there that have enabled the return of species,” Lendrum said. “But we have to recognize that the Great Plains will never be the American Serengeti that it was.”\n\nThis story is part of the ongoing 'Silent Plains' series by the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal on the disappearance of grasslands and the long-term implications of biodiversity loss and wildlife loss in West Texas and the broader Great Plains.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2020/01/22/colorado-river-grand-canyon-endangered-species-list-humpback-chub/4531481002/", "title": "Wildlife agency proposes to move humpback chub off endangered ...", "text": "A key Colorado River native fish, long seen as a bellwether of ecological health in the Grand Canyon, may soon be moved off the endangered species list.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Monday it was proposing to reclassify the humpback chub as \"threatened.\"\n\nThe fish, a member of the minnow family that has survived and thrived in the warm, muddy waters of the Colorado for up to 5 million years, would retain some protections under the law, but not at the same level.\n\nThe announcement was met with skepticism by at least one environmental group, which said the fish was still at great risk. Wildlife managers, by contrast, said the move was an example of a success story on the river that reduced the chub's threat of extinction.\n\nThe humpback chub, which was placed on the endangered species list in 1973, is one of 43 endangered or threatened species in Arizona. It’s also one of two endangered fish species within the Grand Canyon, and the only chub species left within the Canyon.\n\nOnce abundant, the chub and the seven other fish species native to the Canyon were devastated by dam building, overfishing and the introduction of popular game fish such as trout and smallmouth bass, which have put the chubs and other Grand Canyon fish on their menus.\n\nThe chub also requires specific water temperatures for reproductive success. The Fish and Wildlife Service said the greatest hatching success for chub eggs is around 68 degrees. Water released through Glen Canyon Dam can cause river temperatures to plummet to an average of 46 degrees, leaving chub eggs to freeze and the unhatched fish to perish.\n\nThree other native species — the Colorado pikeminnow, the bonytail and the roundtail chub — are no longer living in the Grand Canyon. All fell victim to human-caused changes to the Colorado’s ecosystem.\n\n'Moving in the right direction'\n\nThe fish, with its distinctive hump that acts as a hydrological stabilizer much like a spoiler enhances a sports car's performance, once faced near-extinction, even after federal protections were enacted.\n\nAfter chub numbers dropped precipitously, with one population dropping to about 2,100 individuals in the 1990s, the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program, a consortium of 14 government and private entities, created a new plan to conserve and revitalize the fish.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service noted that the largest humpback chub population, which lives around the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers, has stabilized at about 12,000 adults.\n\n“The proposed downlisting is a demonstration of success for the collaboration,” said Tom Chart, director of the upper Colorado fish recovery program.\n\nThe program’s goal is to restore the humpback chub and three other fish species in the highly regulated Colorado river system.\n\n“We’re moving in the right direction,” said Chart. “The chub is not at danger of extinction now.”\n\nIn addition to the confluence population, biologists also have identified smaller populations living in other tributaries in the Grand Canyon.\n\nFour other populations are in the Colorado's Upper Basin, including the Green and Yampa rivers, but they exist in far fewer numbers.\n\nChart said scientists are getting a better handle on how flow management and interactions with non-native fish work to conserve humpback chub populations. Also, he said, the chub are moving into the western reaches of the Canyon. Coupled with flow management and non-native fish control, as well as efforts to increase insect food stocks for fish, growth of the humpback chub’s numbers led to the decision to move the fish’s protection status down a level, Chart said.\n\n“It’s a huge success story,” said Julie Carter, statewide native aquatics program manager for the Arizona Game and Fish Department, one of the recovery program’s partners. “This reflects a tremendous amount of work that biologists have done over the years all throughout the basin.”\n\nCarter said the proposed action by the Fish and Wildlife Service would be the first like it for an Arizona fish since 2006 when the Gila trout was moved from the endangered species list to threatened status.\n\nBoth Carter and Chart said conservation and protection efforts would continue and the humpback chub's recovery plan would continue to be implemented.\n\nFish still an indicator of river's health\n\nTaylor McKinnon, senior public lands campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity, was more doubtful about the feds’ request.\n\n“This fish has been here for millions of years, but the last 100 years have been catastrophic for the Colorado River’s ecosystem,” he said. “We’ve seen many fish species pushed to the brink of extinction.”\n\nMcKinnon said the chub’s remaining Upper Colorado River Basin populations are all in decline despite the success of the Little Colorado River population. One population of humpback chub in Dinosaur National Monument recently died out, McKinnon said.\n\nChart said the extirpation was due to marginalized habitat in the Green River upstream of the monument after construction of Flaming Gorge Dam on the Wyoming-Utah border. He added that program managers are considering a chub re-introduction into a nearby reservoir in Colorado.\n\nThe chub community at the Little Colorado River confluence could be imperiled by a proposal to build two dams on the Little Colorado River for electric generation, McKinnon said. “That proposal is still active,” he said.\n\n“The chub’s presence in the Colorado River is very important,” said McKinnon. “If we measure the ecological integrity of the Colorado’s system writ large, one of the primary measures of that is the extent to which its original species can still persist.\n\n“The Colorado River without Colorado River fish is not a desirable future.”\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service will accept comments on its proposed downlisting through March 23.\n\nREAD MORE: How the humpback chub reflect the health of the river\n\nReach the reporter at debra.krol@AZCentral.com or at 602-444-8490.

The source of their elimination is primarily human activity — the upsetting of natural evolutionary changes through habitat destruction, pollution, over-hunting and -fishing, and, potentially most devastatingly, climate change.\n\nWe can expect extinction numbers to grow at an unprecedented rate as human populations spread and the earth gets hotter. Two years ago, the United Nations sounded the alarm, warning that a million species of plants and animals around the world, out of eight million existing today, were threatened with extinction, and that climate change has accelerated the rate at which they will leave the face of the earth entirely.\n\nThe U.N. estimates that 75% of land environments and 66% of marine environments have already been altered by human activity, causing a 20% reduction in the abundance of land animals, as well as a potential reduction in fish biomass of up to 25% by the end of the century.\n\nFor the United States, the picture is less gloomy, at least for the immediate future, thanks to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), passed in 1973, which lists endangered and threatened species and provides for their protection and restoration. The law has, thus far, been a brilliant success, with 99% of listed species brought back from the edge of extinction. Most of the American animals now considered extinct, including many on the most recent list, died off before the enactment of the ESA.\n\nWhat the ESA has taught us is that we can take effective action to slow extinction rates through sound management of human activities as they affect animal populations and habitat. Without such vigilance, animal species whose existence we have come to take for granted could disappear forever.\n\nTo determine the most threatened animals in every state, 24/7 Tempo reviewed the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service’s Environmental Conservation Online System to find two animals listed as “endangered” that are native to each state.

(In September, the Obama administration designated seven species of bees in Hawaii as endangered.)\n\nEnvironmental group sues Trump over delay of listing bee as endangered\n\nNamed for the rust-colored marks on its back, the bee was once common and abundant across 28 states from Connecticut to South Dakota. Today, the species is only found in small, scattered populations in 13 states.\n\nBees are responsible for pollinating most of the plants that require insect pollination to produce fruits, seeds and nuts. Like other bees, rusty patched bumblebees pollinate important crops such as tomatoes, cranberries and peppers.\n\nThe special designation is made under the Endangered Species Act for species at risk of becoming extinct throughout all or a portion of their range. The status helps protect and conserve habitats and punishes people or companies found in violation.\n\nPeople can help boost the rusty patched bumblebee population by growing a garden or adding a native flowering tree or shrub to yards and minimizing pesticide use, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said.\n\nLeaving some areas of the yard unmowed in summer and unraked in fall can also help since bumblebees need a safe place to build their nests and overwinter.

The bat is on both the federal and state endangered species lists.\n\nThe discovery prompted federal officials to ask for a study, estimated to cost $30,000, to determine whether the Indiana bat population would be harmed by the interchange construction .\n\n\"We don't find (the bats) everywhere because there's not a lot of them out there,\" said Kraig McPeek, assistant supervisor of the Rock Island, Ill., field office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. \"Occasionally they come back that you do catch Indiana bats, and you basically have to look at ways to avoid impacting that population.\"\n\nThe bat was discovered in a similar study for a different West Des Moines project last fall. Additional Indiana bats have been found along the Raccoon River.\n\nThe U.S. Indiana bat population has decreased by half, to 387,000, since the species was first put on the endangered species list in 1967, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The bats are important to the ecological system because of the large number of nighttime insects they devour.\n\nThe discovery of the bat will not derail plans for the interchange; however, the discovery comes as the cities were preparing to begin work on a final design. Officials hope to have the interchange under construction later this year.\n\nCity officials are frustrated, West Des Moines Mayor Steve Gaer said.\n\n\"It's coming up at the last hour where this bat was found five-eighths of a mile from the site, and now all of the sudden they want to bring this site into the analysis,\" Gaer said. \"It seems to me that it's so far away, why bring this site into it, but they've got the ability to request that we do that.\"\n\nThe bat often flies one to three miles looking for food.\n\nThe new bat study will likely occur during a week in mid-May, when Indiana bats return to their roosting spots after hibernating for the winter, West Des Moines City Manager Greg Sparks said. Mist nets will be set up near the interchange site overnight, and if bats are located, they will be tagged and tracked to determine where they are roosting, said McPeek, of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nIndiana bats typically roost in the bark of dead or dying trees. If they are found to be living in trees near the interchange site, the cities will have to work with state and federal environmental officials to determine the best way to accommodate the bats.\n\nThat likely could mean cutting down trees during the winter, when bats are hibernating in other areas, or finding ways to construct the interchange in a way that will not impact the trees in which bats are roosting. Often, new trees will be planted to make up for those removed in construction.\n\nHaving to work out such changes could take an extra three to five months, Gaer said.\n\nScott Marler, environmental resources manager for the Iowa Department of Transportation, said the state has faced Indiana bat issues on two other projects in the past five years.\n\nLinda Robel, a West Des Moines resident who lives near where the new interchange will be built, questioned why the study was not conducted sooner.\n\n\"Why wasn't this done before they've spent all this money and all this time on design instead of waiting to discover that there's one bat in the way ... that could change everything and make everything more expensive?\" Robel asked.\n\nWest Des Moines City Engineer Duane Wittstock said officials did not know the bats could be an issue until the one was found near Mills Civic.\n\n\"If they hadn't found that bat across the road, it would probably be clear sailing at this point,\" Wittstock said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/03/05"}]}

LaReau\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nGeneral Motors is pivoting from self-driving robotaxies to focus on developing autonomous driving technology for personal vehicles in the future.\n\nThe company made the announcement late Tuesday afternoon, with GM spokesman Kevin Kelly telling the Detroit Free Press that GM sees a better business opportunity with personal vehicle autonomy rather than building a robotaxi fleet with its San Francisco-based self-driving subsidiary Cruise.\n\nThe automaker said it will combine Cruise, of which GM is majority owner, and GM technical teams into a single effort to advance autonomous and assisted driving in personal cars. As a result, GM said it will no longer fund Cruise’s robotaxi development, given the considerable time and resources needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\n\n“GM is committed to delivering the best driving experiences to our customers in a disciplined and capital-efficient manner,” CEO Mary Barra said in a media statement. “Cruise has been an early innovator in autonomy, and the deeper integration of our teams, paired with GM’s strong brands, scale and manufacturing strength, will help advance our vision for the future of transportation.”\n\nConsiderable cost savings\n\nThe news comes after GM spent much of the earlier part of this year telling Wall Street that Cruise was inching closer to restarting its driverless robotaxi business. Cruise had halted all services and recalled its vehicles in 2023 after an incident in October of that year in San Francisco. A vehicle hit a pedestrian, pushing her into an oncoming Cruise self-driving car, which then dragged her several feet, leaving the woman critically injured.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nBut in May of this year GM said Cruise resumed supervised autonomous driving in Phoenix. As of June, Cruise was operating fleets in Dallas and Houston as well.\n\nBut GM had been spending about $2 billion a year supporting Cruise and has never had a return on its investment since buying Cruise in 2016. GM expects this restructuring to lower its spending by more than $1 billion annually after the proposed plan is completed, which is expected in the first half of 2025.\n\nDuring an investor call Tuesday, CFO Paul Jacobson said GM, which owns about 90% of Cruise, has agreements with other minor stakeholders to sell their shares and raise GM's ownership to more than 97%. The company is in negotiations and will purchase the remaining shares next year, he said.\n\nMore details to be worked out\n\nGM will work with Cruise CEO Marc Whitten, Chief Technology Officer Mo Elshenawy and President Craig Glidden to restructure Cruise's operations, Barra said, noting the move is contingent upon the repurchase of the shares and Cruise board approval. Asked how many Cruise employees will come over to GM, Barra said those details still need to be worked out, but Jacobson indicated this pivot has been long considered.\n\n\"Over the past year we’ve been assessing our self-driving strategy,\" Jacobson said during the investor call. He said the company realized that to continue down the path of deploying, maintaining and operating a robotaxi fleet would require a heavy capital investment on top of \"the $10 billion we've already invested in it.\"\n\n“The better use is to pursue improvements to L3 and ultimately in L4 in a personal model because that’s more aligned with the capital and working needs of the business going forward,\" Jacobson said.\n\nGM will build on the technology currently offered in its hands-free driving system called Super Cruise, which is available on 20 of its models. Super Cruise is Level 2 (or L2) autonomous technology, which means the driver can be hands-free, but is still responsible for the vehicle while the system is active. Level 3 means the car can handle some driving on its own, but a driver must be ready to take control at any time. Level 4 is when the car can do most of the driving on its own.\n\n“You have to understand the cost of running a robotaxi fleet, which is fairly significant, and it’s not our core business,\" Barra said. \"The technology has developed such that ... we’ve seen an opportunity where we think we can work more quickly with focusing on personal autonomous vehicles and bringing the teams together.\"\n\nThe competition in the robotaxi market was heating up. Google’s Waymo unit, which is partnered with Uber, was running ride-hailing and taxi services that use human drivers. Also, Tesla announced plans earlier this fall for new driverless vehicles that would not contain steering wheels, brakes or accelerators. Tesla also had plans to offer a robotaxi service where Tesla owners could rent out their cars to it when they are not driving the vehicles.\n\nAuto safety:GM recalls over 132,000 Chevrolet, GMC trucks over tailgate issue: See affected models\n\nOther GM moves to gain efficiency\n\nThe change follows GM's other shifts in strategy announced recently. Earlier this month, GM said it will sell back its investment in a battery cell plant being built in Lansing to its Ultium Cells joint venture partner LG Energy Solution. The move is in line with Barra's comments to investors earlier this fall that the company is becoming increasingly prudent in its capital allocation to align production capacity with demand. That sale is expected to return about $1 billion to the automaker.\n\nFollowing that news, GM said it will record a total of nearly $5 billion in charges against its fourth-quarter adjusted pretax earnings because of its struggling operations in China. GM is in the midst of a massive restructuring of its operations in China to reduce costs, operate more efficiently and better match its vehicle portfolio to consumer demand there. GM has a 50-50 joint venture in China with SAIC Motor Corp. The joint venture is called Shanghai General Motors or SGM. SGM makes and sells Chevrolet, Buick, and Cadillac vehicles in the Chinese market.\n\nChina is GM's second most important market, behind the United States, and is the world's largest auto market. GM's business has been under pressure there for several years now due to a rapid rise in electric vehicles, increased regulations and new domestic competitors entering the market.\n\nIn November, GM cut a total of about 1,000 salaried and hourly employees as part of the new salaried employee ranking system as well as the \"normal course of business\" to achieve better operating efficiency. At that time, GM said it will also stop using its Yuma Desert Proving Grounds in Arizona for hot-weather vehicle testing, ending 33 jobs. Additionally, GM is permanently closing its Durability, Corrosion and Teardown departments at its Milford Proving Grounds in Michigan. The latter resulted in 44 UAW-represented hourly employees and 16 salaried employees being permanently laid off.\n\nContact Jamie L. LaReau: jlareau@freepress.com. Follow her on Twitter @jlareauan.

It recently began offering driverless rides on freeways in that city.\n\nAs the Detroit Free Press has reported, GM has invested about $8 billion in Cruise since 2016. Cruise leaders had at one point promised to deliver $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but the subsidiary has not made any money yet. Last month, GM CEO Mary Barra reiterated to Wall Street that the relaunch of Cruise safely, \"while delivering strong margins and cash flows,\" is a top priority for GM this year.\n\nSettlement Offer:GM's Cruise offers a settlement to California regulators over pedestrian accident\n\nGM CFO Paul Jacobson has said the company expects to spend $1.7 billion on Cruise operations this year, down slightly from GM’s spend on Cruise in previous years of around $2 billion.\n\nThe fallout from that Oct. 2 accident has resulted in regulators suspending Cruise from further operations in San Francisco. That was followed by Cruise opting to suspend all its operations nationwide. Cruise has since fired nine executives and cut about 24% or 900 full-time employees from its workforce. Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt and co-founder and Chief Product Officer Dan Kan resigned, and Barra said in November that GM will be doing \"substantially lower spending\" on Cruise in 2024 than it did in 2023.\n\nGM leaders remain firm that the automaker still supports Cruise's mission.\n\nContact Jamie L.

And the drop in value of Ford’s investment in Argo caused it to take a $2.7 billion charge in the just-completed third quarter. That resulted in an $827 million loss in the period.\n\nEven excluding the special charges for Argo and other items, Ford reported adjusted earnings per share of 30 cents, a slide from the 51 cents it earned on that basis a year ago, but a slight improvement over the 27 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.\n\nFord reported automotive revenue of $37.2 billion, a jump of $4 billion from a year ago and $1 billion more than the analysts’ forecasts. The revenue was helped by a $3.4 billion from higher pricing on vehicles.\n\nFord did have some problems in the quarter beyond the charge it took for closing down Argo. It said supply shortages left it with about 40,000 vehicles in its inventory at the end of the quarter that were built but awaiting needed parts before they can be shipped to dealers.\n\nIt also was hit with $1 billion in higher-than-expected supplier payments, and a $1.5 billion increase in commodity costs.\n\nAnd it had a smaller profit and profit margin in its core North American market due to those higher commodity costs, and a loss in China, due to costs associated with the development of electric vehicles.\n\nWhile higher pricing on vehicles helped its European unit post a narrow profit in the quarter compared to a narrow loss a year ago, CEO Jim Farley did concede, “Our performance in China and Europe is not nearly as healthy as we’d like it to be.”\n\nBut, in good news, Ford raised its goal for full-year cash that will be generated by the business to be between $9.5 billion and $10 billion — up from $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion — on strength in the company’s automotive operations.\n\nShares of Ford (F) were down 1% in after-hours trading following the earnings news.\n\nBut in the end, the big news of the earnings report was a major change in direction on self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe company insists it still expects to offer full self-driving vehicles in the future, just not soon enough to make the investment such technology will require today. It said it decided it is better to invest in driver assistance technology that is closer to being implemented on vehicles today, and that customers want from their new cars, rather than a fleet of robo-taxis with no drivers at all aboard.\n\n“We’re optimistic about a future for L4 ADAS [advanced driver assistance systems], but profitable, fully autonomous vehicles at scale are a long way off and we won’t necessarily have to create that technology ourselves,” said Farley.\n\nFarley said he expects to be able to find jobs for many of the Argo employees at Ford, having them switch gears to develop L3 driver assistance features.\n\n“That’s really the decision, in many ways, that is driving what we’re doing here at Argo… we are deeply passionate about the L3 mission,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief advanced product development and technology officer.\n\nHe said there is only so much talent available to develop the different driver assistance and self-driving features.\n\n“So this is the way we want to use that talent,” he said.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Matt Mcfarland Peter Valdes-Dapena", "Chris Isidore", "Matt Mcfarland", "Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/business/renault-moskvich/index.html", "title": "Russia needs cars, so it's rebooting this Soviet-era brand | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter Renault announced its departure this week from the Russian auto market amid the country’s war with Ukraine, Moscow’s mayor announced its factory will be used to restart the defunct Soviet-era Moskvich car brand.\n\nLittle known outside the former Soviet Union and its satellite countries, Moskvich was founded around 1930 and operated until 1991. As with many car brands from Communist bloc countries, Moskvich struggled with quality problems. The Muskovich 408 of the 1960s, which had a 50-horsepower engine, was even cited by Soviet officials for numerous defects, according to the book “Cars for Comrades” by Lewis Siegelbaum.\n\nThe author describes it, simply, as a “terrible car.”\n\nDespite these persistent issues, the Soviet government entered into an agreement with French automaker Renault, to modernize the factory and increase output to 200,000 cars by 1975, according to the book. Production ended as the Soviet Union dissolved and Western automakers, like Renault, moved in. A portion of a former Moskvich factory reopened in 2005 as a joint venture between Renault and the city of Moscow.\n\nRenault had also owned a controlling interest in Avtovaz, parent company of the popular Russian car brand Lada. In its statement this week, Renault said that controlling interest was sold to the government of Russia, while its controlling interest in the Moscow factory, where Renault vehicles were made, was sold to the city of Moscow. Renault left open the possibility of a return to the Russian market later.\n\n“The foreign owner has decided to close the Moscow Renault factory. This is their right, however, we cannot allow the several thousand strong workforce to find themselves unemployed,” Moscow’s mayor Sergei Sobyanin, wrote in a blog post, which was translated by CNN Business. “Therefore, I have made a decision to record the plant as a city asset and resume the production of passenger cars under the historical Moskvich brand.”\n\n“In 2022, we are turning a new page in the history of Moskvich,” Sobyanin added.\n\nThe company will try to keep all the plant’s current employees working there, the mayor wrote. The factory will also try to get most of the cars’ parts from Russian firms. The factory will begin by producing conventional gasoline-powered cars but, as some point, will switch to making electric cars, according to Sobyanin’s blog post.\n\nSobyanin did not specify what vehicle models would be built under the Moskvich name at the former Renault factory in the near future, however.\n\nMoskvich traces its roots to what are considered some of the first Soviet-designed cars from the 1920s and 30s. Following World War II, the company began producing cars under the Moskvich name, which means “Muscovite,” or a native of Moscow.\n\nToday, about 200,000 Moskvich cars are still registered in Russia, according to the Autostat analytical agency.\n\nGenerally speaking, cars produced in the centrally controlled economies of the Soviet Union and its satellite nations were not known for their quality.\n\nSome cars made in Communist bloc countries, such as the East German Trabant, found cult followings in the West. The Trabant’s body was made from a material called Duroplast that resembled plastic but was made from a mixture of wood pulp, cotton fiber and resin.\n\nEven still, turnarounds are possible.

This is something people thought may take years. It doesn't,” Vogt said.\n\nWhat about service area and pricing?\n\nCruise declined to share details on exactly where in Austin the service will operate or how many vehicles it will have in Central Texas. Cruise's fleet is made up of Chevy Bolt electric vehicles that have sensors, cameras, radar and lidar that make it possible to operate autonomously, according to the company.

Last year, driverless vehicle startup Argo AI announced it had began operating its autonomous test vehicles in Austin without human safety drivers. The vehicles are primarily operating downtown, as well as in east and south Austin, with the initial passengers being Argo AI employees who are able to stop or trigger the vehicle to pull over in case of emergency.\n\nArgo AI had been operating in Austin since 2019 in partnership with Ford Motor Company, and Ford has been deploying prototypes in Austin to establish the city as a proving ground for autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nFord and Argo AI have established several partnerships to test autonomous technology in Austin. The companies are working with ride-hailing service Lyft, with plans to allow customers in defined service areas to select one of the self-driving vehicles when ordering a ride. The initial rollout for the program is expected be limited, with fewer than 100 vehicles between Austin and Miami where the company is also testing the program.\n\nThe companies are also working with retail giant Walmart, using the vehicles as part of Walmart's delivery service, primarily delivering orders in an area near the Walmart store on East Ben White Boulevard. In both Lyft and Walmart services, the vehicles still had human safety drivers ready to take over in the event of an issue.\n\nNot all autonomous vehicle testing has stuck around in Austin. In 2019, Google’s autonomous vehicle company Waymo pulled out of Austin after testing its autonomous vehicle technology here for several years.\n\nMore:Elon Musk says Austin's not his home, but he spends a lot of time here, flight records show\n\nWhere is Austin-based Tesla on self-driving cars?\n\nAustin-based automaker Tesla has also been developing self-driving technology that is likely being used in Austin. The company has been letting some of its drivers test an advanced driver assistance system called \"full self driving\" technology, designed to navigate, steer, accelerate and brake on local roads. Some of the many Tesla vehicles driving around Austin could be part of the program.\n\nDespite the name, industry experts and the company itself do not consider the vehicles to be autonomous, and the feature does require active driver supervision. All Teslas produced after 2014 are also equipped with autopilot driver assistance technology. The newest version of the technology is powered by eight external cameras and vision processing technology.\n\nWhat else is happening with self-driving tech in Austin?\n\nBeyond the testing of vehicles, Austin is also home to a number of companies and tech operations that are working on technology for self-driving vehicles.\n\nAustin technology giant National Instruments (which has rebranded to NI) has increasingly been making bets on autonomous vehicle and safety technology, entering into two deals related to the technology last year. NI acquired Austin-based monoDrive, a startup that specializes in autonomous vehicle simulations, and also announced it was entering a strategic collaboration with engineering simulation company Ansys.\n\nUndher, an Austin-based company founded in 2015, makes digital imaging radar technology designed to be used in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. The company says its technology is capable of detecting and tracking thousands of objects, and that it is expected to be used in the upcoming Fisker Ocean crossover, which is scheduled to debut this year from EV startup Fisker.\n\nSelf-driving truck company Torc Robotics, which is owned by Daimler Truck, one of the world's largest commercial vehicle manufacturers, said this year that it was opening an Austin engineering hub.\n\nJohn Deere, which opened an Austin technology office this year, has also said its teams here will be focused on software and data including developing software used in autonomous tractors that helps tractors use data from the cloud and GPS signals to take a precise and specific path.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2023/10/27/cruise-gm-suspends-driverless-operations/71345159007/", "title": "Cruise, GM's robotaxi service, suspends all driverless operations"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2024/12/12/gm-moves-signal-restructuring-2025/76941476007/", "title": "GM's moves signal to experts restructuring ahead of an uncertain 2025", "text": "Jamie L. LaReau\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nGeneral Motors has made a series of moves in recent months to quietly restructure its business to be as agile as possible going into a wildly uncertain 2025, and analysts said the market should be applauding it.\n\n\"GM is adjusting to a new reality, and they're become a leaner and a meaner GM,\" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, told the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday. \"I'd say they're quasi-restructuring, meaning they are putting good assets after good and eliminating the bad.\"\n\nGM's most recent change came Tuesday when the automaker announced it would walk away from the billions of dollars it invested in Cruise's robotaxi fleet development since 2016 to instead focus on putting autonomous driving technology on personal vehicles that GM can sell to the public. GM is the largest stakeholder in the self-driving technology company Cruise.\n\n“When I first saw the news, I thought, ‘Oh thank God! It’s the new GM,’ “ Mike Ward, managing director of research at Freedom Capital Markets, told the Free Press Wednesday. “The old GM would have been stubborn and kept throwing billions at it. GM can’t compete with Waymo. GM doesn’t need to be in the robotaxi business. This move shows capital discipline. What got GM into bankruptcy in 2008? Undisciplined capital allocation, plain and simple.”\n\nIves agreed, saying it was smart to cut the cord on a program that won't deliver profits anytime soon, if ever. But, he said, \"It's bad that they spent all that money and they didn't get anything.\"\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nThe Cruise decision is just the latest big move announced by GM. Earlier this month, the company said it will sell back its investment in a battery cell plant being built in Lansing, Michigan to its Ultium Cells joint venture partner LG Energy Solution. That's expected to deliver about $1 billion to GM's coffers.\n\nBut then GM said it will record a total of nearly $5 billion in non-cash charges against its fourth-quarter net income. GM is in the midst of a massive restructuring of its operations in China that is funded by its partners there. When that's completed, GM expects to be profitable in the world's largest auto market again.\n\nIn November, GM cut a total of about 1,000 salaried and hourly employees globally as part of the new salaried employee ranking system as well as the \"normal course of business\" to achieve better operating efficiency. GM said it will also stop using its Yuma Desert Proving Grounds in Arizona for hot-weather vehicle testing.\n\nIn September, GM inked a deal with Hyundai Motor Co. to look into areas where the two automakers might collaborate in the future.\n\nGM admits to considering a change in tactics\n\nNot all is lost in GM's latest move with Cruise. Ives and Ward acknowledge that Cruise did bring GM access to technology that has helped improve safety features across its broader lineup and helped attract top software engineers to the automaker. Two high-level software executives left GM earlier this year.\n\nMorningstar Autos Analyst David Whiston said GM is restructuring its business model in a sense, but that's good, noting that \"the word (restructuring) tends to be associated with companies in trouble and needing a lot of work. In this case GM is not in trouble, but they know they need to change a lot to remain competitive versus Tesla and the Chinese,\" which are dominating the electric vehicle market globally.\n\nThe industry as a whole is adjusting to slower-than-expected adoption of EVs, with added uncertainty in the U.S. from President-elect Donald Trump's expected elimination of incentives for people to buy the cars.\n\nGM recalls:Over 132,000 Chevrolet, GMC trucks recalled over tailgate issue: See affected models\n\nGM's decision to put the brakes on Cruise's robotaxi business reiterated the automaker's disciplined spending philosophy, a message that CFO Paul Jacobson has drilled into Wall Street analysts since earlier this fall. At GM's Investor Day in October, he said the company expects the auto industry to sell about 16 million new vehicles for all of next year, which is \"consistent with where we have seen it.” That would be either flat or slightly below where sales could end up this year, based on predictions.\n\nJacobson said that before the election, however. With a new administration heading to the White House, uncertainty rules the day. Trump has talked of repealing parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, notably the $7,500 federal tax credit to consumers for the purchase of electric vehicles, which has helped GM and other carmakers sell EVs despite a lagging public-charger infrastructure.\n\nThe industry also faces the possibility that Trump will follow through on his threat to raise tariffs on products imported from Mexico and Canada, where all three Detroit automakers have factories in Mexico and Canada. An increase in tariffs, which are the taxes imposed on products when they cross borders, could mean huge cost bumps to automakers.\n\nAmid all of this, Jacobson has said that at some point next year, GM's losses on its EVs would narrow by $2 billion to $4 billion. On Dec. 4, an analyst asked Jacobson at the UBS Global Industrials and Transportation Conference in Florida if that goal holds true even if Trump repeals the federal tax credit on EV purchases and rolls back other environmental regulations next year.\n\n“I won’t speculate on what policy is going to do, other than to just to say we’ve got to remain agile. We’ve done that for more than a century across 20 presidents,\" Jacobson said. \"Things change. While there might be some changes that are pretty big shifts, we’ve always endeavored to say we want the products to sell themselves.\"\n\nGM will remain focused on the customer, Jacobson said, but he added, \"it might mean we have to change tactics a little bit.” GM is prepared to shift its all-electric strategy, including its plan to bring plug-in hybrid technology to certain models in North America in 2027, if the Trump administration eases environmental regulations on new vehicles, he said.\n\nBarra pushes back as she considers the future\n\nJacobson's comments, combined with GM's recent moves, provide a glimpse into the company's view of the future, experts said.\n\n\"GM is thinking more about the long term than about 2025, which probably is going to be a difficult year,\" said Erik Gordon, business professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. \"GM reconsidered what had been key pieces of its business plans — China and EVs and AVs — and now thinks they are less important, are drags on profits, and consume a lot of cash.\"\n\nGM committed to invest some $35 billion toward EV and AV development through 2025. Gordon noted that many investors thought the China market was a \"crucial future market.\"\n\n\"Analysts said that a car company that fell behind in EVs or AVs was doomed,\" Gordon added. \"GM did what it was pushed to do. Now (CEO Mary Barra) is pushing back. She doesn't like markets where the company loses piles of money. She never has. That is why she got GM out of Europe in 2017.\"\n\nGM will be more profitable by conserving capital now to have it on hand later to develop new products as the market shifts in the future, Gordon said.\n\nKevin Mixer, senior director analyst for automotive manufacturing at Gartner, said GM’s moves all signal that it’s preparing for the worst.\n\n“It does appear that the strategy has become ‘battening down the hatches’ to drive back to the basics of manufacturing consumer vehicles as the industry heads into uncertainties and economic headwinds,” Mixer told the Free Press on Wednesday. “Recent business ventures being rethought for near-term revenue contribution.”\n\nGM's response to Wall Street's calls\n\nChina is still important to GM. It's the company's second-largest market behind the United States. But the restructuring happening there will be funded by GM's partners, the automaker does not need to infuse any cash in it.\n\nRegarding China, Jacobson said earlier this month at UBS: \"We expect to be in a position to be profitable next year … on a much smaller scale, but that’s OK as long as it’s not a significant capital draw. Some tough decisions have to be made in that space. But it preserves our ability to remain profitable.\"\n\nSimilarly, Jacobson said Tuesday in relation to the Cruise news that the company realized that to continue down the path of deploying, maintaining and operating a robotaxi fleet would require a heavy capital investment on top of \"the $10 billion we've already invested in it.\" It made more sense to direct resources to further advancing GM's existing hands-free technology in Super Cruise, which is offered on 20 vehicles.\n\nGM had been spending about $2 billion a year supporting Cruise and has never had a return on its investment since 2016. GM expects this restructuring to lower its spending on Cruise by more than $1 billion annually after the proposed plan is completed, which is expected in the first half of 2025. Cruise had been operating human-supervised fleets of self-driving vehicles in Phoenix, Dallas and Houston since summer after a pause caused by a pedestrian injury.\n\nNow, with the robotaxi idea dead, China's restructuring in the hands of its partners and the company having shed jobs it did not deem necessary, GM can focus on the strategic opportunities, while cutting costs, Ives said.\n\n\"Wall Street wants to see a focused GM and Barra, and the team have heard the calls. It's why the stock has done so well this year,\" Ives said. Shares of the Detroit automaker have risen more than 50% this year, but some of that has been through $12.4 billion in stock buybacks since last November. GM has said it will continue making stock repurchases for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe 'sea change' at GM\n\nIves said GM is now set up well for whatever may come in 2025. Whiston agreed saying, \"I don’t think they are pessimistic about 2025, but they are hyperfocused on capital efficiency and reducing costs.\"\n\nOthers appear to agree. Morgan Stanley recently upgraded GM stock to \"equal-weight\" in its 2025 U.S. Autos Outlook. Autos analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a Wednesday research note that the Cruise robotaxi news is consistent with the \"narrative-changing discipline\" in GM's other recent moves that show improved execution and capital spending discipline, which led to that upgrade.\n\nFreedom Capital Market's Ward said people are not giving GM enough credit for its decision on Cruise, noting GM is not getting out of autonomous-active safety; it is just shifting it to various degrees of use on personal cars.\n\n“I think GM’s very optimistic about 2025,\" Ward said. \"There’s been a sea change at General Motors. Their lack of capital discipline got them into trouble in the 1990s and 2000s. They’re doing a restructuring in China, but the Chinese joint venture is paying for it. When you’re looking at a new year and how you’re allocating capital, you look at this robotaxi and say does this make sense? No, it doesn’t. They made the right call on that.\"\n\nThe Detroit Three automakers should always be cautious heading into the new year, Ward said, because the auto industry is capital-intensive, labor-intensive, cyclical, low growth, highly regulated and highly competitive.\n\n\"So if you’re Paul Jacobson, the CFO at General Motors, and you have to present a capital plan to your constituents and have the board sign off on it,\" Ward said, \"you better be conservative.\"\n\nContact Jamie L.

Some Argo AI employees will join Ford for that work, Farley said. Ford offers a driver-assist technology called BlueCruise that is positioned as a rival to Tesla’s Autopilot software.\n\nVW described similar plans in a statement.\n\n“Our goal is to offer our customers the most powerful functions at the earliest possible time and to set up our development as cost-effectively as possible,” VW CEO Oliver Blume said in a statement.\n\nArgo AI confirmed in a statement that it would be shutting down.\n\n“Many of the employees will receive an opportunity to continue work on automated driving technology with either Ford or Volkswagen, while employment for others will unfortunately come to an end,” Argo AI said in a statement.\n\nArgo was founded in 2016 and had fewer than 200 employees in 2017. It grew to more than 1,000 employees in 2020 following investments from Ford and VW, and to about 2,000 in 2022.\n\nFord and VW had first said in July 2019 that they would invest together in Argo AI. The company was developing robotaxis, self-driving vehicles that can operate in a ridehail service that does not require human drivers. Argo AI was also developing self-driving delivery vehicles and had worked on related programs in US cities.\n\nThe team effort allowed Ford and VW to share the hefty costs of developing self-driving cars.\n\nThen-Ford CEO Jim Hackett said at the time that Argo AI would allow the company to “showcase the power of our global alliance in this era of smart vehicles for a smart world.”\n\nArgo AI CEO Bryan Salesky had spent three years working on Google’s self-driving car program, now known as Waymo, which kicked off the industry in 2009.

The deep-diving marine mammal normally lives hundreds of miles offshore along the continental shelf edge and in even deeper ocean environments.\n\nBut when a young female Gervais' calf washed up on Emerald Isle in Carteret County last October, biologists knew something was very wrong. The marine mammal died soon after, and a necropsy later found a balloon lodged in the 11-foot-long whale's gastronomical tract, which prevented the still-nursing calf from effectively drinking her mother's milk.\n\nIn effect, the whale starved to death.\n\nIt's an outcome Debbie Swick is working to stop − first along the Outer Banks and then maybe along the entire North Carolina coast.\n\n\"There's nothing beneficial from releasing a balloon,\" she said. \"It's littering and dangerous, pure and simple.\n\n\"You don't throw a lit cigarette out the window, and we all cut up those six-pack plastic holders because we know what damage they can do to wildlife.

Balloon releases are already prohibited in all of the county's incorporated towns, and several towns in Southeastern North Carolina, including Wrightsville Beach and the three beach towns that share Topsail Island.\n\nA number of states − including Virginia and most recently Florida − also have balloon release bans in place.\n\n\"It's a common sense fix,\" Swick said, who also runs a Facebook page pushing for balloon release bans. \"Just don't let them go because there's nothing beneficial from releasing a balloon.\"\n\n'Balloons are not the answer'\n\nLiving in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Swick said she was somewhat aware of the impacts from free-floating balloons on the environment.\n\n\"But after moving down here and seeing them littering the beaches, I began to weep uncontrollably,\" she said.\n\nSwick, who lives in Southern Shores, said that in 2022 more than 700 balloons were collected within the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Last year, that number ballooned to nearly 1,800.\n\nSwick said she understands that people like to celebrate an important life milestone or remember someone by releasing a balloon, but there are better and safer ways to commemorate someone than releasing something that can travel for hundreds of miles and doesn't quickly or easily break down in the environment. Options include bubbles, flowers, kites, a memorial garden, or − if adventurous − origami.\n\n\"I don't want to tell someone how to grieve, but balloons are not the answer,\" Swick said.\n\nScientists have documented balloons in the stomachs of sea turtles, who mistake them for jellyfish, one of their favorite foods, and a whole range of marine mammals. Once in the digestive tract, the balloons are not digested and can cause blockages and death.\n\nOn shore, birds can become entangled in the balloons' strings. And then there's the unsightly view of balloon carcasses caught in trees, on sand fences and littering the beachfront.\n\n'Good common sense'\n\nThe Dare County ban comes with a $250 fine per released balloon, while most town bans include civil penalties ranging from $25 to $50. Swick said she didn't think the $250 penalty was too high and would act as a good deterrent for people to think twice and do something as simple as weighing a balloon down.\n\n\"I'm not banning balloons,\" Swick stressed. \"I'm just banning releasing them.\"\n\nThe Dare County ban was passed unanimously, and Swick said she has heard very little criticism about it. Even the local real estate community has jumped on board and no longer uses balloons tied to mailboxes to advertise open houses, she added.\n\nBut Swick said she's not satisfied, and has sent letters to all of the state's county commissioners \"since balloons don't respect government boundaries and can travel for long distances.\"\n\nShe also has reached out to state Sen.

It's all based on one 9-year-old's suspect statistic\n\nDan Flynn, chairman of the Balloon Council, noted that the percentage of balloons let go in the environment is minuscule compared to how many are sold. He also clarified that balloons filled with air typically don’t rise high enough to present a problem.\n\nThe issue is with those inflated with helium or another gas lighter than air, whether they’re made from latex or the foil-and-polyester material commonly known as Mylar, because they can travel longer distances.\n\nMylar balloons, which conduct electricity, often get caught in power lines and have caused countless power outages – more than 1,000 last year in Southern California alone. The Balloon Council recommends they be sold only when tethered to a weight, following the requirement of a 1990 California law.\n\nWhile Flynn said trade research has found no evidence of latex balloons by themselves causing harm to marine life – usually the animals have ingested plastic products as well – the industry has tried to educate customers about the proper way to handle them.\n\n“Our message to our retailers, to our users, is, ‘Don’t let go,’’’ Flynn said. “We recognize that, even though the product is biodegradable, some people are going to consider releasing a balloon to be littering. And while balloon releases can be very beautiful events, if you’re offending a lot of people by it, it’s not the thing to do.’’\n\nThere are varying estimates of how long balloons take to biodegrade, from six months to four years. They’re not among the 10 items the European Commission listed in May as targeted for bans or phasing out in an attempt to reduce marine debris.\n\nThat list is composed entirely of single-use plastics and it does include straws, which have been banned in Seattle, San Francisco and Vancouver, British Columbia. New York City is also pondering such a move.\n\nThough straws account for just a fraction of the plastics content in landfills, environmentalists see their banishment as a means to raise awareness to the importance of finding ways around reliance on single-use plastics.\n\nThe issue has become even more pressing in the U.S. now that China has tightened the rules on what it will purchase and has threatened a tariff on other reclaimed refuse as it engages in a trade war with the Trump administration.\n\n“Now more than ever, this stuff will go to landfill because the sort of contaminated recyclable material that especially California used to send to China, well, China’s not taking this anymore, so there’s just no market for it,’’ said Roland Geyer, an assistant professor of environmental science at the University of California-Santa Barbara.\n\nGeyer was the lead author of a 2017 study that estimated only 9 percent of the 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic made since the 1950s has been recycled; nearly 80 percent ended up in landfills or somewhere in the environment.\n\nExperts in the field see the next step toward sustainability not in recycling but in structural changes that would encourage producers and vendors to seek packaging alternatives that don’t rely on plastic, which is used for beverage containers, yogurt cups, peanut butter jars, shampoo bottles and more.\n\nThe old three-R slogan of reduce, reuse and recycle is giving way to reduce, reuse and refuse, the last one not the noun but the verb, meaning to turn down plastic.\n\n“I’m hoping people wake up to the beauty of reusables and disengage from all of these throwaway to-go cups and this whole throwaway mentality that we’ve become acclimatized to, because it’s completely unsustainable,’’ said Dianna Cohen, CEO of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.\n\nGiven the greater urgency of addressing the worldwide plastics crisis, the movement toward getting rid of balloons – or at least further restricting them – doesn’t figure to take off for a while.\n\nBut much like plastic bags and straws, they could become subject to the kind of campaign that brings their use crashing down.\n\nSharon Dunwoody, a University of Wisconsin professor who studies the role of science, environment and health messages in mass media, doesn’t see that prospect as far-fetched.\n\n“Balloons are a uniformly cheery item. You would certainly engage in a rigorous effort to communicate about the downsides,’’ she said. “I do think in a case like that, people could readily change their behavior, because balloons are not a life-or-death issue. They’re fun, they’re common. If you said to me, ‘Have balloons but don’t let them out of the house; don’t let them escape,’ that to me would be a very doable thing.’’", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/06/25/balloon-release-ban-florida-desantis/74202568007/", "title": "Florida bill bans balloon releases. Info about HB 321", "text": "Balloons are often at the scene for major life events, such as birthday parties, weddings, marathons and celebrations of life. As fun and sentimental as they are, far too many end up as litter in the state’s ecosystems.\n\nOn Monday, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law a measure that would ban intentional balloon releases in the state, adding in some hefty fines for those who violate the law.\n\nThe Tallahassee Democrat wrote Florida's current law allows nine or fewer balloons to be released within a 24-hour period. However, this latest bill classifies the intentional release of all balloons inflated with a gas lighter than air as littering.\n\nOceana, a nonprofit ocean conservation organization, lobbied for the bill and stated the legislation's passage as a \"great day for Florida's coastlines and ocean wildlife.\"\n\n\"Florida's new law will help save ocean animals from these preventable deaths,\" Oceana’s Florida Field Campaigns Manager Hunter Miller wrote in a statement. \"While releasing balloons is sometimes used for celebrations, Floridians can opt for greener choices like bubbles, kites, planting trees, or making memorial gardens.\"\n\nIntentional balloon releases in Florida: What is HB 321?\n\nHouse Bill 321, dubbed the \"Release of Balloons\" bill, seeks to ban any intentional balloon releases in the state.\n\nAccording to the bill's analysis, it revises the penalties for intentionally releasing balloons by specifying that a person commits littering if they intentionally release, organize the release of, or intentionally cause to be released balloons inflated with a gas that is lighter than air.\n\nWeather, research and hot air balloons that are recovered after flight would still be allowed.\n\nWhen will HB 321 take effect?\n\nWith DeSantis' signature, the bill would take effect on Monday, July 1.\n\nIs there an exemption for biodegradable balloons?\n\nBiodegradable balloons are often made from a natural latex, according to EcoFreak. However, the bill will remove the previous exemption for balloons that have been determined by FWC rules to be biodegradable or photodegradable.\n\nWhat are the legal consequences of having a balloon release in Florida?\n\nHB 321 would classify the intentional release of all balloons inflated with a gas lighter than air as littering, and people who violate the law could be subject to a $150 fine. Of that amount, $50 would go to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's solid waste management trust fund.\n\nFor balloons over 15 pounds, fines could reach up to $1,000.\n\nThese penalties do not apply to children under 6, according to the bill.\n\nHow bad are balloons for the environment?\n\nNonprofit organization Oceana shared that scientists estimate that 33 billion pounds of plastic wash into the ocean every year, which equates to about two garbage trucks’ worth of plastic entering the ocean every minute.\n\nBalloons are typically made of foil or latex and are inflated with a gas lighter than air. They are sealed with plastic ribbons, valves, tie-off discs, and clips. The bill's own analysis states when balloons are released, they drift away and eventually fall somewhere becoming litter, which can be dangerous to wildlife and the environment.\n\n\"Balloons take years to break down and often end up in waterways or the ocean, where they can be swallowed by marine animals. Turtles have been found to selectively eat burst balloons because they look like jellyfish, their natural food,\" the description reads.\n\nContinuing: \"Balloons, along with any ribbons or plastic discs attached, can harm animals by blocking their airways or becoming lodged in their intestines. Ribbons and strings from balloons can also become entangled round birds and other animals, making them unable to move.\"\n\nIn which states are balloon releases illegal?\n\nIn addition to Florida, several other states have passed or put forward legislation to ban or limit balloon releases outdoors, such as:\n\nCalifornia\n\nConnecticut\n\nDelaware\n\nHawaii\n\nMaine\n\nMaryland\n\nRhode Island\n\nTennessee\n\nVirginia\n\nI was planning on doing a balloon release.

An otherwise baby-faced Harvard graduate, I wanted to seem mature and rugged to the teenagers I worked with as a wilderness therapy guide. My father, a Hindu Indian immigrant, encouraged me to shave. These are dangerous times to be mistaken for a Muslim, he said.\n\nLater, when a shopkeeper and then a Pakistani flight attendant greeted me in Urdu, the language of South Asian Muslims, I grinned. My father wasn’t wrong: I did look Muslim. But where was the danger in that?\n\nLast week, an Indian-born engineer named Srinivas Kuchibhotla was killed in Olathe, Kan. by a man who apparently thought he was “Middle Eastern.\" I felt the deadly gunshots reverberate here in Boston, where I train to save lives at Harvard Medical School. As an aspiring psychiatrist, I wondered whether the shooter, reportedly a veteran with PTSD, had adequate mental health care. As a political activist, I wondered if better gun control could have saved Kuchibhotla’s life. But as the son of another Indian-born engineer, I soon found my mind leaping from Kansas to nearby Illinois, where my family still lives.\n\nRockford, Ill. is as improbable a destination for Indian immigrants as Olathe, but it’s where the job market happened to lead my father. As a child, I never questioned my Americanness; even when a kid shouted “Osama!” at me in the wake of 9/11, I didn’t take him seriously. Rockford didn’t let me grow up believing in either an all-white or a post-racial America. Half my schoolmates were black, and I saw structural racism daily in their segregated neighborhoods. I didn’t fit the all-American mold, but neither did my black and brown friends and teammates.\n\nMy America had a checkered history. But even a kid with my brown skin and unpronounceable name had the right to love it enough to improve it.\n\nMuslim-Mexican scapegoats in Trump’s America: Voices\n\nA change of heart about Muslims: Column\n\nToday, my America is struggling to survive. White nationalism has bubbled to the surface, its noxious fumes seeping into our discourse, our institutions, our policies. Disguising fear and hate as pragmatic problem-solving, it has already birthed the “Muslim ban” and indiscriminate immigration raids this year. Without verified information from Olathe, to claim that white nationalism killed Srinivas Kuchibhotla would be irresponsibly speculative — but the divisive climate it has created is undeniable.\n\nDivisiveness, of course, is not an American invention. I have always been proud that my Hindu grandfather considered a Muslim man his best friend, precisely because their friendship defied India’s abysmal history of Hindu-Muslim violence and the recent resurgence of Hindu nationalism. Look no farther than the Republican Hindu Coalition to see how seamlessly Hindu nationalism dovetails with white nationalism’s campaign against Islam.\n\nBut even beyond such egregious offenders, bigotry is an inescapable part of my Indian heritage. We Indian-Americans share a dirty secret: many of our beloved elders (and even peers) carry shocking prejudices about other minorities behind closed doors. Even Gandhi, in his early years, excluded blacks from the struggle of Indians in colonial South Africa for political rights. Our failures of solidarity with fellow communities of color continue today, at no small cost.\n\nI chose to be an American: Rekha Basu\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nSrinivas Kuchibhotla was not the first person in America murdered for the color of his skin. He will not be the last. Some in our (Hindu) community still cling to the belief that we are safe because we are not black and not Muslim. We are the successful model minority, we tell ourselves; we are neither the threat nor the threatened. Or are we?\n\nThat, however, is the wrong question to ask. As long as any of our brothers and sisters — Muslim, black, Latino, or otherwise — are in danger, we all are. Hate and fear are our birthright as humans, but so is love. We cannot afford to draw more dividing lines. We stand together in solidarity. Or we perish alone.\n\nSiva Sundaram, a medical student at Harvard, was born and raised by Indian immigrant parents in Rockford, Ill.

Their wholesale business sells snack food, wine and beer, she said.\n\n“My husband’s always loved gardening. I actually went to an agricultural high school, in Australia,” said India Sekiguchi, who grew up in Yigo and returned to island more than a decade ago. “We both love plants and animals, and we thought now would be the perfect time to surround ourselves with plants and animals.”\n\nThey turned their wholesale warehouse, on Pick-A-Nail Road, in Tamuning, into a retail gardening store, dealing directly with customers for the first time.\n\n“Our conference room became our little boutique shop for high-end nutrients, fertilizers, succulent planters,” she said.\n\nStart your new business: Best LLC services\n\nDedicated to gardening\n\n“We’re the first dedicated gardening center,” she said. “There’s no distraction here. There’s no construction material. We are pure, 100% garden-focused.”\n\nThe store has a large inventory of high-quality potting soil in stock, as well as additional fertilizers and inert material to create custom soil mixes. The soil is brought in by container-load, she said, which allows it to be sold at a lower price.\n\nThe store sells hydroponic growing systems, hard-to-find seeds for Asian vegetables and potted plants, including strawberry plants. The strawberry plants grow outdoors and produce fruit without dying, India Sekiguchi said, but she recommends keeping them in pots instead of planting them in the ground.\n\nThe variety of available products in the store continues to grow, based on customer input. India Sekiguchi said if a customer asks her about something once, she notes it. If another customer asks about the same thing, she orders it.\n\n“We really feel that we’ve struck a chord with a lot of people on Guam. Their reactions tell everything when they walk into the store. A lot of people are saying it’s like a religious experience for them,” she said.\n\nBill 69:Public hearing for foam container ban on Friday\n\nCannabis customers\n\nSupplies for different types of gardeners are grouped in separate areas of the store. Equipment preferred by customers who grow cannabis — grow tents, LED grow lights and ventilation systems — is displayed on the second floor, which is accessed by climbing a metal ladder.\n\nGuam in April 2019 legalized recreational cannabis on island, allowing residents 21 and older to grow and consume cannabis at home. It must be grown indoors, however.\n\n“With the (cannabis) legislation coming about the same time as the pandemic, and the whole phenomenon of pandemic gardening, ... we’ve just been hit up by everyone who loves to grow,” India Sekiguchi said. “And we welcome people, no matter what they’re growing — whether it be cannabis, orchids, succulents, vegetable patches.”\n\nThings to do:A list of Mass schedules for Holy week and Easter services\n\nRestoring habitat\n\nSekiguchi said Back to Nature is about to start a partnership with the Guam Department of Agriculture, as part of a project to help residents restore habitat for native bird species. The store will help grow native plant species and distribute them at workshops, where information will be provided about plants and birds.\n\n“If Guam wants to emulate Saipan, Rota, these other islands that have had successful bird reintroduction programs, we have to bring back the plants that the birds eat,” she said. “We can’t just bring back the birds and expect them to eat these introduced plants. They want to eat the native species.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/26/you-think-you-see-light-end-tunnel-and-itcolumbine-survivors-what-expect-following-parkland-fla-high/372207002/", "title": "Columbine survivors offer tips for Parkland shooting survivors", "text": "LITTLETON, Colo. – Change the sound of the fire alarms. Consider banning what the cafeteria cooked for lunch that day. Watch out for slamming lockers and popping balloons.\n\nAnd accept that normal will never truly be normal again.\n\nThat’s the advice survivors of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting have for their fellow students, educators and administrators at Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nNearly 20 years after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 of their fellow students and teacher Dave Sanders, the lessons of Columbine are visible across the nation: more metal detectors and armed guards, a more aggressive police response.\n\nLess visible but no less important are the lessons learned by the teachers and administrators who lived through that day and returned to their shattered school weeks later to pick up the pieces.\n\nAt Stoneman Douglas, curriculum will be altered, grading diminished, teaching style adapted. Test scores could drop and learning could slow, at least in the short term, as traumatized students and staff try to readjust to a campus transformed into a national focal point on gun violence.\n\n\"Everybody needs school to feel like school. But everyone is traumatized, and traumatized brains don't learn well,\" said Paula Reed, an English teacher who survived the Columbine attack. \"It's going to be a while before they even start getting their feet under them.\"\n\nMonday and Tuesday are staff planning days, and classes resume Wednesday on a modified schedule. The full class schedule is set to resume March 5. The freshman building, where the carnage took place, will remain closed, and tentative plans call for its demolition. The school has been closed since Feb. 14, when authorities say former student Nikolas Cruz killed 14 students and three staff members.\n\nNow retired, Columbine principal Frank DeAngelis has spoken several times with Ty Thompson, Stoneman Douglas' principal, offering hard-earned guidance and advice. DeAngelis has become one of the world's leading experts on school violence and its effects on communities.\n\n\"It's the things you don't even think about, things that will trigger the emotions,\" DeAngelis said. \"Teachers won't know what to expect. It's a day-by-day experience.\"\n\nDeAngelis said the smell of the food from the cafeteria could trigger memories for some students, and the fire alarm sound certainly will. So might sirens or even the sound of a slamming door. Even camouflage clothes or the sight of police cars parked out front could frighten kids, he said.\n\nAfter the Columbine shooting, well-meaning community members built a balloon arch in the school colors to welcome students back to class. “What we didn’t anticipate was balloons popping and kids diving on the ground,” DeAngelis said.\n\nMore:Florida students set to return to class; pressure on Broward sheriff mounts\n\nStoneman Douglas teachers will bear some of the heaviest burdens, DeAngelis and Reed said, because they'll try to be strong for the students while still struggling themselves. DeAngelis said he always recommends counseling for teachers after a shooting so they can help support their students.\n\n\"If they don't take care of themselves, it will be impossible for them to care for anyone else,\" DeAngelis said. \"They’re going to want to put on a tough face for the students, but they are also hurting. You have to remember that you're not in this alone.\"\n\nIn the weeks after the shooting, Reed remembers walking into her home, past her husband and two kids, to sit on the bed and stare out the window, exhausted after a day of trying to teach and balance the emotional needs of herself and her students.\n\nReed said at first she altered her teaching style: Instead of lecturing or asking for class participation, she asked her 10th- and 11th-graders to follow along as she read aloud to them. The comforting familiarity helped, she said, as did a daily check-in when she asked each student to rate out loud how he or she was feeling. For the first few years, she also avoided teaching books full of violence or teen deaths.\n\nThe most important thing, Reed and DeAngelis said, is to remember that every student and staff member will be at a different place in the grieving process. Some will be ready to move on quickly, the two said, and some won’t be able to stop talking about it, and others will refuse to discuss it at all — at least at first.\n\nMany will struggle with guilt, knowing they survived while their classmates and colleagues didn’t.\n\n“The first few good days you have can also be the hardest,” Reed said. \"You think you see the light at the end of the tunnel, and it's actually an oncoming train.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/26"}]}

In both, a nefarious man attempts to trick his new wife into thinking she’s losing her mind, in part by telling her that the gaslights in their home, which dim when he’s in the attic doing dastardly deeds, are not fading at all.\n\nBoth the play and film were wildly popular, with a renamed version of the play running for more than 1,000 performances on Broadway, and the 1944 film earning a best picture nomination and an Oscar for Ingrid Bergman. Partly due to the film’s popularity, the noun “gaslight” became a verb, too.\n\nIn the context of the film, “gaslighting” refers to the “psychological manipulation of a person over an extended period of time that causes the victim to question” their reality, according to Merriam-Webster.\n\nGaslighting in politics, media and entertainment\n\n“Gaslighting” has in the last few years become a ubiquitous term, particularly in the “age of misinformation,” Merriam-Webster said. In 2017, a CNN opinion writer said President Donald Trump was “‘gaslighting’ all of us” after he denied making several statements he’d made in public. CNN’s Chris Cillizza used the word again in 2021 to describe the way Trump downplayed the severity of the January 6 insurrection.\n\nIt’s also a legitimate and “extremely effective form of emotional abuse,” according to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, which has resources for survivors on recognizing gaslighting. The New York Times also this year wrote about “medical gaslighting,” when patients, especially women and people of color, are dismissed by physicians who downplay the severity of their symptoms.\n\nThis year in particular, interest in the word “gaslighting” has surged, per Merriam-Webster, with a 1740% increase in searches for the term.\n\nThe word continued making its way into popular media this year: “Gaslit” is the name of a limited series starring Julia Roberts set during the Watergate scandal of the ’70s. The young, rich cast of “Bodies, Bodies, Bodies” accuse each other of gaslighting when tensions run high. HBO’s “The White Lotus,” as well as recent film “Don’t Worry Darling” (both properties of CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery) also feature characters gaslighting each other.\n\nWhile other commonly searched words, including “omicron” and “queen consort,” reflect specific events or episodes of 2022, “gaslighting” refers to a phenomenon that isn’t fleeting but rather an ingrained part of our lives, per Merriam-Webster.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/27/merriam-webster-word-of-the-year-2023-authentic/71715120007/", "title": "Merriam-Webster word of the year for 2023: 'authentic'", "text": "In a year where AI, celebrity culture, identity and social media became a center of conversation, it's only fitting that Merriam-Webster's word of the year is \"authentic.\"\n\nIn a news release, the dictionary said that while the word has had a high number of searches in previous years, it saw a substantial increase in 2023.\n\n“We see in 2023 a kind of crisis of authenticity,” editor at large Peter Sokolowski told The Associated Press. “What we realize is that when we question authenticity, we value it even more.”\n\nA constant spike in searches\n\nSokolowski said that this year, searches for the word was not boosted at any one point in time but consistently throughout the year.\n\nSokolowski said the company's data crunchers filter out commonly looked-up words like “love” and “affect” vs. “effect” as they search for words that have high lookups online.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nMerriam-Webster has named “gaslighting” its word of the year.\n\nThe decision to crown “gaslighting” in 2022 may feel a little late. The term became the go-to way of describing former President Donald Trump’s devotion to creating false realities through repeated lies all the way back in 2016. As one of the first people to apply the term to Trump’s rejection of reality (in a viral piece for US News & World Report in March 2016), I’ve paid attention as the word entered the political lexicon and broadened until it became, essentially, a synonym of “lying.”\n\nNicole Hemmer Courtesy Nicole Hemmer\n\nBut in that broadening, something has been lost. A particular moment spurred me to think of Trump’s habitual dissembling in gaslighting terms. A week before I wrote that column, video appeared to show Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski roughly grabbing Breitbart writer Michelle Fields, forcing her out of his way after a press conference. (After battery charges were filed by police, the state’s attorney decided there was not enough evidence to pursue criminal charges. Lewandowski denied touching Fields.)\n\nThe incident was filmed and the video widely circulated. Yet when I came home and turned on the news that night, there was Trump, denying that it had happened. I was so confused that I hopped online to make sure I hadn’t mistaken what I had seen (I was not yet acclimated to Trump’s steady stream of lies).\n\nThe disorientation I felt in that moment reminded me of gaslighting, a term derived from the 1938 play “Gas Light” (later turned into a film), which depicted a husband psychologically torturing his wife to the point that she questions her own grasp of reality. In the cases of both “Gas Light” and the Lewandowski incident, the core question was one of men menacing women. Those connotations made the term especially apt for Trump, who has faced dozens of allegations of sexual harassment and assault (which he has denied) and regularly attacked women in his speeches.\n\nBut that aspect of gaslighting did not make it into the popular understanding of the word. The team at Merriam-Webster argues that it caught on because it describes a particular type of lying that defined the past several years in US politics: “The idea of a deliberate conspiracy to mislead has made gaslighting useful in describing lies that are part of a larger plan.” That it has roots in domestic abuse is relegated to part of what Merriam-Webster describes as the word’s “colorful” origins.\n\nCharles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman in 1944 film, \"Gaslight.\" Everett Collection\n\nThis loss of context for a single word might not feel urgently important – after all, words evolve as they work their way from novel to commonplace to, eventually, trite (as the word “gaslighting” now feels after years of overuse). But in a culture where histories of abuse are regularly erased – even five years into the #MeToo movement – the erasure feels significant.\n\nGaslighting describes a particular type of psychological abuse, where the abuser repeatedly undermines and contradicts the victim’s perception of the world, to the point where she questions her own experiences and memories. In the play “Gas Light,” the goal was to swindle the woman out of money. But the broader purpose is to make women uncertain and dependent, to render them unreliable narrators of their own experiences — especially experiences of abuse, harassment and assault.\n\nGaslighting, then, is a fundamental element in the infrastructure of a culture that does not believe women. That’s why the phrase “believe women” became such a powerful rallying cry during the #MeToo movement — not because women cannot lie or make mistakes, but because undermining women’s credibility had been a key tool of abuse.\n\nWhile women are gaslighting’s main victims, its consequences extend much further. The space where domestic abuse most quickly disappears is around public violence, in particular mass shootings. Studies show that domestic violence is deeply entwined in mass shootings: The majority of perpetrators have histories of domestic violence. Domestic homicide or attempted homicide often precedes mass shootings (as was the case in Uvalde and Sandy Hook) and domestic violence-related mass shootings are deadlier than other mass shootings.\n\nAnd yet when it comes to public debate about mass shootings, addressing domestic violence is seldom near the top of the list. That’s possibly because mass shootings, though relatively common in the US, are rare compared to rates of domestic violence: according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 41% of women and 26% of men experience intimate-partner violence. Domestic violence in the United States is so common, it seems, that it quickly disappears from public consciousness.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe #MeToo movement focused less on domestic abuse than workplace abuse, ranging from sexual harassment to rape. As the movement emerged, many men were shaken that so many of the women they knew had experienced abuse. And yet even in a moment when abuse of women commanded national attention, a counter-movement quickly emerged asking whether #MeToo had gone “too far” (despite the relatively small number of abusers who experienced any sort of lasting consequences).\n\nSustained attention to abuse of women – and the patriarchal norms and structures that underwrite it – requires constant reminders of the way it shapes culture, politics and even language in the US. Yes, gaslighting is just one small word that has been stripped of its origins in domestic abuse. But it is a word that named a particular form of abuse, and gave women a way to talk about attacks on their credibility, that empowered them to claim their experience. That makes it a word whose origins deserve to be fully recognized. While gaslighting as a synonym for lying feels hackneyed in 2022, as a description of efforts to undermine women’s credibility, it is as relevant as ever.", "authors": ["Nicole Hemmer"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columns/2023/12/31/the-word-of-the-year-is-not-what-youve-been-told/71907393007/", "title": "Charita Goshay: The Word of the Year is not what you've been told", "text": "Two of the world's top dictionary publishers, Merriam-Webster and the Oxford University Press, recently announced their respective picks for the \"2023 Word of the Year.\"\n\nMerriam-Webster selected \"authentic.\" Oxford University Press has chosen \"rizz,\" a slang term for \"charisma.\"\n\nI respectfully disagree.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/31"}]}

He's that type of player.\"\n\nJordan Romano to Phillies\n\nDALLAS — The Philadelphia Phillies, whose bullpen failed them again in the postseason, hope they have solved their Achilles heel by agreeing to a one-year, $7.75 million contract with free agent All-Star closer Jordan Romano on Monday at the Winter Meetings.\n\nRomano was one of baseball’s premier closers from 2021-23 with the Toronto Blue Jays before missing the final four months of the season with an elbow injury. He needed arthroscopic surgery for an elbow impingement. The Blue Jays non-tendered him last month, making him a free agent.\n\nRomano, 31, saved 95 games and struck out 230 batters with a 2.37 ERA from 2021-23, with the highest WAR among all relievers during that span.\n\n– Bob Nightengale\n\nTigers, veteran Alex Cobb agree to one-year deal\n\nDALLAS — The Detroit Tigers have added a starting pitcher.\n\nThe Tigers have signed right-hander Alex Cobb, an All-Star in 2023, to a one-year contract in MLB free agency, according to a source with knowledge of the agreement. The two sides agreed Monday, the first day of MLB's Winter Meetings, but the deal is pending a physical exam.\n\nCobb, 37, posted a 2.76 ERA with three walks and 10 strikeouts across 16⅓ innings in three starts for the Cleveland Guardians in the 2024 season. He missed most of the season because of left hip surgery and a right shoulder injury.\n\n– Evan Petzold, Detroit Free Press\n\nCubs announce Matthew Boyd deal\n\nYankees rumors after Juan Soto news\n\nNo need to sugarcoat it: This is devastating for the Yankees.\n\nSoto and Aaron Judge made for one of the great middle-of-the-order duos in major league history, combining for 99 home runs (apropos), combining with Giancarlo Stanton to reestablish a punishing Bronx Bombers presence and drive the Yankees to their first World Series since 2009.\n\nWhat now?\n\nThe answers are all suboptimal, to a degree. The Yankees can try to add power and address badly-needed upgrades by pursuing Alex Bregman, Pete Alonso or Christian Walker, with the first two options likely costing in excess of $200 million.\n\nAll three are right-handed hitters, however, which would badly imbalance the lineup around Judge. That’s where a trade for Cody Bellinger makes so much sense: They could likely import the lefty-hitting, athletically elite first baseman/outfielder from the Cubs for not much more than taking on the potential $52.5 million owed Bellinger this year and next (He has a player option for 2026).\n\n– Gabe Lacques\n\nTop MLB free agents remaining\n\nJuan Soto and Blake Snell, the top two players in USA TODAY Sports' 2024-25 free agent rankings, are now off the board but there's elite talent remaining on the market expected to fetch big deals.\n\nHere are the top 10 players still on the market:\n\nSP Corbin Burnes 3B Alex Bregman 1B Pete Alonso SP Max Fried OF Teoscar Hernández OF Anthony Santander INF Gleyber Torres SP Nathan Eovaldi SP Jack Flaherty RP Tanner Scott\n\nJuan Soto contract is 'most important transaction the Mets have ever made'\n\nLongtime New York Mets announcer Gary Cohen told SNY late Sunday that Juan Soto's record-breaking 15-year, $765 million deal is \"the biggest and most important transaction the Mets have ever made.\"\n\n\"The only one that even is in the same ballpark is the trade for Mike Piazza in 1998.\n\n\"The Mets have never dipped this deeply into the free into the free agent market in terms of the caliber of player and youth. The thing that would come closest to that would be signing Carlos Beltran (seven years, $119 million after 2004 season).\"\n\nWith the team coming off an NLCS appearance, Cohen said Soto \"completely changes the conversation around the Mets\" and the addition \"automatically\" makes New York the NL East favorites \"regardless of what they do the rest of the offseason.\"\n\nSoto contract is history repeating itself 24 years after A-Rod deal\n\nDALLAS — This is the exact spot where it happened, turning the baseball world upside down, leaving executives fuming, and publicly threatening that it would forever ruin the sport.\n\nThe date: Dec. 11, 2000. The time: 1:30 a.m. The location: Room 633, Anatole Hotel, Dallas, Texas.\n\nIt was the moment the Texas Rangers agreed to a 10-year, $252 million contract with shortstop Alex Rodriguez.“How can I forget?\" said former Rangers GM Doug Melvin. “How can anyone forget?\"\n\nNow, 24 years later, at this same hotel, history repeated itself. This time, it’s Juan Soto signing a record 15-year, $765 million contract with the New York Mets.\n\nAnd once again, particularly from the small- and mid-sized markets, you could hear screaming into the Texas night, and cries that the sport is broken – worrying about a work stoppage in 2026.\n\nScott Boras, the man who negotiated A-Rod’s contract and now Soto’s, can only laugh and will tell you it’s a shrewd business deal that will only enhance the franchise’s value.\n\n“I think the process was very misunderstood,\" Boras told USA TODAY Sports of the Rodriguez pursuit. “When you look at the surplus value, even though the Rangers didn’t win, it was economically beneficial to the franchise.

Steve Cohen helped define it to Juan Soto during lunch as the Mets owner attempted to sell the superstar outfielder on his vision for the franchise.\n\nSoto wanted to know how many World Series Cohen was hoping to secure across the next decade. The billionaire owner candidly offered: \"Two to four.\"\n\nThat vision of a fruitful future in Flushing helped Soto begin to warm to the idea of migrating to a different borough and landing with the Mets. A cool, record $765 million contract probably did not hurt. Neither did the efforts of the rest of the Cohen family, including co-owner Alex Cohen, in helping Soto feel comfortable in his new home.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon at Citi Field, the Cohens' grand vision of producing a consistent, bona fide World Series contender came into clearer focus as Soto stepped onto the dais in the Piazza Club and thrust on a hat and white jersey garnished with royal blue and orange.\n\n\"What they showed me, how the organization runs things and how they’re going to manage things and how they look at the future, I think it was one of the things that opened my eyes a little bit more,\" Soto said as he stepped into the spotlight as the highest paid player in the history of sports. \"What they’ve been constructing and building to take all the way up to 15 years, 20 years, you never know. But definitely that was one of the things that opened my eyes more was how hungry they are to win a championship and make a dynasty with the New York Mets.\"\n\nAll things Mets: Latest New York Mets news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nThe afternoon was something of a fantasy for the Mets organization, and they pulled out all of the stops to welcome one of the most elite hitters of his generation to Flushing.\n\nDozens of members of the Mets organization outlined a border of seats that stretched to the bar in the club. As Soto emerged in a navy-blue suit, black turtleneck and with a No. 22 chain around his neck, the staffers showered the team's new generational talent with applause.\n\nMoves:What Mets' brass is saying, and not saying, about Juan Soto and other offseason hot topics\n\nThe Mets set up 22 seats for Soto's family, or the \"Soto Supreme Court,\" as his agent Scott Boras dubbed the 26-year-old's support system. A lunch of Latin American cuisine, including carne asada, roasted pernil, tostones and arroz con gandules awaited.\n\nSoto's arrival was a celebration for all involved.\n\n\"It’s obviously a huge move,\" Steve Cohen said. \"I think it puts an accent on what we’re trying to do. It accelerates our goal of winning championships, but more important, I kind of said it in our locker room after one of our playoff victories, my goal was to change how the Mets were viewed. I think we’re really on the path of changing that.\n\n\"We’re never going to stop. We’re always in a constant state of improvement, but that’s my goal. My goal is that the Mets are going to be a premier, one of the elite teams in Major League Baseball.\"\n\nThursday's festivities had been practically fantasized about since David Stearns became the franchise's first president of baseball operations prior to the 2024 season. Soto's name was at the top of the upcoming free agent list for the 2025 season but following an offseason trade to the crosstown Yankees, there was doubts about an impending departure from the Bronx.\n\nStearns said the preparation for the pursuit of Soto began last August. The Mets' run to the National League Championship Series might have helped put the Mets in a better spot but the Yankees went one step further. Soto had one of his best seasons in his seven-year career, belting a career-high 41 home runs and scoring 128 times, while plating 109 runs.\n\n\"The way he thinks about hitting is a gift,\" Stearns said. \"I mean, this is not only a physically gifted athlete, physically gifted hitter, this is someone who spends a lot of time thinking about his craft, observing other players. There's a reason he's as good as he is, and I think a lot of it is the thought that goes into his approach and how he goes about it.\"\n\nPayroll:Mets' 10 biggest contracts for 2025 season as Juan Soto agrees to record contract\n\nAfter a weekslong pursuit, optimism waned on Saturday night, with Stearns putting the Mets' chances at less than 50%. The bidding began to hit historic levels. But Cohen would not be denied.\n\n\"I can think pretty well on my feet, and adjust pretty quick,\" Cohen said. \"That's what I do for a living in the markets. And so, I always say, 'I don't quit. I don't create the world. I gotta live in the world that’s being created around me.' And I wasn't the only bidder. That was the market, and so we’re lucky enough that he chose us.\"\n\nDespite a strong season with the Yankees across town, Soto said that it came down to a family decision. The Cohens outlined a family-centered culture, with Steve's accessibility and openness with his players. Stearns touted his approach to roster-building, complete with the team's financial resources and the young talent waiting in the wings.\n\nThat message resonated with Soto.\n\n\"What they show and what they have in the table, it’s seems like they're a right family,\" Soto said of the Cohens. \"A family that wants to win, but they want to take care of their players and families. That’s one of the things that always ... it was a better thing for me to move forward.\"\n\nAnd on a blustery Thursday afternoon in December, the Mets organization reveled in landing one of baseball's top free agents and perhaps a reclaimed identity as one of the major players in the sport. Now, Soto shares in a major piece of the responsibility in taking that vision one step further.\n\n\"I think that’s why you play baseball, to be a championship player and try to win and try to win as many as you can,\" Soto said. \"At the end of the day, you can have all the stuff and everything but if you don’t win, it's kind of hard.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2022/08/02/mlb-trade-deadline-live-updates-rumors-news-tuesday/10209474002/", "title": "MLB trade deadline: Juan Soto to Padres tops MLB deals, signings ...", "text": "Juan Soto’s trade to the San Diego Padres was the top headline on MLB’s trade deadline day, but some other big names were dealt as contenders jockey for the stretch run.\n\nEarlier in the day, the 23-year-old Soto was traded by Washington just three years after winning the World Series. The Nationals got MacKenzie Gore, Luke Voit and four prospects in exchange for the next 2½ years of Soto’s career.\n\nAmong a flurry of moves before clock struck 6 p.m. ET, the Atlanta Braves landed reliever Raisel Iglesias, the Blue Jays got two-time All-Star Whit Merrifield and the Phillies made a deal for starter Noah Syndergaard.\n\nCatch up on everything that happened Tuesday:\n\nPreviously-unvaxxed Whit Merrifield going to the Blue Jays\n\nThe Royals sent utility man Whit Merrifield to the Blue Jays just minutes before Tuesday’s trade deadline, even though the two-time All-Star was unvaccinated against COVID-19 and had to miss Kansas City’s trip to Toronto last month.\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\nMerrifield drew the ire of Royals fans when, prior to their trip to Toronto, he said: “Something happens and I happen to get on a team that has a chance to go play in Canada in the postseason, maybe that changes.”\n\nMerrifield is making $7 million this season and is due $2.75 million next season along with a $4 million bonus for spending fewer than 110 days on the injured list in 2022.

Los Angeles is getting lefty Tucker Davidson and righty Jesse Chavez in return.\n\nThe 32-year-old Iglesias received Cy Young votes last season and signed a four-year $58 million extension with the Angels this past offseason. His 3.17 FIP (4.04 ERA) suggest that he's been unlucky so far in 2022. Iglesias joins closer Kenley Jansen and lefty A.J.

Hosmer is due $39 million from 2023-2025 and Boston will also receive cash in the deal\n\nPadres get Brandon Drury in latest deal\n\nSan Diego followed up on the Soto trade by making a move for Reds utilityman Brandon Drury, who was enjoying a career year in Cincinnati with 20 HR and 59 RBI in 92 games.\n\nThe 29-year-old has played all four infield positions this year – primarily third base – and has experience in the outfield. Drury could get at-bats at designated hitter the Padres' new-look lineup with Soto and first baseman Josh Bell.\n\nThe Reds are getting 18-year-old shortstop prospect Victor Acosta, the Padres' sixth-ranked prospect (after the Soto trade) according to MLB.com.\n\nTwins make move for Reds righty Tyler Mahle\n\nWith two of the best pitchers available on the trade market, the Cincinnati Reds opted to boost their farm system. The Reds traded right-handed starting pitcher Tyler Mahle to the Minnesota Twins for a group of three prospects Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe prospects include infielder Spencer Steer, left-hander Steven Hajjar and third baseman Christian Encarnacion-Strand. Steer is the headliner, rated No. 4 in the Twins' organization by Baseball America. Hajjar is rated No. 11 and Encarnacion-Strand is ranked No. 14.\n\nMahle had a 5-7 record and a 4.40 ERA in 19 starts with the Reds this season, striking out 114 and walking 39 in 104 1/3 innings. He made two starts ahead of the trade deadline after a stint on the 15-day injured list with a right shoulder strain.\n\nIt’s the second time the Reds have traded a starting pitcher to the Twins this season. They swapped Sonny Gray for pitching prospect Chase Petty in March.\n\n– Bobby Nightengale, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nDavid Robertson to close for Phillies\n\nSeemingly always in the market for bullpen help, the Philadelphia Phillies struck a deal with the Chicago Cubs for closer David Robertson.\n\nAn All-Star in 2011 with the New York Yankees, Robertson made only 19 appearances from 2019-21 because of injuries. However, he's rebounded in a big way with the Cubs this year, posting a 2.23 ERA with 14 saves.\n\nClass A right-hander Ben Brown, 22, goes to Chicago in the deal.\n\nNL East contenders set to add outfielders\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies have struck a deal to land outfielder Brandon Marsh from the Los Angeles Angels. In return, the Angels receive catching prospect Logan O'Hoppe, FanSided's Robert Murray reports.\n\nMarsh, 24, is a speedy outfielder who can fill the Phillies need in center. However, he has the highest strikeout rate of any qualified hitter in the majors this season at 36.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Mets are acquiring outfielder/first baseman Darin Ruf from the San Francisco Giants in exchange for veteran third baseman J.D. Davis and prospects, according to Joel Sherman of the New York Post.\n\nRuf, who has a .886 OPS vs. left-handers this season, gives the Mets a right-handed complement to lefty sluggers Dan Vogelbach and Tyler Naquin, who were also acquired just before the deadline.\n\nDodgers acquire OF Joey Gallo from Yankees\n\nOne of the surest bets of this year's trade deadline was that the New York Yankees would part ways with outfielder Joey Gallo, whom they acquired to much fanfare at last year's trade deadline.\n\nHowever, in Gallo's one year in the Bronx, he has gone from an All-Star and Gold Glove defender to a struggling part-timer. In 140 games in pinstripes, he has produced a .159/.291/.368 slash line with 25 home runs and a whopping 194 strikeouts.\n\nIn a recent interview, Gallo was quite candid about his struggles, both physically and mentally, in New York.\n\nOnce the Yankees picked up left-handed hitting outfielder Andrew Benintendi from the Royals, Gallo's days were clearly numbered.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed to send 23-year-old Class AA right-hander Clayton Beeter to the Yankees for Gallo, according to multiple media reports.\n\nBeeter is the Dodgers' No. 15 prospect, according to MLB.com.\n\nBlue Jays bolster bullpen in deal with Marlins\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays added a pair of relievers for the stretch run, acquiring right-handers Anthony Bass and Zach Pop from the Miami Marlins for shortstop prospect Jordan Groshans.\n\nBass has been outstanding this season, with a 1.41 ERA, 0.94 WHIP and just one home run allowed over 44 ⅔ innings. Pop has split time between Miami and Class AAA Jacksonville. They'll provide depth behind closer Jason Romano.\n\nGroshans, a top-100 overall prospect entering this season, has struggled at Class AAA Buffalo, posting a .250/.348/.296 slash line with one home run in 279 plate appearances.\n\nJuan Soto trade to Padres now official\n\nThe San Diego Padres are making a huge statement in their bid to reach the World Series by landing the trade deadline's biggest prize, agreeing to acquire All-Star outfielder Juan Soto and first baseman Josh Bell from the Washington Nationals.\n\nIn return, the Nationals receive first baseman Luke Voit, left-hander MacKenzie Gore and a package of four prospects, shortstop C.J. Abrams, outfielders Robert Hassell III and James Wood, and right-hander Jarlin Susana.\n\nANALYSIS: Padres show they're all-in with Soto, Hader acquisitions\n\nVeteran first baseman Eric Hosmer was originally part of the Nationals' haul for Soto and Bell -- however, he has a limited no-trade clause that prohibited him from being traded to several teams, including the Nationals, without his permission.\n\nHowever, Voit was later added to the trade so it could be finalized.\n\nEarlier this season, the Soto turned down a record-breaking 15-year, $440 million contract offer to stay with the Nationals. Even though the deal would have been the largest in baseball history, it would only average $29.33 million per year -- making him the 20th highest-paid player in annual value.\n\nTwins pick up Orioles closer Jorge Lopez\n\nDesperate for bullpen help, the Minnesota Twins have acquired 2022 AL All-Star Jorge Lopez from the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nThe O's will receive left-hander Cade Povich, right-handed reliever Yennier Cano and additional low-level prospects in exchange for the 29-year-old Lopez.\n\nIn by far the best season of his seven-year career, Lopez has made the transition from struggling starter (3-14, 6.07 ERA in 2021) to lights-out closer -- converting 19 of 23 save chances and pitching to an ERA of 1.68 in 44 appearances.\n\nThe Twins have gone through several closers after trading 2021 All-Star Taylor Rogers to the Padres this spring. Emilio Pagan leads the team with nine saves, but has blown six other save chances and has an ERA of 4.75. Five other Twins relievers have picked up at least one save.\n\nFantasy winners and losers (so far) from deadline deals\n\nMLB teams aren't the only ones looking to improve their rosters at the trade deadline. In the upcoming issue of USA TODAY Sports Weekly, Steve Gardner offers his winners and losers from a fantasy standpoint. Here are a few of each:\n\nWINNERS\n\nSP Luis Castillo, Mariners. Somehow, Castillo managed to put up a 2.86 ERA and 1.07 WHIP with Cincinnati – in one of the most homer-happy ballparks in the majors. In Seattle, he’ll have a much more neutral home park and a better defense behind him. The schedule helps as well with the M's having 25 games left against sub-.500 division opponents the Angels, Rangers and A's -- and none against the first-place Astros.\n\nRP Devin Williams, Brewers. MLB saves leader Josh Hader's fantasy value wasn’t going to change whether or not he changed teams. Once he did though, going from the Brewers to the Padres, Williams’ immediately becomes a top-10 fantasy closer in Milwaukee. Possibly top five. (The Orioles' Felix Bautista gets a similar boost in value with Jorge Lopez traded to Minnesota.)\n\n1B Trey Mancini, Astros. Mancini was one of the hitters most impacted by the Orioles moving the left field wall back 30 feet this season. After hitting 14 homers at Camden Yards a year ago, Mancini had just five there this season (one of them of the inside-the-park variety). Hitting fly balls at a career-high rate, the Crawford Boxes in Houston, by comparison, should seem like just a short pop fly away for Mancini.\n\nLOSERS\n\nSP Frankie Montas, Yankees. With the Mariners landing Castillo first, the Yankees made a strong and successful push for the No. 2 starting pitcher on the market. Montas’ 4-9 record belies his excellent 3.18 ERA and 1.18 WHIP. However, he has taken full advantage of the spacious Oakland Coliseum this season. Over 12 starts in Oakland, Montas has a 2.06 ERA; in seven starts on the road, his ERA is over 5.00.\n\nOF David Peralta, Rays. Primarily a platoon hitter, Peralta shouldn’t see much of a change in his role playing primarily against right-handers. However, the AL East is the toughest division in the majors and the Rays like to tweak their lineups more than most teams. The Rays also acquired outfielder Jose Siri on Monday and should have Manuel Margot and Harold Ramirez coming back off the injured list soon.\n\nFantasy managers in AL- and NL-only leagues. This could change with a flurry of activity on deadline day. But as the final 24 hours of trading began ticking down, the number of inter-division deals was disappointingly small. Perhaps the possibility of a Juan Soto trade has kept a number of other deals on hold. No matter the reason, hoarding one’s FAAB dollars until the last minute in hopes of grabbing a superstar from the opposite league seems to be yet again a dangerous gamble.\n\nPadres front-runners in Soto sweepstakes?\n\nThe San Diego Padres are now seen by multiple observers as the \"most motivated\" team to put together a package for Juan Soto, in the words of The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal.\n\nThey have several high-level prospects -- including shortstop C.J. Abrams and outfielder Robert Hassell III -- which would be essential to creating a package the Nationals would accept.\n\nBarry Svrluga of the Washington Post goes even further, calling the Padres the \"most likely landing spot\" for Soto. In addition, he says the Padres could also acquire first baseman Josh Bell as part of a Soto deal.\n\nWhat makes the Padres different from the other rumored suitors for Soto is that they might have a bit more trouble getting him to sign a long-term extension before he becomes a free agent at the end of the 2024 season. That's because they already have two huge contracts already on the books in Fernando Tatis (14 years, $340 million) and Manny Machado (10 years, $340 million). However, Machado's contract does allow him to opt out after the 2024 season.\n\nAccording to USA TODAY's Bob Nightengale, the Padres wouldn't necessarily have to deplete their farm system for years to come if they acquired Soto. They could always trade him for more top prospects before he becomes a free agent.\n\n5 biggest trades from Monday\n\nYankees land Frankie Montas, have improved everywhere\n\nThe New York Yankees have been sitting atop the baseball world all season, but were much more worried about their team than they ever publicly revealed.\n\nSo, what did they do?\n\nThey grabbed Oakland A’s ace Frankie Montas on Monday when they couldn’t get Cincinnati Reds ace Luis Castillo. They passed on Brewers All-Star closer Josh Hader, who went to San Diego, but turned around and acquired Oakland closer Lou Trivino in the Montas trade. They acquired Cubs rookie reliever Scott Effross, too. They’re out on the Juan Soto sweepstakes, but acquired Andrew Benintendi from the Kansas City Royals last week.\n\n– Bob Nightengale, USA TODAY Sports\n\nBrewers think they can still win without Josh Hader\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers let teams know early in July that four-time All-Star closer Josh Hader was available, believing they could still win the NL Central without him, but warned the asking price would be steep.\n\nWell, they soon will find out if they’re correct in their assessment, trading Hader to the San Diego Padres on Monday for closer Trevor Rogers, starter Dinelson Lamet, pitching prospect Robert Gasser and outfield prospect Esteury Ruiz.\n\n\"Trading good players on good teams is difficult, and that certainly is the case with Josh,\" Brewers president David Stearns said. \"We also recognize that to give our organization the best chance for sustained competitiveness, to avoid the extended down periods that so many organizations experience, we must make decisions that are not easy.\"\n\n– Bob Nightengale, USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 2022 Tigers weren't supposed to be sellers. How it all went wrong.\n\nThere was a time, not too long ago, when the Detroit Tigers envisioned a much different approach at the 2022 trade deadline — 6 p.m. Tuesday, less than two hours before they play the Twins in Minnesota.\n\nOn paper, the Tigers were lined up to compete. But on the field, due to myriad injuries and poor performances, the Tigers have the third-worst record in the AL, and the offense — averaging 3.21 runs per game — is one of the worst in baseball history.\n\n\"I'm just trying to make sure our guys realize we put ourselves in this situation,\" manager A.J. Hinch said. \"We have to deal with the consequences of the stress, anxiousness, curiosity and the reality that, if I was on the outside and I had a contending club, I would have a few pieces that I would want here, too.\"\n\n– Evan Petzold, Detroit Free Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2022/08/07/mlb-trade-deadline-juan-soto-standings-playoff-odds/10259179002/", "title": "MLB trade deadline, Juan Soto deal created more questions in ...", "text": "The 2022 Major League Baseball trade deadline was absolutely breathtaking with 29 teams making deals, including the seismic eight-player Juan Soto swap between the San Diego Padres and Washington Nationals.\n\nNow that the smoke has cleared, it’s time to officially end any concerns that an expanded postseason would ruin the trade deadline.\n\nRemember the talk during the collective bargaining agreement negotiations that if the postseason was expanded from 10 teams to 12, the best teams may not be incentivized to make improvements?\n\nTry telling that to the New York Yankees, who are sitting with the best record in the American League and a 10 ½-game lead in the AL East, and still acquired ace Frankie Montas, outfielder Andrew Benintendi, and relievers Lou Trivino and Scott Effross.\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2024/11/05/mlb-top-free-agent-tracker-2024-2025-rankings/76054405007/", "title": "MLB top free agents: 120 best for 2024-2025, tracker as rumors swirl", "text": "Another year, another free agent ready to make history.\n\nThis time, it is Juan Soto’s turn to eat, with a very strong chance to exceed Shohei Ohtani’s heavily deferred 10-year, $700 million deal in current value.

Rankings based on projected future performance and perceived market value:\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\nDODGERS WIN WORLD SERIES: Celebrate with this commemorative coffee table book!\n\nAges on April 1, 2025\n\nOne of the most elite free agents in baseball history, thanks to his age, production similar to Hall of Famers like Ted Williams and Ken Griffey Jr. and an epic platform year in which he hit 41 home runs and only burnished his excellent postseason credentials. He will set a free agent record for largest contract, non-Ohtani division.\n\nSIGNED: 15 years, $765 million with Mets, Dec. 8.\n\nThis time around should go much better for Snell, who languished on the market until March and settled for a $64 million guarantee for two years. He wisely opted out after striking out a career-high 12.5 per nine innings in 20 starts and throwing a no-hitter, for good measure. The Giants badly need him back, but there will be competition.\n\nSIGNED: Five years, $182 million, with Dodgers, Nov. 26.\n\nBurnes vs. Snell is an interesting subplot on this market: Both are Scott Boras clients, both have a Cy Young Award on the shelf and both should have nine-figure deals attached to their name come February. After winning the ’21 NL Cy with a 2.94 ERA and 1.63 FIP in just 167 innings, Burnes has posted seasons of 202, 193 ⅔ and 194 ⅓ innings pitched since, while largely maintaining that dominance.\n\nCan Jim Crane casually let another core player to their dynasty walk as the product withers? With Bregman’s $100 million extension expired, he’ll take his first Gold Glove and a rousing endorsement from Crane favorite Jose Altuve to the market. A career .848 OPS (132 adjusted) will bring plenty of suitors – and require action lest Bregman join Carlos Correa and George Springer as ex-Astros.\n\nTo what extent is Alonso’s fate tied to that of the No. 1 player on this list? It’s unclear if Mets owner Steve Cohen will make a drive for Soto, and even more intriguing is how badly he wants Alonso back and whether new baseball chief David Stearns is willing to bid irrationally to keep him. The price probably went up when Alonso – who hit 226 homers in six seasons – sparked an epic playoff run with a season-saving shot at Milwaukee.\n\nWelcome to the first non-Boras client on this list. Fried has had forearm flareups the past two seasons but his stuff still plays just fine and his mastery of a six-pitch mix only seems to grow each season. A career 3.07 ERA and an elite 140 adjusted ERA.\n\nHe played on a one-year, $23 million, heavily-deferred make-good deal and Hernández made plenty good. He hit 33 homers, posted an .840 OPS, made his second All-Star team and then hit three homers and drove in a dozen runs in the Dodgers’ World Series run. L.A. loves Teo, but it will cost a premium to bring him back.\n\nHe can be a linchpin for a playoff club, and hit 31, 24 and 32 homers the past three seasons. Yet Adames’ market might be tempered a bit by how clubs project that bat will age. He has a lifetime .322 OBP and those home runs came with 166, 165 and 173 strikeouts the past three years. Still, he’s an absolute dude that can change the culture of a middling team.\n\nSIGNED: Seven years, $182 million with Giants, Dec. 7.\n\nA perfectly timed platform year, as Santander slammed 44 homers – third in the majors and most by a switch-hitter – with an .814 OPS. While his age and longer career sample (.307 lifetime OBP) might affect the length of his deal, Santander should have multiple suitors for a three- to five-year deal for a solid annual value.\n\nMaybe the most maddening player on this list, as Torres was a two-time All-Star by 22, dipped below league average hitter two years later and finally found his level, it seems, with a career 112 adjusted OPS. Last year was a similar microcosm: Lousy first half, great second half, clutch playoff performance marred by a misplay or two. Highest-ranked player on this list not to receive a qualifying offer among those eligible.\n\nEovaldi declined his $20 million player option, and for good reason: He’s still among the game’s most reliable starters even as he couldn’t quite replicate his 2023 performance, when he was the Rangers’ World Series hero. Still, he’s averaged 27 starts, 152 innings pitched, a 3.76 ERA and 1.16 WHIP the past four seasons. One more big bite at the free agency apple.\n\nHouston gave up multiple prospects to rent Kikuchi and he shined as an Astro, posting a 2.70 ERA in 10 starts, and the Astros won the first nine of them. Will suitors bid on that guy, or the lefty who struggled to a 4.75 ERA in 22 starts for Toronto?\n\nSIGNED: Three years, $63 million with Angels, Nov. 25.\n\nPerhaps some of it was Fenway Park, but O’Neill slugged 31 homers in 113 games, and is just three seasons removed from a 34-homer season in St. Louis. Not much pop like that, younger than 30, no less, on the market.\n\nSIGNED: Three years, $49.5 million with Orioles, Dec. 7.\n\nAfter two trades and four teams in two years, Flaherty may yet find his permanent home. His 3.17 ERA in 162 innings for Detroit and Los Angeles was his best since 2019, and while he had a bit of a good start/bad start thing going in the postseason, his Game 1 gems in the NLCS and World Series were pretty good platforms.\n\nThe best reliever on the market isn’t your standard ninth-inning guy, although Scott did save 18 games in Miami before a trade to San Diego. No, his greater appeal is locking down elite portions of the opposing lineup regardless of inning, and his 188 strikeouts over 150 innings with a 1.05 WHIP the past two seasons are a delectable sample.\n\nAs the Best First Base Option Not Named Pete Alonso, Walker will be in solid demand this year, perhaps even by the Polar Bear’s former team. He’s coming off three excellent seasons in Arizona, with home run totals between 26 and 36 and adjusted OPS marks from 121 to 125. A really good veteran fit for contenders missing a last piece.\n\nAnd so begins the dice-rolling portion of our rankings, so strap in for the next 100 or so. Buehler hit health and performance potholes in his return from a second Tommy John surgery, but he’s also the only one holding a pose the entire winter – after striking out two on one days’ rest to close out the World Series.\n\nKim had 5- and 6-WAR seasons before injuries limited him to 121 games this season. Yet his age and his peak – think 17 homers, 38 steals and multi-position excellence – are worth betting on.\n\nAfter years of short-term commitments and opt-ins and outs, Manaea finally had a platform season worth going to the market on, making 32 starts with a career-best 3.47 ERA, 1.08 WHIP and consecutive playoff wins against the Phillies and Dodgers in the NLDS and NLCS.\n\nWhat to do with Biebs? He’ll be almost a year removed from Tommy John surgery by Opening Day and a standard one-year commitment with an option to protect both team and player would make sense. But this is just the first TJ for Bieber, and he should be healthier than he’s been since winning the 2020 AL Cy Young Award. Maybe it’s just a pillow contract, but there’s runway for both a team and the player to get creative in a bigger way.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $14 million, with Guardians, Dec. 6.\n\nThe capital-C closer has more or less gone the way of the sacrifice bunt, but Estévez comes as close as anyone to filling that bill. He has an 86% save percentage the past two seasons and cut his ERA from 3.90 to 2.45 in 2024, even as his strikeouts per nine innings fell from 11.3 to 8.2.\n\nThe man is a paradox: A 10.0 career strikeouts per nine – paired with a 4.76 ERA. A career-low 2.2 walk rate in 2024 – but an adjusted ERA that was barely league average. Yet Pivetta’s right arm is one worth wagering on, as he’s averaged better than a strikeout per inning three of the last four seasons and two years ago pitched a career-high 179 ⅔ innings. A pretty good bet someone will believe they can unlock another level on his elite curveball and shed the “enigmatic Canadian” tag for good.\n\nAn All-Star in 2024 who faded in September and in the playoffs, Hoffman nonetheless represents one of the better relief arms in this class. Had a 1.12 ERA in first half, 3.81 in the second, but had a 2.28 ERA, 0.94 WHIP and 2.54 WHIP in two seasons with Phillies.\n\nHe’s 38 wins from 300 and three years from 45, the age he’d at least like to try to pitch through. Injuries limited him to 90 ⅓ innings last season and so his 2025 option did not vest at $35 million. How much are teams now willing to pay for a Hall of Famer now more likely to give them five really good innings 20 to 25 times a year?\n\nOne of the great “pillow contract” success stories in recent years, as Severino admittedly was one of the worst pitchers in baseball in 2023 but found success across town at Citi Field. Most notably, he’s healthy: Severino’s 31 starts and 182 innings pitched were his most since 2018, his second consecutive All-Star season.\n\nSIGNED: Three years, $67 million, with Athletics, Dec. 5.\n\nHe’s been a Dodger for five years now, minus the 2023 campaign he missed due to rotator-cuff surgery, and finished with a flourish: 2 ⅓ scoreless innings to enable L.A.’s wild comeback in Game 5 of the World Series. Perhaps both parties realize they’re best when together, as Treinen has a 2.29 ERA in 154 career innings as a Dodger.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $22 million with Dodgers, Dec. 8.\n\nA litany of arm issues limited him to between eight to 15 starts the past four years, but Boyd just might parlay a playoff platform into a nice payday. He did not pitch for Cleveland this season until Aug. 8, then fashioned a 2.72 ERA in eight starts. He followed up with three playoff starts in which he gave up just one earned run in 11 ⅔ innings. A multiyear deal is likely in the offing.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $29 million with Cubs, Dec. 2.\n\nMartinez performed excellently in a swing role in his only year in Cincinnati and thus declined his 2025 player option. He covered 142 innings while making 16 starts, maintaining a 1.02 WHIP and walking barely one batter per nine innings. Well-suited to the versatility modern clubs prefer out of their best arms.\n\nSIGNED: Accepted one-year, $21.05 million qualifying offer from Reds, Nov. 18.\n\nLike Manaea and Severino, Quintana quaffed readily from the fountain of youth in Queens, making 31 starts and topping 170 innings for the first time since 2019. Given his age, that may not get him much of a raise from the $13 million he made the past two seasons, but Quintana will certainly have options.\n\nThere’s a first baseman on the market who hit 22 homers with a .302 OBP and a career-high tying 173 strikeouts. Does it change the impression if it turns that is indeed Goldschmidt, who just two years ago was named NL MVP? Yet in 2024, Goldschmidt slipped below league average as a hitter, though he was still worth 1.3 WAR. His market will likely reflect his reclamation project status, but the right situation – perhaps in his Houston hometown? – could unearth more production.\n\nA great comeback story rolls on, as Yates missed all but nine games of 2021-22 with injuries but made 61 appearances each of the past two seasons, earning All-Star honors, posting a 1.17 ERA and saving 33 games in Texas last year. Perhaps a little more wedded to the ninth than other relievers, but plenty of contenders would be fine with that.\n\nKind of the AL equivalent to Jeff Hoffman, as Holmes went from All-Star to late-season enigma. Yet Holmes did rally very nicely in the postseason, adjusting to a set-up role after he was moved off the closer job and posting 11 scoreless outings in 13 appearances, including five World Series appearances in which he gave up just one hit and two walks.\n\nSIGNED: Three years, $38 million, with Mets.\n\nA handful of leg injuries limited Kepler to a career-low 105 games and eight home runs; he’d hit 24 in 2023 and 36 in the juiced-ball year of 2019. With various ups and downs throughout his career, Kepler lands just north of a league average hitter – a 102 career adjusted OPS – with the ability to play a serviceable corner outfield.\n\nNew York declined Rizzo’s $17 million team option, and now the sides must debate whether to renew acquaintances a third time after his 2021 trade from the Cubs. It’s complicated: Rizzo and franchise player Aaron Judge are close friends and clubhouse leaders, but Rizzo has been limited to 99 and 92 games (posting a .673 OPS) the past two seasons and the club needs roster flexibility.\n\nHow much does Scherzer have left? His nine starts in 2024 might not be the best gauge, as Scherzer returned from back surgery and then suffered from shoulder fatigue and a hamstring injury. He’s still effective – a 3.16 ERA and 1.03 WHIP in 59 starts since 2022 – but the body is sometimes not willing. A solid guarantee and bankable incentives should create a good match with a contender.\n\nThe lone player from Korea or Japan known to be certainly coming to the majors, Kim is reportedly an adept defender with decent power who impressed the Dodgers in an exhibition game last March. The domestic second base market certainly can use a vital, still-developing player.\n\nThis may not be the year Lorenzen finds the security of a multiyear commitment, but that doesn’t mean he won’t be valued by upper-division squads. Lorenzen made playoff rosters in Philadelphia and Kansas City after midseason trades the past two seasons, and logged a 3.31 ERA – 121 adjusted – over 130 ⅓ innings for Texas and the Royals last year.\n\nAs if the man wasn’t valued enough already for his elite on-base skills and veteran savvy, now Santana will take a Gold Glove with him to the market. At 38, he was a 2.5 win player who drilled 23 homers. Always room for an elite first base glove that can switch hit.\n\nPerhaps there’s a little projection with this one, but after years of injuries and false starts, Ross seemed to find a groove as a swingman in Milwaukee last year, his 3.77 ERA backed up by a 3.83 FIP in 74 innings, with just nine homers allowed. Seems like betting on the next step would be wise.\n\nNot a totally lost two years in San Francisco as Conforto’s first grab at free agency was truncated by a shoulder injury that sidelined him all of 2022. From ’23 to ’24, he boosted his homers from 15 to 20, his hard-hit ball rate from 39.8% to 46% and played in 130 games, most since 2019. Are suitors convinced he’s an everyday player?\n\nSIGNED: One year, $17 million with Dodgers, Dec. 8.\n\nWas almost exactly a league-average starter in his two years in Texas, which included a World Series championship.\n\nFinally an All-Star at 31 and then one of the driving forces behind the game’s hottest second half team. Profar easily had his most productive season – 3.7 WAR, 24 homers both career highs – and the question now is whether he’s a snug fit in San Diego or if he could take his revamped game elsewhere.\n\nWhat a sneaky-good year: 23 homers, a 151 adjusted OPS and nearly 3 WAR, highest since 2019. Pederson took just 42 plate appearances against left-handers, illustrating the Diamondbacks’ disciplined and effective usage.\n\nAthletic, young, useful, yet still inconsistent. Verdugo played in the game’s two most demanding markets and lived to tell about it, although his tale of two halves in New York (.764 OPS through June 2, .575 thereafter) will temper some market enthusiasm.\n\nInnings-eater deluxe back on the market seeking his fourth team in as many years. They’ll know what they’re getting: Gibson posted 167 ⅔, 192 and 169 ⅔ innings pitched with Philadelphia, Baltimore and St. Louis, with a 4.68 ERA and 1.33 WHIP. Ideal for emerging teams with young starters.\n\nThe human victory cigar lit up another postseason, going 5 for 11 for Kansas City in the ALDS and boosting his career postseason OPS to .823 in 136 plate appearances. Yet his finer work might have come for the sad-sack White Sox, where he maintained a .710 OPS for the worst team in modern baseball history.\n\nIt’s likely Braves or the easy chair for the 17-year veteran who posted for 30 starts in his age-40 season.\n\nThis space has long respected Iglesias, who mysteriously had to scamper for minor-league deals in recent years despite solid production and the wisdom of a veteran. But after a hit single and a stunning Mets renaissance after he was added to the roster in June, Iglesias finished second in WAR (3.1) for the NL runner-ups and shouldn’t need to wait until March for a job. OMG = Only Major-League Guarantees.\n\nEnjoyed a nice renaissance in Philly – posting a 2.65 ERA and a 1.04 WHIP on the fringes of their starting rotation – before a lat strain ended his season before July. A useful arm to augment any staff.\n\nHip surgery ended his season in September, but the Night Shift alum was solid in the 39 games he did pitch, with a 1.02 WHIP and 35 strikeouts. Topped 60 appearances four times in seven full seasons.\n\nRea landed on the market somewhat surprisingly, with the Brewers placing him on waivers and then declining his $5.5 million option. He’ll probably do about as well on the market, as a solid back-end rotation option that won 12 games, started 27 and gave Milwaukee 167 ⅔ innings last year.\n\nStill finds a way to get it done, as he converted 56 of 64 save chances (88%) in two years with Boston. Just 31 saves from 478 in his career, tying Lee Smith for third place on the all-time list.\n\nFlourished after leaving Pittsburgh, as one does, posting a 3.46 ERA in 10 starts with San Diego after a 5.20 mark in 16 outings with Pirates. Just two years removed from a 196-inning, All-Star season, but bidders should temper their enthusiasm for a veteran with a 1.45 career WHIP.\n\nHe turned down a player option because, even though he turns 40 in April, Robertson believes he can do better on the market. And who’s to doubt him? Robertson’s 72 innings were a career high, and he maintained a 1.11 WHIP and 2.65 FIP.\n\nA one-time All-Star, Kittredge was solid in his only year with St. Louis (2.80 ERA, 1.13 WHIP). Not the strikeout guy he was in Tampa Bay, but plenty effective.\n\nWilliams enjoyed a second-year renaissance in Washington, posting a 2.03 ERA and slashing his home runs allowed from 34 (2.1 per nine innings) to three (0.4). A shoulder injury limited Williams to 13 starts and 66 2/3 innings, but he did return at year’s end to make two starts and is an adequate twice-around-the-order back-ender.\n\nEnergetic and athletic, Bader has fallen off at the plate, his adjusted OPS tumbling from 114 in 2021 to 80 the past three seasons. Still has defensive value as an extra outfielder or platoon guy against left-handers.\n\nOstensibly a throw-in in the Juan Soto blockbuster, Higashioka added power to his game, socking 17 homers and earning the lion’s share of playing time behind the plate in San Diego. A .212 career hitter but a valued receiver and veteran presence.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $13.5 million with Rangers, Dec. 2.\n\nRelegated to a minor-league contract last February, Winker performed well enough for Washington to flip him to New York, where he seized folk and playoff hero status. He backed up his solid 118 adjusted OPS with seven hits in 22 postseason at-bats, and can still play a decent left field.\n\nA significant surprise Atlanta did not pick up d’Arnaud’s $8 million option, given his clubhouse leadership and decent production over the years. An All-Star in 2022, d’Arnaud might be most effective in a timeshare but would bring plenty to a contending team.\n\nSIGNED: Two years, $12 million with Angels, Nov. 12.\n\nThis might be the last call for the 6-foot-8 Texan, who was limited to 44 ⅓ innings but still struck out 50 and yielded a 1.13 WHIP. Says he’ll likely retire after 2025.\n\nUnlike 2023, when Chapman was dealt from Kansas City to Texas and won a World Series, the lefty reliever was marooned in Pittsburgh all year, during which he posted a 1.35 WHIP, second-worst in his 15-year career. Velocity on his sinker and four-seam fastball ticked down from 2023 (101.1, 99 mph, respectively to 2024 (99.8, 97.8).\n\nSIGNED: One year, $10.75 million with Red Sox, Dec. 3.\n\nNot a great year for the 6-foot-4 slugger, whose .720 OPS was his lowest in a full season, yet Arizona still saw fit to acquire him from Miami. Nineteen homers, 23 doubles and league-average OPS will always have a home.\n\nHis two years in New York marked a nice career renaissance, as he struck out 10.2 batters per nine innings and posted a 179 adjusted ERA. Played a crucial role in postseason, posting eight scoreless outings until giving up the tying and go-ahead runs in World Series Game 5.\n\nHe’ll get another World Series ring, as the Dodgers released him toward the end of August, yet he still provided a nice boost in his six weeks with Houston. Heyward still has the juice defensively, as he batted .211 with a 98 adjusted OPS yet was still worth 1.2 WAR in 87 games.\n\nStill a potent outfield platoon force, as he hit 12 homers with an .875 OPS, including a .914 mark against lefties.\n\nA rough few seasons marred by injury and his walk year was no different. A trade from Toronto to Boston did not yield any extra production from the Fenway factor (his OPS dropping from .671 to .623). Yet Jansen is young for a free agent catcher and will try to sell suitors on the fact that just two years ago, he was a 3-win player with an .855 OPS.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $8.5 million with Rays, Dec. 6.\n\nAveraged 66 appearances the past two years and maintained a 3.64 ERA and 8.6 strikeouts per nine in that stretch.\n\nHeld lefties to a .161 average, .419 OPS and zero home runs in 67 plate appearances.\n\nGarcia dominated in Toronto, striking out 42 in 30 innings, but struggled in 10 games after a midseason trade to Seattle before getting shut down with right elbow inflammation.\n\nSimply one of the greatest postseason players of all time, Hernández managed to tread water during the regular season, batting .229 with an 85 adjusted OPS but logging 1.2 WAR thanks to his defensive acumen and versatility. But oh, that postseason: An .808 OPS and two homers in 14 games, and a pair of rally-starting hits in the decisive World Series Game 5.\n\nJust a little better than a replacement-level backstop, Kelly fared better in Detroit last season (.716 OPS) than after a July trade to Texas (.634)\n\nWord is J.T. is not yet ready to hang ‘em up, and the veteran can still bring value: A .354 OBP and 114 adjusted OPS for Toronto and Seattle. His 11 homers were his fewest since 2014.\n\nYet another “will he retire?” situation, although Lynn still gutted through 23 starts and 117 ⅓ innings with a 3.84 ERA. Might be challenging to match up a contending team with one that has low-end innings-eating needs, however.\n\nA perfect timeshare candidate, as he produced a career-best .357 OBP and .810 OPS with nine homers in 81 games.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $2 million with Rockies, Nov. 20.\n\nA moderate surprise the Orioles turned down Coulombe’s 2024 option, as he was one of the AL’s most reliable lefties the past two seasons (2.56 ERA, 0.95 WHIP). Coulombe did have June surgery to remove bone spurs from his throwing elbow, though he did return to post four scoreless outings in September, plus one more in the wild-card series.\n\nA lifesaver in Atlanta this year after Austin Riley’s injury, Urshela proved he can be a valued part-time or bench contributor and reliable defensive presence.\n\nTeams hope to capture Sims’ 10.4 career strikeouts per nine innings, and not the 6.43 ERA he produced in 15 games after a trade from Cincinnati to Boston.\n\nA deadline trade acquisition the past two seasons, Canha has churned through the Mets, Brewers, Tigers and Giants, producing a .350 OBP and 104 adjusted OPS all the while.\n\nFor the first time since 2013, Smyly did not start a single game, his 50 appearances and 3.84 ERA all coming in relief. Walk rate soared to 3.8, but Smyly otherwise is a versatile and useful lefty.\n\nClevinger underwent disc replacement neck surgery in August, a malady tied to elbow inflammation that limited him to four starts before his season ended. He’d produced a 3.77 ERA over 24 starts in 2023.\n\nRarely dominant but also useful, his effectiveness ticking up as his innings pitched have decreased from 177 in 2018 to 67 last year. Adapting with the game, you might say.\n\nThe Professor says he’s not yet ready to leave the faculty lounge, even if he’s no longer calling Wrigley Field home. Hendricks posted career worsts in ERA (5.92) and hits per nine innings (10.1), but produced a 3.74 ERA the previous season.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $2.5 million with Angels, Nov. 6.\n\nSensing the retirement theme? Martinez may call it quits after hitting 331 career homers but enduring a middling season in Queens. He’ll need an offer from a contender and ample playing time, not entirely out of the question given he’s just a year removed from a 33-homer, 103-RBI year with the Dodgers.\n\nConsider this a personal services contract with solid production. McCutchen seems primed for a third consecutive year on a one-year deal back in the ‘burgh, where he hit 20 home runs in 120 games, producing a 105 adjusted OPS.\n\nDoes the battle-scarred righty still have another deal awaiting? Recovery from hip surgery delayed Cobb’s return to the Giants, and they traded him to Cleveland, although he wasn’t ready to pitch until Aug. 9. He managed three solid starts and two more in the playoffs before a strained back forced his removal from the roster. We can’t imagine Cobb will go out like that.\n\nCatching the ball will always have value and in 2024, Newman even hit .278, to boot. Your favorite shortstop’s favorite shortstop.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $2.75 million, with Angels, Nov. 14.\n\nGraveman nearly made it back to the mound for Houston this year, running out of runway once the club was eliminated in the wild-card round, but he’s recovered from January shoulder surgery to very much be in play for 2025.\n\nGrandal was limited to 72 games last season and has only topped 100 once since 2019.\n\nShelved for the World Series run after missing nearly three months with shoulder injuries, Kelly said he intends to pitch again in 2025; a reunion in L.A. for the SoCal native would make sense, as Kelly cn still touch 98 mph on the radar gun even as other peripherals have slipped with time.\n\nAfter a well-chronicled exit in New York, López pitched well for Chicago after joining them in June, posting a 2.03 ERA in 26 ⅔ innings.\n\nSomebody had to wear it on the South Side and most often, it was Flexen, the pitcher of record for 15 of the White Sox’s 121 losses. Yet making 30 starts and producing 160 innings amid such conditions is almost an accomplishment itself.\n\nAfter a 2023 season limited to 14 minor-league appearances, Strickland made an admirable big league return, posting a 1.09 WHIP across 72 appearances for the Angels.\n\nLike a boomerang, Neris was acquired by the Astros from Chicago for the playoff drive, although neither club nor reliever could fully reclaim their glory: He had a 4.70 ERA and gave up four homers in 15 ⅓ innings in Houston.\n\nHis WHIP blew up to 1.32, worst in a full season since 2019, but Leclerc did strike out 89 batters in 66 1/3 innings. Swings and misses get phone calls.\n\nA tough season ended in mid-September when a neck injury sent Sewald to the injured list, a grim coda to a year that saw him lose his closer’s job and post a 7.71 ERA in his final seven innings. A decent change-of-scenery situation.\n\nLiberated by a mid-season release by the White Sox, the lefty groundball specialist flourished for the Yankees, with a 1.02 WHIP and just two homers in 44 innings. He pitched in 10 of their 14 postseason games, retiring 25 of 32 batters faced and giving up just one earned run.\n\nValued in Baltimore for his toughness, pitch calling ability and leadership, McCann also hit eight homers and nearly produced at a league average level at the plate. Modest numbers, but more than enough characteristics to stick as someone’s No. 2 catcher.\n\nWeird year: So-so in Seattle, traded to New York, struggled with Mets yet still ended up in their postseason bullpen circle of trust. Still gets it up to 98 mph, so dial up another one-year deal.\n\nThe OG Bulk Guy, you might say, Yarbrough will get a World Series ring from L.A. but was dealt to Toronto for Kevin Kiermaier. The rare pitch-to-contact guy who finds more than enough outs (3.19 ERA, 1.03 WHIP).\n\nJankowski’s offense fell off significantly (.508 OPS in ’24, .689 in ’23) but he can still win games with his glove and has value as an extra outfielder.\n\nHas cycled through four teams in two years but his ability to competently play five positions balances his slightly below-average bat.\n\nFlopped in 40 games with Tampa Bay (4.58 ERA) and then flourished after trade to Mets, where he had a 0.84 WHIP in 31 appearances.\n\nThe hirsute southpaw shaved a run off his ERA, down to 3.51, while striking out 11.2 batters per nine innings.\n\nNow two years removed from missing two full seasons due to injury, making his 0-10, 4.95 ERA mark for the worst team in modern history more palatable. He’s still a big man with a big arm and just 27 years old.\n\nAll the man does is go to the playoffs. He helped guide Cleveland to the ALCS a year after winning it all in Texas and, thanks to his elite receiving ability and clubhouse leadership, will still have a home even after another season batting a career-low .152.\n\nSIGNED: One year, $4 million with Guardians, Nov. 6.\n\nVery much a part-time player these days, Gallo hit 10 homers for the Nationals in 76 games, eight of them against right-handers. Still young enough for someone to bite on that lefty power off the bench.\n\nNot good (5.13 ERA) with the Yankees, better with the Astros (3.86) as the life of an itinerant lefty rumbles on.\n\nSmith’s streak of three consecutive World Series titles ended, though his Royals did break a nine-year playoff drought. Even after back spasms and a down year, his phone will surely ring again.\n\nTwo years removed from All-Star Game MVP honors, Díaz produced capably for the Rockies before an August release enabled him to join the playoff-bound Padres. Likely someone’s backup in 2025.\n\nOne of the original Openers, Beeks now covers almost any inning you’d ask – 70 of them in 2024 – at a competent, league-average level.\n\nWhile Merrifield’s All-Star offensive form has deserted him, his legs are keeping him above water: He was 17-for-20 on stolen-base attempts in 2024.\n\nLess erratic (a 3.80 ERA in ’24, 6.45 in ’23) after cutting his four-seam usage from 21.7% to 6.3%.\n\nMid-leverage guys need homes, too. Barnes racked up eight relief wins and trimmed his ERA to 4.36, lowest since 2018.\n\nLed the majors with 79 appearances and lived to tell about it. Someone save this man from a summer in Sacramento.\n\nSIGNED: One year, with Athletics, Nov. 7.\n\nOttavino might already have hung ‘em up by the time you get around to reading this, but he’s open to pitching again given the opportunity. There figures to be one.\n\nStarting to become the poor man’s Tommy Pham, with playoff appearances each of the last three seasons, including a huge home run for the Padres this year. Professional hitter still valued.\n\nHis six-year, $140 million deal finally over, Corbin plans to pitch again even as he had the worst ERA among full-time starters three of the last four years. Yet Corbin posts, making 31 to 33 starts in every full season since 2017, and an innings-hungry team will take a shot at adding some depth to his slider.\n\nA .343 OBP and 112 adjusted OPS for Donnie Barrels, who still makes for a decent right-handed bench bat.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast.

Their D.C. period was an oft-blue one, marked first by ghastly teams that befitted the District’s sordid baseball history and then by star-crossed clubs that stubbed their toe in winner-take-all games in 2012, 2016 and 2017.\n\nThese Nationals, though, are not staggering into the Fall Classic like an oversize Teddy Roosevelt tripping over the finish line of their iconic Presidents’ Race.\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\nAfter Tuesday night’s 7-4 dispatching of the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, these Nationals come in with credentials that belie their franchise – and their city’s – odd baseball past.\n\nSince their infamous 19-31 start, the Nationals are 81-40 – climbing from the nether reaches of the National League East to claw their way into a home wild card game.\n\nSince entering the playoffs, they have won eight of 10 games, a fascinating mix of derring-do and dominance - erasing 3-1, eighth-inning deficits in win-or-go-home games against the Brewers and Dodgers, followed by an utter splattering of the Cardinals, who never so much as took the lead in this NLCS.\n\n\"Bumpy roads lead to beautiful places,\" once-embattled manager Dave Martinez said atop the championship podium at Nationals Park, \"and this is a beautiful place.\"\n\nAnd so Washington will see its first World Series since 1933, when the Senators succumbed in five games to Carl Hubbell’s New York Giants.\n\nThe Houston Astros or New York Yankees will arrive with greater fanfare and pedigrees – winners of 107 and 103 games, respectively, Houston boasting a World Series title as recently as 2017 and the Yankees with 27 such flags decorating their billion-dollar manse in the Bronx.\n\nThese Nationals? Well, they are an appropriate bunch to introduce this delirious, absurd civic celebration called the World Series to a town gradually regaining its baseball bearings.\n\nFor this club, imperfection is a feature, not a bug, its terrible start and its collection of game-weathered veterans – viejos, the oldest team in the National League likes to call its most senior members – creating a collective feeling of improbable destiny.\n\nHowie Kendrick? Your National League Championship Series MVP. He's 36 years old, with an iron glove and no true position and never has has never advanced past a league championship series.\n\nYet he may have more to do with the makeup of this club than anyone.\n\nWhen Kendrick tore an Achilles tendon in May 2018, an injury-ravaged club looked at its roster of available outfielders and didn’t find an answer until its Class A roster – and a 19-year-old slugger named Juan Soto.\n\nSoto became a good player in 2018 and a superstar in 2019, by which time Kendrick had returned from his Achilles tear and promptly tore the cover off the baseball like never before - setting career marks in slugging (572) and OPS (.966).\n\n\"Howie’s got a big strong back,\" general manager Mike Rizzo said moments after stepping off the championship podium, \"because he carried us for three months.\"\n\nHis grand slam in Game 5 of the Division Series is the biggest hit in franchise history. His three doubles in Game 3 of the NLCS put the Cardinals away.\n\n\"It just makes it sweet because, as we're getting older, the game keeps getting younger,\" Kendrick said. \"But to see a team like us continue to grind, and I think the mixture of people that we do have is what makes us so good. The chemistry that we do have, we understand each other.\n\n\"I feel like being around this long, I wouldn't change anything about the past because this is just -- I mean, it's unbelievable.\"\n\nRyan Zimmerman can relate.\n\nThe Nationals' original draft pick in 2005 weathered the 100-loss seasons and the many demands that fall upon the lone mainstay of a franchise through years of rebuilding. He entered the month answering questions about these possibly being his last days with the club, his role marginalized by his age (35) and a battle with plantar fasciitis.\n\nNow, he’ll enter this World Series yet another glorious reclamation project, batting .333 with a .913 OPS, a huge Division Series home run and an iconic defensive play to momentarily preserve a no-hitter.\n\nAs he cradled a light beer in the booze-fueled clubhouse celebration, someone brings up the year 1933, and without missing a beat, he quips: \"You mean the year Howie and I were born?\"\n\nThe Senators were long before his time, but save for the first five months of the inaugural 2005 season - while he was still at the University of Virginia - Zimmerman has seen it all.\n\n\"This organization is fairly young still - 14, 15 years old - but it’s a great city, a great sports town. They showed up. They showed up at these games.\n\n\"I feel lucky. A lot of guys play for a long time and don’t get a chance to do it. This is why you play the game, why you work so hard, and why your family sacrifices as much for you as well.\"\n\nTheir manager can relate, too.\n\nMartinez was a rookie manager in 2018, trying to replace the beloved Dusty Baker and guide a playoff-ready team to the next level. Instead, his inexperience was exposed.\n\nA year later, “Nationals manager” had replaced “Redskins quarterback” as the most reviled man in town, with Martinez presumed to take the fall for the 19-31 start.\n\nInstead, he coined a phrase now emblazoned on towels, shirts, and dugout – Stay In the Fight – and made do with a terrible bullpen until reinforcements arrived.\n\n\"I'll be the first to say, I never doubted these guys. I really didn't,\" says Martinez. \"All I kept telling myself, hey, stay with them. Stick to the process. Stay positive. Teach. And as soon as everybody gets healthy, we'll make a run. We'll get back in this thing.\"\n\nSays Zimmerman: \"He’s been around baseball his whole life, so he gets it. That’s why you play 162 games. You stay positive, you stay with the approach and you grind it out. His positivity and not wavering from who he was really allowed us to do that.\"\n\nHe missed a week in September to undergo a heart procedure, a sobering reminder of how consuming his job is. Yet all around him were reminders of the game’s joys.\n\nThe Nationals dance after home runs. They group-hug the reticent ace, Stephen Strasburg, after he finishes off yet another dominant outing. And they provide a reminder that in this town where matters so heavy are decided every day, a little levity is OK.\n\nCome Sunday, the Nationals will be boarding a plane for Houston or a train to New York, prohibitive underdogs who have seen worse than Gerrit Cole or Aroldis Chapman glowering atop a mound.\n\nOn Oct. 25, the District will host its first World Series game in 86 years. It was a long wait for a team to come back, and a seemingly more torturous wait for one good enough to get back in the Fall Classic.\n\nFinally, D.C. has just that. And there couldn’t be a heartier group to deliver that dose of joy only a World Series run can provide.\n\n\"We want to keep winning with these guys,\" says outfielder Adam Eaton. \"We love every one of them here – on the road, at home, out to dinner.\n\n\"We want to keep this going as long as we can.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2024/06/30/mlb-awards-first-half-all-star-game/74258656007/", "title": "MLB awards: Biggest surprises and disappointments of first half", "text": "PHOENIX — It’s been a first half where two teams getting their last rites suddenly kicked the priests out of the room and are running down the halls ready to party into October.\n\nYes, we’re talking about you, New York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nIt’s been a first half where the teams that absolutely stunk a year ago suddenly have become serious playoff contenders.\n\nTake a bow, Kansas City Royals and Cleveland Guardians.\n\nIt’s been a first half where Shohei Ohtani is letting us know that he’s the greatest player in history with one healthy elbow; Aaron Judge could be our modern-day Babe Ruth; rookie Paul Skenes could be the most electrifying starter since Pedro Martinez; and A’s rookie reliever Mason Miller is making radar-gun readings look obsolete.\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\nIt’s been a first half where kiddie shortstops Gunnar Henderson, Bobby Witt Jr., Masyn Winn and CJ Abrams have become the new generation of Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and Nomar Garciaparra and where 35-year-old veteran Chris Sale has turned back time.\n\nNow, with the July 4th holiday at the end of the week, the All-Star break two weeks away, and the trade deadline four weeks away, buckle up, grab a cold one, and take a look at our first-half awards winners.\n\nAL's biggest surprise: Cleveland Guardians\n\nI picked these guys to win the World Series a year ago and they fell flat on their face.\n\nFuture Hall of Fame manager Terry Francona retired after the season. The Guardians didn't spend any money over the winter. They lost ace Shane Bieber after two starts.\n\nAnd they have the best record in the American League.\n\nGo figure.\n\nNL's biggest surprise: Milwaukee Brewers\n\nLet’s see, they traded their Cy Young award winner. They’re without their No. 2 starter, Brandon Woodruff. They lost veteran Wade Miley. They’ve been without All-Star closer Devin Williams.\n\nThey’ve had to resort to using a franchise-record 14 different starters.\n\nAnd, yes, their manager had defected to the rival Chicago Cubs.\n\nAnd?\n\nThey have a 6½-game lead over the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Central and a whopping 11 ½-game advantage over the Cubs.\n\nAL's biggest disappointment: Toronto Blue Jays\n\nRemember when they were supposed to be the class of the AL East, and the envy of baseball with all of their fabulous young talent, and be a serious threat to return to their golden age of 1992-1993 when they won back-to-back World Series titles.\n\nWell, they’ve won the AL East once since 1993, haven’t won a postseason game since 2016, and have Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette under team control for only 1 ½ more years.\n\nThey are the American League’s most underachieving team.\n\nIt will be intriguing to see who pays the price.\n\nNL's biggest disappointment: Chicago Cubs\n\nThey sure don’t have David Ross to blame anymore, do they?\n\nRoss is sitting home this summer, collecting his paycheck, and watching his resume look a whole lot better with the Cubs falling off a cliff.\n\nThe Cubs spent money, have gotten tremendous value out of rookie sensation Shota Imanaga, and somehow find themselves in last place.\n\nThe only category this team leads is having players thrown out stealing: 35 and counting.\n\nAL MVP: Aaron Judge, Yankees\n\nThe Yankees have spent an awful lot of money on free agents over the years, but they may never have made a better investment.\n\nJudge, who’s in contention to win the Triple Crown with 30 homers (first) and 79 RBI (first) while batting .312 (second), is also leading the American League in walks. Having accomplished the feat in 2022, Judge would join Babe Ruth and Ted Williams as the only players to twice lead the league in RBI and walks in the same season.\n\nHe’ll have a spot in Monument Park awaiting him.\n\nNL MVP: Bryce Harper, Phillies\n\nHe doesn’t lead the league in any offensive categories, but everywhere you look, he’s ranks in the top five, including batting average (.303), homers (20), RBI (58), on-base percentage (.399), slugging percentage (.582,) and OPS (.981).\n\nOh, and he’s playing a stellar first base.\n\nHe means absolutely everything to this franchise, and may mean more to his team than any single player in the game.\n\nAL Cy Young: Tarik Skubal, Tigers\n\nKingman, Ariz., used to be best-known as a gas-stop on the way to party in Las Vegas.\n\nNow it may forever be known as the home of Tarik Skubal, on the road to the Cy Young award with his 9-3 record and 2.32 ERA.\n\nNL Cy Young: Ranger Suarez, Phillies\n\nSuarez, who has never won more than 10 games in his career, is 10-2 with a league-leading 1.83 ERA.\n\nYou know your team is pretty darn good when Suarez’s closest competition for the Cy Young may be his own teammates in Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola.\n\nAL Rookie of the Year: Luis Gil, Yankees\n\nGil was running away with the award until his last two clunkers.\n\nHe’s still in the lead, but this race is wide open.\n\nNL Rookie of the Year: Paul Skenes, Pirates\n\nHe just got to the Show, but the way he’s pitching, he is the show.\n\nHe’s also the only major league player since the days of Ted Williams and Bob Feller who has openly said that he wants to serve his country in the military once his playing career is over.\n\nCome on, someone has got to tell this dude it’s not this easy.\n\nJust two years after retiring, hitting a home run in his final at-bat, he’s the runaway leader to win the award in his rookie season.\n\nNL Manager of the Year: Pat Murphy, Brewers\n\nHis claim to fame entering the year was being Craig Counsell’s collegiate coach at Notre Dame, Dustin Pedroia’s coach at Arizona State, and Counsell’s sargeant-at-arms with the Brewers.\n\nNow that he’s the man in charge, they may be building a statue of him outside of Miller Park if they continue to run away with the division.\n\nWon't Be Opting Out award\n\nBlake Snell (Giants) and Jordan Montgomery (Diamondbacks)\n\nRemember when they signed their contracts in the waning days of spring training, told the world there was no need for spring training, and they’d be just fine when the season started?\n\nWell, the Giants and the D-backs sure wish they had their own opt-outs, because they’d be exercising them as soon as someone gave them a pen.\n\nMontgomery is 6-5 with a 6.03 ERA, has a negative 1.3 WAR, and twice has been heavily booed off the field at Chase Field. He is earning $25 million this year, and already has vested a player option for $20 million in 2025 year with a chance to make it $25 million if he makes 25 starts.\n\nWhile Montgomery has been a mess, at least he’s pitching.\n\nSnell, who is receiving $32 million in salary and a signing bonus this year, has a $30 million player option for 2025. He has made only six starts, going 0-3 with a 9.51 ERA over 23⅔ innings, without pitching five innings in a start, and a negative 1.1 WAR.\n\nNeedless to say, both will probably be staying put.\n\nAL's best trade: Orioles\n\nThe Orioles, who decided to stay away from the free-agent market, determined that no one would be better than Milwaukee Brewers Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes.\n\nThey struck gold.\n\nBurnes has been everything they hoped, and more, posting every fifth day with a 2.28 ERA while pitching 106 ⅔ innings, second-most in baseball. He has gone at least five innings in all but one start, and will be their No. 1 starter in October\n\nBest non-trade: Guardians\n\nThe Guardians told the world all winter that beleaguered closer Emmanuel Clase was available, wondering if his 2023 struggles (12 blown saves, 3-9, 3.22 ERA) were a sign the best was behind him.\n\nWell, no one met their asking price, and there’s not a finer closer in the game this year.\n\nClase has 25 saves for one of the best teams in baseball, going 3-1 with a 0.70 ERA.\n\nBest free agent signing: Jurickson Profar, Padres\n\nHe signed a one-year, $1 million contract on the eve of spring training with just $1.5 million in incentives.\n\nFour months later, he’s the best outfielder in the National League and the MVP of the Padres, hitting .316 with 11 homers, 55 RBI and an .894 OPS.\n\nWorst free agent signing: Blake Snell, Giants\n\nFarhan Zaidi, president of baseball operations for the Giants, should have listened to himself when he declared in March that his team was set and would not be in the market for any more marquee free agents.\n\nThree weeks later, they signed Snell to a two-year, $62 million contract, which has been nothing short of disastrous.\n\nSnell has already given up more earned runs (25) in six starts with the Giants than he did in is his final 23 starts (18 earned runs) for the Padres last season.\n\nComeback Player of the Year: Marcell Ozuna, Atlanta\n\nIt was 13 months ago when Atlanta’s fans were pleading for Ozuna to be released, hitting .085 with two RBI. He was kept around only because he was in the third year of a four-year, $65 million contract.\n\nWell, since May 1, 2023, no one has driven in more runs (165), and only Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge have hit more than his 59 homers or produced a higher slugging percentage.\n\nHis $16 million club option in 2025 now looks like a bargain.\n\nComeback manager of the year: Oli Marmol, Cardinals\n\nThe Cardinals were a mess in mid-May, sitting in last place with a 15-24 record, losing seven consecutive games, with the Cardinals’ fanbase calling for Marmol to be fired.\n\nWell, look who weathered the storm, refused to give in, and has led the Cardinals to a 27-15 record, best in the Nationals League since May 12.\n\nIf the season ended today, they would be back in the playoffs.\n\nRebuild of the year: Mike Rizzo, Nationals\n\nThere’s no one in the business who does a more magnificent job rebuilding franchises than Rizzo. He turned a Nationals franchise that lost more than 100 games two consecutive years and turned it into a playoff team in two years, reaching the postseason five times in eight years, winning the 2019 World Series championship.\n\nHe tore it down, traded Juan Soto to San Diego for five prospects, lost 295 games the last three years, and here they are, knocking on the door of a playoff berth, with the best prospect in that deal, outfielder James Wood, scheduled to make his major-league debut Monday.\n\nThey should return to being a perennial contender in 2025.\n\nAround the basepaths\n\n– The Chicago White Sox quietly engaged in brief contract extension talks with ace Garrett Crochet, but with no optimism towards reaching an agreement, the White Sox intend to trade him by the July 30 trade deadline.\n\nThe White Sox have had 15 teams calling to express interest in Crochet, who is making just $800,000 and is under team control through 2026. The X-factor for suitors will be determining just how much Crochet can help them in the pennant stretch and October.\n\nHe has already pitched 94 ⅓ innings as a first-year starter, 21 more than his entire career total entering the season, and the White Sox and Crochet already have a firm plan in place to greatly limit his workload in the second half.\n\nIt’s quite possible that a team acquiring Crochet may have to offer a contract extension for him to lift those innings restrictions in the second half because of the potential of an injury risk.\n\n– The Los Angeles Dodgers have already made an offer to the White Sox for Crochet, but it was quickly rejected. The White Sox have informed teams they are seeking young prospects with enormous upside.\n\n– Rival teams who have expressed interest in New York Mets first baseman Pete Alonso are convinced Alonso will definitely stay put as long as the Mets are within five games of the wild-card race.\n\n– The Blue Jays, whose season is already on the brink, plan to place starter Yusei Kikuchi, catcher Danny Jansen, reliever Yimi Garcia, DH Justin Turner and outfielder Kevin Kiermaier on the trade block. Yet, they still want to make one last run with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette. They should be staying until at least this winter, if not next summer.\n\n– The White Sox have had several teams also contact them about center fielder Luis Robert Jr., but with his struggles, they are considering hanging onto him into at least the winter since he’s under control through 2027.\n\n– The Dodgers have to be thankful they didn’t deal rookie starter Gavin Stone this past winter when his name came up with several teams in trade talks.\n\nStone threw the first complete game shutout by a Dodgers pitcher since 2022, and the first on the road since Hideo Nomo’s no-hitter in Colorado in 1995. Stone, 9-2, 2.73, has emerged as a legitimate front-line starter.\n\n– The best reliever on the trade market will be Tanner Scott of the Marlins, with Mason Miller of the A’s expected to stay put.\n\n– The White Sox are openly shopping outfielder Andrew Benintendi, and would love to get out of his contract. He’s still owed nearly $50 million from 2025-2027.\n\n– It has been a hearbreaking 10 days for the San Francisco Giants who lost Hall of Famers Willie Mays and then Orlando Cepeda on Friday night.\n\n“Another gut punch,’’ Giants manager Bob Melvin told reporters. “Another just incredible personality who’s just beloved here, his statue out front, the numbers he put up. There are a lot of legends here, and he’s certainly right in the middle of that, and to have it so close in proximity to Willie, it’s just staggering.’’\n\n– While Mets closer Edwin Diaz was the latest to be caught using an illegal foreign substance. Team executives and scouts say it’s a widespread problem with pitchers finding ways to greatly enhance their spin rate without being caught.\n\n“The key is trying to see how they’re doing it,\" one veteran executive said. “If umpires started checking infielders’ gloves, I think they’d find the answer.\"\n\n– Teams have begun sending their top scouts to watch the Oakland A’s because of their surplus of relievers and outfielders available at the trade deadline, featuring outfielders Brent Rooker and Miguel Andujar, along with relievers Austin Adams, Scott Alexander, Lucas Erceg and T.J. McFarland.\n\n– While Mets first baseman Pete Alonso may be a prized commodity on the free agent market, and will be seeking at least $200 million, several teams may prefer signing Arizona's Christian Walker, who will also hit the market at a cheaper cost.\n\nWalker, a two-time Gold Glove winner, has averaged 35 homers and 98 RBI the past two seasons, and is on pace for 34 homers and 102 RBI this season.\n\nThe D-backs would love to keep him.\n\n– You can be sure that ESPN and baseball officials will be heavily lobbying Shohei Ohtani to participate in the Home Run Derby these next two weeks with Aaron Judge bowing out.\n\nOhtani’s presence would be a massive ratings difference maker.\n\n“For the game, I think it’s great, for the workload part of it, I’d probably not want him to do it,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters. “No one can argue that a manager wouldn’t want their player to swing as hard as he can for essentially 45 minutes when [he] is supposed to be on a break, right? But the other side is, obviously, he’s the biggest star in the game, and it makes it more attractive. So, I think whatever he decides, I’ll support it.”\n\n– Major League Baseball plans to return to historic Rickwood Field in the future, and could play the East-West Classic in Birmingham as well as Hinchcliffe Stadium in Paterson, N.J., in upcoming years.\n\n– It’s hard to believe that second baseman Marcus Semien may be the only player from the reigning World Series champion Texas Rangers to be in the All-Star Game, playing for his own manager and coaching staff at his home ballpark.\n\nA year ago, the Rangers had five starters in the game.\n\n– MLB will make sure that Pirates rookie sensation Paul Skenes will be in the All-Star Game.\n\n– Seattle Mariners All-Star outfielder Julio Rodriguez opened his career hitting .279 with 60 home runs and a .834 OPS his first two seasons.\n\nThis year? The Mariners are scratching their head watching him hit .251 with no power, producing just seven homers, six doubles and a .635 OPS.\n\n– The Diamondbacks were fourth in the major leagues with 43 comeback victories a year ago, winning 20 games after being behind by two or more runs.\n\nThis year, they have only 12 comeback victories, second-lowest in MLB, while winning just one game when down by two or more runs.\n\n– Do you realize that Guardians outfielder Steven Kwan is hitting .310 with two strikes?\n\n– Now that Mookie Betts is sidelined and Trea Turner just returned from the injured list, Reds shortstop Elly De La Cruz deserves to be in the All-Star Game, where he just may steal the show.\n\n– Remember when the Detroit Tigers opened the season by winning their first five games and had folks believing this could be the year they return to the playoffs?\n\nOops.\n\nThey since have gone 32-45 and once again will be sellers at the deadline, shopping Jack Flaherty, who signed a one-year, $14 million contract.\n\n– The Houston Astros aren’t dead yet. They are 28-17 since May 9, with an American League-leading 3.26 ERA, despite starters Cristian Javier, Jose Urquidy and J.P. France done for the season and Justin Verlander on the injured list.\n\n– Orioles shortstop sensation Gunnar Henderson, who nearly has twice as many homers as any shortstop in baseball with 26, is on pace to join Alex Rodriguez as the only shortstops in history with 50 homers in a season.\n\n– Just in case you still don’t believe in the Mets, who won 16 of their last 20 games, you may want to know that they also happen to have the third-easiest schedule in the NL the rest of the season, according to tankathon.com.\n\n– The Yankees’ starting rotation was the best in the game through June 14 with a 2.77 ERA.\n\nWell, in their 13 games since June 14, their starters have been bludgeoned, yielding an 8.31 ERA.\n\n– Here’s hoping that Bryce Harper can return in time for the All-Star Game. Harper has made seven All-Star teams, but never has played in the game as a member of the Phillies.\n\n– Ever so quietly, Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley has converted 29 consecutive saves, the longest streak in franchise history.\n\n– While umpires lost the fight to prohibit players from having a strike-zone box on their iPads during games this season after a union grievance, players’ fines will substantially increase if they “embarrass, denigrate or question the impartiality or ability of an umpire.’’ Players can now be fined between $2,500 to $7,500 for first-time violations.\n\n– As bad as the White Sox are now, just think how ugly it’s going to get when they start trading away their best players.\n\nThe 1962 Mets, who went 40-120-1, may soon become only the second-worst team in MLB history.\n\n– Considering how many balls get fouled off into the dugouts, nearly striking Shohei Ohtani in the head last week if not for the quick hands of batboy Javier Herrera, it’s absurd that MLB has not mandated ballparks to have protective netting in front of dugouts for player safety.\n\n– Beloved former Phillies manager Charlie Manuel, who suffered from a stroke last year that left him partially paralyzed, presented the Philadelphia Public League with a donation from Perfect Game of more than 30,000 pieces of sports apparel. It’s the largest donation ever presented to Philadelphia public school athletic departments.\n\n– It will be a heartwarming moment in Boston on Sunday with Padres knuckleballer Matt Waldron taking the mound at Fenway Park. Waldron, who grew up a Red Sox fan, and mastered his knuckleball thanks to the help of the late, great Tim Wakefield.\n\nWakefield, a knuckleball pitcher, spent two hours on a zoom call with Waldron three years ago and provided constant feedback from his minor-league outings.\n\nWakefield died of brain cancer at the age 57 last October.\n\n“I think it’d be cool to toe that rubber, knowing that Wakefield has been there too,’’ Waldron told The Athletic. “I think it’ll be a surreal moment.”\n\nFollow Nightengale on X: @Bnightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2022/05/22/mlb-payroll-disparity-mets-dodgers/9883522002/", "title": "MLB's payroll disparity continues to loom large in sport", "text": "PHOENIX – We’ve reached the quarter mark in Major League Baseball where the 2022 New York Yankees are playing like the ’27 Yankees, the Seattle Mariners are playing like a team that isn’t remotely close to ending their 21-year postseason drought, and teams we thought would stink are playing even worse than envisioned.\n\nBut really, upon examination of MLB’s current team payrolls, exclusively obtained by USA TODAY Sports, why should there be any surprises?\n\nThe salary disparity and competitive balance in baseball, even with the draft lottery, stiffer luxury tax penalties, and rewards for rookie call-ups, remains as wide as the Grand Canyon.\n\nThe teams with the largest payrolls are winning, with six of the top 10 highest-paid teams are on pace to win 100 games.\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/22"}]}
