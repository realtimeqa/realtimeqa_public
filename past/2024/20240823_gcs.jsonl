He said President Joe Biden is willing to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin “at any time, in any format” if it will help prevent a war, saying the Biden administration will continue to take whatever steps it can to try to convince Moscow not to invade Ukraine.\n\n“We believe President Putin has made the decision, but until the tanks are actually rolling, and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President Putin from carrying this forward,” Blinken said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was in Germany on Saturday, where he met with Vice President Kamala Harris at the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky said that he was urging the US and Europe not to wait to put in place sanctions against Russia, arguing that they wouldn’t help Ukraine if they only were invoked after an invasion had already begun.\n\nBlinken said on Sunday that the US did not want to unveil the sanctions ahead of time because that would “allow Russia to try and plan against them.”\n\n“The purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war,” he said. “As soon as you trigger them, that deterrent is gone and until the last minute, as long as we can try to bring a deterrent effect to this, we’re going to try to do that.”\n\nBlinken said that if Putin goes forward with an invasion, the US and NATO have been clear they’re “going to come down on him and Russia very, very hard.”\n\nAsked if Putin could be bluffing, Blinken said, “There’s always a chance, but every indication that we’ve seen, every move that he’s made, that has followed the play that we laid out for the world to see in front of the United Nations Security Council, he is following the script almost to the letter.”\n\n“Everything we’re seeing suggests that this is dead serious, that we are on the brink of an invasion,” he added.\n\nBut Putin still has options on the table if he chooses to take a diplomatic off-ramp to the tensions, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Sunday.\n\n“We have made serious proposals and talked about changing, for instance, the scope and scale of some of our exercises in Europe, being willing to talk about offensive missile capabilities in Europe. We have certainly put forward other proposals to try to convince Mr. Putin … that we’re serious,” Kirby told Fox.\n\nHe also made clear the issue of Ukraine’s membership in NATO, however, is “an issue for Ukraine and for NATO.”\n\n“That is not something that Mr. Putin can simply institute a veto over or decide for himself,” he said.\n\nAnd the US would not recognize the ceding of Crimea or any other territory in Eastern Ukraine to Russia as a way to avoid war, Blinken told CBS’ Margaret Brennan Sunday.\n\n“No,” the secretary said when asked on “Face the Nation” if the US would use that tactic as a diplomatic way to avoid a larger war.\n\nMeanwhile, President Sauli Niinistö of Finland, which shares a border with Russia, told Bash in a separate interview Sunday that Putin has “behaved in a way which is very difficult to predict”.\n\n“It’s very difficult to say and define what the other person actually, deep down, is. But so far, I would say that he has behaved in a way which is very difficult to predict but that might be also intentional, namely to behave in that way, because that brings confusion to surroundings,” Niinistö said.\n\nBlinken is scheduled to meet later this week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Europe, in what would be another round of diplomatic talks that have gone on for weeks as Russia’s troops have continue to mass on Ukraine’s border. But Blinken said the meeting would be called off in the event of an invasion.\n\n“It all depends on what Russia does in the coming days,” he said. “If it doesn’t invade, I’ll be there.”", "authors": ["Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/middleeast/hamas-israel-gaza-conflict-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Why Hamas stayed out of the latest Gaza conflict | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nSderot, Israel CNN —\n\nOne of the most important aspects of the weekend’s short but violent conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was what didn’t happen: Hamas’ involvement.\n\nA ceasefire between Israel and the PIJ over Gaza that went into effect at 11:30 p.m. local time (4:30 p.m. ET) Sunday appeared to be holding almost 24 hours later. The conflict led to the death of at least 44 militants and civilians in Gaza, according to information from the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Fifteen of the dead were children. Israel insists most of those killed were militants, and that several civilians were killed by failed militant rocket launches.\n\nHamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, expressed support for the PIJ’s actions. But it kept its much larger and more powerful arsenal of rockets out of the equation, while Israel’s military made it clear from the outset they were focusing solely on PIJ targets.\n\nThat kept the conflict from spiraling into a larger, more dangerous confrontation, and closer to what happened during the 11-day war in May 2021.\n\nSo why not get involved? According to analysts and Israeli officials, one reason is the fact it is still only 15 months since the 2021 conflict that led to considerable damage and death in Gaza. Palestinians there are still rebuilding their homes, and Hamas is rebuilding its arsenal.\n\nThe Israeli government also believes its campaign of economic incentives – boosting the number of permits given to Gazans to cross into Israel for work – is succeeding.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have imposed a closure on Gaza since 2007, limiting access to the territory via land, air and sea, including tight restrictions on the movement of residents and the flow of goods.\n\nIf rockets are fired, Israel closes the border and the thousands of Gazans with permits can’t work in Israel or get paid.\n\nOn Monday, a senior Israeli diplomatic official said Hamas was “an enemy not a partner … but there is cooperation we can do, predominantly through Egypt, to improve the situation in Gaza.”\n\nFor showing restraint, Hamas will expect to be rewarded.\n\nLapid’s first big security test\n\nThe weekend’s conflict was also the first major military test for interim Prime Minister Yair Lapid. Unlike his predecessor Naftali Bennett, Lapid is not known for his military combat experience. But like US President Joe Biden’s visit last month, it was another moment for Lapid to look like a real prime minister — images Lapid likely hopes Israelis remember as they had to the polls in November.\n\nThe conflict also brought about another breakthrough, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale: former prime minister, now opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu met with Lapid on Sunday to receive a security briefing on the operation. It was his first security briefing since leaving power – even though by law it is supposed to be standard practice. Until this weekend, Netanyahu had boycotted the meetings.\n\nAfter the meeting, Netanyahu said he supported the operation and gave his “full backing to the government, the IDF, and the security forces.”\n\nParts of Gaza once again lie in rubble and the mourning continues for lost lives, but for everyday Israelis and Gazans, the conflict hasn’t led to a substantial change in the political situation on the ground.\n\nThe digest\n\nRussia envoy to Iran nuclear talks says they are “moving in right direction”\n\nAmbassador Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s chief negotiator in Vienna for talks aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal, on Sunday told media, “I cannot guarantee [anything], but the impression is that we are moving in the right direction.” He said there were “minimal” unresolved issues, “just 3 [or] 4.”\n\nBackground: Tehran ramped up uranium enrichment at a pace not seen since the signing of the 2015 nuclear deal. Former US President Donald Trump withdrew from that agreement in 2018. In June, Iran switched off surveillance cameras used by the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor activity at the country’s key nuclear facilities. Sunday marked the fourth day of this latest round – the nineth – of the Iran nuclear talks.\n\nWhy it matters: Talks broke down earlier this year over Tehran’s insistence that the US remove the Revolutionary Guards from its list of terrorist organizations, which the US has refused to do. The US did however send Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley to Vienna for the new round of talks, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last Monday said that the US is “prepared to move forward on the basis of what’s been agreed,” but it is unclear if Iran is prepared to do the same.\n\nPutin, Erdogan agree to begin partial payment in rubles for Russian gas\n\nBilateral talks in Sochi between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan included an agreement to pay Russia in rubles for partial gas supplies. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the two presidents reached agreements on establishing a financial banking bloc “to enable commercial companies, Russian citizens, to pay during tourist trips and exchange money.”\n\nBackground: Russia has been trying to force its customers to pay for energy in rubles. President Vladimir Putin signed a decree in March that requires buyers of natural gas from “unfriendly countries” to hold accounts at Gazprombank — Russia’s third-largest bank — and settle contracts in rubles.\n\nWhy it matters: Russia is on a mission to prove it’s not as isolated as the US would like it to be. Tightening relations between Putin and Erdogan may provide Russia with routes to ease the pressure of western sanctions on the country. The ruble crashed to a record low in the wake of the invasion, but it is the world’s best-performing currency this year, according to Reuters. The central bank has implemented policies to prevent investors and companies from selling the currency and other measures that force them to buy it.\n\nIran city reaches 53 degrees Celsius, hottest temperature in the world this year\n\nAbadan, Iran had a high temperature of 53.0° C (127.4° F) Friday – the highest temperature recorded anywhere in the world in 2022, according to weather historian Maximiliano Herrera.\n\nBackground: Numerous locations across Iran, Iraq and Kuwait topped 50 degrees Celsius Friday. Temperatures were expected to drop back closer to average after the weekend, with highs in the mid to upper 40s Celsius. The highest temperature ever recorded in the world is 56.7° C (134.1° F) in Death Valley, California, on July 10, 1913.\n\nWhy it matters: Heat of this caliber raises major concerns for heat-related illness, especially for those without access to water and proper shelter and is likely to bolster arguments for action on climate change.\n\nWhat’s trending\n\nKuwait: #Wage_rise_is_a_public_demand\n\nThe citizens of one of the richest Arab countries are demanding a rise in wages.\n\nKuwaitis took to Twitter to express their frustration at the country’s economic situation, blaming official corruption and greed for alleged inequality in pay.\n\nKuwaiti citizens are a minority in the country of 4.2 million, making up just 30% of the population, according to World Population Review. Most rely on government jobs to make a living.\n\n“It’s inconceivable that a rich country like Kuwait that has a small number of people and the strongest currency in the world [wouldn’t raise wages],” tweeted Mohammed Al Huwaishel. “The demands of the people must be met without conditions.”\n\nMany Kuwaitis take government jobs – where pay can be up to 28% higher than the private sector – because they either lack the necessary skills to work in the private sector or because some of those jobs are seen as menial, according to the Middle East Institute.\n\nDue to the benefits offered in government jobs, the private sector finds it difficult to lure Kuwaitis. According to the International Monetary Fund, public wages and benefits account for one-third of the government’s budget. The government set aside $72 billion in spending for its latest budget.\n\nThe World Bank warned in December that the government’s wage bill is unsustainable, saying that if the situation continues, the country’s financial reserves will be depleted. The nation has made the least progress among oil-rich Gulf Arab countries to reform its wage bill and has even increased hiring, it said.\n\nAnother hashtag on Twitter called on the government to write off citizens’ debt, which is not without precedent. After the end of the 1991 Gulf War, the government wrote off almost all consumer debt.\n\nBy Mohammed Abdelbary\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Hadas Gold"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/politics/united-nations-ukraine-russia/index.html", "title": "Why isn't the United Nations doing more to stop what's happening in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWatching the brutal images of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has many people around the world asking, why isn’t the United Nations doing more to stop the war? Among them, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky himself.\n\n“You need to act immediately,” Zelensky implored the UN Security Council during a live-streamed address April 6 to its members.\n\nHe begged them to do something to stop the war in his country, criticizing the Security Council’s inaction directly. And he called out the elephant in the room: Russia, one of the five permanent members of the Council, whose status gives it the ability to veto any action it disagrees with.\n\n“We are dealing with a state that turns the right of veto in the UN Security Council into a right to die,” Zelensky said.\n\nIt was a blunt message urging the Council to reform, and if that won’t work, he said, “the next option would be to dissolve yourself altogether. And I know you can admit that if there is nothing you can do besides conversation.”\n\nMany people who have watched the UN for years agree that the UN Security Council looks impotent in this moment, with the world watching. The Security Council was designed in a different era, after World War II, with a membership and veto system that have ultimately restricted its effectiveness in dealing with this global conflict. Other parts of the UN have responded more effectively to the humanitarian and refugee crises the war has created.\n\nFormer US Ambassador to the UN John Bolton, who served under Republican Presidents including George W. Bush and Donald Trump, agreed with Zelensky’s assessment. “I thought he was absolutely right,” Bolton told CNN’s chief political analyst Gloria Borger. “And I thought one more convert to understanding what’s wrong with the United Nations. Its political institutions are fundamentally broken.”\n\nBolton has never been a big fan of the UN. He’s famous for saying, back in 1994, that if the UN Secretariat building in New York “lost 10 stories, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference.”\n\nThere have been many moments of deadlock before in the Security Council when the big powers disagree. But this moment has drawn outsized attention globally.\n\n“This is the single biggest crisis to hit the UN since the end of the Cold War,” said Richard Gowan, the UN Director for the International Crisis Group. “It is possible that this does mark the beginning of a sort of fundamental rupture amongst the great powers that will make UN diplomacy see vastly harder going forward.”\n\nThe system was designed this way: to prevent global conflict but also to reward the main winners of World War II, according to Gowan.\n\nKey veto power\n\nWhen the United Nations charter was signed in 1945, it established the Security Council with five permanent members and six nonpermanent members. The permanent members – the US, the UK, France, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China – were each given the power to veto any resolutions they opposed.\n\n“It was Franklin Roosevelt who wanted to set up an organization that would police the world after the defeat of Nazi Germany,” Gowan said. “But the only way he could get Russia and other powers to agree to that deal, was if they had the ability to block any actions against themselves.”\n\nThe late Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin himself insisted on that power as a way for his state to protect itself.\n\nToday, the Security Council has 15 members, but the five permanent members have remained the same, with Russia holding the former Soviet Union’s seat and China taking the seat of the Republic of China. And the veto hasn’t changed either.\n\n“What we’re seeing is, when there’s a fundamental disagreement among the permanent members, nothing happens,” Bolton said.\n\nThe UN charter also makes it impossible to do another thing Zelensky suggested: kick Russia off the Security Council, because the country can veto that too.\n\nOver the years, countries and diplomats have suggested to reform the council by adding more permanent members to make it better reflect the contemporary geopolitical reality, or even try to take away the veto power. But no country wants to dilute its power.\n\n“I’m being honest with you, I don’t think anyone’s going to want to give up their veto,” former US Ambassador to the UN Bill Richardson, who served under former Democratic President Bill Clinton, told Borger.\n\nRichardson points out that the United States has used the veto to protect its own interests – and may need to again.\n\n“It helped us in the Iraq War. It helped us in Bosnia. It helps us in conflicts in Africa,” he said. “So no country that is a permanent member wants to give up their veto. And I would be against the US giving up their veto right now, just so that we take action on another issue.”\n\nIn theory, the Security Council “could impose even more sweeping global economic sanctions on Moscow than we have already seen. It could technically authorize military action to push back Russian forces in Ukraine,” according to Gowan.\n\nBut with Russia and likely China set to veto any action taken against the war, the Security Council is deadlocked.\n\nA massive global organization\n\nThe UN is bigger than just the Security Council, and other areas of the body – which has six main organs – have been more active since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n“The UN is for airing publicly the tragedies of the world. Like the refugee crisis in Ukraine, like the possible war crimes, like so many other human costs that are taking place,” Richardson said. “At the same time, the UN is providing food. The UN is providing refugee assistance.”\n\nThe UN General Assembly has condemned Russia twice over the war in Ukraine; those resolutions are nonbinding but carry symbolic weight. Russia was also suspended from the Human Rights Council, which requires a two-thirds vote.\n\nBut Bolton said the math behind that vote shows Russia has significant support around the world; the voting result was 93 in favor, 24 against and 58 abstentions. A remaining 18 member states were not included in that result.\n\n“So here’s the real headline … A majority of the members of the United Nations, did not vote to expel Russia,” he told Borger.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin likely expected these kinds of condemnations, but what he really cares about is the status and power that being on the Security Council gives Russia.\n\n“After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow clung on to its seat in the Security Council essentially as proof that it was still a big power,” Gowan of the International Crisis Group said. “Now, in the real world … Russia is not that important. It’s China and the US that are the dominant players, but in the Security Council, the Russians stand as equal to the US. And they’re very, very proud of having that status.”\n\nAnd Richardson knows firsthand from his time at the UN in the 1990s, Russia knows how to play the system.\n\n“When I became UN ambassador for the US, Lavrov, Foreign Minister had been there 10 years already. So he was very skillful,” Richardson said. “He knew how to maneuver in the Security Council. He was very formidable. And so we have Russia right now, very knowledgeable about UN operations so that’s an advantage that they have.”\n\nAnd so the Security Council could only watch as Russia invaded Ukraine. And in a bizarre split-screen moment, Russia held the rotating presidency of the Security Council and even chaired the meeting as the invasion began and diplomacy failed.\n\nBolton doesn’t see any way to change the system.\n\n“Unless unicorns break free and sweetness and light prevails, where there are disagreements among the (permanent) five, there will be no action,” he said.", "authors": ["Ashley Semler"], "publish_date": "2022/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/europe/minsk-agreement-ukraine-russia-explainer-intl/index.html", "title": "Minsk agreement: Could it be a way out of the Ukraine-Russia crisis ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs world leaders scramble to find a diplomatic solution over the ongoing Russia-Ukraine tensions, talk has turned to the 2015 Minsk Agreement as a possible way out of the crisis.\n\nThe agreement, the second of its kind (and the one that matters), was hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end what was then a bloody 10-month conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nBut Minsk II has never been fully implemented, with its key issues still unresolved. Here’s what you need to know:\n\nWho are the key players?\n\nA rare meeting between Russian, Ukrainian, German and French leaders in February 2015 sought to bring peace to areas of Ukraine that had been taken over by pro-Russian separatists the year before. Those areas, in Ukraine’s Donbas region, became known as the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) and the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). The Ukrainian government in Kyiv asserted the two regions were in effect Russian-occupied.\n\nThe talks also aimed to work towards a political settlement for the region.\n\nThe result, Minsk II, was signed by representatives of Russia, Ukraine, the separatist leaders and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). It was subsequently endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution.\n\nWhat were the conditions of the agreement?\n\nA ceasefire. In February 2015, there was still heavy fighting in some areas between Ukrainian forces and Russian-supported rebels, with the Ukrainians taking heavy losses.\n\nThe withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the frontlines.\n\nThat the OSCE – a 57-member security organization that also includes the US and Canada – monitor the frontlines.\n\nA dialogue on local elections in areas occupied by pro-Russian rebels.\n\nThe restoration of full economic and social links between the two sides, so that, for example, pensions could be paid.\n\nThat Ukrainian government control be restored over the border with Russia.\n\nThe withdrawal of all foreign forces and mercenaries.\n\nConstitutional reform that would provide some autonomy to the regions of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region no longer under the central government’s control.\n\nWhat happened after Minsk II was signed?\n\nThe worst of the fighting stopped, and OSCE monitors moved in. To this day, the OSCE patrols the frontlines and reports ceasefire violations along the border. However, there is much less fighting and fewer casualties than in 2014-15. From that perspective, the agreement was, at least, partly fulfilled.\n\nStill, there are 1.5 million internally displaced people in Ukraine, and nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict.\n\nA burned military vehicle in front of a destroyed building in Uglegorsk, Ukraine, in February 2015. Pierre Crom/Getty Images\n\nBut there’s a catch\n\nThe Minsk Agreement was devised very hastily. Russia was a signatory but its role in the conflict was not acknowledged. Indeed the word ‘Russia’ does not appear anywhere in the text. Ever since, that’s allowed the Kremlin to say that it is merely an observer and that agreement must be reached between the Ukrainian government and the rebels in the country’s east – despite evidence showing that Russia supports the separatists. Kyiv, meanwhile, refuses to talk directly to the rebels.\n\nIn addition, the agreement’s language is imprecise – with Russia and Ukraine interpreting its political roadmap to mean very different things.\n\nUkraine wants first to regain control of its international border before local elections are held in rebel-held areas. It also wants Russian forces (point 7 above) to leave. Russia, of course, says it doesn’t have any forces in the rebel-controlled areas.\n\nMoscow wants elections while the region is still under the control of the separatists – and before Ukrainian authorities regain control over the border.\n\nEfforts by Western diplomats to square this circle have gone nowhere.\n\nWhat are the other issues?\n\nThe status of the rebel-held areas of the Donbas have never been defined (point 8 above).\n\nKyiv’s view is that the region should have the same sort of autonomy as other Ukrainian regions do, within a federal structure.\n\nMoscow points to language in the Minsk Agreement that refers to “the special status of certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions” and interprets that as allowing these regions to have their own police forces and judicial system, among other advantages.\n\nBut any Ukrainian government that agreed to giving the Donbas special status might not survive a public backlash. In 2015, then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko put forward constitutional amendments on decentralization that were bitterly opposed by Ukrainian nationalist groups. Riots in Kyiv left three law enforcement officers dead.\n\nDenis, a soldier in the Ukrainian army, holds a machine gun in Marinka, Ukraine. The 38-year-old was previously a welder.

Cold misery.\" Timothy Fadek/Redux for CNN On the front lines, Ukrainians brace for possible attack Prev Next\n\nWhy does Vladimir Putin regard Minsk as so important?\n\nIf interpreted in Moscow’s favor, it’s potentially a way that Russia can retain its influence in Ukraine for and through pro-Russian groups in the Donbas.\n\nIt would give Russia the ability to control the territory – without annexing it, as they did with Crimea in 2014 – and a say in Ukraine’s national affairs.\n\nFurther complicating matters, Russia has issued passports to hundreds of thousands of residents of Donbas.\n\nThat could also give Russia a role in Ukraine’s parliament through its proxies – and the chance to derail any distant Ukrainian effort to join NATO or the European Union – a key demand that Russia says must be met to defuse current tensions. Depending on how elections were organized, people with Russian citizenship and those who have been granted amnesty for killing Ukrainians might conceivably end up in the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nThat would further destabilize Ukraine.\n\nWhat do world leaders have to say?\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron sees the Minsk Agreement as the most promising off-ramp to avert conflict, saying on Tuesday that “the shared determination [to put into effect the Minsk Accords] is the only way allowing us to construct peace and build a viable political solution.” He said that during his meetings he was able “to obtain a very clear and explicit commitment from Presidents Putin and [Volodymyr] Zelensky to commit themselves to the strict basis of the Minsk agreements,” but gave no further details.\n\nUkrainian servicemen of the Donbas volunteer battalion take part in clean-up operations in the Lysychansk district of the Luhansk region in January 2015. Anatoli Boiko/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that the United States and Ukraine are “united” in supporting the Minsk agreements as the way forward to resolve the conflict. But he also hinted that the agreement alone isn’t a one-stop solution, highlighting the challenges that the agreement presents.\n\n“Minsk does not spell out some issues of sequencing when it comes to the steps that the parties need to take,” Blinken said, adding: “Ukraine’s been approaching this in good faith. We have not to date seen Russia do the same.”\n\nDuncan Allan, associate fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Program at London’s Chatham House think tank, wrote that ultimately the argument about Minsk is this: “Is Ukraine sovereign, as Ukrainians insist, or should its sovereignty be limited, as Russia demands?”", "authors": ["Tim Lister"], "publish_date": "2022/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/27/kamala-harris-2024-profile/71972381007/", "title": "Is Dubai Harris the Kamala everyone has been waiting for? Will she ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — When a temporary cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war collapsed, Vice President Kamala Harris found herself in United Arab Emirates city of Dubai, pulling aside sheiks, generals and powerful Middle Eastern leaders.\n\nWhen she was done, she emphasized the Biden administration’s staunch support for Israel’s right to defend itself after the bloody Oct. 7 Hamas rampage. But she also made clear Washington’s mood had shifted as the civilian death toll surged.\n\n“Frankly, the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from Gaza are devastating,” Harris said, raising her right index finger as she delivered the sternest U.S. warning yet to Israel about the Gaza offensive.\n\n\"As Israel defends itself,\" she said. \"It matters how.\"\n\nFor more than a century, the one cardinal rule for America's vice presidents has been: Don't get in front of the boss. Had Harris? No, instead, this was the moment the White House united behind her and listened to her concerns about Gaza’s body count as the war roiled global opinion and the Democratic base.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nHarris’ remarks that day, her command of the room, were a glimpse of the politician whose potential seemed unlimited just four years ago but whose image and presidential prospects have together dimmed under the intense scrutiny that followed her ascent to the second-highest office in the land.\n\nHer supporters chalk it up to sexism, racism and unfair media coverage of the first Black woman to serve as vice president. Harris’ detractors point to her tendency to laugh through uncomfortable situations and sidestep direct questions with rambling answers. Others can’t seem to get a read on who she is.\n\nWhatever the case, on this aspect, much of America seems to agree: Harris has an uneven record and is not ready to claim the mantle of party leader. More worrisome, are the criticisms that she lacks foreign policy experience and isn’t fit to step into the Oval Office if Joe Biden’s presidency takes an unexpected turn.\n\nAt an October stop at the College of Charleston in South Carolina, sophomore Andrew Baxley, who chairs the school’s College Democrats of America chapter, asked about steps the administration is taking to secure reproductive rights − low-hanging fruit for the former California attorney general.\n\nBaxley actually wanted to ask Harris about knottier topics such as Biden’s decision to allow construction to move ahead on a section of border wall. That did not fly.\n\nThe White House advertised the campus appearances as moderated conversations; it didn’t disclose the extent to which the events were scripted. Students were asked to submit questions on abortion, gun violence, climate change, voting and LGBTQ rights. They held a Zoom prior and rehearsed the rundown.\n\nOn the day of the event, Harris answered Baxley’s question. Her response drew applause, but Baxley was unsatisfied as he watched Harris handled, scripted and managed in ways that undercut her image as a leader. It was not the same Harris – the unfettered Harris – that wowed a global audience in the UAE. With the election 11 months away, and the presidency on the line, the deciding factor could be whether voters think Harris could really do Biden's job. Sending Dubai Harris to American swing states could be exactly what the ailing campaign needs.\n\nBackstage at the college event, Baxley tried asking Harris his other question. An aide shooed him along.\n\nBaxley felt shortchanged, unable to walk away with a positive opinion of Harris. “And I feel as though, had I been able to really have a more personal connection with her, and possibly speak more in depth with her, that could have been possible.”\n\nThe role of the VP ‘sucks most of the time’\n\nHarris' allies have been warning the White House about the severity of her image problems for years.\n\nPart of the issue stems from being number two when she was always a number one, used to accumulating a series of firsts as a Black woman and of South Asian descent: district attorney of San Francisco, California attorney general and U.S. senator. Harris blazed trails, forging her own path and making up her own mind.\n\nEarly on, she had to get in line with Biden’s agenda, a quirk of the job that has caused her remarks to frequently come across as stilted. Harris’ positions as a candidate were to the left of Biden's on many issues, and she was not helped by White House assignments that were a poor fit for her skill set.\n\nBiden’s tasking of Harris to solve the root causes of mass migration to the southern border in 2021 was especially egregious. The most experience that Harris had dealing with Central America prior to the arrangement was arresting and prosecuting human and drug traffickers. She would inevitably be compared to Biden, who, perhaps unfairly, had himself been charged with playing migration 'bad cop' by former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe test led to a major setback. So, Harris allies pushed for more public appearances in places like South Carolina, in front of voting blocs that are prone to like her.\n\nIn early December, Beaufort County Democrats gathered for a gala on St. Helena Island. The function’s speaker was Congressional Black Caucus Chair emerita Joyce Beatty, on behalf of the Biden-Harris reelection campaign.\n\nBeatty pushed aside remarks that Biden’s aides had given her to read and began to riff about the duo’s record with gusto. The Ohio congresswoman told attendees she had recently challenged one of Harris' Democratic detractors to name the last 20 people who’d held her job.\n\n“The vice president’s job sucks most of the time,” Beatty told the crowd to laughter.\n\nVice presidents run the risk of being too good at their jobs and getting accused of trying to outshine their bosses, she explained. “The role of the vice president is to do what the president tells them to do,” Beatty said.\n\nIt was not always this way with Harris. Obama complimented her as brilliant, dedicated and tough. She won a U.S. Senate seat in 2016 on the same night the country elected Donald Trump.\n\nHarris’ supporters are still in awe of how she hammered future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearing.\n\nAmong Harris’ die-hard fans are John Glover. A retired IT manager from St. Helena Island, he spent nearly five decades in Berkeley, California, where Harris was raised.\n\nGlover, who turns 80 in January, has a photo of himself standing with Harris as his cellphone background. The picture was taken when she was campaigning for president in 2019.\n\n“I fell in love with her the first time I met her,” he said.\n\nAuthentic Harris appears behind closed doors\n\nRiding an adrenaline high after three days of meetings with Asian-Pacific leaders, a more authentic version of Harris was on display at a campaign reception in Piedmont, California, in November.\n\nHer comfort was palpable in a room filled with dear friends and top donors. Together they laughed. They clapped. Harris’ amiable husband, Doug Emhoff, introduced her.\n\nHarris turned her gaze to a small group of reporters standing at the back of the room.\n\n“When people want to talk about the polls, on and on about the polls, let me tell you: Everything we have accomplished is highly, highly popular with the American people,” she said.\n\nBiden and Harris had been hit with a wave of negative surveys that showed them losing to Trump and saying that they were in trouble.\n\nEven now, as her vice presidency has stabilized, she has not entirely restored her credibility, although she has done a better job at making the role her own.\n\nIn South Carolina, Lynn Lotz, a Hilton Head Island resident, said Harris “was given tasks that she should not have been given early on, because I think that put her a step back instead of moving her forward.”\n\n“I don’t think she had the support behind her that she needed,” said Lotz, who met Harris at a Democratic convention in 2019.\n\nThe vice president's political opponents, such as GOP presidential candidate and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, have turned Harris’ failures into campaign attacks, deriding her more incoherent comments as word salads.\n\n“Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom to know where up is. And we’re there. The one thing I don’t think we can survive is a President Kamala Harris,” Haley told a Bluffton, South Carolina, crowd in late November.\n\nRep. Dean Phillips, a Democrat from Minnesota who is challenging Biden for president, came under scrutiny last month for repeating critiques he said had been shared with him that Harris is incompetent. He later apologized and suggested that Harris should be running instead of Biden.\n\nAnne Moncure, 67, a retired health care facility administrator from Beaufort County who hoped Democrats would come up with an alternative to Biden this year, doesn’t think Harris is up to the task of commander-in-chief. The role of the vice presidency, she says, should be a mentored one.\n\n“How is Biden preparing her for the role?” she asked.\n\nHarris was unavailable for an interview for this article.\n\nWhite House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement the president views the vice president as a \"critical partner\" in the successes of the administration including the restoration of America's alliances around the world.\n\n\"The President deeply values her counsel, which he seeks often, and her leadership on a wide range of issues from reproductive freedom, to artificial intelligence\" Bates said.\n\nIs Harris turning it around?\n\nFor the first time in months, Biden and Harris met for a private lunch on Dec. 15. It’s a tradition that Biden began when he was vice president to Obama to help the men of different ages and lived experiences bond.\n\nBut the dynamics of the relationship between Biden, 81, and Harris, 59, are starkly different. As vice president, Biden was seen as the adult in the room to a younger president, who possessed far less experience. Harris was chosen as vice president in large measure to excite the party’s progressive base.\n\nIn recent months, she has demonstrated a keen understanding of the politics of the Israel-Hamas war and of the political peril that she and Biden face as they head into an election year in which they believe American democracy is truly on the line.\n\nThe criticisms of Harris have lessened as the White House has gotten better at utilizing her on issues that fire up progressives and on which she and Biden largely agree.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Harris was responsible for making abortion rights a centerpiece of her and Biden’s midterm elections platform. Supporters had pushed for her to be the one to rally Democrats, effectively marking a turning point for Harris.\n\nIn January, Harris will embark on a nationwide tour to promote the abortion rights message. Her first stop? The battleground state of Wisconsin.\n\nNational tours have helped Harris reach a critical constituency: voters who are unfamiliar with work she did that took place during the pandemic and behind closed doors.\n\n“I’m always wondering, why am I not hearing about her?” said Julie Raino, a 66-year-old grief counselor who lives on Hilton Head Island. “The fact that I have to look for her is really strange.”\n\nRaino says she admired the way Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent, challenged Biden during a heated Democratic primary debate, telling him she was bused to elementary school during an exchange over integration. Raino says she wants to see more of Harris.\n\n“I really loved her when she was running for office,” Raino said. “And I thought in that debate she was amazing and she could stand up to even Biden.”\n\nHarris lays groundwork in South Carolina\n\nWhen it was time for Biden’s team to file paperwork to appear on the ballot in South Carolina this year, it turned to campaign co-chair and former Democratic majority leader Jim Clyburn. Harris joined Clyburn in Columbia, the state capital.\n\nAppearing before a small group of supporters, Harris called the influential Democrat a friend. “It was South Carolina that created the path to the White House for Joe Biden and me,” she told them.\n\nClyburn and Harris were both members of the Congressional Black Caucus. He endorsed Biden for the presidency after Harris left the race at the request of his wife, Emily. It was her dying wish.\n\nHe has since become one of Harris’ most vocal defenders. “People walk around and find reasons to criticize, and then every time she has been called to step up to the plate, she's hit a home run,” Clyburn said.\n\nHarris has been paying more frequent visits to the state that will hold the first, sanctioned Democratic presidential primary. She has traveled there twice since mid-October. Harris made a stop at Benedict College, a historically Black university in Columbia, on another trip last February. And she has a trip planned for Jan. 6.\n\nIt's only natural she'd want to deepen her relationships in the state with an eye toward a 2028 presidential bid, activists say.\n\n“I think that she gets it. She knows that you have to be here in South Carolina the same way Vice President Biden got it,” says Christale Spain, who chairs the state’s Democratic Party.\n\nHarris’ own political operation in South Carolina was never tested. She shut down her financially struggling campaign on Dec. 3, 2019, a day before the conclusion of the state’s filing period.\n\n“She still has a lot of relationships that she can still tap into when she's going back to South Carolina on the campaign trail,” said Jalisa Washington Price, a senior adviser to the Biden campaign in South Carolina and Harris’ former deputy political director.\n\nOne of Harris’ campaign stops at the time was Royal Missionary Baptist Church. Biden later came to the church in the primary. A photo of him with the Rev. Isaac Holt Jr. still hangs on the minister’s wall.\n\nHolt says much of Harris’ political future, her ability to put together a winning coalition in 2028 to land the party’s nomination, will depend on the rest of Biden’s tenure.\n\n“It’s going to be a tough one. I don't think it's going to be a gimme. I don't think it'd be automatic,” said Holt, 70. “But she's in a better position right now than anybody else.”\n\nPotential rivals, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, are already signaling they might challenge her. She must convince voters that she's uniquely suited for the job.\n\nBaxley, the college Democrat, said he’s leaning toward Newsom but hasn’t counted out Harris – yet.\n\nLosing to any of the Republican candidates in this election could be a dealbreaker.\n\n“I'm looking for a strong Democratic candidate, and if she loses in 2024, that's kind of my statement on President Harris,” Baxley said.\n\nIt’s a heavy burden for a vice president who would face more far-reaching political damage if the Biden-Harris ticket fails.\n\nBut as Harris herself has said, now is not the moment for that conversation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/politics/joe-biden-egypt-cop27/index.html", "title": "Biden says US is back as a leader on fighting climate change as he ...", "text": "Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Friday used a short visit to the United Nations climate change summit in Egypt to tell the world the United States was ready to take back its leadership role on fighting a warming planet after the passage of one of the president’s key priorities.\n\nIn a speech to the United Nations COP27 summit, Biden proclaimed the US is back as a global leader on climate change following passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which included around $370 billion in clean energy incentives meant to slash the use of harmful greenhouse gases.\n\n“My friends, I came to the presidency determined to make … transformational changes that are needed, that America needs to make and we have to do for the rest of the world, to overcome decades of opposition and obstacles of progress on this issue alone,” Biden said, “to reestablish the United States as a trustworthy and committee global leader on climate. As I stand here before you, we’ve taken enormous strides to achieve that.”\n\nBiden added that other nations must similarly raise to the challenge.\n\n“To permanently bend the emissions curve, every nation has needs to step up,” he said. “At this gathering, we must renew and raise our climate ambitions. The United States is acting. Everyone has to act. It’s a duty and responsibility of global leadership.”\n\nBiden arrived Friday to the climate summit underway in an Egyptian Red Sea resort eager to highlight major new US investments toward limiting climate change, a sharp difference from the last time he showed up at a climate conference empty handed.\n\nDuring his speech, Biden apologized for the US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord under former President Donald Trump, and said he was trying to prove to skeptics that “good climate policy is good economic policy.” He said those steps would drive progress and durable economic growth around the world.\n\nHe highlighted a new proposed rule requiring large federal contractors to develop carbon reduction targets and disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, leveraging the federal government’s purchasing power to combat climate change in the private sector and bolster vulnerable supply chains.\n\nBiden also announced new rules from his administration intended to further clamp down on super-polluting greenhouse gas methane. The Environmental Protection Agency plans to further strengthen an earlier regulation it announced to cut down on methane pollution from the oil and gas sector. As proposed, the updated rule would reduce methane emissions from oil and gas by 87% below 2005 levels.\n\nThe newly enhanced rule would also require oil and gas companies to respond to “credible third-party reports” of large methane leaks. The EPA rule still must go through a public comment process before it’s finalized.\n\nBiden announced new partnerships with foreign nations on cutting methane and several other new international climate initiatives. The US will double a multi-year pledge of adaptation funding to $100 million, and announce new climate partnerships with African and Pacific Island nations.\n\nThe actions the nation is taking means the US will “meet our emissions targets by 2030,” Biden said.\n\n“The climate crisis is about human security, economic security, environmental security, national security and the very life of the planet,” Biden said.\n\nBiden speaks at the COP27 summit on Friday. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nWorries about Republicans back in Washington\n\nYet many nations who have sent representatives to this week’s conference in Egypt are focused on another matter: demanding climate reparations be paid by wealthy and high-emitting countries like the United States to smaller, poorer nations who have felt the outsized effects of climate change.\n\nIt’s a proposal some European countries have latched onto, and have goaded Biden into supporting. But political constraints both in the United States and elsewhere make significant progress unlikely, at least in the near-term.\n\nBiden has already struggled to gain backing in Congress for global climate resilience funding, which would help low-income nations prepare for the adverse effects of a warming planet, like floods and other extreme events. If Republicans seize control of one or both chambers, the prospects of any new climate legislation over the next two years appears dim.\n\nWhen he was asked by reporters in Egypt how he plans to convince Republicans to fund his climate initiatives, Biden replied: “Reality.”\n\nSpeaking at the climate conference Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi acknowledged that after the midterm contests, Democrats will need to partner with Republicans on taking steps to fight climate change, even as she cast doubt on the opposing party’s willingness to take action.\n\n“Our colleagues said, ‘Why are we having this discussion, there is no climate crisis, it’s all a hoax,’” she said of the GOP reaction to investments meant to combat climate change that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n“We have to get over that,” she went on. “I place my confidence in their children, who will hopefully teach their parents that this is urgent, long overdue.”\n\nBiden’s climate envoy John Kerry on Wednesday announced a new plan to raise cash for climate action in the developing world by selling carbon credits to companies wishing to offset their emissions. He said the proposal would help countries decarbonize their energy system. But the plan has already attracted criticism because of the way it will be financed – with money raised in sales of carbon credits, which allow companies to pay for someone else to cut their planet-warming emissions, instead of cutting their own.\n\nBut he was frank in an interview with CNN’s David McKenzie that “there is not enough money in any country in the world to actually solve this problem,” referring to accelerating the energy transition and tackling the climate crisis.\n\nMeeting with El-Sisi\n\nEgyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi hosts Biden on the sidelines of the COP27 summit Friday. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMeeting with Egypt’s military-backed leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Biden thanked the host of this year’s COP27 summit for reminding the world of the urgency of the climate crisis.\n\n“It is an urgent crisis and we all have to do considerably more,” Biden said.\n\nHe said with Sisi he would discuss a wide range of issues, including the US-Egypt defense partnership, a more integrated Middle East, and – critically – human rights.\n\nThe president is only expected to be in Egypt for roughly three hours. He is stopping over on his way to other international summits in Asia.\n\nThe ensuing years saw the overthrow of the authoritarian leader Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring followed by a period of instability and the elevation to power of el-Sisi, whom Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump once referred to as his “favorite dictator.”\n\nBiden has kept Sisi at arms’ length over the course of his own presidency, and limited some military aid over human rights concerns. Ahead of their meeting, Biden said he was “looking forward to our conversation,” and praised Egypt for supporting Ukraine at the United Nations and for helping broker a ceasefire during a cross-border conflict in Gaza last year.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Biden, el-Sisi also raised the subject of human rights, claiming he’d established a comprehensive approach. The US has previously accused Egypt of a woeful human rights record.\n\nBefore he departed, Biden was urged by human rights activists and a group of House Democrats to raise with el-Sisi the imprisonment of British-Egyptian activist and writer Alaa Abd el-Fattah, who is currently on a hunger strike.\n\nA senior administration official said that the US is “concerned” about the case and that “human rights will feature prominently” in the president’s conversations abroad.\n\nAsked by reporters if he discussed el-Fattah with el-Sisi, Biden said, “What we talked about is the relationship between the United States and Egypt.”\n\nThis is a breaking story and will be updated.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Ella Nilsen", "Kevin Liptak", "Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/europe/ukraine-russia-news-thursday-lavrov-intl/index.html", "title": "Russia's main concerns over Ukraine not addressed by NATO, US ...", "text": "Moscow CNN —\n\nThe written responses presented by the United States and NATO to Russia’s security demands fail to address Moscow’s concerns over the eastward expansion of the military alliance, Russia’s Foreign Minister said Thursday as fears of a possible invasion of Ukraine remain high.\n\n“There is no positive reaction on the main issue in this document,” Sergey Lavrov told journalists in Moscow. “The main issue is our clear position on the inadmissibility of further expansion of NATO to the East and the deployment of strike weapons that could threaten the territory of the Russian Federation.”\n\nTensions between Moscow and Kyiv are at their highest in years, with a large Russian troop buildup near the shared borders of the two former Soviet republics.\n\nRussia has repeatedly denied it is planning an invasion but has argued that NATO support for Ukraine – including increased weapons supplies and military training – constitutes a growing threat on its western flank.\n\nLavrov explained the US and NATO had previously agreed within the context of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) not to expand at the expense of Russia’s safety.\n\n“We present non-verbal promises, written documents signed by the leaders of all the OSCE countries, including the President of the United States (Istanbul Declaration of 1999, Astana Declaration of 2010), our Western partners have to get out from a more serious situation,” Lavrov explained. “This principle is clearly stated. It has two main interrelated approaches. First, the right of every state to freely choose military alliances is recognized. Second: the obligation of each state not to strengthen its security at the expense of the security of others.”\n\n“In other words, the right to choose alliances is clearly conditioned by the need to take into account the security interests of any other OSCE state, including the Russian Federation,” Lavrov concluded.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Minister conceded the responses by the US and NATO could lead to serious discussions but only on secondary issues.\n\n“There is a reaction there that allows us to count on the beginning of a serious conversation, but on secondary topics,” he said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov echoed the same concerns on Thursday, saying on the surface, Russia’s prime concerns had not been addressed. He however refused to give an official definitive answer to the responses presented by the US and NATO.\n\nPeskov told journalists during a conference call that Vladimir Putin had read the written responses from both the US and NATO, but added that Russia’s President and his government won’t be rushing into any conclusions.\n\n“The President already read the written responses,” he said. “All the papers are with the President. It will take some time to analyze them, we will not rush to any conclusions.”\n\nRussia’s official response would not take long but Peskov cautioned it wouldn’t happen straight away.\n\nNATO sees ‘room for progress’\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday the US’s written response to Russia “sets out a serious diplomatic path forward should Russia choose it.”\n\nThe US has repeatedly said Putin’s central demand, that the US and NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine to the alliance, is non-negotiable.\n\nBlinken declined to detail specifics presented to Moscow in the written response, but reiterated the West’s public response to uphold NATO’s “open-door policy,” rejecting Moscow’s demands that NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine.\n\n“There is no change. There will be no change,” Blinken said of US and NATO support for the alliance’s open-door policy.\n\n“We make clear that there are core principles that we are committed to uphold and defend, including Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the right of states to choose their own security arrangements and alliances,” he added.\n\nNATO’s Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday that the alliance’s written response was sent in “parallel with the United States.”\n\nAlthough the positions of Moscow and the alliance are “far apart,” the NATO chief outlined three main areas where NATO sees “room for progress.” He asked that Moscow and NATO reopen their “respective offices in Moscow and in Brussels.”\n\nIt is unclear whether the latest diplomatic overture, which Moscow had sought, will change the course of talks between Russia and the West that have continued over the past several weeks.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Ministry Alexey Zaytsev told journalists Thursday that they consider the idea of war between Russia and Ukraine “unacceptable” adding that a discussion on a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine in Paris “was not easy” and ended without result.\n\nHe was referring to Wednesday’s meeting of the so-called Normandy Format – a four-way conversation between representatives from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France – that has been trying to broker peace in eastern Ukraine since 2014.\n\nZaytsev said he hoped for a different outcome when the four countries meet again in Berlin in two weeks. “There is no alternative to the Minsk agreements,” he said in reference to the framework for peace in the region that has repeatedly failed since it was first partially implemented in 2015.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a positive assessment of the talks, in a Thursday statement that described the discussion as meaningful.\n\nZelensky also spoke with US President Biden on Thursday in a call that “did not go well,” according to a senior Ukrainian official, with disagreements resurfacing on the “risk levels” regarding a possible Russian attack.\n\nThe White House, however, disputed the official’s account, warning that anonymous sources were “leaking falsehoods.” They did state that Biden warned Zelensky an imminent invasion is a “distinct possibility.”\n\nOn the call, which the Ukrainian official described as “long and frank,” Biden warned his Ukrainian counterpart that a Russian attack may be imminent, saying that an invasion was now virtually certain, once the ground had frozen later in February, according to the official.\n\nZelensky, however, restated his position that the threat from Russia remains “dangerous but ambiguous,” and it is not certain that an attack will take place, the official said.\n\nTroop buildup rings alarm bells\n\nUkrainians – who have been at war for nearly eight years since Russia annexed Crimea and Russia-backed separatists took control of the eastern Ukrainian cities of Donetsk and Luhansk – are desperate for reprieve from the drumbeats of war.\n\nIn an opinion article published on CNN, Olesia Markovic described how the Russian troop buildup at the border was ringing alarm bells for Ukrainian society.\n\n“People admit the uncertainty and the lack of clear emergency instructions are draining their intellectual and emotional resources, making it hard to focus on current tasks and their ability to make long-term plans,” she writes.\n\nOn Thursday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow, not Kyiv, must make concessions to defuse tensions in the region.\n\n“The logic that Ukraine always has to make concessions in order to prevent Russia from being more aggressive… doesn’t work this way,” Kuleba told journalists during a visit to Copenhagen.\n\n“I firmly believe that it’s important for Western countries to succeed in this particular crisis, for the reasons that I mentioned, because in recent years, Russia has been attacking not only Ukraine,” he said, pointing to Moscow using gas supplies, alleged cyberattacks and other tactics to hit the West.", "authors": ["Uliana Pavlova Tara John Vasco Cotovio", "Uliana Pavlova",

Donald Trump is a loser,\" Biden thundered as he began a speech in which he touted his support for unions in the pro-labor crowd and said he would protect Social Security, lower the cost of prescription drugs, expand health care, institute an assault weapons ban and protect abortion rights. \"Above all else, we’re going to stand up for our constitution and save our democracy,\" he said.\n\nOn a couple of occasions, Biden's speech faltered briefly as he seemed to realize he might misspeak and he mispronounced U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar's name. He also appeared to mix up a date at one point — but at no point did he appear to ramble or be lost as to the contentions he was trying to make.\n\nAs for Trump, Biden said he was an enemy to democracy and a friend to authoritarians and hammered away at a vision concocted by the conservative Heritage Foundation for a conservative, top-to-bottom revamping of the federal government which his campaign has claimed is \"a project built for Trump,\" even though the former president has tried to distance himself from the plan. The 900-plus-page \"Project 2025\" framework includes calls for upending the present civil service system, giving presidents more power to appoint and fire workers, eliminating the Education Department, limiting abortion pills and pursuing other conservative policies.\n\nHe underscored how those changes, if enacted, could hurt Black families in Detroit by reducing access to health care and government aid programs.\n\nBiden also laid out his vision for the first 100 days of his second term if reelected. He vowed to make Roe v. Wade “the law of the land.” Among the other policy goals he put forward, he vowed to sign into law new voting rights legislation, expand Social Security and Medicare by drawing in more tax revenue from wealthy Americans, raise the federal minimum wage, ban assault weapons and create a permanent child care tax credit.\n\nBiden's speech seemed designed to remind Democrats of the stakes of the upcoming election and underscore his belief that he is the best candidate to beat Trump, despite polls that have shown him trailing the former president. In recent weeks, Democratic fears that Biden would stumble and clear the way to a second Trump presidency — especially in the wake of a debate in late June in which Biden seemed tired and had a hard time forming coherent responses — have motivated the 11th-hour calls by some in Biden's own party to replace him at the top of the ticket.\n\nBiden, speaking at what was his fourth campaign event in the state this year but his first actual campaign rally in Michigan since the 2020 election, acknowledged mistakes in that debate and that he sometimes misspeaks and transposes names. But he said Trump does that as well and that he has gotten \"a free pass.\"\n\n\"Do you really want to go back to the chaos of Donald Trump as president?\" Biden said, arguing that Trump's plans for tariffs and tax cuts will cause a recession and increase inflation, which has been falling in recent months.\n\n\"Hopefully, with age, comes a little wisdom. And here’s what I know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how and I’ve demonstrated how to do this job. And I know Americans want a president, not a dictator,\" he said later.\n\nThe speech was delivered less than 24 hours after a high-stakes news conference in Washington on Thursday during which Biden faced numerous questions about whether he should step down as the nominee.\n\nSome attendees appeared split on the question.\n\nMarcia Hales, 74, of Grosse Pointe Woods, said she thought another Democrat might have a better shot at beating Trump. On her walk to the rally, Hales — an abstract painter — said she plans to support Biden if he's the nominee. \"But I really do think that we could get excited about somebody new, younger,\" she said.\n\nBut nursing instructor Pamela Dunbar, 65, of Oak Park, said Biden should stay in the race, saying if he beat Trump once, he can do it again. \"And I don't think one bad debate should force him to move out,\" she said.\n\nCertainly, the mood in the room was for the president to remain the nominee, with supporters holding banners saying \"MOTOWN IS JOETOWN.\"\n\nWhile Biden has repeatedly characterized the upcoming Nov. 5 election as a fight for American democracy and insisted that Trump poses an existential threat to the country's future, some Democrats have continued to cast serious doubts on Biden's claim that he can beat Trump.\n\nAs of Friday, at least 18 Democratic U.S. House members and one U.S. senator had called for him to step aside, especially following that disastrous debate in late June.\n\nU.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Grand Rapids, is the only Democrat in Michigan's congressional delegation to do so. \"With the challenges facing our country in 2025 and beyond, it is essential that we have the strongest possible candidate leading the top of the ticket- not just to win, but to govern,\" she said in a statement Thursday.\n\nWith every seat in the Michigan House of Representatives on the ballot this fall, state Rep. Phil Skaggs, D-East Grand Rapids, has expressed concern that having Biden on the ballot will hurt Democrats down ballot.\n\nBut ahead of Biden's visit, a group of metro Detroit Democratic state lawmakers penned a letter expressing their \"unwavering support\" for their party's presumptive nominee, who is expected to formally receive the nomination in a virtual roll call before next month's convention in August if he remains in the race as he says he intends to. \"Under President Biden's leadership, we have witnessed significant progress that directly impacts Black communities across Michigan and the nation at large,\" the letter states.\n\nTraveling with the president to Michigan were three members of the state's U.S. House delegation, Reps. Debbie Dingell, of Ann Arbor, Haley Stevens, of Birmingham, and Thanedar, of Detroit. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime friend and supporter of the president's, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and actor Octavia Spencer greeted him on arrival and all delivered speeches at the rally as did Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II.\n\nMissing from Biden's rally in Detroit was his top campaign surrogate in Michigan: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. She was absent due to a previously scheduled trip to Sun Valley, Idaho, according to her office.\n\nRepublicans criticized Biden before his visit, with Michigan GOP spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita predicting the president would \"sleepwalk through his trip to Detroit.\"\n\nBiden's visit was met by protests, too; a crowd of around 20 gathered near the event's entrance, many wearing keffiyehs. In addition to calls that he insist on an Israeli cease-fire in Gaza, chants demanded that the Democrats find a new presidential nominee. One man carried a sign that read \"Pass the torch, Joe.\"\n\n\"We're tired of business as usual,\" said Abdul Bari, of Detroit. He waved a Palestinian flag toward passing cars. Some honked, while others rolled up their windows as they headed toward the event.\n\nDan Lombard, a peace activist, carried a large cardboard sign that read simply \"CEASEFIRE,\" around the perimeter of the event. He was saddened by the calls for Biden to step down, he said, and doesn't think the president can't do the job — just that he's not right for it.\n\nBefore heading to Renaissance High School for the rally, the president and his entourage stopped at a campaign organizing event at The Garage Grill & Fuel Bar in Northville to talk briefly with supporters and volunteers.\n\nThe last-minute pleadings from Democrats for Biden to step down as nominee frustrated Jonna Siano, 60, of Battle Creek, who attended the rally at Renaissance High. \"I really feel that people describe it courageous right now to step up and tell him to bow out. I think courage would have been a year ago,\" she said. Now she bemoans what she sees as a lack of strategy among the Democratic Party.\n\nRobert Tucker, 76, of Southfield, said Democrats should have stepped up to challenge Biden. Instead, they essentially handed Biden the nomination, he said, only to have second thoughts now.\n\nThe location of the Biden rally in Detroit holds significance for the president's reelection prospects. The biggest city in Michigan — a crucial battleground state — is one of the nation's largest majority-Black cities and a Democratic stronghold. But low turnout in Detroit could hamper Biden's chances of staying in office.\n\nAs he faces calls to drop out of the race, Biden has visited Democratic strongholds in key battleground states. In addition to his stop in Michigan on Friday, Biden has held campaign events in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In 2016, Trump won those three previously dubbed \"blue wall\" states that hadn't backed the GOP presidential candidate since the 1980s. But Biden won the trio of toss-up states in 2020, defeating Trump.\n\nDetroit Free Press Data Intern Carmela Guaglianone contributed to this article.\n\nContact Clara Hendrickson:chendrickson@freepress.com or 313-296-5743.

After the debate, Democrats were sweating over the president's performance and his stumbles over talking points, data and more.\n\nThe president and the former president for 90 minutes attacked each other's records on the issues facing the nation: childcare costs, the spread of opioids and other challenges. They also waged into America's role on the world stage, with moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper pressing the candidate on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn one of the most heated moments of the night, Biden and Trump also fought over reports that the former president called veterans who lost their lives in war 'suckers.'\n\nCatch up with live updates from the USA TODAY Network.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nDonald Trump Veepstakes enter home stretch after Atlanta debate\n\nNow that the first debate is over, the Donald Trump running mate race heads into overdrive.\n\nA bevy of potential Republican vice presidential candidates flocked to Atlanta to carry the flag for Trump before and after his clash with Joe Biden - and amid news reports and informed speculation that the presumptive GOP 2024 nominee could announce his decision any day now.\n\n\"He's told some people, yeah,\" said Lara Trump, the former president's daughter-in-law and a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, speaking to NBC News.\n\nThe Trump debate surrogate list included the most often mentioned possibilities: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, and Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio, Tim Scott of South Carolina, and Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Sense of shock': Democrats melt down over Joe Biden's debate disaster\n\nDemocrats and other opponents of Donald Trump melted down as Joe Biden struggled during Thursday's debate, with some suggesting he should bow out to allow another Democrat to run instead.\n\nBiden's voice was hoarse and raspy from the start. He stumbled over words and had to correct himself with numbers. He was sometimes hard to follow. On one occasion, the president appeared to lose his train of thought, concluding − confusingly − with the line, \"we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\n\"That's a good man. He loves his country. He's doing the best that he can,\" said Van Jones, a Democratic political analyst on CNN. \"But he had a test to meet tonight to restore confidence in the country and of the base, and he failed to do that.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump concludes: ‘We’re in a failing nation ... but we’re gonna make it great again’\n\nTrump in his closing statement called Biden a “complainer” and said Biden “doesn’t do anything.”\n\n“This man is just a complainer,” Trump said, mocking Biden. “He said ‘We wanna do this, we wanna do that, we wanna get rid of this tax, that tax.’ But he doesn’t do anything.’”\n\nHe also took aim at the Biden administration’s foreign policy, claiming that none of the crises across the world would be happening if Trump was still in office.\n\n“We looked like fools in Afghanistan,” Trump said. Hamas’ attack against Israel on Oct. 7, Trump claimed without evidence, was such a “horrible thing that would have never happened,” if he were still president. “Ukraine should have never happened,” Trump added.\n\n“We’re in a failing nation but it’s not gonna be failing anymore. We’re gonna make it great again,” Trump concluded.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nBiden zeroes in on bringing down inflation, fixing tax system in closing statement\n\nBiden closed his debate performance by insisting that he would implement “a fair tax system” if he’s reelected, including guaranteeing that people who make less than $400,000 won’t see a tax increase.\n\nHe contrasted that by saying Trump increased taxes, caused inflation by fumbling the pandemic response, and will make it worse by implementing a 10% tariff on all imports to the U.S.\n\nBiden also touted policies passed since he became president, including lowering the cost of prescriptions. And he said if he is reelected, he would advance policies to support childcare and fix “bad pipes and other things causing health problems.”\n\n“We’re going to continue to fight inflation and give people a break,” he concluded.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nA \"childish\" argument about golf\n\nIt took an argument about golf scores - one of their few direct exchanges - to get the two candidates to accuse each other of childishness.\n\n\"Let's not act like children,\" Trump told Biden.\n\nReplied Biden: \"You are a child.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump blames Biden border policies for spread of opioids\n\nAsked what they would do to support people in the throes of opioid addiction, both candidates focused on the situation at the southern border.\n\nTrump said the flow of drugs across the border was under control until the COVID-19 pandemic. “Then we had to get tough,” he said, adding that drugs were “pouring across the border.”\n\nHe argued that since Biden has come into office, the flow of drugs is back up. Biden rebutted that he fought to get equipment that could detect fentanyl coming across the border, but that Trump killed the bipartisan deal in Congress that would have funded it.\n\n“He never argued it’s not a good bill. It’s a good bill,” he said.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nYour money and the presidential debate: Trump and Biden spar over the economy, inflation\n\nAt the top of the high-stakes faceoff, Joe Biden and former Donald Trump sparred over their economic records in a bid to persuade undecided voters theirs is the winning plan to slow rising prices.\n\nExasperated Americans are paying more for the basics from check-out lanes to the gas pump, souring the national mood and making the inflation surge one of Biden’s greatest challenges going into the November rematch with Trump.\n\nYour money and the presidential debate:: Trump and Biden spar over the economy, inflation\n\n– Jessica Guynn and Bailey Schulz\n\nJoe Biden claim: No American troops died anywhere in the world during his presidency\n\n“The truth is, I’m the only president this century that doesn’t have any - this decade - that doesn’t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like (former President Donald Trump) did.”\n\nBiden’s comment came following a reference to hostilities in Afghanistan during Trump’s term in office. But the notion that no troops have died in the world during Biden’s time in office is wrong.\n\nThirteen U.S. service members were killed in a suicide bombing attack near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in August 2021, when Biden was president, as thousands tried to flee the Taliban’s takeover of the country, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nAmong the deaths were 11 Marines, one Navy hospital corpsman and one Army soldier. Biden remarked on the deaths at the time, calling them “tragic.”\n\nMore recently, three U.S. Army Reserve soldiers were killed in January at a base in Jordan in what was described as a drone attack by Iran-backed militants.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nFor more fact checks about what Trump and Biden said, follow USA TODAY's live debate fact check here (Biden-Trump debate fact check: Separating lies from truth (usatoday.com)\n\nTrump's claim: The US southern border is the most dangerous place in the world\n\n“We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world”\n\nThis is false. While deaths, disappearances and violence do occur at the U.S. southern border, there is no evidence to suggest it is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nStatistics on border deaths vary. Customs and Border Protection data shows 171 people died at the border in fiscal year 2022, some in CBP custody and others while attempting to cross the border. The International Organization for Migration, a U.N.-related organization, documented 686 deaths and disappearances of migrants on the US-Mexico border in 2022.\n\nPlaces all over the world and even in the U.S. have more frequent deaths. For example, there were more than 700 murders in Chicago in 2022, according to the Chicago Police Department. Chicago is 228 square miles, while the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,951 miles long.\n\n– Brad Sylvester\n\nFor more fact checks about what Trump and Biden said, follow USA TODAY's live debate fact check here (Biden-Trump debate fact check: Separating lies from truth (usatoday.com)\n\nBiden: Trump ‘didn’t do a damn thing about’ climate change\n\nTrump claimed he “had the best environmental numbers ever” and said his administration took significant action to address climate change: “My environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage actually.”\n\n“I have no idea where he’s been,” Biden responded, touting legislation he led that made significant investments in combating climate change, including the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden went after Trump for pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords, arguing the former president did nothing to fight climate change.\n\n“The only existential threat to humanity is climate change and he didn’t do a damn thing about it,” Biden said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nTrump and Biden battle over serving Black communities\n\nAsked what he says to Black voters who are disappointed he hasn’t done more to help their communities during his time in office, Biden said: “I don’t blame you” and noted inflation is hurting them. But he said he has proposed tax credits for first-time homebuyers who are Black and made it easier for Black students to take out loans for college.\n\nHe added that he supports other policies that would help Black families, such as cutting childcare costs.\n\nTrump leaned into that response, arguing that Biden’s economic policies have hurt the pocketbooks of families of color and said undocumented immigrants are taking the jobs of workers of color.\n\n“He caused inflation and it’s killing Black families and Hispanic families,” he said. Trump added that he funded historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and supported criminal justice reform and economic opportunity zones.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWhat happened when Biden froze?\n\nJoe Biden was in the middle of answering a question about the economy during the debate on Thursday night when he began to stutter, froze on stage, and then began talking about the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"We'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do, child care, elder care, making sure that we continue to spend our health care system, making sure that we're in every single solitary person eligible,\" Biden said, before taking a long pause.\n\nHe then began talking about the COVID-19 pandemic and Medicare.\n\n\"For what I've been able to do with the COVID, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do,\" he said, before taking another pause. \"If we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nBiden hits Trump over white supremacists in Charlottesville\n\nIn going after Trump, Biden cited the incident he says inspired him to run for president in 2020: The violent 2017 rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nBiden noted that Trump said supportive things about the Charlottesville rioters. Trump accused Biden of making his criticism up, though Trump did say there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the deadly demonstration.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden freeze sparks backlash on Twitter\n\nBiden freezing on stage when discussing healthcare quickly drew fire on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“Sorry, I’m voting for President Biden but a disaster so far,” wrote Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and NBC News analyst, on the platform.\n\nStephen Hayes, editor and CEO of The Dispatch, tweeted, “Let the Dem panic begin.”\n\n“Holy shit. Joe Biden isn’t running. He just froze. Trump is murdering him,” tweeted American writer and lawyer Clay Travis.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden hits Trump over his felony conviction\n\nDonald Trump responded to the fact that he is a \"convicted felon\" by claiming – without evidence – that Biden is a future felon.\n\n\"This man is a criminal,\" Trump said of his opponent, also noting that Biden's son Hunter Biden has already been convicted on a gun charge.\n\nBiden called the accusation \"outrageous,\" and added: \"It's simply a lie.\" For good measure, Biden noted that Trump's criminal case involved hush money to a \"porn star.\"\n\n\"You have the morals of an alley cat,\" Biden told Trump.\n\nThis all began with a question about Trump's claims that he may seek retribution against political opponents if he gets back into the White House.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump doesn’t take responsibility when asked about Jan. 6 Capitol attack\n\nTrump didn’t take blame for the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack when he was asked about a mob of his supporters breaching the building in a bid to overturn the 2020 election results. Instead, he repeated his false claims that the attack was former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s fault.\n\nTrump claimed he offered Pelosi “10,000 soldiers” to stop the attack, but Pelosi’s office has said she was never presented the offer by the former president. Pelosi also would not have had the power to refuse such an offer regardless.\n\nIn response, Biden went after Trump for his inaction during the attack, instead watching the riots unfold from the White House. He also slammed Trump for calling Jan. 6 defendants “patriots” and promising to pardon them.\n\n“The idea that those people are patriots? Come on,” Biden said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nBiden touts support for Israel, slams Trump on NATO\n\nAsked what additional leverage he would use to end the Israel-Hamas War, Biden said international leaders and experts have endorsed his plan for a ceasefire, which would include trading hostages held by Hamas for a ceasefire.\n\nHe added that “the only thing I denied Israel” was 2,000-lb bombs that can do significant civilian damage, and said Israel is getting “all the weapons they need” from the U.S.\n\nTrump said Israel wants to continue its war against Hamas. “You should let them go and let them finish the job,” he said to Biden.\n\nBiden – in one of his more forceful responses of the debate so far – said Trump wants to pull out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and said U.S. strength relies on alliances. “He has no idea what the hell he’s talking about.”\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump asked about Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nPutin would have never invaded Ukraine if he was president, Trump claimed without evidence. But he added Putin's terms in its brutal invasion of Ukraine should not be accepted.\n\nBiden retorted by saying he'd never heard more malarkey.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to Trump: 'You're the sucker, you're the loser'\n\nThe angriest exchange of the night came when Biden cited reports that Trump has described veterans as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\"\n\n\"You're the sucker, you're the loser,\" Biden told Trump.\n\nTrump denied making such comments, and demanded an apology from Biden. Not a chance, Biden replied.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPressed about his deportation plan, Trump goes after Biden over border\n\nTrump was asked about his plans to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history” and whether he intended to deport all undocumented immigrants in the U.S., including those currently working critical jobs, whose spouses are citizens and have resided here for decades.\n\nTrump declined to answer and instead criticized Biden over his handling of the southern border and repeated his past anti-immigrant rhetoric at the podium.\n\n“We are living right now in a rat’s nest,” Trump said. “Every state is now a border state and it’s because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies. People are coming in and they’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen.”\n\n“We’re literally an uncivilized country,” Trump added.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nTrump: I won’t block abortion pill\n\nTrump said he won’t block abortion medication if he is reelected.\n\nHe noted that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a challenge to mifepristone, the pill commonly used in medication abortions, said he agrees with that decision, “and I will not block it.”\n\nHe took credit for appointing the justices that were crucial votes in overturning Roe v. Wade and said the states are “all making their own decisions,” later adding that “the country is now coming together on this issue. It’s been a great thing.”\n\nBiden rebutted that it has been “terrible” since Roe was overturned. He said he would reinstate the protections under Roe if he is reelected.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump appears to call Biden 'Brandon'\n\nTrump at one point appeared to call Trump \"Brandon,\" a reference to \"Let's go, Brandon,\" which has become a joke and a rallying cry for Republicans.\n\nThe phrase originated at an Oct. 2 NASCAR race at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Brandon Brown, a 28-year-old driver, had won his first Xfinity Series and was being interviewed by an NBC Sports reporter. The crowd behind him was chanting something at first difficult to make out. The reporter suggested they were chanting “Let’s go, Brandon” to cheer the driver. But it was clear they were saying, “(Expletive) Joe Biden.\"\n\n– USA TODAY staff\n\nOn top earners paying less in taxes\n\nWith US facing trillion dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now? Trump said the tax cuts spurred the “greatest economy that we've ever seen. “ Just prior to Covid and even after Covid, it was so strong that we're able to get through Covid much better than just about any other country, but we spurred that tax spurred.”\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden's voice draws attention\n\nOne story so far, at least on social media: Biden's hoarse-sounding voice.\n\nPollster Frank Luntz, who is conducting a focus group on the showdown, said on X: \"My focus group of undecided voters is surprised and concerned about Biden’s voice. This doesn’t bode well for questions about his health.\"\n\n–David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden: The economy is coming back\n\nThe first question is to Biden about inflation.\n\nBiden, sounding somewhat hoarse, said the economy fell apart on Trump's watch thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is coming back under current leadership - slowly, but surely.\n\n\"Working class people\" are still struggling, Biden said.\n\nTrump replied that Biden's handling of the COVID crisis sparked inflation, and the two argued about who has the best economic approach.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Biden skip a handshake\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Biden took the stage on Thursday night without a traditional handshake, walking directly to their podiums.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden jokes about taking ‘performance enhancers’ ahead of debate\n\nJoe Biden joked about being on “performance enhancers” in a social media post shortly before the start of the debate – mocking the conspiracies pushed by Trump and some Republicans that Biden would have to take drugs to keep up.\n\n“I don't know what they've got in these performance enhancers, but I'm feeling pretty jacked up. Try it yourselves, folks,” Biden said in the post, holding a can that reads “Biden” and his slogan “No Malarkey.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly challenged Biden to a drug test, arguing taking artificial enhancements is the only way the 81-year-old Biden can display energy during the debate. Republicans have suggested, without evidence, that Biden was on drugs during his State of the Union address in March.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat time is the debate? 9 p.m. eastern to central, pacific\n\nThe CNN Presidential Debate will begin at 9 p.m. ET, which is 8 p.m. CT and 6 p.m. PT.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nCan I livestream the debate? How do I watch the debate without cable?\n\nYes. A livestream and recording of the first presidential debate will be available on USA TODAY’s YouTube channel.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHow popular is Joe Biden?\n\nHow popular is President Joe Biden? People are certainly curious. Searches for \"Joe Biden approval rating\" in the past one hour shot up by more than 150%, according to Google Trends data.\n\nAccording to a recent Gallup poll, Biden’s latest 38% job approval rating remains largely unchanged from recent months and continues to put him well below the 48%+ threshold all reelected incumbents in the modern era have had at the time of the election.\n\nHis ratings among the three major party groups are also steady, with 83% of Democrats, 33% of independents and 5% of Republicans expressing approval.\n\n–Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nLongshot Trump VP pick Sen. Katie Britt is not at the first presidential debate\n\nSen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., one of about 20 Republicans seen as a potential Donald Trump option for vice president, will be watching Thursday's first presidential debate from her home in Montgomery, Alabama, a staffer for the senator confirmed.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to watching President Trump win tonight's debate as he outlines his vision to restore secure borders, safe streets, stable prices, and strong families,\" Britt said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nBritt's physical absence from the event in Atlanta could be a signal that the State of the Union star will not be Trump's pick.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nRFK Jr. to hold his own livestream debate tonight\n\nDuring Thursday’s presidential debate, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is hosting a program over livestream after he failed to qualify for tonight’s event.\n\nTo make it to the debate stage, candidates had to get on a sufficient number of state ballots as well as earn at least 15% in four separate national polls. Shortly after the CNN Presidential Debate was announced last month, Kennedy filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that CNN violated federal election laws by scheduling the June debate.\n\nKennedy will respond to the same questions that Biden and Trump are asked in a livestreamed event moderated by John Stossel that his campaign is calling “The Real Debate.” It will start at the same time as the presidential debate and will be held in front of a live audience in a Los Angeles studio.\n\n– Maya Marchel Hoff\n\nMelania Trump? Eric Trump? Who's with Trump in Atlanta?\n\nAs Donald Trump arrived in Atlanta Thursday evening for the pivotal debate, some political observers were watching who's in Trump's entourage for the event.\n\nFootage from Trump landing in Atlanta shows he deplaned alone, and it is unclear if his wife Melania or other members of his family are there with him.\n\nBut several Trump surrogates\n\nwho have also been floated for the vice presidential candidacy, are part of the entourage in Trump's spin room, including North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum; Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and others.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nDebate spin room buzzing hours before Trump and Biden take the stage\n\nHours before the big matchup between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the floor at Georgia Tech University’s McCamish Pavilion – a basketball arena converted to debate spin room – was buzzing with reporters, campaign officials and politicians.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom; Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy all were swarmed by reporters.\n\nTrump campaign aide Corey Lewandowski and Republican National Convention co-chair David Bossie also circulated in the crowd, along with religious leader Ralph Reed. FOX News host Sean Hannity walked through the crowd and stopped to chat with Reed.\n\nAsked about the questions Trump continues to face surrounding his character and temperament, Lewandowski said “it’s up for the American people to decide.”\n\n“They get to decide if an 82-year-old who is practicing standing for 90 minutes should be the next leader of this country,” Lewandowski said, adding a year to Biden’s age. “Or if Donald Trump should be the leader of this country because they don’t like they way he… made some remarks.”\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nBiden campaign to launch ads during debate\n\nThe Biden campaign will air a set of three ads in battleground states criticizing Trump on issues such as reproductive rights and threats to democracy, CNN reported.\n\nThe first ad, which will run before the debate, will seek to tie Trump to abortion restrictions passed by states after Roe v. Wade’s fall in 2022.\n\nThe second ad will feature a Michigan sheriff who will slam Trump for refusing to denounce the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, according to the outlet. The third ad, which will air after the debate, will focus on criminal charges across four indictments.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhere do Donald Trump and Joe Biden stand on student loan forgiveness?\n\nOne of Joe Biden’s signature priorities while in the White House has been addressing student loan debt. With his effort challenged or blocked in court, the president said alternative actions by his Education Department have resulted in $160 billion in debt relief for nearly 4.6 million borrowers as of May 2024.\n\nDonald Trump has criticized Biden’s efforts to cancel student loan debt for millions of borrowers. In 2023 he also praised the Supreme Court justices for striking down a chunk of Biden’s plan, which Trump called unfair for people who have paid back their educational loans.\n\n– Joey Garrison, David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs Biden or Trump leading in the polls ahead of the debate?\n\nTrump and Biden are in a near dead-heat, according to a Real Clear Politics average of national polling. Trump is slightly ahead at 46.6% compared to Biden’s 45.1%, but those results are well within the margin of error.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nUSA TODAY is fact checking the first 2024 debate\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will be investigating claims from the presumptive nominees on debate night.\n\nWe'll be watching for statements that exaggerate, mislead, misrepresent or otherwise stray from reality.

And you won't have to take our word for it, since we'll always link our sources as we go.\n\nPresidential debate live fact check: What Trump, Biden got right (and wrong)\n\n– Bradley Sylvester\n\nJake Tapper and Dana Bash: Who is moderating the debate?\n\nCNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate the debate. Both have experience moderating political debates, including CNN’s Republican Presidential Primary Debate this cycle.\n\nOn Monday, Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt accused the longtime political journalists of being biased during an interview with CNN's Kasie Hunt before the host abruptly ended the interview, The Hill reported.\n\nCNN defended Tapper and Bash, saying in a statement shared with USA TODAY Tuesday, \"there are no two people better equipped to co-moderate a substantial and fact-based discussion.\"\n\n– Rachel Barber and Kinsey Crowley\n\nJill Biden rallies supporters before debate\n\nHours before the two presumptive nominees were slated to hit the debate stage for the first time in the 2024 presidential race, first lady Jill Biden stopped in Virginia Beach on her way to Atlanta to support her husband, President Joe Biden.\n\n“You all know that there’s two visions for America and you’ll see them tonight when you watch the debate,” she told the crowd that had gathered inside of the Biden-Harris campaign office in Virginia Beach for a sign-making event.\n\n“You’ve already chosen your vision, or you wouldn’t be here,” she said to the crowd of Biden supporters. “The vision you’ve chosen is for strong, steady leadership versus the other vision, which is chaos and corruption.”\n\n– Elizabeth Beyer\n\nWhat are the rules for the debate?\n\nThe candidates will be provided with a pen, pad of paper and a water bottle, but are prohibited from bringing props or prewritten notes. Following a history of presidential frontrunners talking over one another, CNN announced candidates' microphones will be muted throughout the debate when it is not their turn to speak.\n\nThe candidates will also not be able to consult with their campaign teams during the event’s two commercial breaks, a departure from past formats overseen by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nBiden’s campaign won a coin flip against Trump’s, giving his aides the choice between selecting the president’s podium or the order of the debate’s closing statements. The president’s campaign opted for the podium on the right side of the stage, meaning Trump's campaign got to choose the order of closing statements. His team opted to give Trump the final word.\n\n– Rachel Barber, Sudiksha Kochi and Marina Pitofsky\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp did not vote for Trump in the primary\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, revealed that he did not vote for his party’s frontrunner, Donald Trump, in the state’s primary election in March.\n\nThe governor revealed his decision – counter to that of many GOP voters and lawmakers – in an interview with CNN on the eve of the historic debate between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\n“I didn’t vote for anybody,” Kemp told CNN Wednesday when asked if he voted for Trump.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is in the debate?\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will face off in the first presidential debate. Third party candidates including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will not participate in the debate.\n\nIn order to secure a spot on stage, CNN required candidates to have received at least 15% support in four approved national polls and qualify for the ballot in enough states to have the opportunity to earn the 270 electoral votes in November needed to win the White House.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhat channel is the debate?\n\nThe debate will air on CNN and its related channels including CNN International and CNN en Español. Several other networks will carry the debate including Fox News, ABC News, NBC News, and NewsMax.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nGOP lawmakers want to see a more measured Donald Trump\n\nHouse Republicans tuning into tonight’s debate hope to see a more mellow version of Donald Trump compared to his previous debates with Joe Biden, telling USA TODAY that policy debates should be the priority for the former president.\n\nBut those GOP lawmakers acknowledged that Trump’s previous performance in debates means they can’t exactly have high hopes.\n\n“I think he’s his own man and he’s gonna do what he’s gonna do,” Rep. Jake Ellzey, R-Texas, said. Ellzey thinks Trump is going to come off more “gentlemanly” tonight.\n\n“You’re never gonna change Donald Trump. He is who he is, he talks the way he does,” Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., said. But he hopes to at least see a “little more measured approach” and “a little more hopeful.”\n\n“You been to Baskin Robbins? There’s 31 flavors,” Alford said. “I think there’s 31 flavors of Donald Trump. You’re going to see the rocky road, you’re going to see the daiquiri ice, you’re going to see a little vanilla. But in the end, it’s gonna be something you want to take home.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden says it's 'good to be back' in Atlanta\n\nJoe Biden shared photos of voters cheering in Atlanta a few hours before the first 2024 presidential debate.\n\n\"I met some incredible supporters who are fired up ahead of tonight’s debate. Let’s finish the job,\" he shared on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nx.com\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWill tonight's presidential debate be a 2020 replay? Here's what Chris Wallace said\n\nCNN personality Chris Wallace suggested on \"The Source with Kaitlin Collins\" that Donald Trump may change tactics in the first debate of the 2024 presidential election. Wallace moderated the first debate in 2020 between Trump and Joe Biden when he was an anchor at Fox News. That debate provided multiple campaign changing moments.\n\n\"I’ve talked to a lot of people in the top echelons of his staff. They say he finally understands how badly he did in the 2020 debate,\" Wallace said. \"The two words that are coming out ― you don’t usually hear from the Trump camp ― are ‘nice’ and ‘respectful.'\"\n\n– James Powel and Kinsey Crowley\n\nWhite House reporters urge CNN to widen access during debate\n\nThe White House Correspondents’ Association said they're concerned about CNN’s decision to deny their request for a specific White House pool reporter inside the studio during the network’s presidential debate in Atlanta between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nCurrently, CNN rules state that a pool of still photographers will be allowed in the studio, but a reporter specifically representing print reporters will be given access during commercial breaks. But a broader group of White House reporters say they need more access to cover the historic event.\n\n“That is not sufficient in our view and diminishes a core principle of presidential coverage,” the statement says. “The White House pool has a duty to document, report and witness the president’s events and his movements on behalf of the American people.\"\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Biden and Trump shake hands?\n\nIt's not clear. The president's campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond told Fox News that he probably wouldn't shake Trump's hand, but he added that he believes \"President Biden consistently rises above pettiness.\" Prior to the 2016 election between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a handshake was a central part of decorum of presidential debates.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nWhere do Trump and Biden stand on Ukraine?\n\nTrump has called for pulling back on U.S. defense commitments, throwing into doubt additional U.S. aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia. He has also privately said he could end Russia’s war in Ukraine by pressuring its embattled government to give up territory, the Washington Post reported, despite the repeated and vehement refusal of Ukraine's leaders to cede any land in the conflict.\n\nBiden has been a vocal supporter of additional U.S. aid to Ukraine. He struggled, but ultimately prevailed, in 2024 to get Congress to provide additional support for Israel in its fight against Hamas and for Ukraine in its war against Russia’s invasion.\n\n– John Bacon and David Jackson\n\nWho is Donald Trump's VP pick? Everything to know about the many possibilities\n\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump have not yet been formally nominated by their party, and Trump has yet to announce his pick for a vice presidential running mate.\n\nTrump told NBC News he has decided on a running mate, and they could be in Atlanta for the debate. Here is what to know about Trump's vice presidential candidate search so far:\n\nWho is Donald Trump's VP pick?Everything to know about the many possibilities\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump's potential running mates trek to Atlanta\n\nTrump and Biden won't be the only national candidates speaking tonight in Atlanta – there are also all those Trump vice presidential candidates.\n\nTrump surrogates who will be speaking to the media include the three most often mentioned vice presidential prospects: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nThere are also long-shot Republican veep candidates surrogating for Trump, including businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPlay along with presidential debate bingo\n\nReady to win presidential debate bingo?

Five squares in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, wins bingo.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhere do Trump and Biden stand on health care?\n\nExpanding health care coverage provided by the Affordable Care Act and lowering prescription drug costs remain two of Biden’s signature campaign promises in his second presidential race.\n\nHe has called health care a right, not a privilege, for all. He succeeded in winning the right for Medicare to negotiate prices for a slate of drugs for seniors and to cap their annual costs at $2,000. He has said he wants to extend both policies to all Americans.\n\nTrump tried and failed to repeal the health care law signed by his predecessor, former President Barack Obama. Now, Trump says he does not want to repeal it but to improve it and make it cheaper. He has not released a specific plan.\n\nAs president, he did sign legislation to increase funding for substance use disorder treatment in the wake of the opioid epidemic, and in 2017 he declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency.\n\n– Joey Garrison, David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump arrives in Atlanta\n\nDonald Trump's Trump motorcade is now leaving the airport in Atlanta ahead of the debate.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHow old is Donald Trump?\n\nAge has taken center stage in the 2024 race for the White House. If either candidate on stage on Thursday wins in November, they will become the oldest person to take the oath of office.\n\nDonald Trump is 78 years old. He was born on June 14, 1946.\n\n– James Powel\n\nWhere do Trump and Biden stand on the economy?\n\nDonald Trump receives some of his highest marks from voters on his handling of the economy. A Wall Street Journal poll in March found a majority of voters said they trust him to do a better job than Biden in bringing down inflation, a top economic concern.\n\nIn 2017, Trump and his fellow Republicans passed a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, which would expire during the next president’s term in 2025.\n\nBiden says he believes the best way to boost the U.S. economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. His economic plan has included the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan - a post-pandemic stimulus package - and funding for major infrastructure projects and climate initiatives.\n\nBiden has called for an increase in the minimum corporate tax to 21% from 15%. He also wants to restore a previous version of the Child Tax Credit, make the healthcare tax credit permanent and give new home buyers a $400 a month tax credit for two years to bring down mortgage costs.\n\n– Joey Garrison, David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nLooking for a debate drinking game?\n\nThe first presidential debate of the 2024 general election is set for Thursday night, with presumptive Democratic nominee President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, set to meet face to face for the first time since the White House changed hands in 2021.\n\nHere are three games that can help you get through the presidential debate Thursday night.\n\nFrom Bingo to shotsPresidential debate drinking games, an American tradition\n\n– James Powel\n\nMary Trump, Donald Trump's niece, to make pitch for Biden at presidential debate\n\nMary Trump, a psychologist, writer, and niece and critic of former President Donald Trump, will make an appearance in the spin room following Thursday's CNN presidential debate, the Biden campaign said.\n\nShe will be supporting her uncle’s opponent, current President Joe Biden, and will be joined by several key Democratic leaders, including Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, California Rep. Robert Garcia and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n– Joey Garrison and Maya Homan\n\nHow old is Joe Biden?\n\nAge has taken center stage in the 2024 race for the White House. If either candidate on stage on Thursday wins in November, they will become the oldest person to take the oath of office.\n\nBiden was born on November 20, 1942. He is 81 years old.\n\n– James Powel\n\nWhere do Biden and Trump stand on climate change?\n\nTrump opposes most climate change legislation, a position that hasn’t changed since his term in the White House. During his presidency, he withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, a global climate initiative that Biden rejoined once he took office.\n\nBiden has warned that denying the impacts of climate change in the U.S. and around the world is “condemning the American people to a very dangerous future.” He has also set a national goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030 and has pledged to make the American power sector 100% carbon-pollution-free by 2035.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAre Trump and Biden in Atlanta?\n\nBiden arrived in Atlanta this afternoon and greeted groups of supporters chanting “four more years” and “let’s go Joe,” according to White House press pool reports.\n\nTrump is expected to arrive in the Peach State at approximately 5:30 p.m.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nYes, Donald Trump is still waiting for Supreme Court to rule on immunity\n\nThe former president debates while he and the rest of the political world are on the cusp of an important legal ruling: A Supreme Court decision on his claim of immunity from prosecution for actions he took while in office.\n\nCourt rulings announced Thursday did not include the immunity case, which could determine when - and if - Trump is tried on criminal charges he tried to steal the 2020 election from Biden.\n\nThe high court is scheduled to issue more rulings on Friday, but that is not expected to be the final day of the current term. So the Trump immunity decision could slip until next week.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDemocratic governors talk Biden, debate expectations\n\nSeveral Democratic governors from across the country gathered in Minneapolis Monday on the anniversary of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. While there, they looked ahead to tonight’s debate.\n\n“This will be the first opportunity in a long time for people to see the contrast of these two people side by side,” Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly told USA TODAY. “And I think if people are watching with open minds, open eyes, the contrast will be startling.”\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he wouldn’t give the president and leader of his party any advice ahead of the 2024 showdown.\n\n“This isn't theoretical. There's two people who are going to be president, one or the other,” Walz said. “There's going to be a vision that's hopeful, compassionate, optimistic, addressing climate change, addressing inequities. And then there's going to be grievance filled, you know, anger coming from former President Trump.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow long is the debate?\n\nThe debate is scheduled to last 90 minutes and will include two commercial breaks.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nMust-watch cringe TV:Few swing state voters want to see Trump-Biden debate\n\nCNN says debate will not have an extended delay\n\nCNN corrected rumors that the first presidential debate will air with a 1–2-minute delay, instead of the standard 7-second delay, allowing the network to potentially edit parts of the broadcast. CNN Communications responded in a post on X, formerly Twitter, stating “This is false.

A chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans,\" Harris told a cheering crowd at the Democratic convention.\n\nHarris spent much of 2024 campaigning as President Joe Biden's running mate. But on Thursday, she talked to the party that swiftly rallied around her after he ended his reelection bid. She laid out how she would address the major debates facing the nation, ranging from abortion rights to the southern border and the economy.\n\nThe vice president's speech comes after her own running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, delivered his acceptance address on Wednesday, telling his fellow party members \"Thank you for bringing the joy to this fight.\"\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's coverage of the Democratic convention in Chicago.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nHarris pledges to ‘stand strong’ with Ukraine, work to end war in Gaza\n\nHarris pledged to “stand strong” with Ukraine and NATO and said she is working “around the clock” to end the war in Gaza.\n\n“Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelensky to warn him about Russia’s plan to invade,” she said. “I helped mobilize a global response, over 50 countries, to defend against Putin’s aggression. And as president I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.”\n\nOn the war in Gaza, Harris said “now is the time to get a hostage deal and a cease-fire deal done.”\n\n“Let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself,” she said. “Because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on Oct. 7.”\n\nShe also said “what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating.”\n\n“The scale of suffering is heartbreaking,” she said. “President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages is released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nReproductive rights get center-stage moment in Harris’ speech\n\nBashing her opponent and the GOP’s record, Harris highlighted reproductive rights as a key issue in the first presidential election since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\n“Simply put, they are out of their minds,” Harris said of Trump and Republicans. “And one must ask, why exactly is it that they don’t trust women?”\n\n“Well, we trust women,” she continued, adding that as president she would “proudly sign” legislation to enshrine abortion access.\n\nAs vice president, Harris has been the leading voice in the current Biden administration on reproductive rights and abortion access – a winning issue for many Democrats since 2022.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris vows to bring back bipartisan border deal Trump bashed\n\nHarris said that after decades in law enforcement, she knows the “importance of safety and security, especially at our border.”\n\n“Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades,” she said. The bill was killed by Senate Republicans in February after pressure from Trump.\n\n“Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal,” she alleged. “Well I refuse to play politics with our security. And here is my pledge to you as President, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'New path forward'\n\nHarris told convention attendees that her campaign is all about charting a “new path forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class.”\n\n“We know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success, and building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” she said.\n\nHarris said that, if elected, she would pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. She said her term would also also allow Americans to “fully make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home,” she said, referring to reproductive rights and other matters.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump hits Harris and her speech\n\nNot exactly breaking news: Donald Trump gave bad reviews to Kamala Harris' acceptance speech.\n\nIn a constant stream of Truth Social posts, Trump assailed the vice president's remarks on items ranging from the condition of her former home city of San Francisco to inflation, immigration and relations with other countries.\n\nAfter Harris accused him of wanting to be an autocrat, Trump concluded by saying: \"The Tyrants are laughing at her, she’s weak and ineffective, and for three and a half years she has done nothing except enabled them to get STRONG, RICH, and POWERFUL!\"\n\nAt another point, Trump pointed out that Harris and President Joe Biden have ignored the issues that came up in the speech: \"No specific programs, ALL TALK, NO ACTION - Why didn’t she do it three and a half years ago.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHarris zeroes in on Trump in convention address\n\nKamala Harris called out former President Donald Trump by name in her acceptance speech, saying the former president is “in many ways ... an unserious man.”\n\n“But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious,” Harris said.\n\nPointing to what she called the “chaos and calamity” of his first term, Harris raised alarms about her 2024 opponent.\n\n“Consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol,” she said, referring to Trump’s comments about potentially pardoning January 6, 2021 rioters.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris lays out her record as a prosecutor\n\nHarris walked the crowd through her history as a prosecutor, both at the local level and as California's attorney general. \"As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them,\" she said.\n\n\"As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks, delivered $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation,\" she said.\n\nHarris said she stood up for veterans and students who were being scammed by for-profit colleges and workers who were cheated out of their wages.\n\n\"I fought against the cartels who traffic in dugs and guns and human beings, who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities,\" she said. \"And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn. But we never gave up. Because the future is always worth fighting for.\"\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nHarris accepts presidential nomination\n\nKamala Harris formally accepted her party’s presidential nomination, as the Democratic convention comes to a close Thursday.\n\n“On behalf of every American regardless of party, race, gender or the language your grandmother speaks, on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey ... I accept your nomination,” Harris told the crowd.\n\nDemocrats had officially nominated Harris in a virtual vote earlier this month and affirmed the decision at the convention Tuesday in an enthusiastic celebratory roll call.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris calls Biden’s character ‘inspiring’\n\nHarris began her remarks thanking President Joe Biden, who ended his reelection bid and immediately endorsed her candidacy.\n\n“To our President Joe Biden. When I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude,” Harris said.\n\n“Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring, and Doug and I love you and Jill, and are forever thankful to you both,” she added.\n\nShe said that the path to get to the nomination was “no doubt unexpected but I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nIlhan Omar: “Mistake” not to platform Palestinian voice\n\nOn Thursday evening, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said the DNC’s decision not to platform a Palestinian-American speaker at the convention was a “huge mistake.” That had been a key ask of the protesters seeking to push the Democratic Party towards a more pro-Palestinian stance.\n\n“I think it undermines our messaging about unity, about diversity,” said Omar, one of the most vocal critics of Israel in Congress.\n\nOmar said she spoke with the DNC chair, Jaime Harrison, multiple times in an effort to push the committee to change their mind. \"Last I heard from the Harris campaign was for us to be patient,” she said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Harris has touted her and Biden’s efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. She has not explained if or how her approach to the conflict would differ from Biden’s.\n\n—Laura Gersony\n\nRoy Cooper calls Kamala Harris ‘one hell of a fighter’\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper acknowledged he’s not the main event of the night.\n\n“Hello, America,” he said. “I’m Roy Cooper, the last guy standing between you and the moment we’re all waiting for.”\n\nCooper, a former North Carolina attorney general, told the audience how he worked with Harris when she was California’s attorney general, when she insisted on holding out for a bigger settlement from the nation’s big banks after the 2008 housing crash.\n\n“She went toe to toe with some of the world’s most powerful executives, and she refused to give in,” he said. “Let me tell you, this was a huge risk, but she knew it was a risk worth taking. That’s Kamala. And we all know what happened. The banks caved.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nKamala Harris’ sister, Maya Harris, pays tribute to their mother\n\nMaya Harris, Kamala Harris’ younger sister, opened her remarks by reflecting on her mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris.\n\n“Mommy was so many things to so many people, a civil rights activist, a scientist, a devoted mother to her two little girls,” said Maya Harris. “But most of all, Mommy was a trailblazer who defied the odds and defined herself. And when it came to Kamala and me, Mommy had great expectations for us, but she had even greater expectations of us.”\n\n“She raised us to believe that we could be and do anything, and we believed her.”\n\nMaya Harris said that she wishes her mom, who died in 2009, could have attended the convention.\n\n“ I can just see her smiling, saying how proud she is of Kamala,” said Maya Harris.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDon't bet on a Beyoncéappearance\n\nBeyoncé's publicist Yvette Noel-Schure shut down speculation about Beyoncé appearing at the DNC, despite reports.\n\nMinutes before fans hoped to see the \"Cowboy Carter\" singer on the convention stag, Noel-Schure posted to her Instagram.\n\n\"At home watching and anticipating the VP’s historic speech,” she wrote. “Focus on the win and register to vote. Do not report rumors. FOCUS.\"\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter was the first to report that according to a representative for the singer, \"Beyoncé was never scheduled to be there.”\n\nLeading up to the DNC, fans speculated the megastar might perform. Of course, Walz has been deemed a certified Beyhive member. And Beyoncé's camp gave Harris approval to use her song \"Freedom\" featuring Kendrick Lamar on her campaign trail. The song has become an anthem for Harris' campaign.\n\n− Liz Schubauer\n\nAnother Republican for Harris addresses Democratic audience\n\nSaying he was “proud to be in the trenches” with the evening’s crowd, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger acknowledged the “awkward alliance” between himself and Democrats.\n\n“I never thought I’d be here, but listen,” he told the audience, “you never thought you’d see me here, did you?”\n\n“The Republican party is no longer conservative. It has switched its allegiance from the principles that gave it purpose to a man whose only purpose is himself,” Kinzinger added, referring to former President Trump.\n\nA turning point, Kinzinger said, was January 6, 2021.

It was hard, but not extraordinary. It's life. Those nights reminded me who I was fighting for, people just trying to make it. Kamala Harris knows who she's fighting for too,” she said.\n\nWhitmer also knocked Trump in her remarks, saying he can’t relate with everyday families.\n\n“You think he understands that when your car breaks down? You can't get to work? No, his first word was probably chauffeur. You think he's ever had to take items out of the cart before checking out? Hell, you think he's ever been to a grocery store? That's what the chauffeur is for,” she said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRuben Gallego leads Democratic veterans onstage, tells Trump to ‘show some respect’\n\nArizona Senate nominee Ruben Gallego led a group of Democratic veterans, including members of the U.S. House and Senate, onstage, urging Donald Trump to “show some respect” to veterans.\n\n“We were proud to wear the uniform,” said Gallego, a congressman who served in the Marines. “And we’re proud serving our countries in city halls, state capitols, the U.S. House and the Senate. These veterans represent the best of our country. We stand united as veterans, Democrats and patriots to fight for everyone who serves.”\n\nGallego said “politicians like Donald Trump” don’t stand with veterans. He referred to Trump’s frequent insults to the late Sen.

Mark Kelly said Harris will stand with America’s allies and is “the leader we need right now.” Harris, he said, understands the importance of international alliances like NATO, and of supporting Ukraine in its war defending itself from Russia’s invasion.\n\n“Donald Trump skipped his intelligence briefings,” Kelly said. “He was too busy sucking up to dictators and dreaming of becoming one himself.”\n\nKelly referred to a 2020 report in The Atlantic that said Trump described fallen service members were “suckers” and “losers.” Trump denies the report.\n\n“Trump thinks that Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice are suckers and losers,” Kelly said. “If we fall for that again and make him the commander in chief, the only suckers would be us.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miler\n\nDenied a speaker, pro-Palestinian Democratic delegates make new demand on Kamala Harris\n\nStymied in their demand that a Palestinian-American be allowed to speak to the Democratic National Convention about the war in Gaza, a group of uncommitted delegates ended a protest outside the United Center on Thursday with a new demand: that Vice President Kamala Harris meet Arab-American and Muslims in Michigan and elsewhere.\n\nThey also set a deadline for such a meeting or meetings to take place of Sept. 15.\n\nWhile not saying what they would or would not do if a meeting did not take place to discuss their insistence that the U.S. stop shipping weapons to Israel and demand a cease-fire in Gaza, the organizers suggested there would be ramifications.

She receives a good citizen award, and we pose for photos. She wears a St Mary's sweatshirt and a smile that lights up the room.”\n\n“30 minutes later, a gunman murders her 18 classmates and two teachers. We are taken to a private room where police tell us she isn't coming home,” Rubio said.\n\nMelody McFadden told convention attendees about when her niece was shot in Myrtle Beach. “10 years of waiting, and Sandy's murder is still unsolved. I'll keep calling and I'll keep fighting,” McFadden said.

Now she's guiding my own children, and I know she'll guide our country forward,” said Meena Harris.\n\nElla Emhoff, stepdaughter of Kamala Harris, said that the vice president came into her life when she was 14 - “famously a very easy time for a teenager,” she joked.\n\n“Like a lot of young people, I didn't always understand what I was feeling. But no matter what, Kamala was there for me. She was patient, caring, and always took me seriously. She's never stopped listening to me, and she's not going to stop listening to all of us,” Emhoff said.\n\nHelena Hudlin, goddaughter of Harris, said that Kamala Harris’ advice “means everything, whether it's pursuing my passions, making an impact, or finding hope when the world doesn't feel so hopeful.”\n\n“She taught me that making a difference means giving your whole heart and taking action,” Hudlin said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKerry Washington brings 'Scandal' costar Tony Goldwyn, Harris family members on stage with her\n\nActress Kerry Washington helped host the final hours of the Democratic convention’s final night.\n\nShe brought back to the stage her former “Scandal” costar Tony Goldwyn, who days earlier also made a convention stage appearance.

Where to stream the DNC?\n\nThe convention will air live on its website, from the United Center in Chicago between 7 p.m to 11 p.m. ET (6 p.m. to 10 p.m. CT) Tuesday through Thursday.\n\nUSA TODAY will provide livestream coverage on YouTube each night of the DNC, Monday through Thursday.\n\n– Gabe Hauari\n\nDemocrats face uphill battle courting business community\n\nIn a high-rise building overlooking the Chicago River downtown, Democratic Party advocates made the case Tuesday that business leaders should step up their opposition to GOP-led threats to U.S. democracy – not for moral reasons, but economic ones.\n\n“The other party right now is so unpredictable,” said Rhett Buttle, an entrepreneur and advocate. “I think it’s a question of stability in business, and normal rule-making, or potentially chaotic markets.”\n\nIn courting the business community, Democrats have a steep hill to climb. The GOP broadly supports an agenda of low taxes and light regulation.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden’s big-spend infusions into the U.S. economy have been welcomed by some industries, he and other Democrats have taken a more aggressive tone towards large companies, blaming corporate greed for some of Americans’ affordability issues. Vice President Kamala Harris recently announced a proposal to ban price-gouging in the food and grocery industries.\n\nDaniella Ballou-Aares leads the Leadership Now Project, a business group focused on “protecting American democracy.” She said executives are split between the two parties, and argued the prospect of an authoritarian turn is making some in that group nervous.\n\n“Do business leaders like all Democratic policies? No,” she said. “But are they scared of a leader who’s gonna go after his enemies, and reward his friends, and turn us into a banana republic? Turns out they don’t like that.”\n\n– Laura Gersony\n\nKlobuchar: 'There is a lot of competition about competition'\n\nDuring the Republican National Convention last month, Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s support for anti-monopoly measures set off a flurry of messaging from Democrats, as they sought to reassure voters that they, not the GOP, are the party of workers and economic progressivism.\n\nSpeaking in Chicago on Thursday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar suggested those shifting fault lines could be a good thing for antitrust-minded Democrats.\n\n“There is a lot of competition about competition,” Klobuchar said. “When you look through history, that actually is what’s gotten things going. … When you’ve got some buy-in from both sides.”\n\nVance, the Republicans’ vice presidential nominee, has praised the current Federal Trade Commission Chair, Lina Khan, who is controversial even among Democrats for her strong anti-monopoly intervention.\n\nSo far, Vice President Kamala Harris has signaled she will embrace a populist economic platform, arguing large corporations have helped drive Americans’ affordability issues. Though key details of her platform remain in flux: some of Harris' big donors have been pushing her to replace Khan.\n\n– Laura Gersony\n\nMaggot probe continues in Chicago\n\nAuthorities are still investigating whether saboteurs put insects into a breakfast buffet for delegates at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, sickening one person.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday morning, Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling declined to discuss specifics of the investigation at the Fairmont Chicago hotel. Last month, Gaza war activists released insects at the Watergate hotel in Washington, D.C. in an effort to disrupt the stay of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nOne witness staying at the Fairmont told USA TODAY the insects appeared to be crickets, while other news reports suggested maggots. Officials indicated the contamination happened around 6:45 a.m., and witnesses said all the food had been replaced within an hour.\n\nRead more on the ongoing investigation.\n\n— Trevor Hughes\n\nWho is performing at the DNC? The Chicks expected to sing the national anthem\n\nThe Chicks, the country music group formerly known as The Dixie Chicks, are expected to perform the national anthem for the final night of the Democratic convention. The group was seen doing a sound check at the United Center on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe appearance isn’t the group’s first foray into politics. In 2003, it’s lead singer Natalie Maines said during a concert that the band was “ashamed” that President George W. Bush was from her home state of Texas.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nWho is set to speak tonight at the DNC?\n\nThe official DNC Day 4 speaker schedule lineup has not yet been released. But so far, according to USA TODAY reporting and reports from other media, the list includes:\n\nVice President Kamala Harris\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper\n\nFormer Illinois Republican U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin\n\nCalifornia Sen.

Maxwell Frost\n\n— Gabe Hauari and Chris Sims\n\nTrump says he will provide running commentary on Harris' speech\n\nYou didn't think Trump would stay quiet during Harris' acceptance speech, did you?\n\nThe Republican nominee has announced that he will provide running commentary on Harris' address via his Truth Social website.\n\n\"I will be doing a LIVE PLAY BY PLAY,\" Trump said early Thursday on Truth Social, later adding: \"We will start at 10 P.M., Eastern, and be covering and commenting on some of the earlier Speeches made, prior to hers.\"\n\n— David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy pushes GOP at Trump Tower in Chicago ahead of Harris speech\n\nFormer GOP presidential candidate and Trump campaign surrogate Vivek Ramaswamy held a news conference Thursday at Trump Tower in Chicago ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris' speech on the last day of the Democratic National Convention.\n\nRamaswamy addressed a packed room to bash Harris' border policies.\n\n\"If only (Democrats) cared as much about keeping illegals out of our country as they do keeping their own left wing protestors out of their own convention,\" he said. \"From one kid of legal immigrants to this country to another, my message to (Harris) is 'shame on you.'\"\n\nRamaswamy called on Harris to apologize to the families of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants during her speech.\n\n\"She has an opportunity... to have a spine,\" Ramaswamy said. \"If she doesn't, it'll tell you all you need to know.\"\n\n— Sam Woodward\n\n'YYYEEEEAAAAHHH': Lil Jon makes Democratic national convention cameo for Georgia delegates in convention roll call\n\nGeorgia's delegate roll call at the Democratic National Convention Tuesday included a star cameo: Lil Jon.\n\nEach state was introduced by a DJ at the convention before announcing how their delegates cast their vote (even though the formal nomination has already happened). When Georgia was called on to cast their votes, the cameras panned to Lil Jon atop the United Center stadium stairs in Chicago.\n\n\"YEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHHHH,\" the Atlanta rapper said as the intro to \"Turn Down for What,\" played on the speaker.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nMuslim Women for Harris-Walz disbands\n\nThe group Muslim Women for Harris-Walz announced it is disbanding after the campaign refused a request from the uncommitted movement to give a Palestinian American a speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"We cannot in good conscience continue Muslim Women for Harris-Walz,\" the group said in a statement. \"We pray that the DNC and VP Harris’ team makes the right decision before this convention is over. For the sake of each of us.”\n\nThe uncommitted movement has for months pushed Democratic leaders to implement an arms embargo to Israel and work toward a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Delegates from the group organized a sit-in outside of the convention on Wednesday, saying they would stay put until Harris' campaign allowed a Palestinian speaker on stage.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nWhat Shyamala Gopalan's legacy means to Kamala Harris\n\nIn the story of Kamala Harris’ life, her mother steals the show. The vice president would have it no other way.\n\n“Mommy, you are the star of this book because you are the reason for everything,” Harris wrote in her 2019 memoir “The Truths We Hold.” “There is no title or honor on earth I’ll treasure more than to say I am Shyamala Gopalan Harris’ daughter.”\n\nGopalan, a breast cancer researcher who died in 2009 at age 70 of colon cancer, won't see her daughter accept the Democratic Party’s nomination for president on Thursday, but she will be a strong presence.\n\nGopalan set out on her own across the world at the age of 19, defying her native culture. She raised two girls to identify both with her own background and one that was totally alien to her. She encouraged them to excel and exceed expectations but not leave others behind. And she did it all while performing important scientific work of her own.\n\nRead more on Harris and her mother's legacy in her life.\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nDNC schedule Thursday:See full list of events, where to watch Democratic convention\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz visits home delegation, touts importance of today\n\nFresh off his convention floor speech, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz joked with Minnesota Democrats that Thursday was an important day.\n\n\"Look, it's an important day. The eyes of the world are focused on this day because it's the day that the Minnesota State Fair opens up,\" Walz told delegates at the Fairmont Chicago.\n\nWalz thanked his home-state delegates for supporting him and his wife Gwen in recent weeks.\n\n\"We're ready to take the Minnesota values that you all taught us,\" Walz said. \"Everybody who I talk to across this country, when I talk to them, they want to be Minnesota.\"\n\n— Jessie Balmert\n\nWhat people are saying about Kamala Harris: 'A vibe I’m feeling'\n\nPolls suggest millions of Americans are changing their presidential voting plans with Harris currently topping the Democratic ticket, signing up for who she is and what they feel she represents.\n\nMany voters interviewed by USA TODAY find themselves surprised to be supporting the new Democratic candidate for president this year, swept up in the excitement and \"vibes\" of her campaign.\n\nThere are at least four distinct groups of Harris supporters: The Democrats who would have voted for whoever their party put at the top of the ticket; the Democrats who weren't sure they would have bothered to vote for Biden, but are enthusiastically behind Harris; the undecideds who have come down on the side of Harris; and the former Trump supporters who are excited about someone new.\n\nRead what Americans are saying about the Harris campaign.\n\n— Terry Collins, Deborah Barfield Berry and Trevor Hughes\n\nPoet Amanda Gorman, comedian Kenan Thompson among Wednesday highlights\n\nAmanda Gorman, the country's first national youth poet laureate, delivered a poem that drew applause and cheers from the audience at the Democratic convention on Wednesday night.\n\nGorman debuted a new poem called \"This Sacred Scene\".\n\n“Only now approaching this rare air are we aware that perhaps the American Dream is no dream at all, but instead a dare to dream together,” she said in one of her lines.\n\nComedian Kenan Thompson took the stage to continue criticizing Project 2025, a policy blueprint from the Heritage Foundation for potential new Republican administration, though Trump has continually denied association with the it.\n\n“You ever seen a document that can kill a small animal and democracy at the same time?” the comedian said while holding a large hardback copy of the project.\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi, Amaris Ecinas and Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris ushers in a new Democratic era, stepping out of Biden shadow\n\nAs President Joe Biden gave a tearful goodbye to the Democratic Party this week, a liberated Kamala Harris stepped out of his shadow and commandeered the national stage.\n\nThe handoff at the Democratic convention, one of several Biden farewells, was a visceral example of how the country is changing, with the first Black and Asian American woman topping a presidential ballot.\n\nNow, Harris has less than three months to convince the rest of America to entrust her with a four-year presidential term. She has raced to lay out an agenda that hits on Americans’ most pressing problems that excites the party’s base and is palatable to moderates.\n\nAfter years of quiet inroads on issues she cares about without undermining the president’s agenda, the pressure is on for Harris to provide a detailed vision of her own coming out of the party’s four-day gathering in Chicago.\n\nRead more as Harris prepares for her acceptance speech tonight.\n\n— Francesca Chambers and Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump: I'd be 'honored' by Kennedy endorsement\n\nDonald Trump wouldn't say whether he has spoken with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in recent days, but made clear he would welcome an endorsement from the independent candidate.\n\n\"If he endorsed me, I would be honored by it — I would be very honored by it,\" Trump said during an early morning interview on \"Fox & Friends\" otherwise devoted to attacking Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\n\nTrump praised Kennedy during the Fox interview, quite a change from earlier this year when he denounced the independent candidate as a \"Radical Left Liberal\" whose candidacy would hurt him and help the Democrats.\n\nKennedy is expected to withdraw from the presidential race later this week.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nJewish Democrats have party loyalties tested in 2024 election\n\nJewish Democrats have had their party loyalties tested this election year as the left flank's support for the plight of the Palestinians has, at times, seemed to have taken on anti-Semitic undertones in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks and the subsequent Gaza war that's led to an estimated 40,000 Palestinian deaths.\n\nThe pushback from the left has been on display during protests at this week's Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Democrats nominated Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nThe split among Democrats and progressives over the war in Gaza is partly generational − with even some young Jewish Americans opposing Israel's war in Gaza. The right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has caused some younger Jewish Americans to push back at Israel.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll in March found that 42% of American Jews between the ages of 18 years old and 34 believe the way Israel is carrying out its war against Hamas is \"unacceptable.\" Only 27% of Jewish Americans ages 50 to 64 years old said it is \"unacceptable.\"\n\nRead more on the divisions facing some Democrats.\n\n— Joey Garrison and Rebecca Morin\n\nGus Walz in Wednesday night's most touching moment: 'I love you, dad.'\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the vice-presidential running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, has spoken openly and lovingly about his neurodivergent 17-year-old son Gus, who has ADHD, along with a non-verbal learning disorder and an anxiety disorder. Walz and his wife, Gwen, both former teachers, said recently in a statement to People magazine that they never considered Gus’ conditions an obstacle.\n\nWhen Walz delivered his acceptance speech inside the packed United Center arena Wednesday night, Gus watched from the audience with his mother and sister, Hope, and sobbed.\n\n“Hope, Gus and Gwen – you are my entire world, and I love you,” Walz said.\n\nGus Walz sprung from his seat, moved by his father's words.\n\nHe pointed his index finger, saying \"I love you, dad.\"\n\nRead more about Gus and how advocates for Americans with learning disabilities believe the Walz family's openness about their son and their willingness to speak publicly about the experience will raise much-needed visibility that could help others who are going through similar issues.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nWalz hometown view:Locals at DNC watch party cheer on their former football coach\n\nDemocratic National Convention highlights: Tim Walz makes everyman pitch\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz played up his role as the everyman on the Democratic ticket on Wednesday night by talking about his time as a high school teacher and coach while accepting his party's nomination for vice president.\n\nTaking the stage as the night's keynote speaker, Walz revved up the crowd by bragging about his policy record as governor. He talked up cutting prescription drug costs and establishing free school lunch for students while defending abortion rights and establishing firearm regulations. But the 60-year-old Democrat also underscored how the heart of his progressive values — and differences with the Republican ticket — are about respecting others.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from Wednesday night:\n\n'A dad in plaid' Walz speech: Democrats went into overdrive to convey that Walz is a regular small-town dude living down the road, with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar introducing her home-state governor as a “dad in plaid.” They even brought out former students and football players on the stage sporting jerseys while playing up his military service (which has come under attack by the GOP). The message was clearly aimed at Midwest voters across the blue wall, particularly in rural white working-class areas where Democrats have struggled.\n\nDemocrats went into overdrive to convey that Walz is a regular small-town dude living down the road, with Minnesota Sen.

Bill Clinton's complicated legacy with modern Democrats: In the 1990s, William Jefferson Clinton was the boss of the Democratic Party, and considered one of the best political communicators of the age. the former president is still thought of fondly by a segments of the party who believe he could be an asset this cycle. Still showcasing the 42nd president could also backfire and aggravate younger generations of Democrats, who find it hard reconcile with Clinton's tenure scarred by an extramarital affair with an intern.

John Lewis will now keep watch over a site in his former Georgia congressional district which once held a monument to the Confederacy.\n\nSculptor Basil Watson has been selected to design and create a monument to be placed at the Historic Decatur Courthouse in the district Lewis served for 17 consecutive terms, the DeKalb County Commemorative Task Force announced Thursday.\n\nThe task force was formed to honor Lewis’ legacy and “provide a symbol of inclusivity, equality, and justice” where the Confederate monument stood for more than 100 years.\n\n“A monument that represented bigotry, division and hatred will be replaced, by a monument to a man who loved, who cherished this nation and brought all people of all colors together,” DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond said, noting the removal of the confederate monument in 2020 was “one of the proudest moments” of his tenure.\n\nLewis, who was the son of sharecroppers, survived a brutal beating by police during the landmark 1965 march in Selma, Alabama and went on to become a towering figure of the civil rights movement. Lewis died in July 2020 at the age of 80.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony announcing his commission on Thursday, Watson said he met the late congressman briefly at an art fair. “Everyone was so excited. We spoke for maybe 30 seconds, but he left an impression,” he said.\n\n“The John Lewis story is a powerful story that needs to be told,” Watson added.\n\nWatson is a Jamaican-born artist who immigrated to Georgia in 2002. His work includes sculptural tributes to eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt in his home country and Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom for her Golden Jubilee, according to his website. Many in Atlanta may be familiar with his statue of Martin Luther King Jr. located near Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\n\nThe courthouse where Lewis’ tribute will be erected is in Decatur Square, a bustling city center just east of Atlanta.\n\nUntil June 2020, about a month before Lewis died, the DeKalb County Confederate Monument to “the lost cause” was removed from the courthouse grounds. The movement of the 30-foot obelisk was ordered by a county judge, after the city called it a threat to public safety. Local activists, demonstrators and students from nearby Decatur High School had also pushed for its removal.\n\n“This project has been a labor of love for all of us who knew and loved Congressman Lewis. He served our district and the world with such honor and distinction,” Decatur Mayor Patti Garrett said in a news release ahead of the announcement.\n\n“His statue will stand as a reminder to all who pass that once this great but humble man walked among us, and we are happy we elected him over and over to serve us and the world. He was truly the conscience of the Congress,” Garrett said.\n\n“The artist will commence work immediately. Once the statue is complete, the task force will sponsor a community-wide event to unveil the work,” the release said.\n\nThe organization hopes to have the tribute in place by 2024.", "authors": ["Devon M.

The Civil War has ended; now an angel is guiding him to lay down his rifle.\n\nAtlanta's Peace Monument, erected in 1911, honors the Peace Mission led by Southerners to reconcile with the North after America's deadliest conflict.\n\nWhat's missing is the reason that Confederate leaders seceded from the United States and attacked it in the first place: to preserve and extend the enslavement of African-Americans. The reconciliation it depicts is between the whites of the South and the whites of the North – it has nothing to say about black Americans, their experience with slavery, or their struggle for equality and justice.\n\nFor that reason, the Peace Monument in recent years has been the target of protests and vandalism.\n\nAnd it's why civil rights leaders and public officials in this majority-black city now want it removed.\n\n\"We've allowed the ones who lost the war to write the narrative,\" said the Rev. Tim McDonald, pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church. \"It's not good for our children. It's not good for our culture.\"\n\nBut there's one obstacle to taking the statue down: state law.\n\nAs public opposition to symbols of the Confederacy has grown, Georgia is one of several states that has moved in recent years to protect them. New laws throughout the South are blocking local governments from removing statues, monuments and other markers from public view.\n\nNow leaders in Atlanta are considering an alternative: adding signs to the Peace Monument to explain that the Peace Mission excluded African-Americans – 200,000 of whom fought in the war. Three other city-owned memorials – the Peachtree Battle monument, the Confederate Obelisk and the Lion of the Confederacy – would also be \"contextualized.\"\n\n\"Don’t leave them uncontested,\" says Sheffield Hale, president and CEO of the Atlanta History Center. \"If you want to leave them, you'd better tell the truth about them.\"\n\nSome say new signs aren't enough. Heidi Beirich is director of the intelligence project at the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\"A plaque standing next to something that massive and already offensive can’t really undo the harm to citizens who are being exposed to it,\" she said. \"It’s very, very hard to write history correctly about what happened in the Confederacy and in the South when you’re facing monuments.\"\n\nIt's the next phase in the national debate over monuments to the Confederacy: What can local officials do when the state says they can't take them down?\n\nCommunities across the South have tried a range of approaches.\n\n► The City of Birmingham, Alabama, covered its Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument with plastic in 2017 and built a plywood enclosure around it. The state's attorney general sued, citing the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act, approved that year. But a state judge threw the law out last month, saying it infringed on Birmingham's \"right to speak for itself.\"\n\n► City leaders in Memphis wanted to remove statues of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest and Capt. J. Harvey Mathes from two public parks. Under the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act, they were required to get a waiver from the state historical commission. When the commission rejected their request, they came up with a different solution: They sold the parks to a nonprofit, which took the statues down.\n\n► Protesters at the University of North Carolina took matters into their own hands last August, toppling a statue of a Confederate soldier that had stood on campus for more than a century. State law prohibits the university from moving \"Silent Sam\" to another jurisdiction; some officials say the law requires them to restore the statue to its pedestal. The university's board of trustees is due to report its options next month.\n\nOfficials in New Orleans, Baltimore and other cities, unrestrained by state laws, have taken down Confederate monuments.\n\nEach state gets to memorialize two figures in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol. In recent years, some states have replaced Confederate figures with civil rights leaders or other notable figures.\n\nAlabama replaced a statue of Confederate Lt. Col. Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry with one of writer and activist Helen Keller. Florida replaced Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith with educator Mary McLeod Bethune.\n\nMore:Controversial Confederate statues remain in U.S. Capitol despite being removed elsewhere\n\nMore:Confederate memorials turn up faster than they can be removed\n\nMore:Virginia school changes name from Confederate leader to Barack Obama\n\nIn some places, those moves have drawn opposition. The Sons of Confederate Veterans has filed lawsuits over the removal of memorials.\n\nWalter D. Kennedy, the organization's chief of heritage operations, says the soldiers and sailors whom the monuments memorialize made honorable contributions to the Confederacy. The public, he says, should look beyond slavery and white supremacy.\n\n\"Heroes are not people that are flawless,\" Kennedy said. \"We look at our history and we point to the positive things in their life.\"\n\nConfederate memorials – and flags and place names – have stoked controversy since they began to proliferate a century ago.\n\nThe debated heated up in 2015, when a white supremacist murdered nine black church members in Charleston, South Carolina. Dylann Roof had shared racist views and posed on social media with a Confederate battle flag.\n\nThe deadly 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was ostensibly sparked by a proposal to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a public park.\n\nThe rally, and the murder of demonstrator Heather Heyer, prompted other communities – including Baltimore and Birmingham – to take action against their own memorials.\n\nThe Georgia law dates to 2001, when then-Gov. Roy Barnes wanted to redesign the state flag. Its close resemblance to a Confederate battle flag was drawing criticism both inside and out of Georgia, threatening tourism and other business.\n\nLawmakers, split on the redesign, reached a compromise: The state would get a new flag, but prohibit the removal of Confederate memorials from public spaces.\n\nThe controversy didn't go away.\n\nState Rep. Renitta Shannon, a Democrat from the Atlanta suburbs, introduced legislation last month that would prohibit the display of Confederate monuments in public places outside museums and battlefields. It also would bar the use of taxpayer dollars to maintain the monuments.\n\n\"These are widely recognized symbols of of hate, and it symbolizes a time when black folks were second-class citizens in this nation,\" Shannon told USA TODAY. \"This bill is about restoring the dignity of black taxpayers.\"\n\nShannon said her bill has not received a committee hearing in the Republican-led Georgia House of Representatives.\n\nState Sen. Jeff Mullis, a Republican from northwestern Georgia, introduced legislation that would increase protections of monuments and require anyone who vandalizes them to pay for the damage.\n\nThe bill was passed by the state Senate last week and is now headed to the House Rules Committee.\n\n“We need to calm down and respect the wishes of our previous ancestors of whatever kind of monument their city thought was important at that time,” Mullis told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nHe said his legislation would \"apply to all government monuments, not just ones of a specific nature.\"\n\n“This legislation is about protecting and respecting the history of Georgia,\" he said.\n\nThe oldest Confederate monuments date to the end of the Civil War in 1865. The earliest were erected in cemeteries to honor the dead.\n\nBut in the first decades of the 20th century – the era of Jim Crow – the United Daughters of the Confederacy launched a building campaign, encouraging and sponsoring memorials across the South and beyond.\n\nThese monuments promoted the revisionist Lost Cause view of the Confederacy: The war wasn't about slavery so much as states' rights; Confederate soldiers were heroes defending their families and homes.\n\nDuke University scholar Tim Tyson has written extensively about the memorials. He says they don't teach history – they rewrite it.\n\nTyson speaks of the 1913 dedication ceremony for Silent Sam, at which industrialist Julian Carr boasted of whipping an enslaved black woman.\n\n\"I horse-whipped a negro wench until her skirts hung in shreds,\" Carr told the crowd. He called it a \"pleasing duty.\"\n\n“Putting (Silent Sam) in a public place is not commemorative, it's celebratory,\" Tyson said. \"The notion that this teaches history is just preposterous.”\n\nNAACP leaders in Atlanta and Georgia launched a campaign in January to remove all Confederate symbols across the state.\n\nThey called on lawmakers to give individual communities discretion to take down statues. They say they would prefer to see them in graveyards or museums with their historical context.\n\n“We are issuing a directive to our elected officials,\" said Gerald Griggs of the Georgia State Conference NAACP. \"It’s time to bring the country together by removing these vestiges of the past.\"\n\nTargets include the massive bas-relief at Stone Mountain, the \"Mount Rushmore of the South.\"\n\nThe 1½-acre carving, the largest of its kind in the world, depicts Davis, Lee and Gen. Stonewall Jackson. Fifteen white men chose the site in 1915 to establish the second Ku Klux Klan. The Klan returned to burn a cross there each Labor Day for decades.\n\nThe Atlanta proposal dates to 2017, when then-Mayor Kasim Reed appointed a committee to study what to do with the city's Confederate monuments. Hale, of the Atlanta History Center, co-chaired the panel.\n\nThe Atlanta City Council is expected to vote on the measure soon.\n\nAtlanta Councilwoman Natalyn Archibong said the signs would honor history while also sending a message that slavery and racism shouldn't be repeated.\n\n“I do think it starts with a conversation, an unpacking of how we got here and where do we want to go,\" Archibong said.\n\nLast year, the city renamed Confederate Avenue.

Nixon Elementary school, named in honor of the Montgomery civil rights leader who played a pivotal role in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nReferencing the movement's nonviolent protest, Reed said he shares in protesters outrage but asked Montgomery citizens to stay home for the next few days.\n\n\"No doubt some who gathered then, as some who may now, want a drastic, radical and immediate change,\" Reed said. \"The decision made then was not to let short-term passions get in the way of what was truly needed: Long-term, measurable and sustainable change. Yet again, Montgomery speaks to the heart and soul of our nation.\"\n\nMontgomery police began blocking off the streets surrounding the state Capitol building in late afternoon, placing a barricade a block away at the intersection of Dexter Avenue and South Decatur Street.\n\nA man named Mark, who declined to give his last name, began pacing back and forth across the Dexter Avenue crosswalk at about 5:30. Police officers, standing an arm's length away, told him he wouldn't be allowed to standstill and block the roadway. So Mark walked back and forth, back and forth, in a solitary loop for more than 2 hours.\n\nAs fellow demonstrators began to gather on Dexter's sidewalk, Mark said he just wanted to be present to \"represent George Floyd.\"\n\n\"It doesn't take a whole lot of people,\" to make a statement, Mark said, speaking through a black face mask emblazoned with an University of Alabama script A. Mark, who is black, said he felt moved to show up after watching the video of Floyd's death.\n\n\"To see what actually, really happened. To hear him crying for his mother, saying he couldn't breathe, it was senseless,\" Mark said. \"It was the straw that broke the camel's back. ... I want to be here to stand up for justice.\"\n\nAs Mark paced, the crowds of protesters swelled to several hundred. Shortly after 8 p.m., a police officer approached the group in front of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church and said they would have to disperse, as they didn't have a permit to protest. But the police officer eventually returned to the barricade and community activist Ja'Mel Brown was seen speaking with several officers. Brown eventually returned to the crowd and said if they stayed on sidewalks and didn't block the street, they would be allowed to remain.\n\nEventually, police used cruisers to block Dexter Avenue off at the lower end of the block, and protesters spilled into the street.\n\nA line of protesters circled the block multiple times, chanting \"Black lives matter\" and \"no justice, no peace.\"\n\nThough peaceful, there were some strained moments in the crowd as differing groups disagreed on the primary message and tact to lead the protesters with.\n\nBut both sides of the barrier appeared to try to de-escalate tensions throughout the night. At about 9 p.m. a large group of protesters surged up Dexter Avenue toward the police barricade. Two young women, facing the crowd with their backs to the barrier, spread their arms wide and asked their fellow protesters to stay calm.\n\nTensions rose quickly as plainclothes police officers in tactical vests appear in the swarm, with two officers approaching a line of men that quickly enclosed them, shouting taunts and laughing as the two groups faced off. A third officer pushed through the crowd and pulled the two officers back, leading them back to the police barrier.\n\nPolice Chief Ernest Finley appeared on scene shortly after the swarm, speaking to officers as well as protest leaders at the front of the barricade.\n\nSeveral demonstrators yelled at and pleaded with police officers to listen to their concerns about police use of force and policing within communities of color.\n\n\"Speak up when y'all see something,\" said one woman, addressing black officers on the barricade line. \"Y'all gotta speak up. Y'all know y'all do.\"\n\nAt 9:55, police began giving orders that the crowd must leave at 10 p.m. One woman, a vocal leader of protest, encouraged people to do so, explaining that the curfew wasn't related to the protest, but had been previously enacted over coronavirus concerns.\n\n\"We'll be back tomorrow,\" she said.\n\nAs the last of the crowd began walking down Dexter Avenue toward their vehicles, 19-year-old Jayee sat cross-legged on the pavement, calm but determined not leave. Another woman, 21-year-old Faith, joined her. Two men spoke with them, encouraging them to leave.\n\n\"This feels like my responsibility,\" Faith said.\n\nChief Finley told officers to \"give them 5 more minutes.\" When officers began breaking around the barricade, the group stood up and began walking away. Another woman was handcuffed after refusing to leave the area, though it wasn't immediately clear what she had been charged with.\n\nHistory of Lee High School\n\nRobert E. Lee High opened in 1955 as an all-white school.\n\nIn March 1954, a recommendation to name the district’s new school Robert E. Lee was made to the board. When the board later voted to approve that name, in November 1954, Lee was identified as “a distinguished Southern leader and educator.”\n\nMonths before Montgomery’s new high school was named, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, ordering the desegregation of all schools. Lee High School was opened as all-white in 1955. The school’s marching band wore Confederate uniforms. The school newspaper was called the “Stars and Bars.”\n\nBlack students began attending Lee and Lanier in fall of 1964.\n\nA November 1964 article in the school newspaper said the masthead of the paper, “has become symbolic of everything for which this school stands. Some would say we have hung our banner on a lost cause for which a war was fought. It is more than that. It is a heritage of the land in which we live. It stands for the great men this land has produced, men like Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis.”\n\nToday, the school serves a predominantly African American student population, as do the other two confederate named public high schools in Montgomery — Jefferson Davis and Sidney Lanier.\n\nSchools don't have the power to change names without legislative support without violating state law. Alabama's Memorial Preservation Act, passed in 2017, prevented the renaming or removal of monuments more than 40 years old without legislative approval. Some in the Montgomery\n\n“How does Robert E. Lee deserve to have a school named after him? He was on the wrong side. Jefferson Davis, wrong side. Sidney Lanier, wrong side of history,” said Lakecia Harris, an English teacher at Lanier High, last year. “There are plenty of people in history that did not deserve to have monuments and buildings and schools named after them.\"\n\nMore:Confederate named high schools: Some say no more, others say changing names unnecessary\n\nBrian Lyman contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/08/17/south-confederate-monuments-often-protected-hard-remove-state-laws/573226001/", "title": "In the South, Confederate monuments often protected, hard to ...", "text": "Calls to remove Confederate monuments have reached a cacophony across the country after the violence in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nBut actions like those in Baltimore, where statues were quietly removed under the shroud of night this week, remains much harder elsewhere in the South.\n\nMultiple states below the Mason-Dixon Line have put into place formal legal mechanisms that prevent historical monuments on public property from being taken down or altered without great difficulty.\n\nMore:Why removing Confederate monuments in Tennessee is not an easy process\n\nMore:County by county: Confederate memorials in Tennessee\n\nIn South Carolina, for instance, a two-thirds vote in the legislature is required to remove a monument. In Tennessee, a state historical commission has oversight over many of the monuments. Cities in their own right do not have the authority to remove them.\n\nProponents see the Confederate statues as representations of history, part of the culture of the past.\n\nBut opponents see them as divisive, a celebratory representation of a war defending slavery, and a lasting symbol of white supremacy.\n\n\"These laws are the Old South imposing its moral and its political views on us forever more,\" said Stan Deaton, senior historian at the Georgia Historical Society. \"This is what led to the Civil War, and it still divides us as a country. We have competing visions not only about the future but about the past.\"\n\nThe monuments and memorials, found throughout the South, are again at the forefront of public debate after white supremacists, neo-Nazis and other groups protested the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville.\n\nThose protests turned violent, and left one woman dead and more than a dozen others injured after a 20-year-old Ohio man, according to authorities, rammed his car into a group of counterprotesters.\n\nThere are more than 700 Confederate statues and monuments on public property across the nation, and the majority of those are in Southern states, according to a 2016 Southern Poverty Law Center study.

Efforts to penalize government entities that don't fly the flag on public property failed last year.\n\nIn South Carolina, Confederate monuments are similarly protected by the state's Heritage Act, which passed when the Confederate flag was moved in 2000 from the statehouse dome to a nearby Confederate memorial. The act requires a two-thirds vote by both chambers of the state legislature to remove or alter a monument.\n\nLawmakers met the two-thirds majority threshold in 2015 when they voted overwhelmingly to remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse grounds.\n\nTheir decision came after self-professed white supremacist Dylann Roof fatally shot nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. Roof had posed for a photo with the Confederate flag.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Charleston shooting, calls for the removal of Confederate symbols from public places were renewed.\n\nIn Tennessee and elsewhere, strict rules in place\n\nThe removal of a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general and early leader of the Ku Klux Klan, from the Tennessee state Capitol became a rallying point in Tennessee.

After a lengthy process, the city government took down several statues — including one of Lee, the Confederate general.\n\nElsewhere in the state, the issue appears to be less volatile.

Mayor Walt Maddox on Sunday ordered conservation measures for areas south of the Black Warrior River, including the University of Alabama, the Mercedes-Benz assembly plant and four rural water systems outside the city limits. City officials said they believed pipes that carry untreated water from Lake Tuscaloosa to a water treatment plant were leaking somewhere along a 2-mile stretch. But floodwaters from Tropical Storm Claudette were covering much of the low-lying areas where the pipes run. Maddox said it could be several days before workers found the leak. Water treatment capacity had fallen from 40 million gallons a day to 22 million gallons, the mayor said. He ordered people to turn off sprinkler systems, not wash cars, not wash pavement and not fill swimming pools until further notice. “That should sustain us with water conservation,” he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: An Alabama museum will return works of art to two Alaskan Native American tribes that requested the items back in 2017, decades after they were acquired for collections. A vote by the Birmingham City Council cleared the way for the Birmingham Museum of Art to return items to the Tlingit and Haida tribes, WBHM reports. The groups requested the return of pieces under a 1990 law that requires institutions which receive federal funds to return Native American cultural items to the respective tribes. The director of the museum, Graham C. Boettcher, told the council that the museum no longer had a “a moral, ethical or legal claim under federal law” to the art. The museum has several Tlingit items as part of its collection, including several spoons, baskets and bentwood boxes. Nearly all of them were purchased by the museum in 1956. The museum also lists three works by Haida artists, including two screen prints by Freida Deising and a Reg Davidson totem pole, all of which were acquired in 1994. Members of the Haida Nation and the Tlingit Nation live in southeastern Alaska. A central tribal government represents more than 32,000 Tlingit and Haida members, according to the groups’ website.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: House Democrats refused to show up at the state Capitol on Tuesday, blocking debate on a budget and a major tax cut primarily benefiting the wealthy. The move kept the House short of the number of lawmakers required to conduct business, forcing Republican House leaders to delay budget work until Thursday, when all GOP lawmakers are expected to be at the Capitol. House Democratic Leader Reginald Bolding said Democrats and the public need more time to review proposed changes Republicans released shortly before the budget debate was scheduled to begin. “You can’t simultaneously ignore the wishes of half the state and then take us for granted to pass a partisan budget,” he said in a statement. Denying a quorum is a tactic increasingly being weaponized by the minority parties of state legislatures in an era of intense partisanship. That hasn’t previously been an issue in Arizona, where a quorum requires the presence of only a simple majority of lawmakers. But on Tuesday, several Republicans planned to vote remotely under rules created during the pandemic, allowing Democrats to exploit the absences.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Monday announced he is creating an office that will focus on outdoor recreation in the state. Hutchinson said the new office of outdoor recreation will be part of the state Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism under the direction of Secretary Stacy Hurst, who will soon start a search for a director to lead the office. The Republican governor said he’s also creating a 10-person advisory board to help guide the new office. At a news conference with U.S. Rep. French Hill, Hutchinson also said the 459-acre Blue Mountain Natural Area site will be part of the state’s inventory of outdoor recreation sites, putting Arkansas in charge of all three mountains in the chain of Maumelle Pinnacles, along with Pinnacle Mountain and Rattlesnake Ridge. The Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission partnered with the Nature Conservancy to purchase Blue Mountain from PotlatchDeltic, a timberland owner and lumber manufacturer. Hutchinson also announced the state has signed a memorandum of understanding with the federal government to offer expanded recreation opportunities at Camp Ouachita and Lake Sylvia.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: COVID-19 vaccination rates for police and firefighting personnel in the city and for prison employees across the state are significantly lower than the average for other adults, raising concerns among medical ethicists and public safety leaders about whether unvaccinated first responders could become a threat to public health. While about 72% of adult Californians and 64% of Los Angeles residents 16 and older have received at least one vaccine dose, only about 51% of LA firefighters and 52% of the city’s police officers are at least partially vaccinated, the Los Angeles Times reports. Less than 30% of Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department staff have received vaccine doses through employee clinics, and about 54% of state corrections employees are at least partially vaccinated. The extent of the low vaccination rate is unclear because not all agencies keep track of who got their doses, whether through their workplace or elsewhere. Law enforcement analysts and ethicists said public safety workers should be allowed to make independent decisions about their health. However, they said the reluctance to get inoculated is a matter of public concern because they work in close spaces, such as jails and courthouses, and interact with some of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis has signed three of six gun bills passed in the latest legislative session into law. The Denver Post reports the bills were all announced following a mass shooting at King Soopers in Boulder on March 22, when 10 people were killed. Earlier this year, Polis signed two other bills, setting regulations for safe storage of guns in homes and requirements for reporting lost or stolen firearms. One other gun bill, meant to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers, awaits the governor’s signature. The three bills signed Saturday will require an expanded background check before a person can buy a gun; give about $3 million to the Colorado Department of Health and Environment for the first year to create the state’s first Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which will be tasked with promoting efforts to reduce gun violence; and reverse a ban that keeps local governments, such as cities and counties, from creating their own gun regulations. Local jurisdictions can only make ordinances that are stricter, not more lenient, than state law. Any regulations currently in place that are less restrictive are overturned.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration unveiled an $8 billion to $10 billion plan Monday that aims to reduce commuter rail times from Connecticut to New York City by as much as 25 minutes by 2035, while pledging in the meantime to make the trip from New Haven to the Big Apple 10 minutes faster as early as 2022. The announcement came on the same day Metro-North Railroad returned eight trains to the New Haven Line, as demand for commuter rail service increases as the region emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. Another service increase is planned in August. “Connecticut is coming back from COVID-19. Commuters are returning to the rails,” Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz said during a news conference held at the Stratford Train Station to announce the Time for CT plan with Lamont and other officials. While much of the initiative is dependent upon passage of a massive federal infrastructure bill in Washington, state Department of Transportation Commissioner Joseph Giulietti said the state has already received enough federal funding to embark on some of the work needed to alleviate long-standing slowdowns along the rails. That includes improvements to signalization systems and movable bridges, as well as the creation of new sections of track that allow trains to pass one another.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state’s minimum wage is expected to rise to $15 an hour by 2025. The Democrat-led state House voted along party lines Thursday to give final approval to a bill raising Delaware’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. Democrats approved the measure after defeating half a dozen Republican amendments, including proposals to allow small businesses and nonprofits to pay 85% of the minimum wage and to require the controller general’s office to submit annual reports regarding the fiscal impact of the wage increases on the state budget and more broadly on the state economy. Democrats also rejected a proposal by one of their own party members, Rep. Sherae’a Moore of Middletown, to delay each of the annual wage increases for one year for businesses employing 20 or fewer workers. The bill was sent to Democratic Gov. John Carney, who is expected to sign it. The measure was one of the legislative priorities for several left-leaning progressives who were elected last year and were able to get veteran Democrats to sign on to their cause. “In the last 15 years, we’ve made 15 attempts to raise the minimum wage. Only three of them bore fractional (fruit),” said Wilmington Democrat Rep. Gerald Brady, chief House sponsor of the bill.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. Public Schools is combining graduations and vaccinations this week. The district plans to hold pop-up COVID-19 vaccine clinics at all its commencement ceremonies this week at Audi Field, WUSA-TV reports. While the class of 2021 gets to walk across the stage to receive diplomas, the graduates, friends and family can take time before and after the ceremony to get COVID-19 shots. The clinics are open to any graduate and their guests over the age of 12. On Friday, the district’s health department announced it’s giving away $51 gift cards to those who get their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at select clinics. And the district also launched a new task force last week to encourage residents to get their shots.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Crime was down overall in the Sunshine State during 2020, but violent crime rose, according to statistics released by the state Monday. There were 1,285 murders in Florida last year, an increase of 260, or 14.7%, from 2019. Of those, 1,025 were committed with a gun, up 20.2% from the year before. Murders committed with a gun made up nearly 80% of the state’s total, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s annual crime report. In a year when many people worked at home or stayed home more often during the coronavirus pandemic, burglaries, robberies and larcenies dropped significantly. There were 13,439 robberies, a drop of 17% from 2019; 51,928 burglaries, down 17.8%; and 291,923 larcenies, down 18.5%. Florida also saw a drop in the number of reported rapes, from 8,439 in 2019 to 7,650 in 2020, or a decrease of 9.3%. Motor vehicle thefts also slightly dropped. Aggravated assaults increased by 9.5% from 55,333 in 2019 to 60,567 last year. Overall, factoring in the state’s growth in population, all crime was down 15.7% in 2020.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDecatur: The Sons of Confederate Veterans group has sued to return a 30-foot-high obelisk to a site in front of a courthouse in what a lawyer for the city calls “a lost cause.” The monument was taken down and moved to storage last year after a judge agreed with the city’s argument that it had become a threat to public safety during protests about racism and police brutality. The suit was filed Wednesday, two days short of a year after the monument’s removal, news outlets report. The group suggests city officials colluded to get around a state law protecting historic monuments, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. It contends the monument was not found to be a public nuisance. DeKalb County Judge Clarence Seeliger said in his ruling last year that it was “a figurative lightning rod for friction among citizens.” In his final order, in September, Seeliger said the obelisk should never be returned to the square. But “the world is full of controversy,” attorney Walker Chandler, who filed the lawsuit, told WXIA-TV. “And if we were to say anything that causes controversy is a public nuisance, that’s an endless road to go down.” In an email to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Decatur City Attorney Bryan Downs called the suit a “tardy, vexatious attack on properly entered rulings by a Georgia court of law. ... In short, it is a lost cause.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Dozens of baby squid from the state are in space for study. The baby Hawaiian bobtail squid were raised at the University of Hawaii’s Kewalo Marine Laboratory and were blasted into space earlier this month on a SpaceX resupply mission to the International Space Station. Researcher Jamie Foster, who completed her doctorate at the University of Hawaii, is studying how spaceflight affects the squid in hopes of bolstering human health during long space missions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The squid have a symbiotic relationship with natural bacteria that help regulate their bioluminescence. When astronauts are in low gravity, their body’s relationship with microbes changes, said University of Hawaii professor Margaret McFall-Ngai, under whom Foster studied in the 1990s. “We have found that the symbiosis of humans with their microbes is perturbed in microgravity, and Jamie has shown that is true in squid,” McFall-Ngai said. “And, because it’s a simple system, she can get to the bottom of what’s going wrong.” The Kewalo Marine Laboratory breeds the squid for research projects around the world. The tiny animals are plentiful in Hawaiian waters and are about 3 inches long as adults. The squid are slated to come back to Earth in July.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: Less than half of nursing home workers in the state have been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The agency said 47.5% of Idaho nursing home workers were fully vaccinated by May 30, compared to more than 82% of residents in the facilities. The Post Register reports Idaho had the 17th-highest resident vaccination rate but 15th-lowest staff vaccination rate among states and territories. About 38% of Idaho’s 2,100 COVID-19 deaths are linked to long-term care facilities. Of all COVID-19 deaths in the state, 93% were among people 60 and older. About 75% of Idaho residents age 65 and over are at least partially vaccinated. Almost half of all Idaho adults are at least partially vaccinated, compared to 65% of all Americans.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new podcast from the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum features conversations about legendary Illinois musicians and bands, sometimes with the performers themselves. The State of Sound podcast is a companion to an exhibit launched earlier this year at the Springfield-based museum, called “The State of Sound: A World of Music from Illinois.” It showcases the achievements and contributions of Illinois artists, including Muddy Waters, Earth Wind and Fire, and Chance the Rapper. The podcast is another way for people to explore the history of the state’s music, museum officials said. Episodes available now include discussions with Kevin Cronin from REO Speedwagon, Tim McIlrath from Rise Against, and Rosanna Goodman, daughter of singer-songwriter Steve Goodman. A new, official gallery guide includes dozens of photos of artifacts such as a red trumpet that belonged to Miles Davis and mementos John Prine carried on stage to help with his performance anxiety. “This exhibit is packed with sound, pictures and stories that we wanted to share with as many people as possible,” said Christina Shutt, executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. “The podcast will give people around the world a chance to hear those stories.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A Bloomfield woman plans to plead guilty Wednesday for her role in the U.S. Capitol riot after appealing to the court that she has since learned “what life is like for others in our country” from movies and books, including the films “Schindler’s List” and “Just Mercy.” Anna Morgan-Lloyd, 49, has agreed to plead guilty to one of her pending federal charges in the Jan. 6 insurrection in exchange for three years’ probation, $500 in restitution and community service. In a letter to the judge, Morgan-Lloyd apologized for entering the U.S. Capitol and said she feels “ashamed” about how the march turned violent on that day, which she previously described on Facebook as “the most exciting day.” She attached movie and book reports to her letter, summarizing “Schindler’s List” and “Just Mercy,” movies she said her attorney recommended. “I’ve learned that even though we live in a wonderful country things still need to improve,” Morgan-Lloyd wrote. “People of all colors should feel as safe as I do to walk down the street.” In “Schindler’s List,” protagonist Oskar Schindler diverts hundreds of Jews from sure death by employing them in his factory in Nazi-occupied Poland. In “Just Mercy,” Bryan Stevenson recalls his career representing disadvantaged clients and establishing the Equal Justice Initiative in 1989.\n\nIowa\n\nIndianola: The city recognized LGBT Pride Month for the first time Monday with an official proclamation at a City Council meeting. According to Indianola Mayor Pamela Pepper’s proclamation, “Pride Month is an opportunity for people to embrace who they are and to celebrate acceptance of diversity,” and the city should value everyone regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. LGBTQ Pride Month is recognized annually through the month of June to honor lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and other voices related to gender and sexuality, as well as to draw attention to the issues members of the community still face. Pepper has recently issued proclamations recognizing other holidays and months not normally recognized or celebrated by the city, including one to recognize Juneteenth ahead of the holiday’s official commemoration over the weekend. Pepper said recognizing more holidays makes clear that the city welcomes all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender. She said the act is a small step the city can take amid efforts to reestablish a human and civil rights commission that was dissolved around 1998.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Country Stampede returns this weekend after being canceled in 2020. The three-day festival will be held Thursday through Saturday at Heartland Motorsports Park. National and local country musicians are expected to play, and stampede president Wayne Rouse said this is the best lineup yet. “I hope people come out and enjoy all the great music,” Rouse said. “There will be a lot of great vendors out there.” Country Stampede officials learned a lot in 2019 about what works and doesn’t work for the venue where the festival takes place. And a year off because of the pandemic allowed for officials to make needed changes that will enhance festivalgoers’ experience. In 2019, muddy grounds caused by several inches of rain created a mess. Rouse said a new layout, an additional 300 acres and a larger festival area are all improvements made based on knowledge gained from that year. This year’s festival grounds have been designed to drain in the event of rain. Country music lovers will see performances from some of the biggest up-and-coming artists in the industry, including Ashley McBryde, Maddie and Tae, Mitchell Tenpenny, Blanco Brown and Gabby Barrett. Luke Combs, Sam Hunt and Riley Green will each headline one night of the festival. Hunt replaced Morgan Wallen, who’s been mired in controversy in the past year.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A man has sued his father’s estate over the effects of secondhand smoke on his health, five years after being left out of the will when his dad died. Hugo J. “Joe” Bobzien Jr. amassed a sizable fortune as president and CEO of American Commercial Barge Line, the nation’s largest barge operator. When Bobzien died March 30, 2016, at age 81, he left his estate to three of his children but gave nothing to his oldest child. The other siblings later speculated their father didn’t like how Michael treated his wife and a daughter, according to court filings. But now Michael Bobzien is trying to get his piece of the pie. In a lawsuit whose trial began Tuesday in Jefferson Circuit Court, Michael J. Bobzien, 63, says his father destroyed his health by chain-smoking Lucky Strikes, Carltons and cigars. In what is believed to be the first secondhand-smoke lawsuit filed by a child against a parent, Bobzien claims he is suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other ailments caused by being “forcibly, knowingly, intentionally, wantonly, chronically and recklessly” subjected to his father’s ever-present cloud of smoke while growing up in Louisville. Bobzien, an occupational therapist before he was disabled by his diseases, is seeking as much as $50 million for his pain and expected shortened life span.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state continues to see major racial gaps in which students take high school classes for college credit, an education consultant told public school and college leaders. The Advocate reports the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Board of Regents received a report showing 22% of Black students take dual enrollment courses, compared to 42% of white students. The percentage of students enrolled in the classes drops as the percentage of Black students in a school rises, according to the data from Adam Lowe, a consultant with Education Strategy Group. The first annual report on dual enrollment came in a meeting between the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, which oversees K-12 public schools, and the Board of Regents, the state’s higher education policy-making panel. “To develop talent and eliminate equity gaps in higher education, much greater intentionality and commitment is needed from all high schools, school systems, colleges and universities in harnessing these successful programs for the benefit of students of color, those from low-income households, first-generation students and special education students,” the report said. Louisiana has long lagged other states in the number of high school students who earn college credentials, The Advocate reports.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state will investigate potential new uses for its dormant rail corridors. Gov. Janet Mills recently signed into law a proposal that directs the Maine Department of Transportation to evaluate possible uses for the state-owned corridors. The department will eventually submit a report to the Legislature. Democratic Rep. Art Bell of Yarmouth, who proposed the bill, said Monday that he is “hopeful that it will provide an opportunity to reimagine the way we interact with miles of dormant, state-owned rail corridors, lying fallow.” Democrats in the state said the transportation agency will create a transportation plan that will serve as a framework as it looks to create new opportunities for outdoor recreation in Maine. That plan will include potential uses for the rail corridors.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city has once again delayed implementing its ban on single-use plastic bags. The Baltimore Sun reports the city is now giving retailers until Oct. 1 to comply with the ordinance. Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said more time is needed to distribute reusable bags and to educate community members. “Now that Baltimore is beginning to emerge from the pandemic and recover from its impacts, we recognize that retailers and residents could benefit from additional time to adopt this important change,” Scott said in a news release. This is the second time the ban has been pushed back. In January the effective date was moved to July 9 because of the economic hardships created by the coronavirus pandemic. The ban requires shoppers at grocery stores, restaurants and other retailers to bring their own reusable bags. Otherwise, they must purchase a paper or compostable bag for 5 cents. “We had hoped that by summer, everything would have been more amenable to the rollout,” said the city’s director of sustainability, Lisa McNeilly. “But what we’ve seen is that there continued to be some concerns from retailers about using reusable bags and having the capacity for it.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The area’s notoriously frustrating traffic dried up in March 2020 as many people started working remotely from home, and businesses closed. Now, it’s pretty much back to pre-pandemic levels. “Traffic, for all intents and purposes, is back to about 2019 levels on most roadways in Massachusetts at this point,” Highway Administrator Jonathan Gulliver said in a presentation to the state Department of Transportation’s board Monday, The Boston Globe reports. Traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike is still “running a little bit lower” than before COVID-19 hit, Gulliver said, particularly closer to Boston. And fewer vehicles are traveling through the tunnels to and from Logan International Airport. The morning and evening rush hours are still crowded, but Gulliver said they do not last as long as they did before the pandemic. “I think we’re in for a really major adjustment period that’s going to occur throughout the fall and early winter before things settle,” Gulliver said. The use of ride-hailing services plummeted last year, with such companies providing about 35 million rides that started in Massachusetts – a 62% drop statewide from the 91.1 million rides started in 2019, according to reports released by the state Department of Public Utilities.\n\nMichigan\n\nMeridian Township: The state is fully open again. After facing 15 months of capacity restrictions and being hit by the country’s worst surge of coronavirus infections this spring, restaurants, entertainment businesses and other venues can operate at 100% occupancy – instead of 50% – as of Tuesday. Limits on large indoor gatherings such as weddings and funerals are gone. So is a broad requirement that the unvaccinated be masked indoors, a rule that remains in about a dozen states. Unvaccinated teen athletes will no longer have to undergo weekly coronavirus testing. Michigan is among the last states to lift gathering caps, which has frustrated the business community. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and public health officials have said the restrictions were needed until enough people could be vaccinated in a state with about 21,900 suspected virus-related deaths. Last year, the governor faced an alleged plot to kidnap her over COVID-19 rules after drawing the ire of then-President Donald Trump, who tweeted calls to “LIBERATE” Michigan. “It’s time to play. It’s time to have fun again,” said Jordan Munsters, co-founder and president of High Caliber Karting and Entertainment, an indoor action park near Lansing where adults can race go-karts, throw axes and smash stuff to smithereens.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz has requested funding to outfit Minnesota State Patrol troopers and officers working at the state Capitol with body cameras. The $7.5 million to buy and maintain the cameras for the officers and troopers is contained in a transportation funding package that could come up for a vote later this week. The bill also includes funding to add nearly two dozen state troopers and a dozen additional Capitol security officers to the detail, Minnesota Public Radio reports. Body cameras are standard for many local police departments, but the state has been slower in adding them to its forces. Capitol security has been a serious concern over the past year. A tall, chain-link fence surrounded the building as protests turned violent in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in May 2020. Crews took down the fence earlier this month, and the Capitol reopened to the public for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March 2020.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: The city is now part of a trail commemorating what was then a nationwide tour by a French general who had participated in both the American and French revolutions. The Marquis de Lafayette visited Natchez on April 18, 1825, during the second and final year of a tour made at the invitation of President James Monroe and the U.S. Congress. During those two years, Lafayette stopped at 320 cities and towns in the 24 states then in the union, Lafayette Trail founder James Icher said. He said he hopes eventually to have 175 markers, including one at Le Havre, the port from which Lafayette departed to return to France. About 40 markers have been approved since the project started in 2017, with about 25 installed in 13 states so far, he said. A marker describing Lafayette’s stay in Natchez was unveiled last week at a lot overlooking the Mississippi River, The Natchez Democrat reports. The Historic Natchez Foundation and the Daughters of the American Revolution worked with The Lafayette Trail Inc. on the project. Two families offered the property, foundation executive director Carter Burns said. When Lafayette made his tour, the 50th anniversary of the American Revolution’s end was nearing. Lafayette, who had been 19 when he first came to America, was “the last surviving general of the Continental Army,” Icher said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Changes in the way the city’s police record crime statistics have prevented the department from publicly publishing crime data for nearly six months, officials said. The problem is related to a switch the department made in December to a new way of tracking crime, the National Incident-Based Reporting System. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the change was made to comply with new reporting requirements from the FBI which has said it required the change to help it improve the statistics it keeps and offer a more complete picture of crime. The city is still working on a way to resume publishing monthly incident data. Switching to the new reporting system required an overhaul of the department’s records software. The city started taking bids on that job in 2019 and hired a company to install new software in 2019. Police department spokeswoman Michelle Woodling said the project to report data publicly using the new system is behind schedule. But she said anyone can still request crime data under public records laws. Researcher Christopher Prenner, who is a sociologist at St. Louis University, said the department used to have better transparency than most other police agencies in the region.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A commission governing wolf hunting in the state is considering new wolf management rules that would make it easier to take the animals after the Legislature passed several laws earlier this year to encourage additional wolf hunting. The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks already expects the number of wolves in the state to decrease from about 1,150 to between 900 and 950 wolves following a particularly successful hunting season. Over 320 wolves were harvested during the 2020 hunting season – significantly more than the preceding eight-year average of 242 wolves per year, according to a report released by the department. Still, the department believes the state’s wolf population can support increased wolf hunting without leading to adverse biological effects, according to the report. The fish and wildlife commission – which governs hunting regulations – is expected to meet Thursday to hear public comment on proposed rules released last week to implement laws passed by the Legislature. The department proposed adopting several new measures, including increasing the number of wolves an individual can hunt to between five and 10, allowing snaring during trapping season and night hunting on private lands, using baits for hunting and trapping, and extending the season dates.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of new COVID-19 cases continued to decrease last week in the state, which currently has one of the lowest rate of new cases in the nation. For the eighth week in a row, Nebraska reported fewer coronavirus cases than the week before, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The state reported 168 new COVID-19 cases last week, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is down from 234 cases the week prior and 254 the week before that. At the peak last fall, Nebraska reported 16,740 new cases during the week of Nov. 20. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska also decreased over the past two weeks, going from 40 new cases per day June 6 to 31.14 new cases per day Sunday. Over the past two weeks, Nebraska reported 21.61 new cases per every 100,000 people in the state, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The only states with lower rates of new cases over that period were Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, South Dakota and Vermont. The number of people vaccinated against COVID-19 continues to slowly increase in the state. As of Friday, 63.4% of Nebraska’s population 18 and older had received at least one dose of a vaccine. That’s up from 63% the week before.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: Rural residents and local law enforcement over the weekend celebrated decisions by two county commissions to become members of a group that believes sheriffs have the final say on any given law’s constitutionality. Hundreds of people gathered for festivities in Elko City Park on Sunday as the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association presented Elko and Lander county commissioners with a plaque to honor their membership, making them the first local governments to join, the Elko Daily Free Press reports. “You know what I train sheriffs to do? Kick ’em the hell out of your county,” association founder Richard Mack told an applauding crowd, referring to criticism of federal government and the Internal Revenue Service. Mack, a former sheriff from rural Arizona who is also involved in the Oath Keepers militia movement, denounced white supremacy and compared sheriffs’ bucking of federal laws to Rosa Parks’ civil disobedience on a bus in 1955. Founded in 2011, the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association believes county sheriffs have a duty to interpret and uphold the Constitution that supersedes other elected officials up to the president. It is against federal gun laws and COVID-19 restrictions and sees sheriffs as a final defense against government overreach.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: As children get ready for summer camp, federal COVID-19 response funds are being used to offer mental health training for camp counselors. The Department of Education is partnering with the New Hampshire Community Behavioral Mental Health Association to provide the training. Also, the 10 community mental health centers around the state will have staff on site at camp locations weekly to provide mental health support for children. The effort is a part of the department’s “Rekindling Curiosity: Every Kid Goes to Camp” program, which offers families camp-tuition support. “In spite of the heroic efforts by so many over this past year, so many children across New Hampshire have experienced anxiety and trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Frank Edelblut, commissioner of education, said in a statement Tuesday. “The Rekindle Curiosity program will simply give many of our children the opportunity to be a kid again and build some childhood memories.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state is investing $200,000 in a center to help Atlantic City and New Jersey become a national hub for the billion-dollar competitive video game industry, known as esports. The New Jersey Economic Development Authority and Stockton University on Tuesday signed an agreement to establish an esports Innovation Center at the university’s Atlantic City campus. The authority will provide staff support for the Innovation Center, which will also include leaders in the esports industry. It was the latest manifestation of New Jersey’s interest in being not just a player but a leader in the fast-growing field. Newzoo, a research firm that tracks the esports industry, projects it will generate $1.08 billion in global revenue this year, an increase of 14.5% over last year. “I was shocked when I saw the numbers,” said Brian Sabina, the authority’s chief economic growth officer. “It’s the fastest-growing college sport in America. Nearly 500 million people tune in to watch esports events.” The center is designed to create new academic and workforce development opportunities and to support local economic development. It plans to identify industrywide technology development opportunities and to host “hack-a-thons” and similar coding challenges focused on creating innovative solutions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlamogordo: Officials in southern New Mexico are seeing an increase in pets surrendered and expect numbers to keep rising. In 2020, Alamogordo Animal Control took in 1,260 animals, saw 563 adopted and euthanized 36, according to Alamogordo Police Department data. The Otero County Animal Shelter took in 1,605 animals, saw 542 adopted and euthanized 364 last year, according to the shelter’s own data. Officials with both organizations expected the number of surrendered animals to increase post-pandemic as pet owners find their way back to offices and away from home. “It’s post-COVID-19 stuff; everyone was home and had time for the dog, and now everyone is going back to work, and we’re getting the same stories, you know?” Alamogordo Animal Control Manager Dwaine Martinez said. He said a surge in pet surrenders was already noted. Alamogordo Animal Control and Kitty City hold regular adoption events at White Sands Mall nearly every other Saturday. “We’ve seen a little bit of returns, but I don’t think it’s been any increase of what it would have been without COVID-19,” Kitty City Director Kathy Denton said. Under the rescue’s return policy, it works with the adopter to find out what issues may have arisen, Denton said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has signed legislation requiring general hospitals to seek input from nurses and other staff in creating staffing plans that are to include specific guidelines on how many patients each nurse is assigned. The new law requires hospitals to form committees composed of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, ancillary staff members providing direct patient care, and hospital administrators to form the staffing plans. Hospital staffing committees must adopted their first staffing plans and submit them to the state health department by July 1, 2022. It’s unclear how the law will play out in non-unionized workplaces. Lawmakers passed the legislation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which put a strain on staffing and resources at many hospitals throughout New York. Supporters of the law want to boost staffing levels. The original bill would have mandated statewide minimum staffing levels, but those were negotiated out. “This legislation requires hospitals to create committees that include the very same staff who treat patients on the ground every single day and come up with plans that take their concerns into consideration when allocating staff,” Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans in the state Senate unveiled a two-year state budget proposal Monday that sticks to earlier spending limits even with recent news of a massive revenue windfall. They instead earmark billions more now for savings, with plans for deeper tax cuts and more construction projects to follow the rest of the decade. The measure also offers pay raises and one-time bonuses to public school teachers and state employees, although the permanent raises fall short of what Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper proposed in his budget in March. The bill, which is expected to pass through the chamber by Friday, seeks to spend $25.7 billion in state funds in the year starting July 1 and $26.6 billion the following year, in keeping with a spending cap that senators settled on with House Republicans this month. However, state economists predicted last week that the state would have $6.5 billion more at its disposal over the next two years above and beyond what was anticipated, beginning with an extra $1.9 billion in state coffers by June 30. Still, senators say they’re committed to the cap – otherwise concerned that much of the cash influx attributed to a resurgent post-pandemic economy can’t be counted on in the long term to pay for permanent initiatives.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Legislative leaders on Tuesday dismissed criticism of new limits on emergency spending by a governor-led panel, saying they have no interest in repealing or amending the law. Republican Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner said in an interview that criticism that the new law could hamper the state’s ability to address emergency spending is unwarranted. “I don’t think this is a life-or-death thing,” Wardner said. “We can live with this.” The law, passed shortly before the GOP-led Legislature adjourned in April, effectively furthers an ongoing battle between Gov. Doug Burgum and the Legislature, which has long argued that it decides spending matters and that the second-term Republican has stepped too far onto its turf. The Legislature easily overrode Burgum’s veto of the bill that he said “clearly violates the separation of powers doctrine” and would be unconstitutional. Burgum has declined to say if he would challenge the law in court. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said in an interview that she supports the law. “It is OK for us to do this,” she said. “Otherwise, we don’t know what’s being spent where.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The coronavirus pandemic appears to have triggered more smoking among smokers in the region and prompted 1 in 10 former smokers to light up again, a newly released survey shows. Tobacco use by Cincinnati area adults had declined for more than 20 years, from 35% in 1999 to 19% in 2018. “But the COVID-19 pandemic stalled progress,” officials at Interact for Health said in a news release Tuesday. The percentage of adult current smokers in the region was fairly stable between 2018 (19%) and 2020 (21%), the organization said. In the wake of the new poll results, Interact for Health, a Norwood-based nonprofit that partnered with the University of Cincinnati Institute for Policy Research on the survey, is offering grants for tobacco-use cessation projects in the Cincinnati area. The Greater Cincinnati COVID-19 Health Issues Survey found that 23% of responding smokers said they smoked more frequently during the pandemic and that 9% of those who had quit started smoking again last year. The survey, conducted between Oct. 7 and Nov. 17, 2020, polled a random sample of 879 adults from the Cincinnati region, including an oversample of Black residents, interviewed by phone. The potential margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points, researchers said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A big boost is coming to efforts to “restart the arts” in Oklahoma, as nonprofit cultural organizations struggle to overcome the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Kirkpatrick Family Fund has announced a $1 million commitment to Allied Arts over a three-year period to assist local nonprofit arts organizations recover and regain forward momentum. “As we emerge out of a pandemic year, the Kirkpatrick Family Fund is committed to helping restore the educational, visual, and performing arts that are vital to a thriving society and economy,” Kirkpatrick Family Fund President Christian Keesee said in a statement. Allied Arts found staggering financial losses when it surveyed 39 central Oklahoma cultural organizations about their operations between March 2020 and February 2021. The local impact of the pandemic was more than $21.2 million in revenue losses for these nonprofits, even after the groups received almost $12 million in COVID-19 assistance. “And that’s not even including the ripple-effect spending, which is looking at the true economic impact,” Allied Arts President and CEO Deborah McAuliffe Senner said. “It’s for those special events and occasions that people are getting their nails done, their hair done, a new dress. All of that was lost.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: With the state and federal eviction moratorium set to expire at the end of June, lawmakers passed an added safety net for struggling tenants Tuesday that will “pause” some evictions. Under the “Safe Harbor” amendment on Senate Bill 278, tenants who are unable to pay their July or August rent would not be evicted for 60 days if they provide proof to their landlord that they’ve applied for rental assistance through Oregon Housing and Community Services. The amended bill, which passed in the House 56-2 and in the Senate 26-3, was sent to Gov. Kate Brown’s desk to be signed. An eviction moratorium has been in place in Oregon since April 2020. In addition, last month lawmakers voted to extend the grace period for past due rent during the moratorium, allowing tenants to have until Feb. 28, 2022, to pay back rent. While the governor announced earlier this month that she was extending the state’s mortgage foreclosure moratorium through September, she said she did not have the authority to extend the eviction moratorium. “That means, by law, Oregon’s eviction moratorium will expire on June 30,” Brown said. Officials had warned that as the moratorium expired, the state would likely see a mass wave of evictions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state locks up far too many first-time and low-level youth offenders, with Black youth in particular disproportionately yanked from their homes and prosecuted as adults, according to a governmental task force that made recommendations Tuesday to reform juvenile justice in the state. “Serious racial disparities pervade Pennsylvania’s juvenile justice system,” the bipartisan Pennsylvania Juvenile Justice Task Force said in its report, adding that changes are urgently needed to make the state’s juvenile justice system more fair and more effective. A substantial percentage of young people who commit a minor crime and are considered at low risk of reoffending are nevertheless removed from home and placed in a residential facility, the group found in its 16-month review. The practice is widespread despite research showing that out-of-home placement is “generally not effective at reducing recidivism for most youth – and can instead be counterproductive,” the report said. Policymakers found widespread geographic and racial disparities in how youth offenders are treated, with Black youths more likely than white youths to be removed from home and prosecuted in adult court.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank has approved a $400,000 loan to help in the redevelopment of a brownfields site in Pawtucket. The loan will finance environmental remediation work as part of the larger Nexus Lofts project that will include 27 affordable market-rate apartments with ground floor office and retail space, the bank said in a statement. “This $400,000 loan for site remediation work at the Nexus Lofts project will help catalyze further development in the surrounding buildings,” infrastructure bank CEO Jeffrey Diehl said in a statement. Co-developer Michael Leshinsky called the loan a critical part of the project. The Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank is the state’s central hub for financing infrastructure improvements for municipalities, businesses and homeowners.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Lawmakers are considering a bill to let mental health professionals refuse to provide care that violates their religious beliefs in response to an ordinance banning conversion therapy for minors in the capital city. The Senate Medical Affairs subcommittee heard testimony on the legislation Monday but didn’t take a vote. The state already has such medical conscience protections in place for doctors and other health care providers, allowing them to opt out of providing nonemergency services to people when it contradicts their religious, moral, ethical or philosophical beliefs or principles. The legislation would expand those protections to mental health professionals, said bill sponsor Sen. Josh Kimbrell, R-Spartanburg. The bill is a direct response to Columbia’s new ordinance barring attempts by licensed therapists and counselors to change the sexual orientation of minors. Opponents say the bill would harm LGBTQ individuals and make health care more difficult to access for many marginalized and rural South Carolinians. Kimbrell previously asked South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson to block the Columbia measure, which was passed last week and is reported to be the first of its kind in the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s largest health care providers proposed Monday that lawmakers drop part of the requirement for people seeking medical marijuana identification cards to obtain a physician’s recommendation to use the drug. Under the proposal, physicians would still need to certify that patients have conditions such as severe pain, seizures or multiple sclerosis that would qualify them for a medical marijuana ID. But they would not need to specifically recommend that medical marijuana be used to treat the condition. The proposal was welcomed by medical marijuana advocates, who have worried that patients will have a difficult time getting medical pot recommendations. Doctors have expressed hesitancy about recommending medical marijuana as the state prepares to legalize it. Although a voter-passed law legalizing medical marijuana takes effect July 1, the full medical cannabis program is still in flux. The state has until November to start issuing ID cards, meaning people wouldn’t be able to legally buy medical cannabis until then. In the meantime, legislators are planning changes to the law. Sarah Aker, director of fiscal policy at the South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations, said doctors might be more comfortable writing certifications if they didn’t specifically recommend using cannabis.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Justin Timberlake was back in his hometown, virtually, as he videoconferenced into a workshop with students of the Stax Music Academy. Timberlake and a team of his associated producers, musicians and industry figures helped guide a two-month creative class and mentorship program. Eight Stax Music Academy students, working as teams, were invited to take part in the “All Star Song Lab.” On Thursday evening, the Memphis-born pop star celebrated the program’s completion with the students and their parents during an event in which the songs they wrote and recorded as part of the program were played. Although Timberlake had conducted a similar workshop in 2019 in person at the academy, the pandemic forced this year’s more expansive effort to take place through computers. Two summers ago, as part of a Levi’s funded initiative, the company and Timberlake installed a creative space called “The Song Lab” in the Stax Music Academy building in South Memphis. That August, Timberlake surprised students with a two-day workshop that also featured noted producers Timbaland and Rob Knox and Memphis guitarist Elliot Ives. Timberlake also pledged to contribute $100,000 toward a scholarship fund for SMA students.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The veto period from the regular legislative session has ended with Gov. Greg Abbott blocking 20 bills from becoming law, including efforts to protect dogs from dangerous restraints and allow police to issue citations for trespassing. Abbott also vetoed legislation requiring middle schools and high schools to provide instruction on preventing child abuse, family violence and dating violence. Though the subjects are important, Senate Bill 1109 “fails to recognize the right of parents to opt their children out of the instruction,” Abbott said in a statement accompanying his veto. “I have vetoed similar legislation before on this ground, because we must safeguard parental rights regarding this type of instruction.” The governor also took exception to SB 474, which sought to prohibit owners from tethering unattended dogs outdoors without providing access to adequate shelter, shade and water, among other protocols. “Texas is no place for this kind of micromanaging and overcriminalization,” Abbott wrote, saying that animal cruelty laws already protect dogs. The Texas Humane Legislative Network spent six years working toward passage of the bill, and its members were devastated by the veto, Executive Director Shelby Bobosky said.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: Arches National Park is on track to have its busiest year ever, and that increase in visitation has caused the park to close its gates more than 80 times so far in 2021. Two other popular national parks in the West – Rocky Mountain and Yosemite – implemented reservation systems last year due to the pandemic. Both brought reservations back this summer in anticipation of record visitation. Park advocates along with Moab and Grand County officials say a similar system could help alleviate congestion and protect Arches. But efforts to implement a timed-entry system there have failed in the past. Lines and closures have been a problem at Arches since about 2016, according to Joette Langianese, director of a nonprofit called Friends of Arches and Canyonlands Parks that helps raise funds and advocate for both parks. Visitation dropped a bit last year because of the pandemic, but she said tourists are back in full force this year, and they’re wreaking havoc on the park, littering and wandering off paths. Langianese said those are the kinds of things rangers are supposed to monitor, but the sheer number of visitors is making it hard. She said a reservation system would spread visitors out over the course of the day during the high season so that the park isn’t swamped. “Let’s just try it, see how it works,” Langianese said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is ending its pandemic-related emergency housing in hotels and motels for some of the homeless population because the program is not sustainable, hotel capacity is shrinking, and it was never meant to be a permanent solution, Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said Tuesday. Roughly 700 people, or about a third of the homeless people put up in motels during the coronavirus pandemic, will no longer be eligible July 1, officials estimate. “This was possible because the public health and travel restrictions essentially closed Vermont tourism, and hotels and motels stepped up,” Smith said during the governor’s weekly coronavirus briefing. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is reimbursing the state for the nearly $79 million cost of the program, he said. It was projected to rise to $108 million in fiscal year 2022 if changes weren’t made while federal reimbursement is uncertain, he said. The Legislature asked the Human Services Agency to create a work group to come up with a transition plan, Smith said. The plan was accepted by the Legislature and includes a more expansive program than before the pandemic – estimated to cost $41 million, compared to $6 million pre-pandemic, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: If a court clears the way, the state expects to remove not just a soaring statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Richmond’s historic Monument Avenue but also a little-known piece of history tucked inside the massive sculpture’s base: a 134-year-old time capsule. Historical records and recent imaging tests suggest the presence of the time capsule, which some have speculated might contain a rare, valuable and historically significant photo of deceased President Abraham Lincoln. “Anyone who has an interest in Civil War history or Richmond history would be very intrigued by this item,” said Dale Brumfield, a local historian and author who has conducted extensive research on the aged copper receptacle and rumored photo. The removal work is contingent on the resolution of two still-pending lawsuits seeking to keep the monument in place. The bronze equestrian statue of Lee was one of five enormous Confederate tributes along Monument Avenue and the only one that belonged to the state. Like many other cities across the South, Richmond removed the figures on its monuments last summer amid nationwide protests against racial injustice and criticism that the statues are symbols of white supremacy that should not occupy public places.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The medical school at Washington State University has received full accreditation, the final step in an academic journey that took nearly six years. The Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, in Spokane, on Tuesday received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, which accredits medical degree programs in the U.S. and Canada. “Achieving full accreditation marks the culmination of a journey that began the day we started the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine,” said John Tomkowiak, founding dean of the medical school named for the late WSU president. The effort started in 2015, after Gov. Jay Inslee signed a bill that gave WSU authority to create a medical school. That overturned a previous law that had been in place for nearly 100 years prohibiting the creation of a new public medical school in the state. In 2016, the LCME granted preliminary accreditation to the WSU College of Medicine, which allowed the college to begin recruiting students and accepting applications for the college’s inaugural class of 2021. The college was granted provisional accreditation in 2019. Accreditation is a peer-review process that determines whether a medical school’s program meets established standards.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Lawmakers will convene Thursday to take up $250 million in spending proposed by Gov. Jim Justice after a “tremendous” budget surplus. The Republican governor has suggested moving the millions to a wide variety of state departments, from tourism to natural resources. There are proposed upgrades to correctional facilities and expansions to some West Virginia State Parks. The Legislature will meet at noon to act on the funds. Earlier this month, lawmakers met to pour federal funds and extra state cash into road repairs, health care and education programs such as school lunches. Those efforts included about $902 million in federal funds received through pandemic relief legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden. Much of that funding came through grants directed by the federal government to be spent on programs such as substance abuse prevention, aid for needy families and child care services. Another $150 million from a state budget surplus was dedicated to fund 702 miles of road paving and projects on 40 bridges across all 55 counties.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Federal officials have designated a huge swath of the state’s Lake Michigan coastline as a National Marine Sanctuary to protect historic shipwrecks in the area, Gov. Tony Evers’ office announced Tuesday. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will publish regulations designating 962 square miles from Kewaunee County south to Ozaukee County as a sanctuary, Evers’ office said. The designation will protect 36 shipwrecks, 21 of which are on the National Register of Historic Places. Evers’ office said research suggests the area may include as many as 60 additional shipwrecks. The designation is subject to congressional and gubernatorial review. Evers said his administration is “really excited” about the designation, according to comments posted on NOAA’s website. The shipwreck sanctuary would become the 15th marine sanctuary NOAA has established. The network encompasses more than 600,000 square miles of marine and Great Lakes waters. Then-Gov. Scott Walker nominated the Lake Michigan area as a sanctuary in 2014. Boats would be prohibited from anchoring on shipwrecks in the sanctuary, and the sanctuary could draw tourists to the area, but beyond that the designation appears to have little practical effect.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Drivers were caught speeding less last year in Wyoming, but those who got nabbed were going faster than usual. Citations for speeding fell 15% in 2020, but there were 29% more citations for people driving over 100 mph, according to the Wyoming Highway Patrol. While highway traffic was down during the coronavirus pandemic, the drivers out there “felt that they could be going faster,” patrol Capt. David Wagener said. Law enforcement gave out nearly 1,500 citations in the state last year for “excessive speeding,” defined as going 15 mph or more above the posted speed limit. That was more than 300 more tickets for excessive speed than the number issued in 2019, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Driving too fast, especially in foul weather, is a leading factor in Wyoming’s serious accidents. More than 1,600 such crashes in the state in the last decade involved excessive speeding.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/24/doggie-dupe-toxic-tahoe-cables-semiconductor-plant-news-around-states/49433923/", "title": "Doggie dupe, toxic Tahoe cables: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The U.S. Department of Justice says conditions in the state’s prisons have not improved since the federal government warned three years ago of unconstitutional conditions that were noted in particular as deadly and dangerous for male inmates. The Justice Department last Friday filed an updated complaint in its ongoing lawsuit against Alabama over prison conditions. Federal officials wrote that violence remains unabated in facilities that are both overcrowded and “dangerously” understaffed. “In the two and a half years following the United States’ original notification to the State of Alabama of unconstitutional conditions of confinement, prisoners at Alabama’s Prisons for Men have continued daily to endure a high risk of death, physical violence, and sexual abuse at the hands of other prisoners,” the Justice Department wrote in the complaint signed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. The lawsuit accuses the state of operating prisons where conditions are so poor they violate the U.S. Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment, and it accuses officials of being deliberately indifferent to the situation. While Alabama has acknowledged problems in its prisons, the state is disputing Justice’s allegations of unconstitutional conditions and is fighting the lawsuit in court.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Dozens of West Point graduates have demanded state Rep. David Eastman resign from office over his ties to a right-wing extremist group, saying his affiliation has betrayed the values of the U.S. Military Academy he attended. A letter signed by 69 fellow West Point graduates was published in the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman and called on Eastman to resign after his membership in the Oath Keepers became public, with another name added after publication. Eastman had previously confirmed to the Anchorage Daily News that he became a member of the organization shortly after it formed more than a decade ago. Ivan Hodes, who lives in Anchorage and authored the letter, served in the same military police battalion at Fort Richardson in Anchorage as Eastman. Hodes told the Anchorage Daily News he reached out to other West Point graduates because he was concerned the Wasilla Republican was violating his duties as a legislator. “It’s serving two masters,” he said. “You can’t be loyal to the U.S. government and the government of Alaska and at the same time belong to this militia.” Several members of Oath Keepers have been charged with crimes connected to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Eastman said he went to Washington that day to object to the Electoral College votes of several states confirming President Joe Biden’s election but didn’t participate in the demonstrations.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Most springs and wells in a vast region of northern Arizona known for its high-grade uranium ore meet federal drinking water standards despite decades of uranium mining, U.S. scientists found. The highest concentrations of uranium were found at several sites downslope from an abandoned mine within Grand Canyon National Park. Further investigation is needed to determine if the contamination is directly linked to the Orphan Mine, the U.S. Geological Survey said. “The proximity of the mine to the spring, that’s our working hypothesis. We can’t say definitively. We need to look for other things,” said Fred Tillman, a research hydrologist for the USGS. The study released this month is part of an effort to better understand the complex geology and hydrology of a region where roughly 1,562 square miles outside the Grand Canyon were put off-limits to new mining claims until 2032. The Obama administration implemented the ban in 2012, partly out of concern that new mining operations could spoil the Colorado River that runs through the Grand Canyon. Companion bills in the U.S. House and Senate seek to make the withdrawal permanent. Near the Orphan Mine, uranium concentrations were up to 10 times higher in springs than what the Environmental Protection Agency deems safe for drinking, USGS found.\n\nArkansas\n\nBentonville: A rare first printing of the U.S. Constitution that sold for $43.2 million – a record price for a document or book sold at auction – is headed to the Land of Opportunity. The buyer, hedge fund manager Kenneth Griffin, will loan the document to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville for public exhibition, Sotheby’s announced. Griffin, the founder and CEO of multinational hedge fund Citadel, outbid a group of 17,000 cryptocurrency enthusiasts from around the world who crowdfunded to buy it. “The U.S. Constitution is a sacred document that enshrines the rights of every American and all those who aspire to be,” Griffin said in a statement. “That is why I intend to ensure that this copy of our Constitution will be available for all Americans and visitors to view and appreciate in our museums and other public spaces.” Crystal Bridges opened in 2011 and was founded by Alice Walton, the daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton. “We are honored to exhibit one of the most important documents in our nation’s history from our location in the heartland of America,” said Olivia Walton, chairperson of the museum’s board. The document Griffin purchased was one of 13 known copies of the first printing of the Constitution and one of only two in private hands. It was last sold in 1988, for $165,000.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State regulators haven’t approved permits for the controversial oil and gas extraction process known as fracking since February, effectively phasing out the process ahead of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 2024 deadline to end it. The state’s Geologic Energy Management Division, known as CalGEM, has rejected an unprecedented 109 fracking permits in 2021, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. That’s the most denials the division has issued in a single year since California began permitting fracking in 2015. Fifty of the permits, mostly from Bakersfield-based Aera Energy, were denied based solely on climate change concerns. State oil and gas supervisor Uduak-Joe Ntuk wrote in a September letter to Aera that he could “not in good conscience” grant the permits “given the increasingly urgent climate effects of fossil-fuel production” and “the continuing impacts of climate change and hydraulic fracturing on public health and natural resources.” Newsom, a Democrat, called in 2020 for state lawmakers to ban the practice by 2024. But a proposal before lawmakers failed, leading Newsom to direct CalGEM to proceed with the timeline on its own. Kern County, where most fracking in the state occurs, and the Western States Petroleum Association have sued the state over the denials. A hearing in the Kern case is set for Monday, and the state must respond to WSPA’s lawsuit by Thursday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state paid more than $630,000 last year to a group of personal and business associates of Gov. Jared Polis that had ostensibly volunteered to help the state manage its way through the COVID-19 pandemic by tracking people’s movements, records show. Then, when that group’s work was done in late 2020, the state began paying another $1 million in a deal it gave to a startup company created by two people tied to the first group’s work, The Denver Gazette reports. Neither of the contracts was publicly bid; rather, they were the result of an executive order Polis issued in April 2020 declaring a disaster emergency that suspended state laws requiring bids on purchases relating to the pandemic, no matter the size of the contract. The state normally requires public bids for any contract over $150,000. State health officials defended the deals as valuable to their work battling the raging pandemic, but none offered an explanation for how they went from a public service to a public expense. Polis’ office said it “had no prior knowledge or involvement in this procurement decision and therefore has no comment.” When Citizen Software Engineers’ cellphone-tracking work became public – it was largely using the information to check whether Coloradans were social distancing at the outset of the pandemic – the nonprofit group was clear about its mission: to help deal with the crisis at little or no cost to taxpayers.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A bipartisan committee of eight legislative leaders and one former lawmaker has voted unanimously for a new map that redraws the boundaries of the state Senate, accommodating the population growth that has occurred in the Stamford area. Tuesday’s vote came on the heels of last week’s unanimous approval of new boundaries for state House of Representatives districts. Senate Minority Leader Kevin Kelly, R-Stratford, credited the process with being a “truly bipartisan effort” that should be replicated across the U.S. “We didn’t always see eye to eye, but you know, that’s part of the process,” he said. “I think (the process) should be emulated throughout the country.” The same group is expected to seek an extension from the state Supreme Court of its Nov. 30 deadline so it can finish redrawing congressional district boundaries. Commission members said they need extra time because they received U.S. census data late due to the pandemic. Under the new Senate map, Stamford will now have three state senators instead of two representing it in the General Assembly. While most of the Senate districts across the state remained relatively unchanged, one that includes about 3,600 prisoners was slightly expanded to accommodate a new state law counting inmates where they lived before being incarcerated.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A veteran firefighter is accusing the Wilmington Fire Department of years of racial and religious discrimination that created a hostile work environment and failure to discipline the perpetrators, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court. On more than one occasion, high-ranking officials as well as other firefighters used racial epithets in conversation with or to insult veteran firefighter Corey Ferrell; played the “Aladdin theme song to plaintiff whenever he would go to pray”; and snuck pork products – which Ferrell cannot consume – in his coffee and turnout gear, according to the federal discrimination lawsuit filed against the city, its fire department and top officials Nov. 10. The city declined to comment, noting that the Law Department is reviewing the lawsuit. Ferrell was regularly subjected to racial slurs by other firefighters and senior management along with harassment over his religious beliefs, according to the suit. The 23-year veteran of the department is African American and a practicing Muslim. The department’s racial makeup is overwhelmingly white and male despite Wilmington’s population being nearly 60% Black or African American. According to the latest department staffing report, white male firefighters make up about 64% of the 162 total employees.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The first person elected to D.C. Advisory Neighborhood Commission while behind bars is starting a new chapter, WUSA-TV reports. As Joel Castón was released from the D.C. jail on parole, after 27 years incarcerated, dozens of family members and supporters from the Georgetown Prisons and Justice Initiative welcomed him to freedom. After he was convicted of killing a teen in a parking lot in 1994 – he maintains he was wrongfully convicted – Castón became a worship leader, a financial literacy instructor and a mentor. He wrote a memoir and taught himself Mandarin and Arabic. Then, in June, the voters in ANC7F, mostly incarcerated people, elected him ANC commissioner. He was the first person incarcerated in the jail to be elected to public office in the district. “My platform will be used to restore the dignity of incarcerated people so that we will no longer be judged by our worst mistake,” he said in an interview during his campaign. “Imagine a single-member district, where every voice matters, every concern is heard, and every person is valued.” Castón will represent the jail, the women’s center and the luxury apartments across the street. The now 44-year-old said the first thing he wants to do is celebrate his mom, then get to work.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: For more than 20 years, a line of German shepherds named Gunther has been presented in news stories as the wealthy beneficiaries of a German countess. The story appears to be a ruse created by Maurizio Mian, the scion of an Italian pharmaceutical company, who has used the tale of the globe-trotting canine to promote real estate sales and other projects. The Associated Press reported last week that a dog, Gunther VI, was selling a Miami mansion it had purchased from Madonna for $7.5 million in 2000 for $31.75 million. The story cited claims from Gunther’s “handler” that the dog was from a long line of dogs bequeathed the fortune of the countess. While the mansion is in fact owned and being sold by the Gunther Corp., according to Miami-Dade County property records, the dog’s role appears to be little more than a joke that’s carried on for decades. And there is no evidence of a German countess. The AP reported on the story after receiving a press release from publicists representing the real estate agents who had the listing. “The AP published a story that did not meet our standards and should not have been published. We did not do our due diligence in the reporting process. We have corrected the story, and we apologize,” AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said in a statement.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDecatur: A women’s college has bestowed a new honor on its first Black graduate, who earned her degree 50 years ago. Agnes Scott College held a ceremony Nov. 17 for Edna Lowe Swift, commemorating her 1971 graduation with a bench and plaque on the campus lawn, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The 72-year-old Swift said she was thrilled by the honor. She received a scholarship to attend Agnes Scott and arrived on campus for the fall semester in 1967. Six years earlier, Charlayne Hunter-Gault faced racial slurs and a mob outside her dorm after she and Hamilton Holmes integrated the University of Georgia. Agnes Scott admitted its first Black student, Gay Johnson McDougall, two years before Swift enrolled, but McDougall did not complete her studies at the college. In a 2010 interview for a school oral history project, she recalled receiving hate mail and feeling “profoundly lonely.” Swift said she did not experience harassment or violence but decided not to live on campus in part because she wasn’t sure how she’d fit in, the AJC reports. She received support from Black employees at the school. “They were proud,” she said. She majored in Spanish and went on to a teaching career in Atlanta Public Schools. College officials named a lounge in the campus center after her a few years ago.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Most of the state’s counties said Tuesday that they will allow restaurants and bars to operate at 100% capacity and eliminate a requirement that groups sit 6 feet apart at restaurants as the state eases some restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. But Gov. David Ige said at a news conference with the mayors that he will continue to require travelers from other states to show proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test to avoid 10 days of quarantine when they arrive. Ige said virus activity continues to be substantial in Hawaii by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards. He noted the state has been averaging about 100 new cases per day lately, and it wouldn’t take much for those numbers to sharply escalate. “We are at a better place than we were in three months ago, but we are still not finished with the pandemic,” Ige said. When asked when he planned to lift a requirement that people wear masks in indoor public places, the governor said health care professionals, including state Department of Health Director Dr. Libby Char and State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Kemble, tell him wearing masks reduces the spread. He also relayed that governors from other states told him they regretted dropping mask mandates in their states, as they believed doing so contributed to surges.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: The state Fish and Game Commission has designated a chronic wasting disease management zone in north-central Idaho, allowing hunts to kill up to 1,000 deer to determine the extent of the disease. The Lewiston Tribune reports the decision Monday allows Fish and Game Director Ed Schriever to establish the emergency hunts that will target a mix of whitetails and mule deer of both sexes. Planning is in progress for the hunts, designed to help wildlife officials determine the prevalence and geographic area of the disease. They aren’t intended to contain the disease, though the commission could in the future authorize such hunts. “That will be the commission’s decision, and it will be informed by the data we are collecting now,” Schriever said. Two mule deer bucks killed near Lucile last month tested positive for chronic wasting disease. It’s the first time the contagious and fatal neurological disorder has been detected in the state. Chronic wasting disease can also infect elk, moose and caribou and has been confirmed in 25 states. The disease found in game animals carries potential health concerns for hunters because it’s in the same family as mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people not eat meat from animals with the disease.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A suburban Chicago priest has been reinstated as a pastor after a review board for the Archdiocese of Chicago found there was “insufficient reason to suspect” he had sexually abused children 25 years ago. The Rev. David F. Ryan was first asked to step away from the St. Francis de Sales Catholic Parish in Lake Zurich in November 2020 when an investigation into the alleged abuse began. Archbishop Blase Cupich then announced Sept. 9 that Ryan had been cleared and reinstated. But a week later, Ryan was once again placed under investigation after Cupich said new information had become available to the archdiocese. Ryan led Mass on Sunday at the St. Francis de Sales parish immediately after being reinstated, the Chicago Tribune reports. He said in a statement last week that he was innocent but that the church was right to be vigilant and must investigate all claims. “It is important that you know I categorically deny that I have ever abused a child. I have faith the investigation will confirm what I know to be true and that I will return to parish ministry when it concludes,” Ryan said in a statement Nov. 18. The abuse allegations were from when Ryan was assigned to Maryville Academy in Des Plaines. Ryan was ordained in Springfield in June 1979 and started working in Maryville six years later.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A lawsuit filed by a teacher who was fired from his job at a Catholic high school for being in a same-sex marriage can proceed, a state appeals court ruled. A panel of the Indiana Court of Appeals ruled unanimously Tuesday that a Marion County court erred in dismissing Joshua Payne-Elliott’s lawsuit against the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. The ruling reverses that decision and sends the case back to the lower court. Payne-Elliott had worked for 13 years as a world language and social studies teacher at Cathedral High School. He was fired in June 2019 after the archdiocese mandated that all Catholic schools under its purview enforce a morality clause barring employees from entering into same-sex marriages. Payne-Elliott married Layton Payne-Elliott, a teacher at Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School, in 2017. The couple has been at the center of a fight between their schools and the archdiocese, which directed the schools to fire both men. Brebeuf did not comply with the directive, to which the archdiocese responded by attempting to strip Brebeuf of its status as a Catholic institution. Payne-Elliott filed a lawsuit in July 2019, alleging that the archdiocese illegally interfered with his contractual and employment relationship with Cathedral High School by causing the school to terminate him.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: They surely don’t want to hurt anyone else’s feelings by saying so, but more than half of Iowans think the state’s residents tend to be unusually nice, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows. Fifty-eight percent of Iowans say that in their experience, Iowans are generally nicer than people from other states, the poll finds. Another 36% say there’s generally no difference, and just 4% say Iowans tend to be ruder than people from other states. The “Iowa Nice” image resonates with Republicans, 70% of whom say Iowans generally seem to be nicer, the poll finds. That view is held by 51% of Democrats and 53% of political independents. Country folks tend to be typecast as the most neighborly, but the poll finds majorities of urban, suburban, small-town and rural Iowans all think their state has more than its share of nice people. At least a plurality of every demographic say Iowans are nicer than people in other states, with one exception: those with no religious affiliation. Just 47% of them say Iowans are nicer – the same proportion as those noting no difference. Perhaps a comfortable income improves people’s opinion of those around them: 67% of Iowans with incomes of $100,000 or more think Iowans are nicer than people from elsewhere.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly on Tuesday brushed aside complaints from fellow Democrats about signing a Republican measure aimed at financially protecting workers who refuse to get COVID-19 vaccines by declaring that “leadership means seeking compromise.” Kelly acted with unusual speed, signing the bill the afternoon after its passage by the GOP-controlled Legislature just before midnight Monday during a one-day special session. Kansas is making it easy for workers to claim religious exemptions from COVID-19 vaccine requirements and promising unemployment benefits to people who are fired after refusing the shots. Most Democratic lawmakers opposed the measure, and Kelly angered some of them with her pledge to sign it in response to federal mandates from President Joe Biden. She signed the bill in private after ignoring questions from reporters during a Tuesday morning holiday event at the governor’s official residence. “I know there are Kansans who believe this legislation goes too far, and there are others who believe this legislation doesn’t go far enough. But I was elected to lead, and leadership means seeking compromise,” Kelly said in a statement. “This bill is the result of compromise in action.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky State Police have started collecting donated nonperishable food items for families in need during the holidays. “Cram the Cruiser” is going on at all 16 state police posts. Collected food is distributed to food banks, shelters, churches and other groups, state police said in a news release. The drive started Tuesday and continues until Dec. 6. Troopers will be at grocery and retail stores accepting products like canned fruit and vegetables, canned meat, macaroni and cheese, peanut butter, jelly, canned soups, cake mixes, water and powdered milk. Food items may also be dropped off at local police posts. Posts compete to see which one gathers the most food, said Capt. Paul Blanton, public affairs commander.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A bronze statue of the state’s most famous politician has had a makeover after decades of exposure to weather and birds. The statue of Huey P. Long, which faces the Capitol he built, was recently cleaned by the expert who is restoring the building’s bronze windows as part of a waterproofing project. “We felt like it was a good opportunity while we had someone with the expertise on site,” said Jacques Berry, a spokesman for Gov. John Bel Edwards’ Division of Administration. The 12-foot-tall statue, which stands atop a pedestal nearly twice as high, was erected on Long’s grave in 1940, five years after he was shot and killed inside the building. Long was serving in the U.S. Senate and running for president against Franklin Roosevelt at the time of his death. The statue faces the front of the 450-foot tall state Capitol he built during his only term as governor, from 1928 to 1932. Charles Heck designed the statue, which cost $50,000. Carvings on the base include a rearing horse carrying a pennant that reads, “Share the Wealth,” Long’s populist plan to redistribute America’s wealth from the rich to the poor. Relief carvings also feature Long distributing free schoolbooks and guiding the construction of the Capitol building while adoring citizens gaze on.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A group of Native American tribes is working on a plan to boost tourism efforts in the coming years. The Wabanaki Cultural Tourism Initiative includes the five Wabanaki tribes in the state. The tribes are doing the work through Four Directions Development Corporation, which state officials described as a Native community development financial institution. The Maine Office of Tourism said Monday that it has awarded the financial institution $150,000 to help with developing tourism. The development corporation wants to create a Wabanaki tourism economy by 2030, officials said. The tourism office said the money will also be used to enroll tribal members from the development corporation in George Washington University’s Cultural Heritage Tourism Certificate Program. That program is intended to help community leaders and others build tourism. Charlene Virgilio, executive director of Four Directions Development Corporation, said the help from the state “will support the development of a Wabanaki tourism industry.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s attorney general filed a lawsuit Tuesday against chemical company Monsanto and two spinoffs, alleging that chemicals Monsanto manufactured harmed Maryland’s waters, fish and wildlife and seeking to recover damages and cleanup costs. The lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City alleges Monsanto knew as early as 1937 that polychlorinated biphenyls had systemic toxic effects in humans and animals, Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a news release. “Monsanto not only continued to manufacture and sell PCBs but increased production even when the harm to the environment was undeniable,” Frosh said in a statement. “Monsanto’s toxic legacy lives on. Until today, Marylanders have borne the cost of cleaning up these poisons. It is time for Monsanto to take full responsibility.” Monsanto was the only U.S. company to manufacture PCBs for widespread commercial use between 1935 and 1977, when it ceased production two years before it was banned. The company knew PCBs don’t naturally break down and touted their longevity, the suit alleges. Environment Secretary Ben Grumbles called the suit an important step to help Maryland “make progress in preventing toxic pollution and recovering from decades of damage.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Middle and high school students would learn about the history of genocide and human rights issues under a bill approved by state lawmakers Wednesday. The bill requires middle schools and high schools to include instruction on the history of genocide. The legislation comes as incidences of hate and antisemitism are on the rise across the country, with several incidents reported in Massachusetts over the past year, lawmakers said. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker has 10 days to decide whether to sign the bill into law. Massachusetts does not currently require education on the Holocaust or other genocides as part of its classroom curriculum. Lawmakers renewed the push for mandating education about the history of genocide earlier this year after a high school football coach was fired following reports that the team used antisemitic language, including a mention of Auschwitz, in its on-field play calling. The Massachusetts Senate last year approved a similar bill to require instruction on genocide before students graduate from high school, but it did not reach Baker’s desk. This bill would create a Genocide Education Trust Fund to support the development of teaching materials and to provide professional development training for educators.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday asked the Biden administration for federal funding to replace Interstate 375, a 1-mile-long depressed freeway in Detroit that was built by demolishing Black neighborhoods 60 years ago. The state wants to convert the highway, which connects I-75 directly to Jefferson Avenue, to a six-lane boulevard at street level. The $1 trillion U.S. infrastructure law enacted last week includes $1 billion to reconnect communities that were divided to make room for freeways. Black Bottom and Paradise Valley, two predominantly African American neighborhoods, were razed in the late 1950s and early 1960s to build I-375, which created a barrier between the downtown and neighborhoods to the east. Whitmer, in a letter inviting Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to join her to tour the area, called the I-375 improvement project a “perfect candidate” for the new federal Reconnecting Communities program. She did not specify how much funding is needed. Construction is not planned to start until 2027, after redesign work is complete. “Now, nearly three generations later, we have an opportunity to eliminate this obstacle and provide easier access to better jobs, services, and quality of life to the residents of adjacent areas of persistent poverty,” Whitmer wrote.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A bank that was badly damaged during protests over the death of George Floyd is giving the property to a nonprofit developer to build affordable housing, commercial space and a home for cultural organizations. The 2.4-acre U.S. Bank site, part of the Lake Street commercial corridor that became the target of vandalism and arson in May 2020, will feature businesses led by people of color, said Taylor Smrikarova, project leader for Seward Redesign. In addition, community organizations will own portions of the multimillion-dollar development. Bank spokeswoman Reba Dominski said the company chose Seward Redesign because it wanted a successful community developer with a history in the adjacent Seward and Longfellow neighborhoods and a commitment to racial equity, the Star Tribune reports. “Our goal is to create a new model for equitable development and demonstrate new ways in which architects can engage and partner with community,” said James Garrett Jr., a partner at Black-owned 4RM+ULA, an architectural design firm that will work with Seward Redesign on the project. U.S. Bank is building a new branch and redeveloping one of its properties, both on Lake Street, so the area will still be served with two locations, officials said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State Department of Human Services officials say inaccurate data provided by school districts is leading to delays in families receiving pandemic food cards. Meanwhile, families say they are waiting hours on hold when they to reach out to Mississippi Pandemic EBT Hotline for assistance. The rollout of the cards, meant to provide assistance to families of children who qualify for free or reduced-price meals at school and missed out on the benefits because of the pandemic, has been hampered by challenges. About 345,000 Mississippi children were set to receive a benefit of $375 per child through the Pandemic EBT program, according to the state. The Mississippi Department of Human Services said in September the money would be distributed by the end of October, but that hasn’t happened in all cases. In October, more than 14,000 low-income children in Mississippi had their pandemic food cards mistakenly deactivated. Officials said children with an apostrophe in their first or last names all had their cards accidentally deactivated by a processing partner. Families would have new cards sent to them in days, officials promised. Now, some families say they still haven’t received the funds.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Police chiefs have called on state lawmakers to change a new law banning local police from enforcing federal gun laws, which law enforcement officials say is making it harder to fight crime. The Missouri Police Chiefs Association wrote a letter to Republican legislators urging changes to the law, The Kansas City Star reports. Lawmakers cited the potential for new gun-control measures under President Joe Biden as motivation for the law, which allows private citizens to sue police departments for as much as $50,000 for violations. Police chiefs want lawmakers to make clear that the law only applies to federal gun rules enacted recently and doesn’t apply if police encounter a suspect committing a crime. They also want the law to detail which federal gun crimes local police can help with. It’s unclear whether lawmakers will take up the police chiefs’ recommendations in the session that starts in January. A staffer for one Republican sponsor, Sen. Eric Burlison, expressed interest in addressing law enforcement concerns. The other sponsor, Rep. Jered Taylor, has said he’s unwilling to consider changes to the law.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The state, the city and Yellowstone County are investing more than $4 million over the next three years to fight and prosecute crimes in the Billings area, the governor’s office announced. The state is using $2.3 million in pandemic relief money to improve public safety and the economy in Yellowstone County, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Tuesday. Businesses owners have reported the crime rate hurts their bottom line. The city and county are also investing $1 million each in the effort, The Billings Gazette reports. A commission created to recommend spending of some of the state’s pandemic relief money voted to invest $1.5 million in the Office of State Public Defender to increase staff in Yellowstone County and another $815,000 to hire agents in the Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation to better address drug and violent crimes in the county. County Attorney Scott Twito and city administrator Chris Kukulski recently raised concerns on the area’s crime levels and the disproportionate number of Department of Corrections inmates being supervised in the county. Billings has two prerelease programs, a substance use disorder program, a sex offender program, 34 sober living facilities, drug courts, veterans courts, and the largest number of probation and parole officers in the state, according to the Gazette.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Milton Andrew Munson’s obituary recalled his life as an Air Force veteran, pharmacist, husband, father and Nebraska football fan. That was evident in one line in the obit: “In lieu of flowers, please place an irresponsibly large wager on Nebraska beating Iowa.” Munson, 73, died Nov. 16. The obit, written by Munson’s sons, ran Nov. 18 in the Hastings Tribune, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. It caught fire on social media and captured the attention of two radio hosts, Josh Peterson, co-host of an afternoon sports talk show on KOZN-AM in Omaha, and Jack Mitchell, of KLIN-AM in Lincoln. They decided to throw in some money and make a bet for the Huskers to pull an upset in Friday night’s game in Lincoln, but once word got out, listeners and others pitched in, and the total grew to nearly $5,000. “I mentioned it (Monday) on the air,” Peterson said. “We talked about it for four or five minutes and said, ‘Here’s my Venmo if you want to donate.’ It’s blown up.” Munson’s son, Todd, was on Peterson’s show Tuesday and said the family will give some of the money to Big Brothers/Big Sisters, along with using some to bet on the Cornhuskers to beat the Hawkeyes, who are favored by a point-and-a-half.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: AT&T’s Pac Bell subsidiary has settled a lawsuit conservationists filed under a U.S. law more typically cited in Superfund cases, agreeing to spend up to $1.5 million to remove 8 miles of toxic telephone cables that were abandoned on the bottom of Lake Tahoe decades ago. The abandoned cables – replaced with fiber optic ones in the 1980s – contain more than 65 tons of toxic lead that is polluting the alpine lake on the California-Nevada line, the lawsuit said. In addition to violating water quality protections, the suit said the more than 3 pounds of lead per foot of cable constitutes solid waste regulated under the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Pac Bell knew the cables it owned and operated contained lead that eventually would leak into the 1,644-foot-deep lake, the lawsuit said. Lead in both solid and dissolved forms is listed as known to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity, it said. “All of the cables are damaged and discharging lead into Lake Tahoe,” the lawsuit said. Initial cost estimates for cable removal range from $275,000 to $550,000. But Pac Bell agreed to deposit $1.5 million in an account to guard against overruns, according to the settlement U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeremy Peterson signed Nov. 4.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLaconia: An economic impact study has found that Lake Winnipesaukee is worth more than $17 billion to the state’s economy – information that an environmental advocacy group hopes to use to underscore the need to protect the lake. The study was requested by the Lake Winnipesaukee Association and was written by the Policy Research Shop at Dartmouth College, The Laconia Daily Sun reports. The association commissioned the report in February, and the work was completed in June. “I think that’s an eye-opener,” Patricia Tarpey, executive director of the Lake Winnipesaukee Association, said of the valuation. The largest contributor to Winnipesaukee’s worth was property values, which totaled about $16 billion. Tourism revenue was worth about $249 million, and boating and fishing added more than $109 million. Tarpey said she hopes municipalities around the 72-square-mile lake can use the information in the report when making policy decisions to protect the water from pollution that can damage the ecosystem. “Any regulation that happens either comes at the federal, state or local level. We have no real authority as an association,” Tarpey said. “The best we can do is help educate policy decision makers to implement better measures to protect this lake.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: A police officer fatally struck a man walking on a highway shoulder, then drove around with the man’s body and visited his mother looking for advice, according to charges released Wednesday. Newark Officer Louis Santiago faces multiple charges in the death of 29-year-old Damian Dymka on Nov. 1, including vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of a crash resulting in death, desecrating or moving human remains, tampering with physical evidence, obstruction and official misconduct. Santiago’s mother, Annette Santiago, and Albert Guzman, a passenger in Louis Santiago’s car, were charged with desecrating human remains, hindering apprehension, and conspiracy to hinder apprehension and tamper with physical evidence. According to prosecutors, Santiago and Guzman, both 25, were driving on the Garden State Parkway when Santiago, who was off duty, hit Dymka. Instead of calling 911, the pair allegedly left the scene but returned and put Dymka in the car, then went to Annette Santiago’s house in Bloomfield to discuss what to do. They allegedly returned to the accident scene with Dymka, who worked as a nurse. According to the prosecutor’s office, Santiago’s father, a lieutenant in the Newark Police Department, called 911 to report the accident. Dymka had died by the time state police arrived.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state legislative complex will be open to the public during upcoming legislative sessions, but only for those who provide proof of vaccination. New rules will also prohibit performances, advocacy booths and tours at the New Mexico State Capitol starting Dec. 6, when the Legislature meets for redistricting. The rules will also be in place during the regular legislative session that starts in January, limiting festivities in the Roundhouse – the Capitol building that includes the Legislature and the governor’s office – but allowing the public to attend legislative hearings for the first time since the start of the pandemic. “Given the high number of COVID-19 cases across the state and the strain this continues to put on state resources, it is incumbent on us to protect everyone in the Capitol complex while conducting the state’s business,” said Legislative Council Service service director Raúl Burciaga, who oversees safety and operations at the building. The vaccination requirement does not apply to lawmakers. The Roundhouse has been open to the public for months, with a masking requirement but no vaccine requirement. It’s popular for visitors thanks to four floors of local art and its round shape, unique among U.S. state capitols.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A program to help people obtain driver’s permits during the COVID-19 pandemic by taking tests online may be rife with cheating. State motor vehicle workers told the Albany Times-Union that thousands of people may have taken advantage of the program instituted more than a year ago by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo as in-person testing was curtailed or became backlogged. Applicants sometimes have others take the tests for them and in other cases complete them with perfect scores in less than seven minutes, workers said. The 50-question test normally takes about 45 minutes to an hour, they said. In response, officials at seven state-run motor vehicle offices recently began keeping track of how many people who passed the online tests later had issues regarding images captured during the test. They found that over a four-day period, 464 out of more than 1,500 people who had passed the online test and came to a motor vehicle office to get their permit had verification issues. Of those, more than 50 people left rather than retake the test, and roughly half of the 410 who retook the test failed, according to the Times-Union. “They sit down for 20 questions, and they’re sitting there for 45 minutes, and they can’t finish the test,” Rensselaer County Clerk Frank Merola told the newspaper.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPittsboro: Tests conducted on the town’s water supply found more than double the amount of a potentially cancer-causing chemical that’s considered safe, officials said. Since Nov. 8, the town of Pittsboro has been performing almost-daily tests for 1,4-Dioxane after the city of Greensboro warned communities downstream of contamination in the Haw River, WRAL-TV reports. At first, town officials reduced the draw from the river in hopes that the contaminated water would flow by. Pittsboro Town Manager Chris Kennedy said it appeared the discharge had passed without making it into the town’s water treatment plant. He said while officials are confident the chemical has passed, there’s the possibility it hasn’t. The Environmental Protection Agency advises that drinking water contain no more than 35 micrograms per liter of 1,4-Dioxane. On Nov. 12, a raw grab from the Haw River at Pittsboro showed it was present at 9.8 micrograms per liter. But by Nov. 17, a similar test found 80.7 micrograms per liter. Even after water was treated at the town’s plant, it showed a level of 37.6, slightly higher than the EPA’s threshold. Kennedy said the town will “minimize” the amount of water it draws from the Haw River.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A North Dakota farmer has been accused of attempting to arrange the assassination of a Ukrainian official and has been detained in the Eastern European country. North Dakota’s congressional delegation has asked the U.S. Department of State to ensure the well-being of 50-year-old Kurt Groszhans, who grew up in the central part of North Dakota and attended North Dakota State University, KFGO-AM reports. He and a Ukrainian woman have been accused of trying to assassinate Roman Leschenko, that country’s agrarian policy and food minister. Groszhans had business dealings with the agriculture minister. His family told The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead that he is an honest agriculture investor who was “tangled up” in a dispute with Leschenko. U.S. Sen. John Hoeven said his office contacted the State Department after hearing from Groszhans’ family and friends.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Franklin County is seeking to settle a federal lawsuit over photographs taken of intimate tattoos of up to 682 female detainees. County commissioners on Tuesday agreed to the $2.5 million settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge. The class-action lawsuit was filed in 2013 on behalf of women who were arrested for minor offenses between May 23, 2011, and April 30, 2014. Photos were taken of their tattoos on or near their intimate body parts when they were booked into the county jail. The jail stopped the practice in April 2014. Each woman is estimated to receive $2,735 under the plan. A third of the settlement would cover attorney fees, costs and expenses. According to documents, the settlement does not include men, detainees charged with felonies or those who had tattoos photographed that were not in an intimate area. Under terms of the settlement, the county would admit no wrongdoing. The sheriff’s office would be required to destroy the photos and cease taking intimate tattoo pictures of misdemeanor detainees.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A federal judge on Tuesday denied a death row inmate’s request for a stay of execution, paving the way for him to receive a lethal injection next month. Bigler Stouffer II, 79, and his attorneys argued that the state’s current three-drug lethal injection protocol poses the risk of subjecting him to unconstitutional pain and suffering. Stouffer also said he should be included among other death row plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the state’s lethal injection protocols. That case is set to go to trial in February. Judge Stephen Friot on Tuesday rejected Stouffer’s request, denying his motion for a stay of execution. Stouffer’s attorney, Greg Laird, said he filed an appeal of the judge’s ruling with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. “It doesn’t appear from the evidence we heard that the state of Oklahoma has figured out how to execute people without some sort of incident, and it should stop,” Laird said after the hearing. Stouffer was convicted and sentenced to die for the 1985 killing of schoolteacher Linda Reaves in Oklahoma City. Stouffer could still avoid the death penalty if Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt agrees to grant him clemency, which the state’s Pardon and Parole Board recommended last week in a 3-2 vote, citing Oklahoma’s history of problematic lethal injections.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Residents are increasingly pushing for the state to divest from fossil fuel companies and other controversial investments, but the Oregon State Treasury is resisting and putting the onus on the Legislature. In addition to fossil fuel companies whose products are a main driver of global warming, the state employee retirement fund is also invested in a company whose spyware was used against human rights workers, journalists and other targets, as well as in companies that operate private prisons where detained immigrants were mistreated and some died. The Oregon State Treasury oversees some $130 billion in investments, including an undisclosed amount in fossil fuel companies and other controversial sectors. Oregon State Treasurer Tobias Read wouldn’t be pinned down on the amount, despite repeated direct questions by Oregon Public Radio. “It’s not just public equities. It’s also private equity; it’s also bonds,” said Read, a Democrat who’s running for governor in the 2022 election. In a letter to House Speaker Tina Kotek and Senate President Peter Courtney, Read and fellow members of the Oregon Investment Council said they can’t pursue divestment because state law specifies investments must “make the moneys as productive as possible.” They said it’s up to the Legislature to change the laws and warned that lawmakers might need to dig into the state’s general funds to cover any losses from divesting.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The Mummers Parade will be back on the city’s streets for the new year. The parade, which draws thousands to Philadelphia on New Year’s Day, will return for 2022 after it was canceled last year amid COVID-19 concerns. The event will be free but could be scaled down since the bands and organizations involved have been affected financially, organizers said. More than 10,000 costumed Mummers, complete with bright colors, sequins and feathers, are still expected to march or strut City Hall south on Broad Street to Washington Avenue. The parade kicks off at 9 a.m. and is expected to run through 6 p.m. The beloved tradition comes back after controversy – and Mayor Jim Kenney – threatened to cancel it in 2020 after some Mummers dressed in blackface. Organizers said all participants must take sensitivity training centered on bias and awareness training.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The city manager is standing by the police department’s review of the 1966 death of an employee of wealthy heiress Doris Duke that found there is no new information that would change the result of the original investigation, which determined it was an accident. Police opened the review into the death of Eduardo Tirella in July after a witness who had never before talked to police came forward after reading the book “Homicide at Rough Point” by Peter Lance. The author and journalist who grew up in Newport suggested Duke, who died in 1993, acted with intent when she struck Tirella with a car at her mansion. That witness, Bob Walker, 68, was at the time a 13-year-old paperboy who was first upon the scene, and his account differed from official versions of what happened. But while Detective Jacque Wuest, who conducted the review, found Walker to be “credible,” she concluded in a statement to Lance last week: “There is no new evidence that would change the previous conclusion in this matter, nor is there any new evidence that warrants further review.” The statement Tuesday from the office of City Manager Joseph Nicholson Jr. stood by the police, saying that “at this time we cannot ascribe any definitive motive or intent to Ms. Duke.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A coalition including legislators, pastors and union leaders is asking a tire manufacturer to improve conditions at its production facilities in the state, including allowing workers to unionize. A group describing itself as “concerned community members, human rights advocates, clergy, elected officials, political activists, labor union leaders, and educators who are committed to raising standards” planned to deliver a letter Tuesday to Phang Wai Yeen, CEO of Giti Tire Manufacturing Ltd. “Workers have reported mandatory overtime, unpredictable schedules, low wages and the inability to have time off to spend with their family without retaliation,” according to the letter. In 2014, Giti officials announced to much fanfare that they would build the Singapore-based company’s first U.S. plant in Richburg, about 50 miles north of Columbia, starting production three years later and expecting to make several million tires a year when fully operational. The announcement was the culmination of an effort to make South Carolina the nation’s chief tire manufacturer, with other tire makers in the state including Michelin, Bridgestone, Continental and Trelleborg.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a lower court’s ruling that nullified a voter-passed amendment to the state constitution that would have legalized recreational marijuana use. Gov. Kristi Noem instigated the legal fight to strike down the amendment passed by voters in November. Though the Republican governor opposed marijuana legalization as a social ill, her administration’s arguments in court centered on technical violations to the South Dakota Constitution. The high court sided with those arguments in a 4-1 decision, ruling that the measure – Amendment A – would have violated the requirement that constitutional amendments deal with just one subject. “It is clear that Amendment A contains provisions embracing at least three separate subjects, each with distinct objects or purposes,” Chief Justice Steven Jensen wrote in the majority opinion, which found recreational marijuana, medical marijuana and hemp each to be separate issues. About 54% of voters approved the constitutional amendment last year. But Highway Patrol Superintendent Col. Rick Miller sued on Noem’s behalf. Pennington County Sheriff Kevin Thom also joined the lawsuit. The high court ruled that the law enforcement officers did not have standing to sue, but because Noem ordered Miller’s suit, they treated it as if Noem brought the lawsuit herself.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Regulators have given approval to a plan by the Tennessee Valley Authority to bury toxin-laden coal ash in southeast Memphis. The federal utility received final approval from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation last week, a spokeswoman for the state agency said Tuesday. TVA plans to have a contractor remove tons of coal ash from ponds in southwest Memphis, transport them along Shelby Drive to a landfill, and bury the material in lined pits to prevent leaching into the ground. The ash has been stored in two unlined ponds near the old Allen Fossil Plant above the Memphis Sand aquifer, the region’s drinking water supply, for years. In 2017, high levels of arsenic, lead and fluoride were found in monitoring wells at Allen, sparking fears that the aquifer that supplies Memphis’ drinking water could become tainted. Testing has since deemed the public water supply unaffected. But a report released by the utility also showed a connection between the shallow aquifer where toxins were found and the deeper Memphis Sand Aquifer that provides the city’s slightly sweet-tasting drinking water.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Samsung said it plans to build a $17 billion semiconductor factory outside the city amid a global shortage of chips used in phones, cars and other electronic devices. “This is the largest foreign direct investment in the state of Texas, ever,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in announcing the project Tuesday. Samsung said it will start building the plant next year and hopes to begin operations in the second half of 2024. The South Korean electronics giant chose the site based on a number of factors, including government incentives and the “readiness and stability” of local infrastructure, said Samsung Vice Chairman Kinam Kim, speaking alongside the Republican governor. The chip shortage has emerged as both a business obstacle and a serious U.S. national security concern. Short supplies of semiconductors kicked off by COVID-era shutdowns have hampered production of new vehicles and electronic devices for more than a year. New questions of economic and national security are also at stake, since many U.S. companies are dependent on chips produced overseas, particularly in Taiwan, which China has long claimed as its own territory. Samsung said it expects to spend $17 billion on the Texas project, which will make it the company’s largest investment in the U.S.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State Attorney General Sean Reyes has tested positive for the coronavirus. Reyes is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 but tested positive for the virus last week after suffering cold symptoms, his office said in a statement Monday. His family has tested negative. The Republican is involved in numerous lawsuits challenging COVID-19 vaccine mandates imposed by the federal government, arguing that vaccination should be a personal choice, Fox13 reports. His office also is defending in court a law that severely restricts local school districts from imposing mask mandates. Utah House Majority Leader Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, also confirmed he had tested positive last week. As of Nov. 19, 582,929 Utahns had tested positive for the virus, and 3,428 had died of COVID-19. About 1.7 million were considered fully vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as Utah’s Department of Health, have recommended booster shots to reduce the risk of a breakthrough infection.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has seen the nation’s highest percentage-point increase in drug overdose deaths during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vermont’s overdose deaths for the 12 months ending in April 2021 went up by nearly 70% from the previous 12 months, from 123 deaths to 209, according to the CDC’s monthly national overdose death report. Nationally, overdose deaths increased by 27.2% from the previous year. Fentanyl was involved in 88% of the overdose deaths in Vermont in 2020, while cocaine was recorded as the reason for 37% of deaths. According to the Vermont Department of Health, most opioid deaths happen when it those drugs are mixed with another substance like methamphetamine. In 2021, health officials found that opioid deaths involving meth more than doubled from 2020. The state’s opioid report said throughout this year to August, 129 overdose deaths were recorded. In 2020, there were 157 overdose deaths from opioids.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: The National Park Service announced Tuesday that it has awarded the largest single grant in the history of its American Battlefield Protection Program to help preserve one of the nation’s lesser-known Civil War battlefields. The $4.6 million grant will be used to purchase and preserve 250 acres of the Williamsburg Battlefield in York County, which has sat on private land outside the city and former colonial capital. The battle was part of what’s known as the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, in which Union forces tried to capture Richmond from the southeast. Fighting began after enslaved Americans provided vital intelligence to the Union Army about unoccupied Confederate entrenchments. There were 72,000 troops engaged in the battle, which ended with 3,800 killed, wounded or captured, said Jim Campi, chief policy and communications officer with the American Battlefield Trust. The nonprofit is partnering with Virginia’s Departments of Conservation and Recreation and Historic Resources to preserve the battlefield. “It was fought in the mud and rain – it was a messy struggle,” Campi said. He said the Peninsula Campaign was an opportunity for Union forces to “catch and swallow a considerable amount of the retreating Confederate Army.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A handful of Republican state lawmakers and others are suing Democratic leaders and a House official over a plan that allows a limited number of lawmakers vaccinated against COVID-19 on the chamber floor during the upcoming legislative session. The new plan released by House officials last week also requires representatives who don’t verify their vaccination status to undergo coronavirus testing three times a week in order to work in their on-campus offices. And it requires members of the public to show proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours in order to sit in the House gallery that overlooks the lawmakers as they work. The Seattle Times repors the lawsuit was filed Monday in Thurston County Superior Court by Reps. Jim Walsh, Robert Sutherland, Jenny Graham, Rob Chase, Bob McCaslin and Jesse Young, plus citizens from their districts who say they are affected by the restrictions on their representatives. “The Plans appear to be an underhanded method used by a few tyrannical members to impose Governor Inslee’s mandate on a legislative body specifically exempt from the mandate,” the complaint says, referring to the governor’s vaccine mandate for executive branch employees. Democratic House Speaker Laurie Jinkins said the lawsuit is without merit.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A pair of large Christmas trees will go on display outside the state Capitol. Michael Buchanan, of the Kanawha County community of Hansford, donated a 40-foot blue spruce for display at the Lincoln Plaza on the south side of the Capitol in Charleston, the Department of Administration said in a news release. The tree was donated in honor of his late daughter, Andrea, who died in 2009 at age 17, the statement said. Buchanan planted the tree with his daughter and her mother about 25 years ago at their residence after the state treasurer’s office worker received it from the Division of Forestry as part of an employee appreciation week. The tree has always been known as Andrea’s Tree, the statement said. Helen Herring, of Elkview, donated a 20-foot Frasier fir for display on the Capitol’s north plaza. Herring also donated a previous tree for the Capitol grounds holiday display in 2010. Both trees will be on display during the upcoming Joyful Night celebration with Gov. Jim Justice and first lady Cathy Justice. The event will be held virtually for the second straight year due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Michael Gableman, a former state Supreme Court justice who has long been active in GOP politics, met with a host of election conspiracy theorists this fall as part of his taxpayer-funded review of the 2020 presidential contest for Assembly Republicans. Among those with whom Gableman met were Peter Bernegger, a felon convicted of fraud who has been using open records laws to gather images of Wisconsin ballots, according to Nate Cain, a West Virginia consultant who has assisted Gableman. Gableman and his team last month also met with Shiva Ayyadurai, who has contended without evidence that votes were taken away from Donald Trump based on a science fiction novel; Mike Lindell, the MyPillow executive who has spent a year making over-the-top false claims that the election was hacked by the Chinese; and Douglas Frank, the chairman of the math and science department at an Ohio school who has falsely asserted that votes in Michigan were manipulated with a mathematical “key.” Gableman, who last year without evidence claimed the election was stolen, has insisted he has no preconceived ideas about his review and hopes to find that the election was run properly. Assembly Republicans hired Gableman at taxpayer expense this summer to conduct his own review of the election.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Dozens of sites across the Equality State could be in for upheaval following a federal move to remove derogatory terms from place names, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The word “squaw,” which has a history of being used as a negative descriptor for Native American women, is in the names of 43 federal locations in Wyoming, including two small mountain peaks that have already been the target of a name-change campaign and a creek in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, according to the newspaper, which cited the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/04/30/coming-byu-chaos-woodstock-manatee-called-bananatee-news-around-states/39421953/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The city is considering mobile grocery stores to fill a gap in residential areas where healthy food options aren’t available. WBRC-TV reports that the Community Food Bank of Central Alabama already operates a truck that sells fruit, fresh vegetables and dairy products in so-called food deserts. City leaders are considering a plan to expand such offerings as part of an initiative by Mayor Randall Woodfin. Mobile stores wouldn’t be allowed on vacant lots, and they couldn’t operate within 1,000 feet of stores that sell similar food items. They could set up shop in commercial area and neighborhoods. The city says about 70% of residents live in areas that don’t have stores offering healthy food. The problem is getting worse with store closings in recent years.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A minister is leading an effort to help an impoverished Native village create a new economy with the plentiful supply of reindeer that roam its island home. John Honan sees great potential for establishing a small commercial reindeer processing plant for residents of Saint George, home to 60 people and an estimated 350 reindeer. Honan is a Protestant pastor who runs an emergency housing ministry on another island. He has launched a donation drive for equipment. He’s also set up a relief fund for the tiny Aleut community. Donations so far include a portable band saw, a table saw, two sets of butchering knives and $730 to go toward a refrigerated shipping container to serve as the plant building. Saint George Mayor Pat Pletnikoff envisions creating three or four jobs.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A collection of photos taken in the Four Corners region by a prominent Arizona ranching family during the late 19th and early 20th centuries is being called a snapshot of history. The State of Arizona Research Library says the selection of images from the Wetherill family’s collection can be viewed online as part of the Arizona Memory Project. Curatorial Specialist Jannelle Weakly says the Wetherills were ranchers, traders, explorers, and amateur archaeologists who participated in the discovery, excavation, research and preservation of significant sites in the Four Corners area. The collection holds images from John Wetherill’s travels to Rainbow Bridge, Monument Valley and Mesa Verde, as well as photos Wetherill took of American Indians, including notable Navajo leaders Hosteen Luca and Wolfkiller.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: A statue topped by a Confederate soldier is to be moved from the grounds of the Jefferson County Courthouse to a nearby Confederate cemetery. County Judge Gerald Robinson told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy has agreed to move the monument to Camp White Sulphur Springs Cemetery. DeeLois Lawrence of the David O. Dodd Chapter of the organization, which owns both the statue and the cemetery, said if the statue is causing controversy because of its location, the group wants it on its private property. The 20-foot tall statue was erected in 1910 on the grounds of Pine Bluff High School and was moved to the courthouse lawn in 1974. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCathedral City: Palm Springs Mayor Robert Moon served in the U.S. Navy for 26 years. He remained silent about his sexual orientation for his entire service, including after he married his husband. When he deployed to sea, Moon recalled, he and husband Bob Hammack had to conceal their relationship in the letters they sent back and forth across the world. “We couldn’t write anything personal, because someone could read those letters,” Moon said. “We could only say, ‘How’s the cat? How’s the dog?’ If someone saw a letter and read it, I could be thrown out.” Moon shared this story Saturday morning, during a ceremony to designate the LGBTQ Veterans Memorial at the Desert Memorial Park cemetery in Cathedral City as an official state memorial. California is now the first state in the nation to have an official memorial honoring gay veterans. Moon called the designation “very personal.”\n\nColorado\n\nAspen: The U.S. Forest Service says the popular Maroon Bells Scenic Area in western Colorado will not open as scheduled May 15 because of avalanche debris that must be removed from the access road. The Aspen Times reports that the Aspen-Sopris Ranger District is tentatively setting the opening for June 15 after consulting last week with Pitkin County public works officials. Maroon Creek Road has been covered by numerous slides in the 7 miles between T-Lazy-7 Ranch and Maroon Lake. The road is covered with snow several feet deep as well as tree trunks. Sixteen couples planning weddings in view of the Maroon Bells between Memorial Day Weekend and June 14 have been notified that they have to change their plans.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Nursing home owners and their employees are keeping a close eye on the General Assembly to see if lawmakers agree to spend more money on Medicaid-related health services. The Appropriations Committee is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a spending plan that will ultimately become part of a two-year budget compromise with Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont. More than 2,400 workers at 20 facilities had planned to walk off the job May 1 if they don’t receive pay raises. But the members of SEIU 1199 New England announced last Thursday that they’ve temporarily rescinded those strike notices for Wednesday. Matthew Barrett, the head of an association that represents nursing homes, says operators had been encouraging all parties to remain at the bargaining table.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A traveling memorial dedicated to the thousands of men and women who died while fighting in the War on Terror launched after 9/11 will be in the state from Sept.27 to Oct.2. Organizers are encouraging anyone with loved ones killed in the conflict to submit their names, along with two photos, as soon as possible so they can be listed on one of several “tribute towers” when it visits. “To ensure your loved one is added, do it now,” says Evonne Williams, part of the husband-and-wife duo behind the “Remembering Our Fallen” memorial. Its visit to Delaware coincides with Vet Fest 2019, which will be held in Whitehall on Sept. 28. If you would like your loved one to be included in the memorial, fill out the form online.

The Washington Post reports about 10 men marched into the Politics and Prose bookstore Saturday while Jonathan M. Metzl discussed “Dying of Whiteness: How the Politics of Racial Resentment is Killing America’s Heartland.” Metzl is the director of the Center for Medicine, Health, and Society at Vanderbilt University. His book discusses how some lower- and middle-class white Americans support politicians whose policies place those classes at greater risk of illness and death. Store co-owner Bradley Graham says the unusual interruption is a sign of the times. Metzl says he had just mentioned Nazis when “the Nazis walked into the talk.”\n\nFlorida\n\nProspect Bluff: Two hundred years ago, a post overlooking the Apalachicola River housed what historians say was the largest community of freed slaves in North America at the time. Now Hurricane Michael has given archaeologists an unprecedented opportunity to study its story, a significant tale of black resistance that ended in bloodshed. The Negro Fort site, also known as Fort Gadsden, sits in the Apalachicola National Forest near the hamlet of Sumatra. Managed by the U.S. Forest Service, the site has been preserved as a National Historic Landmark and park and thus was never excavated for artifacts, except in 1963 by Florida State University, mainly to identify structural remains. October’s Category 5 hurricane caused extensive damage to the site, toppling about 100 trees. Under the massive roots, archaeologists began this month to dig and sift through the soil.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Agencies in DeKalb County are collecting new and gently used children’s shoes as donations to raise awareness about child abuse. All styles and sizes are welcome. The donation drive, running through May 10, is organized by the DeKalb County District Attorney’s Office in commemoration of National Child Abuse Prevention Month, recognized each April. Any shoes collected will go to the DeKalb County Division of Family and Children Services to help the children the agency serves. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the county prosecutor’s office is partnering with the county’s Department of Recreation, Parks and Cultural Affairs to use several recreation centers as drop-off locations. Three of the centers are in Decatur, two each in Lithonia and Scottdale, and one in Atlanta.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Officials have found high levels of a chemical that’s found in sunscreen and believed to harm coral reefs in bay waters off Hawaii’s Big Island. West Hawaii Today reports the Kahaluu Bay Education Center last year commissioned testing for oxybenzone at five sites in the bay on the island’s west side. The recently returned results found the chemical’s concentration to be 262 times greater than levels considered high-risk by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Haereticus Environmental Laboratory executive director Craig Downs says one of the samples had the highest concentration “ever measured in the world.” The Legislature last year enacted a law banning sunscreens that contain oxybenzone and octinoxate, aiming to protect the state’s reefs. The ban takes effect in 2021.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Land management officials have put together a new online map so hikers, campers and other outdoor enthusiasts can know when and where to expect prescribed burns. Boise State Public Radio reports national forests in the state along with the Bureau of Land Management and the Idaho Department of Lands put together the maps for prescribed burns happening through July on the Southwest Idaho Interagency Prescribed Fire website. The goal of prescribed burns is to reduce fuels on the ground, create fire-resilient trees, and help protect people and timber from severe wildland fires. Agencies typically post caution signs with closures and a map of where they plan to burn along trailheads and roads leading to the locations. But the interactive website will allow recreationists to check for prescribed burns before they head out to the wilderness.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Nat King Cole’s brother will be part of a tribute to the late singer at this year’s Chicago Jazz Festival. The free fest is planned for Aug. 23 to Sept. 1 at the lakefront Millennium Park, the Chicago Cultural Center and other venues throughout the city. Freddy Cole is scheduled to honor his older brother’s legacy Aug. 29 at Millennium Park’s Pritzker Pavilion. The famed baritone would have celebrated his 100th birthday this year. Cole is known for songs like “Unforgettable” and “Mona Lisa.” This year’s festival also will include performances from Roscoe Mitchell, Cecile McLorin Salvant, Eddie Palmieri, and George Freeman and Billy Branch. The Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events hosts the event.\n\nIndiana\n\nGoshen: A 17-year-old who passed his college admissions test at age 11 has become the youngest known graduate of Goshen College. Mikol Aspinwall graduated Sunday from the Christian liberal arts college with a computer science degree. The Phoenix native lived with his mother in Goshen during his four years at college, but some of his college friends didn’t know how young he was. The South Bend Tribune reports that Aspinwall began high school at age 9 at an Arizona State University academy for gifted and talented students. Goshen College communications professor Duane Stoltzfus says Aspinwall is memorable for his eloquence and modesty, calling him “somebody who is just very humble about his accomplishments.” Aspinwall is now chasing his dream of attending graduate school at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nIowa\n\nBellevue: Officials are trying to stop the spread of gypsy moths in eastern Iowa’s Jackson County. The Telegraph Herald reports that the state conducted aerial treatments of land west of Bellevue earlier this month. The gypsy moth has spread slowly west from Massachusetts since the 1870s. It’s an invasive species that can cause extensive deforestation as its larvae eat leaves, particularly oak leaves. Mike Kintner, gypsy moth outreach and regulatory coordinator for Iowa, says last year’s treatment reduced the number of gypsy moths, “but we noted that there was movement northward. This year we’re trying to stop that spread.”\n\nKansas\n\nPittsburg: Pittsburg State University students are experimenting with developing a sustainable food production system that can grow plants without soil while also raising fish. The Joplin Globe reports that the group is working with the university’s biology department and Enactus, a nonprofit that encourages entrepreneurship. Hydroponics is growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions in water. The students say they’re growing arugula, red kale, romaine, collard greens and butter lettuce in a garden built from PVC pipes. The rooftop greenhouse plants are covered with mosquito netting to diffuse sunlight. Enactus donated to the project a hydroponic prototype that was also used to establish a hydroponics operation at a Haitian orphanage. Fish will soon arrive, and their waste will provide nutrients for the plants.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A postsecondary education council says the state is on track to reach its educational attainment goal of 60% of the working-age population having a certificate or degree by 2030. The update comes from the release of Kentucky’s Council on Postsecondary Education’s annual progress report on educational achievement rates, which says the total number of undergraduate degrees and credentials conferred increased 2.9% in 2017-18 over the prior year. That beats the 1.7% average annual increase needed to stay on track toward the long-range goal. The increase includes public and independent institutions. The report shows undergraduate degrees and credentials increased 2.6% at public universities and at the Kentucky Community and Technical College System.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Veteran actress Regina Hall has been tapped to address graduates of Dillard University next month. Hall will be the 2019 speaker for commencement ceremonies scheduled at 8 a.m. May 11 on the campus’ historic Avenue of the Oaks. Hall holds an English degree from Fordham University and a master’s degree in journalism from New York University’s Arthur L. Cater Journalism Institute. But after her father died, she decided to pursue goals that “aligned with her spirit” and began landing acting roles for commercials and on prime-time television. Her work includes “The Best Man,” “Girls Trip” and a comedy out now, “Little,” which also stars Issa Rae (“Insecure”) and Marsai Martin (“Black-ish”). Dillard President Dr. Walter M. Kimbrough says Hall “definitely has a message for our graduates.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The administration of Gov. Janet Mills is ending the use of photos on food benefits cards, saying there is no evidence such efforts cut down on fraud. The Democrat’s administration said Friday that the state is ending the policy immediately. Republican former Gov. Paul LePage’s administration in 2014 began allowing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients to have photos placed on electronic benefits cards. Mills’ administration says federal officials have warned Maine that it doesn’t adequately inform participants that the program is voluntary. The administration says some households have been wrongly denied grocery purchases because they weren’t pictured on EBT cards. Participants who currently have photo EBT cards may continue to use them.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: About 300,000 people a year are infected with Lyme disease through tick bites, and for up to 20% of them the condition persists after a course of antibiotics. But just in time for tick season, Johns Hopkins University researchers are now onto a promising treatment for those sufferers, The Baltimore Sun reports. It would be the first specific treatment for those who contend with such symptoms as fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and brain fog, sometimes severe. Researchers from the Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health have had success in mice with a three-drug combination – daptomycin, doxycycline and ceftriaxone – to treat what is now called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. The new study was published in the March 28 journal Discovery Medicine.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Roman Catholics in the area will have a rare chance to worship before the literal heart of a saint. The 150-year-old “incorruptible heart” of Saint Jean Vianney will be displayed starting Tuesday at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, the Boston Archdiocese’s mother church. It also will be on view this week in Braintree, Walpole and Salem. The relic is passing through New England as part of a nationwide tour sponsored by the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternity. It’s been displayed at churches in New York, Rhode Island and Maine and will also visit Connecticut and other states. Vianney was a French priest in the 1800s famous for spending hours hearing people’s confessions. He was canonized in 1925 and is considered the patron saint of parish priests.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Science Gallery Detroit is getting ready to open a new exhibition in partnership with the Michigan Science Center. The gallery’s second exhibition is titled “DEPTH” and runs June 8-Aug. 17 at the science center. “DEPTH” will explore water’s intense power while also showcasing the beauty and life it brings. It invites visitors to contemplate the future of mankind in relation to water. Last year, a multimedia exhibition titled “HUSTLE “ that explored struggle, survival and success attracted more than 10,000 visitors. It was the gallery’s inaugural exhibition. Science Gallery Detroit, developed with Michigan State University and Science Gallery International, was billed the first venue of its kind in the Americas.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBelle Plaine: The Satanic Temple is suing the city for withdrawing permission for a satanic monument two years ago. Satanic Temple co-founder Malcolm Jarry told the Star Tribune that people have a right to protest the proposed monument but not at the expense of the group’s civil rights. The predicament in which the city of Belle Plaine finds itself began in 2017 when officials decided to allow a steel silhouette of a soldier praying over a grave marked with a cross at a veterans’ memorial park. The Satanic Temple wanted its own monument in the park in an area the city designated as a “public forum” after complaints that the soldiers’ monument violated the separation of church and state. Officials shut down the public forum area altogether when complaints followed over the proposed satanic monument.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A car museum’s four-wheeled stock was auctioned off for $8.6 million over the weekend, with a 1948 Tucker bringing $1.8 million. The Tupelo Automobile Museum’s signs and other “automobilia” brought in $428,000 a day earlier. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports that designer Preston Tucker’s grandsons were present as Tucker No. 1028 was gaveled down Saturday. Mike Tucker says it was an original Indianapolis test car. It went to Tim Stentiford, representing the Maine Classic Car Museum in Arundel. He says that museum is set to open in June and has set aside a room for the Tucker – one of 51 ever made. The Tupelo museum’s owner, Jane Spain, has said she’ll use auction proceeds to pay off a loan used to build the museum and to start an education foundation.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: When Kansas City officials voted in January to rename a major boulevard after Martin Luther King Jr., it appeared the city had finally joined more than 950 across the U.S. with streets or public buildings honoring the civil rights icon. Then a grassroots group of volunteers started collecting signatures asking that the renaming of the boulevard known as The Paseo be placed on the ballot this year. On Friday, they turned in petitions with 2,857 signatures. The group wants to retain the 10-mile street’s historic name and find some other way to honor King. The mostly black leaders of the effort to rename The Paseo say it would be embarrassing for Kansas City to remove King’s name, especially after waiting more than 50 years to honor him.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Native American students graduating from Great Falls College MSU will be honored at an eagle feather ceremony Saturday morning, when they will be presented with an eagle feather. This will be the first time GFC MSU has held this ceremony for Native American students. The students will carry their eagle feather with them at commencement later that day and keep it as a reminder of their scholarly accomplishment. The feathers, which will be blessed and beaded, will be handed out by an elder. The meaning of the feather will be shared, and stories from the ceremony will be told. “The significance of receiving an eagle feather is one of the most powerful honors that an indigenous person can receive,” says Dugan Coburn, College Pathways Advisor.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Doctors, nurses and other health care workers connected with a medical school in Omaha may have found making music with their orchestra to be the best medicine for easing their stress and meeting work challenges. The Nebraska Medical Orchestra was formed last year and rehearses for a couple of hours each week under the direction of Matthew Brooks, director of orchestras at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. The 55-member ensemble already has given concerts, performing works by such composers as Mozart and Bach. Dr. Steven Wengel, a psychiatrist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and assistant vice chancellor of campus wellness for both universities, told the Omaha World-Herald a study shows that medical students exposed to the humanities have much lower burnout rates and score higher on measures of empathy and wisdom.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: People will soon be able to track aerial drones flying within about 5 miles of downtown, as the Nevada Institute for Autonomous Safety, a state-funded group seeking to upgrade drone infrastructure, has landed an agreement to test drone-tracking hardware and software in the urban environment. The program, which includes the city, state and federal governments and drone manufacturer DJI, is part of a broader, Nevada-based effort to serve as a testing ground for drone technology. “This is going to be the foundation of what the future of unmanned traffic management looks like,” says David Hansell, public policy manager for DJI.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Hike Safe cards are available for hikers, climbers, kayakers, mountain bikers and other outdoor enthusiasts in the Granite State. The card sales help ensure that New Hampshire Fish and Game conservation officers, trained in wilderness rescue, are ready to come to a person’s aid if the unexpected happens. Last year, they conducted 148 search-and-rescue missions. The card exempts holders from certain liability for repaying search-and-rescue costs. Hike Safe cards for 2019 cost $25 for an individual or $35 for a family. They are valid for the calendar year ending Dec. 31, 2019. The price is the same for residents and nonresidents. Revenue goes to the Search and Rescue Fund. Last year, 5,311 cards were sold, generating $134,349.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRed Bank: Early civil rights leader T. Thomas Fortune’s house has been saved from the ravages of time and neglect. The home will now “stand and educate people” as a cultural center, builder Roger Mumford says. Mumford, of Roger Mumford Homes, restored the property that Fortune called home from 1901 to 1911. The center will make its public debut this Thursday and Friday as a new addition, destination and stop along the Weekend in Old Monmouth historic tour. Fortune was born into slavery in 1856 in Florida. He moved to New York City in the late 1870s and became co-founder and editor of The New York Age, the nation’s leading African American newspaper. At Maple Hall, his Red Bank home, Fortune and wife Carrie entertained many of the most influential African American leaders of the day, including Booker T. Washington.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The move to legalize the production of hemp has investors in the state racing to get a piece of what could be a multibillion-dollar industry. Business leaders are hurrying to capture part of what cannabis market research firm New Frontier Data estimates will become a $2.6 billion industry nationwide by 2022, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate and businessman Jeff Apodaca is among those looking into getting involved in the hemp industry. “Pretty soon, when you talk about New Mexico, you’ll be talking about green chile, pecans and hemp,” Apodaca says. He and others describe the state’s burgeoning hemp sector as a “gold rush,” one that is attracting investors with varying degrees of sophistication.\n\nNew York\n\nWatkins Glen: Woodstock 50 is proving to be as chaotic as the original festival in 1969. A financial investor announced Monday that it was pulling its funding from the anniversary event, set to take place Aug. 16-18 in Watkins Glen. “Despite our tremendous investment of time, effort and commitment, we don’t believe the production of the festival can be executed as an event worthy of the Woodstock Brand name while also ensuring the health and safety of the artists, partners and attendees,” Dentsu Aegis Network’s Amplifi Live said in a statement. Representatives for Woodstock 50 or Michael Lang, who co-founded the festival, didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Tickets were originally supposed to go on sale last week but were postponed, and a sale date still has not been announced.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMarion: More than 50 firefighters, including a hot shot crew, were battling a wildfire Monday that started Saturday in the Linville Gorge Wilderness Area on the U.S. Forest Service Grandfather Ranger District in Burke County, forcing closure of popular hiking trails in the area. The 5-acre Brushy Ridge fire is in a remote area near the Linville River at the end of the Brushy Ridge Trail on the northeast side of the Linville Gorge. The suspected cause of the fire is an abandoned campfire, says U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Lisa Jennings. She says firefighters hiked in Saturday night to assess the fire, in a remote, hard-to-reach location, 2.5 miles down into the gorge.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: Minot State University is facing some challenges maintaining the air dome over its stadium as the facility wraps up its second season. The Minot Daily News reports that operators are struggling with the winter upkeep of the nearly $2 million bubble. Minot State Athletics Director Andy Carter says any substantial snowfall creates issues for the 86,000-square-foot bubble over Herb Parker Stadium. He says if the snow melts and hardens, it could tear the fabric and collapse the inflatable dome. Carter says crews need to monitor the dome around the clock and clear snow from its base to ensure the bubble remains operational. The university is also figuring out how to create a concession area or accommodate those who want to bring their dogs to the space.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Two orphan manatees rescued in Florida have been moved to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium for rehabilitation. The zoo says the male calves began their rehabilitation at the Miami Seaquarium, arrived in Ohio last week and eventually will be returned to Florida waters. The larger of the two, named Bananatee, is 225 pounds. He was found in the Indian Creek waterway near Miami last July. The zoo says the other calf, 185-pound Tostone, was rescued in February from the Lake Worth Lagoon in Riviera Beach and showed signs of cold stress. The Columbus Zoo has been part of a manatee rehabilitation partnership for 20 years. It currently has three other manatees in its care.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTishomingo: Country music star Blake Shelton’s restaurant and bar in southern Oklahoma has planned some star-studded benefit performances for the grand opening of a new music hall and events venue next month. The Doghouse at Ole Red Tishomingo will open over the Memorial Day weekend with performances by Shelton, an Oklahoma native, and fellow country music artist Luke Bryan. Ticket sales will benefit the Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Foundation. The Doghouse will be an expansion of the downtown Tishomingo venue that was inspired by Shelton’s irreverent chart hit “Ol’ Red.” Shelton acquired the property in 2016 following his divorce from his ex-wife, country-music star Miranda Lambert, who had operated retail and bed-and-breakfast establishments in Tishomingo.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state Senate is moving forward with a plan to limit the supply of recreational, legal marijuana. Lawmakers voted 18-10 Monday to freeze marijuana productions at current levels for the next two years. The state will not issue new production licenses to marijuana growers, but current growers will be able to renew their licenses. Democrat Sen. Michael Dembrow from Portland said the state produces so much marijuana that Oregon has enough of the drug to last it for the next six and a half years. That surplus has caused prices to plummet. Lawmakers shot down another version of this bill earlier this month. Republicans said at the time that the marijuana industry should be regulated by the free market, not the state. The measure now goes to the House for consideration.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The Philadelphia Museum of Art will be loaning works to eight museums across the state under a new program designed to broaden public access to art. The museum announced the program Monday in the state Capitol, saying the eight participating museums have selected works they’ll be loaned during the project’s first phase. The participants are the Allentown Art Museum, the Demuth Foundation in Lancaster, the Erie Art Museum, the James A. Michener Art Museum in Doylestown, the Palmer Museum of Art at Penn State, the Reading Public Museum, the Trout Gallery in Carlisle and the Westmoreland Museum of American Art in Greensburg. The Philadelphia Museum of Art is undertaking the art-collection sharing partnership with Art Bridges and the Terra Foundation of American Art.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBurrillville: Gov. Gina Raimondo calls a resolution passed by the town in response to her gun control proposals inappropriate. Burrillville declared itself a “Second Amendment sanctuary” last week and passed a resolution stating it supports the police department’s right to exercise sound discretion when enforcing Second Amendment-related laws. Raimondo told WPRO-AM on Monday that if new gun laws pass, she expects Burrillville to follow them. The Democrat says if town officials disagree with her, they should lobby lawmakers – but “to secede from … our laws is not an appropriate response.” Councilman Jeremy Bailey said the town doesn’t intend to enforce new laws it deems unconstitutional. Burrillville’s neighbor Glocester will consider a similar measure at a May 16 town council meeting.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: Biologists say the sea turtle season in the state has gotten an early start and a visit from a type of turtle seen less than once a decade. The Department of Natural Resources says the first loggerhead turtle nest of the season was found Friday by volunteers on Kiawah Island. Agency biologist Michelle Pate says that is the earliest she can remember a turtle sighting. Sea turtle season starts May 1. But Pate says the warm winter has turtles active sooner than normal. Also on Friday, the wildlife agency says an endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle was found nesting on Hilton Head Island. That species of turtle has been found on a South Carolina beach just four times since the 1970s.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBuffalo: Environmental regulators are trying to figure out how to plug portions of 40 orphaned natural gas wells belonging to a company the state has already fined $15.5 million for abandoning them. Houston-based Spyglass Cedar Creek drilled the wells in 2006 near Buffalo, but the work fell idle as the company’s prospects disintegrated amid lawsuits, a lender’s bankruptcy and falling natural gas prices. The South Dakota Board of Minerals and Environment revoked the company’s permits in January, and state officials estimate it will cost $887,700 to plug the wells. The Rapid City Journal reports getting money from the Houston company could prove challenging because Spyglass was unable to post $200,000 earlier this year to keep its permits.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A baby giraffe at the Memphis Zoo has undergone surgery for a fractured leg and is now recovering at home. Zoo officials say zookeepers noticed the female giraffe named Ali limping early this month. Keepers then noticed that Ali’s mother wasn’t providing an appropriate amount of care. Ali was separated from her mother, and veterinarians diagnosed her with a fractured right leg. She underwent a two-hour surgery in Lexington to outfit her leg with stainless steel plates and 21 bone screws. She made her way back to the zoo last week. The zoo’s curator of large animals, Courtney Janney, says Ali still is considered to be in critical condition and is being monitored for signs of infection.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Critics of a plan to build three liquefied natural gas export terminals in South Texas say the proposed facilities could devastate efforts to boost the population of endangered ocelots in the state. The Houston Chronicle reports that the wild cats have not been seen in the Port of Brownsville since the 1990s. A Washington-based advocacy group estimates fewer than 60 ocelots remain in Texas. Defenders of Wildlife says the LNG plants would effectively cut off a wildlife corridor intended to promote the migration of ocelots and other wildlife from Mexico to Texas. The corridor has taken decades and more than $90 million dollars to develop. Federal regulators have given final environmental approval for the LNG terminal, but no permits have been issued for the energy projects.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A gay student who came out during a valedictorian speech at Mormon-owned Brigham Young University is earning applause and admiration from students and notable figures like actress Kristin Chenoweth. Matt Easton said Monday that he hopes the speech helps ease loneliness felt by other LGBTQ students at the institution where an honor code forbids dating between members of the same sex. The speech was preapproved by the college. The 24-year-old political science major says only a few people knew about his sexuality before Friday, when he spoke the words “I am proud to be a gay son of God.” The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a doctrinal opposition to same-sex marriage and intimacy but has been trying to stake out a compassionate stance toward LGBTQ members.\n\nVermont\n\nOrleans: The Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department says the annual spring migration of steelhead rainbow trout has started, with the fish soon leaping up waterfalls on their way to spawning grounds. The department says the trout can be spotted moving up the falls on warmer days from mid-April to early May. Officials say the best viewing times are in the late morning and early afternoon. The department says Willoughby Falls in Orleans is the best place to see the leaping fish. It also recommends Coventry Falls on the Black River in Coventry and Lewis Creek Falls in North Ferrisburgh. A fisheries biologist will be available at Willoughby Falls from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday to answer questions from the public about fish and the river.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: The College of William & Mary plans to erect a memorial to people who were enslaved at the centuries-old school. The Washington Post reports that the memorial is designed to evoke a hearth and serve as a meeting place to reflect on the past. The design announced Friday is the latest endeavor by the university in Williamsburg to research and publicize the role slavery had played there. School officials launched an international design contest last year for the memorial and received more than 80 entries. The winning entry, called “Hearth,” was designed by 2011 William & Mary graduate William Sendor. He now works at an architecture firm in North Carolina and says he was struck by the role of fire in the enslaved community.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Opponents of the state’s affirmative action initiative have filed a referendum to force a popular vote on the measure, the day after it passed the Legislature. Opponents will have 90 days to gather 129,811 valid signatures. If they can, it will override the legislative approval and force the initiative to a popular vote this November. The affirmative action measure, Initiative 1000, is set to allow state agencies and schools to consider factors like race in hiring and to engage in targeted outreach and recruitment. Because it’s technically an initiative to the Legislature, lawmakers were able to approve it themselves without sending it to a vote. It passed the House and Senate late Sunday night, the final night of the 105-day legislative session. Affirmative action has been illegal in Washington since a 1998 initiative overturned an earlier version of the policy.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBridgeport: Teens who want to be a part of a zombie movie with an anti-bullying theme will have their chance at a casting call next month. Auditions for “Zombie High School” starring Dean Cain, of “Lois & Clark” fame, are being held May 11 at Bridgeport Middle School, where the film will be shot in mid-July. The film’s website says there will be roles for about 50 people ages 13 to 20 and for about 20 adults ages 35 to 55. Cain says that “anything we can do as parents to get more involved in the anti-bullying efforts in our own children’s schools is a good thing.” A release says the film is expected to be available free of charge for use in schools, homes and organizations. Jason Campbell of Morgantown is the film’s executive director.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A statewide victims organization says 20% of teens have experienced some form of violence in romantic relationships. Cody Warner, the LGBTQ and youth program director at End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin, tells Wisconsin Public Radio that dating violence and abuse is more prevalent than many realize. The group says 30 teens in the state have been the victim of intimate partner homicide since 2000. The University of Washington released a study this month that found 7% of teenage homicide victims across the country were killed by a former or current intimate partner. The Wisconsin group’s director of prevention and outreach, Stephanie Ortiz, says the majority of teens never tell an adult when they experience dating violence. She encourages young people to recognize and respond to dating violence in their friends’ lives.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Gov. Mark Gordon says he will convene a task force to address ways to combat the high rates of murdered and missing American Indian women in the state. The Laramie Boomerang reports that Gordon made the announcement Friday at the University of Wyoming during the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls March. The event was held to raise awareness of the high rates of homicide and disappearances faced by American Indian women, including on Wyoming’s Wind River Indian Reservation. Many Fremont County residents drove down to Laramie to participate in the march, including councilwomen of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho business councils. On some reservations, Indian women are murdered at more than 10 times the national average.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/16/antique-fruitcake-polite-porch-pirate-trashed-beer-news-around-states/40833285/", "title": "Antique fruitcake, polite porch pirate: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state blew out 200 candles on its birthday cake Saturday, as officials and residents gathered to celebrate Alabama’s bicentennial. Gov. Kay Ivey spoke, and a series of monuments picturing the state’s history were unveiled in a park across the street from the Capitol. The 16 bronze plaques, each on a base of Alabama granite, depict scenes from the state’s history. State Sen. Arthur Orr, a Decatur Republican who has chaired the bicentennial celebration, said the bronze reliefs focus on ordinary people, showing that “history is made every day by people like us.” Saturday’s events included a parade up Dexter Avenue featuring a bus similar to the one on which Rosa Parks rode when she was arrested and sparked the Montgomery bus boycott. There also was a moon rover replica commemorating Huntsville’s contributions to the space program, plus a 150-member bicentennial all-star band that played a song composed for the occasion.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: State prison officials have proposed giving inmates copies of their incoming mail rather than originals to crack down on smuggling, officials say. The Department of Corrections asked lawmakers to approve a $400,000 budget increase for the program, Alaska’s Energy Desk reports. All inmate mail except confidential letters from attorneys is already opened by prison staff. But that method of intercepting incoming contraband is not completely successful, Corrections Commissioner Nancy Dahlstrom says. “People can be very, very creative,” she says. Four employees would copy more than 908,000 pages of inmate mail annually under the program, officials say. Dahlstrom says there may be sentimental value in allowing inmates to receive original versions of their mail, “but our job is to keep folks safe there.” The U.S. Bureau of Prisons has adopted the practice of copying mail at some federal corrections facilities.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Cross-country travelers and local commuters will soon have a new route to traverse the metro area with opening of an east-west freeway that will skirt the often-congested section of Interstate 10 through downtown Phoenix. Gov. Doug Ducey and other government officials will gather Wednesday at new bridges over the Salt River to celebrate the imminent opening of the 22-mile South Mountain Freeway. The new South Mountain Freeway is part of the Loop 202 freeway already ringing much of the urban area and will provide a new connection between the Loop 202 Santan Freeway in Chandler on the east and Intestate 10 in southwest Phoenix on the west. Transportation officials and local government and tribal leaders are among those scheduled to be on hand with Ducey to mark the freeway’s completion. The governor’s office calls it “the culmination of the largest single freeway project in state history.”\n\nArkansas\n\nBaxter: Arkansas State University-Mountain Home will offer a community education course on the American Revolution starting next month. Adjunct instructor Jim Carroll and film producer Peter Giuliano are teaming up to teach “From Colonies to Country: The Story of the American Revolution.” The course will examine the British colonies in North America before the revolution and look at why and how they were able to unite and successfully defeat the greatest military power in the world at the time. The class will be held from 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays from Jan. 7 through March 19. The course will be a series of lectures, historical movies and audio-visuals that are designed to be fun, informative and patriotic. Proceeds from the course will go to the Scalia Institute of Criminal Justice at ASUMH.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: As homeowners in wildfire-prone areas struggle to find insurance, a lawsuit filed Friday will test the state’s authority to help them. California’s insurance industry pays into a fund that sells coverage to people who can’t buy it through no fault of their own. Known as the “insurer of last resort,” the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan only offers fire insurance. Homeowners must purchase a second plan in the private market to cover other hazards like flooding and theft. Last month, state Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara ordered the FAIR Plan to begin selling comprehensive insurance plans next year. His goal was to save homeowners money by not forcing them to purchase multiple insurance plans. But Friday, the FAIR Plan Association sued Lara, arguing his order is illegal.\n\nColorado\n\nCraig: A government land agency has announced plans to remove about 25 wild horses from private land in northwestern Colorado using a bait-and-trap technique. Craig Daily News reports removing wild horses from private land is part of the Bureau of Land Management’s responsibilities under the 1971 Wild Free Roaming Horses and Burro Act. The horses wandered about 6 miles east of the protected Sand Wash Basin Herd Management Area, where more than 600 wild horses are estimated to live, officials say. Agency specialists are expected to select locations to use hay and water to attract the horses to specific areas until captured, officials say. The horses would be relocated to an agency facility in Rock Springs and made available for adoption or sale, agency officials say.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNewtown: The community marked the seventh anniversary of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School with vigils, church services and a moment of joy when the town’s high school football team – with a shooting victim’s brother as linebacker – won the state championship Saturday in a last-minute thrill. Twenty first graders and six educators were killed at the elementary school Dec. 14, 2012. At a remembrance service earlier Saturday, Monsignor Robert Weiss, of St. Rose of Lima Church, expressed dismay about how the spate of deadly gun violence has continued in the U.S. since Sandy Hook. According to Connecticut Against Gun Violence, which helped to organize vigils in the state Saturday, more than 700,000 Americans have been killed or injured in gun violence in the seven years after the attack.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: When life handed a group of elementary school students lemons, they helped craft legislation protecting lemonade stands in the First State. The students from W. Reily Brown Elementary School’s Student Lighthouse Team, led by state Rep. Andria Bennett, are hoping to protect young entrepreneurs in the state from having their lemonade stands fined and shut down. Last week Bennett and the students discussed the proposed bill, which would keep a child-run stand that operates on a temporary basis to sell non-alcoholic beverages on private property exempt from licensing fees and other state, county and municipal regulations. Delaware code is very vague, Bennett says, and children could be subject to those strict regulations. The bill would provide clarity so that there wouldn’t be any consequences for stands that meet the proposed criteria.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A D.C. schoolteacher is back on a mission to make sure underserved students have a Christmas to remember, WUSA-TV reports. Last year Azel Prather, of KIPP Arts and Technology Academy, took to Twitter asking the public for help raising money to buy toys for all 26 of his students. When word spread, he surpassed his goal and ended up surprising all 340 kids at the school with a gift. This week, Prather is adding a little something extra. On Wednesday, he’s giving his students a “self-care day” at school. His foundation, The Prather Foundation, has partnered with local barbers, beauticians and nail technicians for a day of pampering and helping kids feel good. On Friday, his foundation will host its Third Annual Zelf on the Shelf, a holiday outreach initiative with KIPPDC. More than 350 elementary students will be surprised with a holiday celebration featuring music, interactive programming and a visit from Santa. A truckload of wrapped presents will be waiting for the kids.\n\nFlorida\n\nOcoee: Traffic came to a citrusy standstill when nearly 1,000 grapefruits spilled from a delivery truck onto the Florida Turnpike in Orange County, authorities said. The fruit-hauling truck was traveling on the turnpike Wednesday afternoon when crates inside the vehicle broke, Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Kim Montes said. The grapefruits spilled from the vehicle and blocked a section of the roadway near Ocoee, the Tampa Bay Times reports. The truck pulled over so the remaining fruit could be secured. Traffic was stopped completely for several minutes while state workers cleaned up the spilled citrus to open up one lane. Video taken by witnesses showed crews using push brooms to round up the rolling fruits. It took another three hours to clear the rest of the roadway and return traffic to normal. No injuries were reported.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Some coastal residents are fighting an effort to relocate an iconic statue. Officials approved a plan last week to move the city’s Waving Girl statue, depicting a woman, Florence Martus, who greeted ships arriving and departing the city from 1887 to 1931. Maritime interests and a developer want to move the statue from a park to a spot closer to the edge of the Savannah River, saying mariners should be able to see it, the Savannah Morning News reports. When first placed, the monument was closer to the river. During the 1996 Olympics, the statue was moved. When replaced after the games, it was put 95 feet back from the river. Crepe myrtle trees have since grown up around the monument, obscuring the view. Some opponents of the move are merchants who want the statue near their businesses. Others say it looks like the move is a favor to Richard Kessler, who is developing the neighboring site.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Authorities have launched three inflatable tents at a park on Oahu to make up what they say is the first mobile homeless center on the island. Hawaii News Now reports the Homeless Outreach and Navigations for Unsheltered Persons project intends to temporarily house homeless people while social service agencies help them move into permanent housing. Officials say three 400-square-foot tents were set up at Waipahu Cultural Garden Park, and each tent can house up to 10 people. Officials say people housed in the tents would be given access to food, showers, restrooms and kennels for pets. City officials say $6 million was budgeted to cover costs for a three-year project. Officials say the project expects to spend 90 days in Waipahu before moving to another city-owned park.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Students won’t see a tuition increase if they attend one of the state’s four-year colleges or universities next year. The presidents of the University of Idaho, Boise State University, Idaho State University and Lewis-Clark State College announced the tuition and fee freeze in Boise on Thursday. It’s the first statewide tuition freeze in 43 years. Idaho State Board of Education President Debbie Critchfield said students’ share of the costs of operating the higher education institutions has increased dramatically. “Forty years ago, state funding covered 88% and tuition revenue paid 7% of that cost. Today, the numbers are nearly even,” she said. The freeze is for the 2020-2021 school year. In April, the Idaho State Board of Education approved a 5.6% increase in tuition for full-time, in-state undergrads at the University of Idaho and a 5.5% increase at LCSC for the 2019-2020 school year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The lions at Lincoln Park Zoo are getting some new digs worthy of the kings of the jungle. Thanks to a $15 million donation, the zoo will be able to begin a gut rehab of its central Kovler Lion House. According to the Chicago Tribune, the newly announced lion house is the last phase of a decadelong zoo renovation project. The lions’ new home will be named the Pepper Family Wildlife Center, in honor of donors Richard and Roxelyn Pepper. Zoo officials say the lions will appreciate their new living quarters, which will include a zipline to make food delivery a more enjoyable experience for the lions and better holding spaces that officials hope will be more conducive to breeding. The renovation of the lion house is the final phase of the zoo’s $135 million Pride of Chicago capital campaign that has resulted in new homes for polar bears, penguins and macaques. Construction of the new lion exhibit is expected to take 18 to 22 months.\n\nIndiana\n\nElkhart: Some community members are trying to raise money to buy a building with a treasured mural painted on one side, fearing the city plans to acquire it and tear it down as part of a neighborhood revitalization project. The Elkhart Redevelopment Commission on Tuesday approved of trying to buy the building that depicts the “Peace Mural,” painted decades ago by the late artist Kelby Love. Sam Callantine, a local entrepreneur, says the mural was created amid heightened violence in the city during the mid-1990s, and it stands as a symbolic call for unity and peace. He and his business partner, Jason Moreno, believe the building can be saved. Callantine says the property can be repurposed to benefit the neighborhood. They want the city to hold off acting on the building so that concerned residents can have time to raise money to restore it.\n\nIowa\n\nCenterville: An atheist organization will fight for a display of its own on the Appanoose County Courthouse lawn if the City Council decides to return a Nativity display to the site, the group’s leader says. A Nativity scene was erected Nov. 18 on the grounds of the courthouse in Centerville, but some residents complained that a religious display should not be placed on government property. The display was moved last Monday to a spot about two blocks south, the Daily Iowegian reports. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1984 that displaying a Nativity scene on public property does not violate the U.S. Constitution, saying it has a legitimate secular purpose and does not primarily advocate a certain religion. The Nativity in Centerville was created by the Centerville-Rathbun Lake Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nKansas\n\nSt. John: The clash over water rights between the operators of a federal wildlife refuge in south central Kansas and farmers could potentially wind up in court if the two sides don’t reach an agreement on water usage. The Quivira National Wildlife Refuge has been complaining that it’s not getting its fair share of the water coming from the Rattlesnake Creek into its marsh. The federally operated refuge has been arguing for decades that too much groundwater is being pumped by farmers and wells. But a farmer says her livelihood depends on the water coming from the creek, Kansas News Service reports. Wendy Mawhirter, who farms wheat, corn and soybeans near the refuge, says cutting back on water usage would cause an array of negative outcomes, including a loss in profits. The current proposed solution suggests building water wells that the refuge could use to bring in additional water.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Just days into his term as governor, Democrat Andy Beshear already has checked off some big priorities from his to-do list: a new state school board installed; the education commissioner gone; more than 140,000 nonviolent felons’ voting rights restored. Now comes the hard part – working with a Republican-led Legislature with its own policy priorities. “This week’s actions are pieces of cake compared to what he faces in terms of building a budget and getting a program through the legislature,” longtime Kentucky political commentator Al Cross says. Beshear’s aggressive start as governor was possible because he did most of it with executive orders, fulfilling promises he had made during the campaign. Another executive order is expected any day now – one that would rescind his Republican predecessor’s effort to impose a work requirement as a condition for Medicaid health coverage.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A suspected cyberattack prompted a shutdown of city government computers Friday. The city’s website was down, but officials posted news of the shutdown on social media. Employees began noticing “suspicious activity” on computers about 11 a.m., officials said. “Out of an abundance of caution, all employees were immediately alerted to power down computers, unplug devices & disconnect from WiFi,” the city said on its NOLA Ready Facebook page. The governor’s office said in an email that the Louisiana National Guard and State Police are helping the city gauge the effects of the suspected attack, the second in a matter of days. Last month the Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicle operations was hobbled by a cyberattack.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Sub-Saharan asylum-seekers have overwhelmed the city’s ability to house them. Officials have created overflow shelters at the Salvation Army and the YMCA to accommodate nearly 170 people, the Portland Press Herald reports. Most of the asylum-seekers are fleeing Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Many have arrived surprised that the city is no longer operating a 24-hour shelter, according to city officials. The converted gymnasiums provide only overnight shelter, so families must seek daytime services at other locations in the community. “We have a lot of people arriving in flip-flops and shorts,” says Jeff Tardif, director of the city’s family shelter. The City Council is scheduled to meet Monday to discuss options in case asylum-seekers continue to arrive faster than they can be housed.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state would invest $130 million more for pre-K and other education priorities under a plan announced Friday by Gov. Larry Hogan. The Republican said more than $100 million would be dedicated over the next two years to expand access to early support and interventions for young children and their families. Hogan also said he would commit more than $30 million over two years to fund Concentration of Poverty Grants to provide full-time coverage of health care practitioners and community school coordinators. The money would enable extended learning time, transportation to school and additional social workers, mentors, counselors and psychologists, the governor’s office said. Hogan said he’d commit more than $1 million to provide low-income students access to Advanced Placement tests free of charge, covering the costs of more than 25,500 AP exams.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMarlborough: More than 170 fire departments across the state are sharing $920,000 in grants for equipment intended to reduce firefighters’ exposure to cancer-causing chemicals. The state’s Firefighter Turnout Gear Grant program will provide firefighters in 144 departments with new hoods and gloves. About 3,000 hoods and 3,000 pairs of gloves will be purchased with the $500,000 grant. Through the Washer-Extractor Equipment Grant, $420,000 was awarded to 75 departments for equipment to clean their gear after exposure to smoke and other toxic chemicals. Forty-five fire departments were successful in applying for both grants. “Soot and ash-laden gear was once the mark of a seasoned firefighter, but we now know that washing gear after every exposure to smoke is the safest thing to do,” says Needham Fire Chief Dennis Condon, president of the Fire Chiefs’ Association of Massachusetts.\n\nMichigan\n\nTecumseh: Some families pass down jewelry, watches or even recipes. But a Michigan family has its own heirloom – a 141-year-old fruitcake. The cake was initially preserved to honor Fidelia Ford, who baked it in 1878. She established a tradition of baking the cake and letting it age for a year before serving it during holiday seasons. Ford died at age 65 before her 1878 cake could be eaten, and by the time the holidays arrived, the family considered her handiwork a legacy, not food. Until his 2013 death, the cake was in the care of Morgan Ford, her great-grandson. He had stored it in an antique glass dish on the top shelf of a china cabinet in his Tecumseh home – which is where it remains today. Guinness World Records doesn’t have an entry for the oldest fruitcake, but as for cakes in general, the Ford fruitcake is nowhere near the world’s oldest, The Detroit News reports. That honor goes to a 4,176-year-old cake found in an Egyptian tomb, according to the Guinness organization.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A package thief who made off with a woman’s delivery last week decided to leave something behind for the victim – a handwritten thank-you note taunting her for the package. Homeowner Hilary Smith said she found the note on her porch after she got home from work, hours after she received a text saying her package had been delivered. The note said: “So just a quick little thank you for leaving me the opportunity of stealing your package. Very nice of you. Thank You.” It was signed: “The new owner of your package.” St. Paul police posted a picture of the note on Twitter on Friday and reminded residents who are expecting deliveries to take precautions to avoid thefts. Smith said she appreciates hand-crafted thank you notes, but not in this case. She told the Pioneer Press the package was a portable phone charger for her boss.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal appeals court declared Friday that the state’s ban on abortion at 15 weeks is unconstitutional, dealing a blow to those seeking to overturn the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled correctly when he blocked the Mississippi law from taking effect in 2018. “In an unbroken line dating to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s abortion cases have established (and affirmed, and re-affirmed) a woman’s right to choose an abortion before viability,” the appeals court judges wrote. “States may regulate abortion procedures prior to viability so long as they do not impose an undue burden on the woman’s right, but they may not ban abortions.” The only abortion clinic in Mississippi sued the state after Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed the law. The clinic said it provides abortions until 16 weeks.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: A gay St. Louis County police sergeant who was awarded nearly $20 million in a discrimination lawsuit has been promoted to lieutenant and picked as the leader of a newly created diversity and inclusion unit. Police Chief Jon Belmar said in a news release Thursday night announcing the unit that the department “must demonstrate to our officers and to our community that we prioritize diversity and inclusion.” The announcement comes after a jury ruled in October in favor of Keith Wildhaber, who says he was passed over for promotion 23 times and told to “tone down” his “gayness.” Wildhaber’s attorney, Russ Riggan, described the promotion as “hopefully a crucial first step for the county in making necessary changes to its culture in order to better serve the citizens.”\n\nMontana\n\nLivingston: An astronaut aboard the International Space Station spent 20 minutes speaking with high school students in the town she now calls home. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports Natalie Davis-McGrath, a science teacher at Park High School in Livingston, dialed into the station for a chat with astronaut Christina Koch. The call came in a gym filled with students. Koch was traveling about 5 miles per second about 250 miles above Earth at the time, officials said. Koch, wearing a pink T-shirt with the outline of the state of Montana, answered questions Thursday about what life in space is like, what research she does and if her perspective about living on Earth has changed. She said she was inspired to become an astronaut by anything that made her feel small and made her think about the universe, including the sky and mountains. “It’s the same reason why I think I love the mountains in Montana and around Livingston,” Koch said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: People can learn the basics of ice fishing or pick up some tips from experienced anglers during several January events. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission says classroom instruction for beginners and families is scheduled to run Jan. 6 at the Nebraska Game and Parks Outdoor Education Center in Lincoln. The fee is $5 per family. People can sign up online. A free, on-ice event will be held Jan. 11 at Holmes Lake. The Nebraska Fish and Game Association will host a free classroom clinic at Yanney Heritage Park’s Environmental Resource Center in Kearney on Jan. 18. Seating is limited, so registration is requested by emailing Harold@nefga.org. Fort Kearny State Recreation Area Lake No. 6 will be the site of a free, on-ice event Jan. 19. Limited loaner equipment will be available, and bait and instruction will be provided for on-ice events. Fishing permits can be purchased online.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Las Vegas Strip resorts have won praise for their recycling efforts, but a state analysis shows the rest of the Vegas area falls short of national recycling rates and has shown little signs of improvement since 2003. About 20% of waste produced in Clark County last year was recycled, according to the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection’s 2019 Waste and Reduction Report. That was nearly 10% lower than recycling rates in the Reno area and Carson City and well below the national recycling rate of 35%. State lawmakers set a 25% recycling goal since 1991, but the rate has barely risen above 21% since 2003, the Sun found. The Las Vegas Sun reports that municipal contracts with the main waste-hauler in the region, Republic Services, only guarantee recycling service to single-family homes in Clark County.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s new bail law allows judges to set bail at an amount a defendant can’t afford solely if that person is a flight risk, the state Supreme Court said in an opinion released Friday. The court was asked to interpret the statute, which was amended last year, in the case of Christina Hill. She was charged with possessing drugs and selling them while she was released on bail on other charges. At the bail hearing on the new charges, lawyers for the state requested that Hill be jailed while she awaited trial. They said she had a criminal record dating to 2007, including convictions for violating the terms of her probation. Hill’s lawyer said it wasn’t necessary to detain her before trial because she’s not dangerous. The judge decided that releasing Hill wouldn’t be dangerous but ordered that before she could be released, Hill had to pay $25,000 cash bail.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWeehawken: More buses may be able to travel between New Jersey and New York City through the Lincoln Tunnel with the help of autonomous technology. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on Thursday approved spending $4.8 million to award contracts to two firms to test whether sensors and other technology can shorten the distance between buses and boost speed in the tunnel’s exclusive bus lane. The lane handles 1,850 buses carrying more than 70,000 passengers each weekday between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., the agency said. Bus drivers would still be behind the wheel and could still control their vehicles. Testing would begin off-site next month, and the technologies would eventually be demonstrated in the lane during early weekend hours on buses that are not carrying passengers.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s zoo is celebrating the survival of one of three Mexican gray wolf pups born at the facility this year. ABQ BioPark officials say the pup has grown over the last several months and is becoming more curious and confident. The births of the pups in May marked the first time in nearly 15 years that the BioPark welcomed Mexican wolf pups, the rarest subspecies of gray wolf in North America. To date, the zoo has had 72 pups born, although not all have survived. About 30% of all Mexican wolf pups die within the first year. The BioPark also temporarily holds and cares for injured wild wolves that need medical treatment or rehabilitation. Two wolves that arrived in November were from separate packs in Arizona and New Mexico and had both been caught in leg hold traps. Both are expected to return to their wild packs after a little more care and rehabilitation.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A law that will allow New Yorkers to get driver’s licenses without having to prove they are in the country legally weathered a second court challenge Friday, days before its enactment. A federal district judge ruled against Rensselaer County Clerk Frank Merola, saying he lacked the legal capacity to bring the lawsuit. Merola, a Republican, had argued that the state law conflicts with federal immigration law. Judge Gary Sharpe wrote in his decision that he was not ruling on the legality of the law but on whether Merola could bring the suit. A federal judge in western New York ruled against a county clerk in Buffalo on similar grounds last month. Starting Monday, license applicants without a valid Social Security number will be able to submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver’s licenses issued in other countries.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Critics on Friday pushed back against a deal to protect a Civil War statue that once stood on the University of North Carolina’s flagship campus and to give $2.5 million to a neo-Confederate organization, as a civil rights group objected to it in court and a foundation withdrew a grant. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law filed a motion Friday to intervene and set aside the $2.5 million consent judgment between the UNC Board of Governors and the North Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The agreement involves a statue of a Confederate soldier known as “Silent Sam” that stood on the Chapel Hill campus for more than 100 years until protesters toppled it in August 2018. The New York-based Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has withdrawn a $1.5 million grant intended for the Chapel Hill campus.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s mineral resources director says North Dakota reached a production record of 1.5 million barrels of oil per day. The figures Lynn Helms released reflect the month of October. The increase comes a month after production had dropped to 1.44 million barrels per day. The Bismarck Tribune reports rainy weather in September hampered activity because roads were closed. “It should be a very happy holiday for the state of North Dakota,” Helms said. She said she expects production will continue to increase in the Bakken for the foreseeable future because OPEC and Russia agreed to curb oil outputs this month to reduce an abundant global supply. “It should result in small increments of production growth through the year 2020,” Helms said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine and his administration are focusing on improvements to the state’s highway rest areas. The Republican governor spoke recently about the “sorry” state of Ohio’s rest areas in an address to an Ohio Contractors Association conference in Columbus. The governor has a vision for the state’s rest areas, Ohio Department of Transportation Director Jack Marchbanks told Cleveland.com. “Our rest areas should not just be places where people go take care of biological necessities – they should be really places where we promote all that’s good about Ohio,” Marchbanks said. That vision includes lodge- or chalet-style buildings, well-lit parking areas and dog parks, along with flat-screen TVs displaying weather conditions and kiosks highlighting great Ohioans such as astronaut Neil Armstrong and other state information, according to Cleveland.com. There are also hopes for speakers pumping out a soundtrack of songs from famous Ohio musicians.\n\nOklahoma\n\nCordell: A man suspected of abducting a woman and missing a court date on charges of assaulting two police officers was shot and killed Thursday by police in western Oklahoma, authorities said. Cade Humphrey, 30, died at a hospital after he was shot about 9 p.m. Thursday near Cordell, about 85 miles west of Oklahoma City, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. The woman, 26, was found alive and said she had been beaten by Humphrey on Wednesday and forced to accompany him. Authorities had been searching for Humphrey since he missed a Wednesday court appearance on charges of assaulting two Lone Grove police officers. The woman and Humphrey had previously been in a relationship, according to OSBI spokeswoman Brooke Arbeitman.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A prosecutor has declined to file charges against 21 protesters who were arrested during a sit-in at the governor’s office last month as they protested a planned natural gas pipeline and marine terminal, a spokeswoman said Friday. The office of Marion County District Attorney Paige Clarkson decided not to charge the 21 with criminal trespass in the second degree, her spokeswoman Amy Queen said. Gov. Kate Brown’s spokesman said the governor support the decision. “Gov. Brown supports freedom of expression for all Oregonians, and she agrees with the district attorney’s office that pursuing charges would not have been a good use of public resources,” spokesman Charles Boyle said. Hundreds of protesters had come into the Capitol on Nov. 21. Most left within a few hours. But several dozen refused to leave Brown’s office until she opposed the pipeline, which she did not.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: The Roman Catholic diocese of Pittsburgh has announced plans to merge more than two dozen parishes into eight new parishes next year. Bishop David Zubik said Satuday that 26 parishes will be part of the Jan. 6 mergers, which will reduce the number of parishes in the diocese from 170 to 152. The diocese said that no buildings would be closing. Zubik wrote in a letter to be read or distributed at the weekend’s Masses that “this has not been a simple task.” But he said the changes would mean more effective ministry “by addressing financial needs, sharing resources and allowing your clergy to focus on the spiritual work for which they were ordained.” Officials said the mergers follow “extensive consultation” with laity in all parishes, including 329 parish meetings across the diocese in 2017.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s public school district is in a better financial position than previously thought, but resources need to be reallocated, according to an independent financial analysis released Friday. The state, which assumed control of the struggling district last month, released the analysis by Ernst & Young. Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green said the school community’s needs have evolved, but the district’s $450 million budget “has clearly not kept pace.” The analysis found the city’s projected deficit for the district is “likely overstated,” but growing central office and transportation costs could be cut. Central office costs are $25 million of the budget. Compared to other districts, the district appears to spend about 40% more per pupil on transportation, and benefits are about 10% more as a percentage of salaries, the analysis said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nJames Island: The Folly Boat has finally found a new home along the road to one of the state’s most popular beaches more than two years after Hurricane Irma tried to sweep it away. Crews used a crane and flatbed truck Thursday to move the boat, an unofficial landmark famous for its hand-painted messages, from the private marsh where it ended up after the 2017 hurricane to a bar called The Barrel on Folly Road. The Folly Boat first became famous in 1989 when Hurricane Hugo washed it up on the road to Folly Beach. Instead of moving it, residents and others started painting homemade messages of love, school spirit, politics and whatever else popped up. The boat was filled with 40,000 pounds of concrete and steel to keep it in place. But the strong waves and high water from Hurricane Irma washed it away even though the storm made landfall some 300 miles away in Florida.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The Oglala Sioux Tribe is considering whether to appeal a decision by a panel of judges that a proposed uranium mine site in southwest South Dakota doesn’t have to be surveyed for Native American burials or artifacts. The three judges with the U.S. Atomic Safety and Licensing Board said the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission tried diligently to do an on-the-ground survey for Native American burials, artifacts and other historical and cultural resources. But they say the commission was justified in giving up because the tribe wouldn’t cooperate. The company proposing the mine, Powertech, a subsidiary of Azarga Uranium, in Canada, still has several more regulatory approvals to obtain before it can begin mining, including licenses and permits from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources.\n\nTennessee\n\nOneida: Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area and the Big South Fork Bike Club are planning their annual “Mail Run” for mountain bikers on New Year’s Day. Bikers meet at 10 a.m. at Bandy Creek Visitor Center. Rides vary from 8 to 35 miles, allowing bikers to choose their distance, the park said in a news release. Hot chocolate and coffee will be available before the rides. “The ride is traditionally called the Mail Run because ‘neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of the night’ keep us from getting out there on the first of the year,” said Joe Cross, president of the Big South Fork Bike Club. The park has almost 300 miles of trails that allow mountain biking. In 2012, it was the first national park to receive the International Mountain Biking Association’s Epic Ride designation.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: City leaders have turned down a proposal that would require horseback riders to pick up what their animals leave behind on the beach after equestrians argued that horse manure is harmless. One person even brought a bag of manure to Thursday’s City Council meeting while arguing against the measure, the Galveston County Daily News reports. “It is really pretty much non-toxic and doesn’t do anything,” island veterinarian Lea Fistein said as she placed her fingers into the bag of manure. “It’s really the only feces I would touch with my hands.” City code requires people to clean up pet waste left behind on public beaches, but horses are exempt from that rule. City staff members had suggested lifting the exclusion for horses. Horse riders told the council that requiring riders to pick up manure would prevent people from riding on the beach because it’s difficult to carry the necessary equipment to remove the droppings.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Liquor authorities have thrown away thousands of gallons of drinkable beer after state law changed to allow higher-alcohol brews. The Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control disposed of beer worth almost $18,000 on Friday, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Authorities say they were legally required to dump the beer from state-owned liquor stores because a new law allowed those beers to be sold in private stores instead. Utah had long prohibited grocery and convenience stores from selling beer stronger than 4% alcohol by volume. Everything else was sold at state liquor stores. The law effective Oct. 31 increased that limit to 5%. Because the state-owned stores can’t stock anything available on the open market, officials discounted beers between 4% and 5% before Halloween, then threw away everything that was left. Workers disposed of the 275 cases of bottles and cans at a recycling facility.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The police chief in the state’s largest city used an anonymous Twitter account to troll a government critic, he admitted last week. Burlington Police Chief Brandon del Pozo said he took six weeks of medical leave to seek mental health treatment after telling his story to the mayor. Seven Days weekly newspaper first reported the story Thursday. For one hour July 4, del Pozo said, he used the anonymous Twitter account to respond to the critic. “I erased the tweets and deleted the account because I realized I was wrong, and it wasn’t becoming of me,” he said Friday. He told Seven Days that he created @WinkleWatchers to respond to political activist Charles Winkleman. Winkleman posted to his website that “Del Pozo’s social media is meant to bully and silence critics, whether it be private citizens or oversight groups like Copwatch, all while promoting himself.”\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The Charlottesville Police Department is taking a Dodge Challenger out of service because of its similarity to the car used in a fatal attack during a 2017 white supremacist rally. The city announced the decision in a news release Thursday. City Manager Tarron Richardson said the vehicle was “clearly a reminder” of the attack, which killed Heather Heyer and left dozens more injured. He said the city believes removing it from the fleet is in the best interests of the community. The news release says the decision was reached after questions were raised on social media and by the community. The 2017 Dodge Challenger was purchased as a used vehicle for $20,976 in January 2018. The city says it will be “disposed of” by the end of the current fiscal year.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A jury on Friday awarded the Washington State Department of Transportation $57.2 million in damages over delays in the construction of a highway tunnel that runs beneath downtown Seattle. The Seattle Times reports the verdict against the tunnel contractors in Thurston County Superior Court in Olympia represents the entire amount the state requested. “The contractor, not the taxpayers, is responsible for the costs of repairing the tunneling machine,” WSDOT spokeswoman Laura Newborn said. The Dec. 6, 2013, stall of the tunnel-boring machine known as Bertha – then the world’s largest drill at more than 57 feet in diameter – delayed the project more than two years and required contractors to lift the 4 million-pound front end and replace damaged parts, including cracked main gears and broken bearing seals.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Board of Education is once again trying to reduce high school graduation requirements. News outlets report the board voted Wednesday to open two proposals to public comment until Jan. 24. One involves lessening the number of social studies credits required to graduate. It would essentially require students study all of U.S. history in one course instead of two. The policy was previously proposed and abandoned after officials said public comments were overwhelmingly against the change. The proposal also would nix the requirement that students take a world studies course and allow students to take other social studies classes to replace the currently required civics course. The same proposal would also stop requiring counties to offer economics and geography. The other proposal requires middle schools to offer career exploration opportunities and would require full-time virtual school programs be offered for grades 6 to 12.\n\nWisconsin\n\nPort Washington: A judge on Friday ordered that the registrations of up to 234,000 voters be tossed out because they may have moved, a victory for conservatives that could make it more difficult for people to vote next year in the key swing state. The judge sided with three voters represented by a conservative law firm who argued the state elections commission should have immediately deactivated any of the roughly 234,000 voters who didn’t respond to an October mailing within 30 days. The voters were flagged as having potentially moved. Ozaukee County Judge Paul Malloy denied a request by elections commission attorneys to put his decision on hold. He ordered the state Elections Commission to follow the law requiring voters who didn’t respond to be deactivated. The ruling comes in the early stages of the case and is expected to be immediately appealed.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The final federal quarterly oil and gas lease sale in the state this year netted $10.8 million in bids, the federal Bureau of Land Management says. The BLM received bids on 123 parcels totaling about 123,000 acres around the state in Wednesday’s sale. Wyoming produces more energy on public land than almost any other state in the country. The bureau released 160 of the 169 nominated public land and mineral parcels to energy companies for purchase. The withdrawn parcels conflicted with designated big game migration corridors and existing coal mining operations, the BLM concluded. The state receives about half of the funds made through federal lease sales. Last year, the sales brought $117 million back into state coffers. Statewide lease sales have attracted opposition from conservation groups and some landowners, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/19/hospital-concert-serial-revisited-green-chile-pile-news-around-states/50753003/", "title": "Hospital concert, Serial revisited: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: An inmate who authorities say escaped with the help of a jail supervisor who later killed herself shared nearly 1,000 phone calls with the woman before the breakout, news outlets report. Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said Casey White and Vicky White, who were not related, may have planned his escape over the phone, but authorities must listen to each of 949 calls before making a determination. Authorities have said the two were in a romantic relationship, and Singleton said at least some of the calls were sexual in nature. The phone calls occurred after Casey White was transferred from the Lauderdale County Jail to a state prison where he was held until being returned to Lauderdale County before the escape, the sheriff said. Casey White walked out of the jail in handcuffs in April accompanied by Vicky White, the assistant corrections director, prompting an 11-day search for the pair. On the day of the escape, Vicky White, 56, told co-workers she was driving the inmate to a mental health evaluation. The two were eventually discovered in Indiana, where Casey White was captured. Vicky White shot herself in the head moments before the man was arrested, authorities said. Casey White was charged with escape and murder in her death. The defense has filed documents suggesting Vicky White was in charge of the escape.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A powerful storm sweeping north through the Bering Strait on Saturday caused widespread flooding in several western Alaska coastal communities, knocking out power and sending residents fleeing for higher ground. The force of the water moved some homes off their foundations, and one house in Nome floated down a river until it got caught at a bridge. The potent storm – what remains of Typhoon Merbok – has been influencing weather patterns as far away as California. In Alaska, no injuries or deaths were immediately reported, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Officials had warned that some places could see their worst flooding in 50 years and that the high waters could take up to 14 hours to recede. Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a disaster declaration during the day. The nearly 1,000-mile storm front has damaged roads and potentially other infrastructure, Dunleavy said at a Saturday evening news conference. Officials will evaluate any effects on water and sewer systems, seawalls, fuel storage areas, airports, and ports. Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives were already in Alaska before the storm, and Dunleavy said they will stay to help assess damage.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Republican leaders of the Arizona Legislature will not try to defend a new law limiting up-close filming of police that has been blocked by a federal judge, a decision that essentially ends the fight over the contentious proposal. Senate President Karen Fann and House Speaker Rusty Bowers both said they would not intervene in the case by the Friday deadline set by the federal judge when he temporarily blocked the new law from taking effect last week on First Amendment grounds. And the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. John Kavanagh, said Friday that he has been unable to find an outside group to defend the law, which was challenged by news media organizations and the American Civil Liberties Union. The groups will now ask that the law, which was set to take effect next week, be permanently blocked. Kavanagh said he will review U.S. District Judge John J. Tuchi’s ruling and see if he can craft a law that passes constitutional muster. He said the law is needed to keep people from distracting police trying to make an arrest, but Tuchi agreed with the challengers that it runs afoul of precedents that say the public and press have a right to film police doing their jobs. Tuchi noted there are already Arizona laws barring interfering with police and said singling out people for taking videos appears to be unconstitutional on its face.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, a Republican who is running for governor, was released from a hospital Saturday after undergoing surgery for thyroid cancer. “Following successful surgery on Friday to remove her thyroid and surrounding lymph nodes and in consultation with her physician, Sarah was discharged from an Arkansas hospital cancer-free,” said Sanders spokesperson Judd Deere. “She will spend the remaining portion of her recovery at home.” Deere told the Associated Press that Sanders, 40, planned to resume campaigning “soon,” but it was not known precisely when she would return. Sanders said Friday when announcing the surgery that a biopsy earlier this month revealed she had thyroid cancer. Dr. John R. Sims, a surgeon at CARTI Cancer Center in Little Rock who is one of Sanders’ doctors, said her cancer was a stage 1 papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type of thyroid cancer, and said she has an “excellent” prognosis. Sims said Sanders will need adjuvant treatment with radioactive iodine and long-term continuing care. Sanders, who served as ex-President Donald Trump’s spokeswoman until 2019, is running against Democratic nominee Chris Jones. She is the daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A new state law will help military service members who were discharged under “don’t ask, don’t tell” policies because of their sexual or gender identities to reestablish their eligibility for Veterans Affairs benefits, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Saturday. “For decades, our bravest heroes, men and women who wore the uniforms of the armed services had to hide who they really were, and many were other than honorably discharged if their sexuality was discovered,” Newsom said in a statement after announcing he had signed the bill. Gays and lesbians were banned in the military until the 1993 approval of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” the policy that allowed them to serve only if they did not openly acknowledge their sexual orientation. Rather than helping, advocates say, it created more problems. Repeal of the law was approved by Congress and then-President Barack Obama in late 2010 and took effect nine months later, allowing lesbian, gay and bisexual people to serve openly. The Department of Defense subsequently created a path for veterans who had been discharged under the policy to receive the full range of veterans’ benefits. “But many veterans sadly don’t know or can’t even access this important process,” Newsom said, adding that some have had to hire expensive legal counsel to navigate the process. “We’re taking steps to fix this.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Stricter air quality regulations are coming for northern Colorado businesses after the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday downgraded the area to a category for “severe” violators of ozone standards. Drivers may have to pay higher gas prices, too, because the reclassification prohibits the sale of conventional gasoline within one year. State environmental officials, however, believe they can achieve better air quality without needing to switch to the reformulated blend of gasoline the EPA requires, Colorado Air Pollution Control Division spokesperson Leah Schleifer said in a news release. Colorado has asked the EPA to reassess that requirement and consider the state’s alternative plan. The gasoline blend would raise gas prices 20-30 cents per gallon, AAA estimates, according to the Denver Post. The area includes a large swath of northern Colorado including Denver, Boulder, Greeley, Fort Collins and Loveland. Colorado estimates it will issue more stringent permits for 600 oil and gas facilities and about 100 more industrial sites, the news release said. The Colorado area was one of six areas to get downgraded by the EPA along with the Chicago area; Texas’ Dallas-Forth Worth and Houston areas; parts of Connecticut and the New York-New Jersey-Long Island area; and the Morongo Band of Mission Indians in Southern California.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who is on trial in Connecticut for calling the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre a hoax, continued Friday to describe the proceedings as a “kangaroo court” from his Infowars studio in Texas. Jones’ commentary became a focus of testimony on the fourth day of the trial, with a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families questioning a corporate representative for Jones’ Infowars brand about how seriously the company was taking the trial. The lawyer, Christopher Mattei, showed the jury a photo he said was of an Infowars webpage, depicting the judge in the trial with lasers shooting out of her eyes. “On a scale of one to 10, how seriously is Infowars taking this trial?” Mattei asked the corporate representative, Brittany Paz. “Ten. It’s serious to me,” Paz responded. The exchange occurred as Jones prepares to attend the trial in Waterbury this week and as the judge, Barbara Bellis, considers a request by the families’ lawyers to limit what Jones and his lawyer can say and argue in court. Jones is expected to testify, but it’s not clear yet when. “They are pretending to the world that it’s an actual trial, but I’m guilty when I get there, and I can’t say I’m innocent,” Jones said on his Infowars web show Friday. “Everybody fundamentally knows that’s a fraud.”\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: In future summers, the edges of the city’s boardwalk could have a new, larger look. Multiple plans are in the works to build hotels in Rehoboth Beach, one of Delaware’s most popular destinations that keeps getting busier. In the coming years, when beachgoers look back on the avenue from the sand, there will likely be more oceanfront balconies and windows than one-story shops. Two projects could shake up the end of the boardwalk. The longtime owner of the Candy Kitchen corner wants to build a 100-plus room building there in the image of a mid-20th-century hotel. Across the avenue, Grotto Pizza is taking over the former Dolle’s with plans for a restaurant and hotel. Elsewhere on Rehoboth Avenue, a motel is being renovated into a boutique hotel. A court battle will decide whether an office strip is replaced by another hotel.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Local officials will consider legislation Tuesday to support migrants bused into the district from Texas and Arizona, WUSA-TV reports. The DC Council plans to vote on an emergency bill introduced by Councilmember Brianne Nadeau at the request of Mayor Muriel Bowser. The measure calls for the establishment of welcome and reception services and the provision of food, clothing, medical services, cash assistance and other necessities for migrants. But the proposal has some residents worried about unintended consequences. The Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless called the legislation a “poison apple” Thursday. LegalAidDC tweeted Friday that the council should reject the bill in its current form, saying it “will weaken basic protections that all unhoused individuals & families deserve when they seek help in the District.” The group also said in a statement that it is concerned about the “unchecked” powers it would give the mayor. The Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network has repeatedly taken issue with Bowser’s claims that the overwhelming majority of migrants do not want to stay in D.C. once they arrive, saying that takes focus off the need to support those migrants who do want to stay in the capital. Local nonprofits say almost all the people arriving are asylum-seekers with pending immigration cases.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Attorneys for school shooter Nikolas Cruz asked for the judge in his murder case to remove herself Friday, two days after she scolded them when they abruptly rested their case after calling only a fraction of their expected witnesses. The Broward Public Defender’s Office said in a motion that Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer held a long-standing animosity toward lead defense lawyer Melisa McNeill. The motion cited Florida’s Judicial Code of Conduct that states a judge shall disqualify himself or herself if the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances in which the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or a party’s lawyer. Defense attorneys said Scherer’s repeated improper and unjustified attacks on the defense counsel undermine the public’s confidence in the judicial system and have also caused Cruz to fear that he will not receive a fair trial. Prosecutors said in a response that Scherer has been respectful to both sides. Cruz’s attorneys had told the judge and prosecutors they would be calling 80 witnesses but surprisingly rested at the start of Wednesday’s court session after calling only about 25 of them. Scherer called the decision without warning to her or the prosecution “the most uncalled for, unprofessional way to try a case.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nDecatur: Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor, is launching an intensive effort to get out the vote by urging potential supporters to cast in-person ballots the first week of early voting as she tries to navigate the state’s new election laws. The strategy, outlined to the Associated Press by Abrams’ top aides, is a shift from 2018, when she spent generously in her first gubernatorial bid to encourage voters to use mail ballots. It also moves away from Democrats’ pandemic-era emphasis on mail voting, a push that delivered Georgia’s electoral votes to President Joe Biden and helped Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff win concurrent U.S. Senate runoffs to give Democrats control of Capitol Hill. Republicans, including Abrams’ opponent, Gov. Brian Kemp, answered in 2021 with sweeping election changes that, among other provisions, dramatically curtailed drop boxes for mail ballots, added wrinkles to mail ballot applications and ballot return forms, and made it easier to challenge an individual voter’s eligibility. But it also expanded in-person voting. “It’s self-evident we have to have a big early vote in-person,” said Abrams campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo, arguing the new mail ballot procedures make it risky for Democrats to rely too heavily on that option. “What’s not self-evident,” Groh-Wargo said, “is how the hell you do that.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A business owner and a Maui County official have been charged with bribery and public corruption involving more than $2 million in cash and gifts, federal court documents unsealed Thursday showed. Milton Choy, the owner of a Honolulu company that provides wastewater services and supplies, is accused of bribing Stewart Olani Stant, who was a wastewater manager and then director of the Maui County Department of Environmental Management. Choy provided Stant with cash deposited directly to Stant’s bank accounts, plus gambling chips and trips to Las Vegas, U.S. Attorney for Hawaii Clare Connors said at a news conference. In return, prosecutors said Choy received upward of $19 million in business contracts from the county. Messages left for Stant on various social media sites were not immediately returned. Listed phone numbers had been disconnected. Choy took responsibility for his actions and admitted everything he did to federal investigators, said his attorney Michael Green. “He gave unprotected statements – that’s where you don’t ask for a lawyer, and you you sit down with the agents and tell them what you did. And he did that,” Green said. The two will be arraigned in federal court Monday.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Huckleberries are highly sought after, but the coveted mountain fruit was difficult to find across much of northern Idaho and eastern Washington this year. Pickers were able to locate some productive plants and patches, but they frequently encountered healthy bushes that had few berries or none at all, The Lewiston Tribune reports. “In general terms, this is not a very good year,” said Wayne Kasworm, a grizzly bear biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who tracks huckleberry production in the Selkirk, Cabinet and Yaak mountain ranges. With a changing climate, scientists like him increasingly are tracking huckleberries that are an important food source for grizzly bears and other wildlife and coveted by people as well. Native Americans have harvested huckleberries for thousands of years and continue to do so today. The small berries with a pleasant mix of sweet and tart are targeted by recreational and commercial pickers as well. They are used to make pies, ice cream and other desserts, as well as being added to pancakes, milkshakes and smoothies. Grizzlies depend on the berries as a key food source. “The other thing I’ve learned in the process of doing this work is just how many other species rely on huckleberries. It’s really a keystone species,” said Tabitah Graves, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Two police officers face felony charges for allegedly shooting and seriously wounding an unarmed man during a July shootout on the city’s southwest side that also wounded a second man, authorities said Friday. Sgt. Christopher Liakopoulos, 43, and Officer Ruben Reynoso, 42, of the Chicago Police Department, have been charged with one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm, aggravated discharge of a firearm and official misconduct, said Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx. She said the officers were relieved of their police powers Thursday before they turned themselves in to authorities. Foxx said both officers “are being charged with having fired their shots” that wounded an unarmed 23-year-old man – identified separately Friday through a civil court filing as Miguel Medina – on July 22 in the city’s Pilsen neighborhood. That man has since recovered and is cooperating with the investigation, she said. “The victim who was shot and injured in this incident was not in possession of a weapon, nor did he fire a weapon at these two officers,” Foxx said during a news conference. The officers were heading to a morning training course and were in plain clothes at the time of the shooting. They weren’t wearing their police body cameras because they were going to training, Assistant State’s Attorney Alyssa Janicki said. Prosecutors later obtained surveillance video from the area.\n\nIndiana\n\nElkhart: A staffer for U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski was trying to pass a flatbed truck on a northern Indiana highway last month when the SUV in which they were traveling crashed into an oncoming car, killing Walorski and three other people, police said Friday. A witness traveling behind the SUV told investigators it sped up, crossed the centerline of the two-lane highway as it neared the truck, and pulled into the path of the other car when the crash happened about 12:30 p.m. Aug. 3, according to the Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office. Airbag control module data from the SUV driven by Zachery Potts, 27, who was Walorski’s district director, showed it was going 77 mph at the time of the crash on a rural stretch of Indiana 19 near the town of Wakarusa, the office said. “All of the evidence and information gathered is consistent with someone attempting to pass another vehicle on a two-lane roadway,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Walorski, 58, was a Republican first elected in 2012 and was seeking reelection this year to a sixth term. The sheriff’s office released statements from the county coroner ruling the deaths of Walorski and the others as accidental from injuries suffered in the crash. Investigators blamed the crash on Potts for “driving left of center with a contributing factor of excessive speed.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Iowa Confluence Water Trails project received a big boost Friday when Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she will allocate $7million in federal funding for its construction. Though backers of the project aim to develop outdoor attractions across 150 miles of waterways in central Iowa, the governor allocated the latest round of funding to one of the project’s focal points: the Scott Avenue dam development at the confluence of the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers in downtown Des Moines. Developers plan to turn the low-head dam into two whitewater features for rafting, kayaking, canoeing, tubing and surfing. They also expect to add trails, a plaza and fishing areas. The latest grant represents about 13% of the $53.5 million budget for the development. The water trails comprise one of two Des Moines projects that received federal money through the state’s Destination Iowa program Friday, with the governor allocating $1 million to renovation of the Val Air Ballroom in West Des Moines. Reynolds also awarded Council Bluffs and the Southwest Iowa Nonprofit for Collaborative Impact $4.9 million for a joint plan to redevelop a stretch of that city’s Missouri River frontage.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hundreds of thousands of dollars of COVID-19 relief funds spent by state and local governments could have violated federal rules or were ill-advised, a report released Wednesday by the Legislature’s nonpartisan auditing office showed. The audit comes as state officials are still grappling with how to spend millions in federal pandemic relief, with the process to dole out the money coming under fire over transparency concerns. Of the $18 million in expenditures by county governments, nonprofits and businesses reviewed by the Division of Legislative Post Audit, officials flagged $1.1 million in spending as ill-advised, with an additional $264,000 considered wasteful or excessive. And while 85% of funding was considered to be clearly allowable under federal guidelines, it was unclear whether $2.7 million in spending was acceptable. Another $48,000 was deemed to likely not be allowed. Potentially problematic expenditures ranged from a recipient of a small-business grant who conducted a festival to the purchase of electronic signs, sports equipment and office supplies by local governments. In Bourbon County, officials gave a vendor $450,000 to start a grocery store in a part of Fort Scott considered to be a food desert – only to see the store close after a few months.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: When 14-year-old Michael Carneal opened fire on his fellow students during a morning prayer meeting in 1997, school shootings were not yet a part of the national consciousness. The carnage that left three students dead and five more injured at Heath High School, near Paducah, ended when Carneal put down his weapon, and the principal walked him to the school office – a scene that seems unimaginable today. Also stretching today’s imagination: Carneal’s life sentence guaranteed an opportunity for parole after 25 years, the maximum sentence permissible at the time given his age. A quarter-century later, Carneal is 39 with a parole hearing this week that comes at a very different time in American life – after Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after Parkland, after Uvalde. Today, police officers and metal detectors are an accepted presence in many schools, and even kindergartners are drilled to prepare for active shooters. “Twenty-five years seemed like so long, so far away,” Missy Jenkins Smith recalls thinking at the time of the sentencing. Jenkins Smith was 15 when she was shot by Carneal, someone she considered a friend. The bullet left her paralyzed, and she uses a wheelchair to get around. The shooting at Heath High School took place Dec. 1, 1997, less than four months before a shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Carneal’s parole hearing is scheduled to start Monday with testimony from those injured in the shooting and close relatives of those who were killed.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families and businesses in Tangipahoa Parish are a step closer to getting paid for flood damages in 1983 caused by the construction of Interstate 12. A $95 million payment was approved Friday by the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget, The Advocate reports. The committee’s action allows the money to be moved to an escrow account and eventually to the 1,246 victims, 400 families and 96 businesses harmed. “This is the single final payment that resolves the entirety of the lawsuit,” Commissioner of Administration Jay Dardenne said. When those payments will be made is unclear. The state earlier put $6 million into an account for the plaintiffs, which means the total settlement is $101 million, the newspaper reports. Dardenne said he is confident a district judge will approve the payment, which will then allow a special master to decide how much individuals and businesses are owed. Rains on April 6, 1983, flooded about 6,000 homes in the Baton Rouge area. In Tangipahoa Parish, east of Baton Rouge, the newly opened I-12 acted like a large levee and resulted in water from the Tangipahoa River being diverted into homes and businesses. In 1999, a jury decided that the I-12 bridge over the river did not change elevation crossing the river as it should have and awarded plaintiffs in $92 million. However, nothing happened for years while the state Department of Transportation and Development appealed, and the Legislature declined to approve the award.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Wild blueberries were smaller this summer in the barrens of Maine, where the sweet crop expanse dominates treeless plains of sandy soil. Some of the lowbush berries started shriveling or ripened too quickly, hitting the dry ground before harvest season began. The drought-stressed plants were speeding up their production process. Lobster and blueberries go hand-in-hand when people think of Maine. The state’s iconic wild blueberries are one of only three fruits native to North America, and they’re loaded with twice the antioxidants of their ordinary crop equivalent. There are 36,000 acres of commercial wild blueberry land in the state, and the crop’s total value reaches tens of millions of dollars each year. But climate change-induced drought is threatening the superfood fruit, particularly the native lowbush species in Maine where irrigation systems are few and far between. With climate change creating a world of extremes in New England – longer and more frequent dry spells punctuated by deluges of rain within shorter periods of time – the region’s blueberry farmers face the task of adapting. “In every season, there are all of these different weather events that can happen that can increase or decrease the crop,” said Lily Calderwood, extension wild blueberry specialist and assistant professor of horticulture at the University of Maine. “Every year is a new adventure. And because of climate change, we have seasonal droughts that occur more frequently now.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A court hearing has been set for Monday to consider a request from prosecutors to vacate the 2000 murder conviction of Adnan Syed, whose case was chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial.” Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn scheduled the hearing for 2 p.m., The Baltimore Sun reports. The development comes after Baltimore prosecutors filed a motion Wednesday saying a lengthy investigation conducted with the defense had uncovered new evidence that could undermine the conviction of Syed. He has served more than 20 years in prison for the strangling of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, who was 18 when she was killed in 1999. Her body was found buried in a Baltimore park. Syed, 42, has maintained his innocence for decades and captured the attention of millions in 2014 when the debut season of the “Serial” podcast focused on the case and raised doubts about some of the evidence, including cellphone tower data. Prosecutors said in their motion that they weren’t asserting that Syed is innocent but that they lacked confidence “in the integrity of the conviction” and recommended he be released on his own recognizance or bail. “We believe that keeping Mr. Syed detained as we continue to investigate the case with everything that we know now, when we do not have confidence in results of the first trial, would be unjust,” State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Taxpayers can look forward to seeing a return of some of their tax dollars this year, Gov. Charlie Baker said Friday. The announcement came after the state auditor’s office certified that tax revenues exceeded allowable revenues under a little-noticed 1986 law that kicked in due to the state’s soaring tax collections. As a result, taxpayers are on tap to claim a share of more than $2.9 billion dollars. Those eligible will receive refunds automatically as a check sent through the mail or via direct deposit. Distribution of refunds is expected to begin in November. In general, eligible taxpayers will receive a credit in the form of a refund that is approximately 13% of their Massachusetts Tax Year 2021 personal income tax liability, officials said. To be eligible, individuals must have filed a 2021 state tax return on or before Oct. 17, 2022. An individual’s credit may be reduced due to unpaid taxes, unpaid child support or certain other debts.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A judge on Friday signed off on a fund for more than 1,000 people who said they were sexually assaulted by a University of Michigan doctor – an order that allows victims to start collecting a portion of a $490 million settlement negotiated with the school. “The University of Michigan offers its heartfelt apology for the abuse perpetrated by the late Robert Anderson. We hope this settlement helps the healing process for survivors,” said Paul Brown, chairman of the school’s governing board. Anderson died in 2008 after working at the university for nearly 40 years. He was director of the campus Health Service and a physician for multiple sports teams, including football. Former athletes, students and others who had no connection to the university – mostly men – said they were molested by Anderson during routine physicals or other visits. The settlement was announced in January, but the final details took months to wrap up. The university said the deal recently got approval from 98% of claimants. “It’s been a long road,” said Richard Schulte, a lead negotiator for Anderson’s victims. “I’m very happy for the survivors and glad I could get it across the finish line.” Six percent, or $30 million, of the settlement will be set aside for people who step forward later with claims.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Democratic Gov. Tim Walz agreed Saturday to two additional debates against Scott Jensen, following complaints from the Republican challenger that Walz is ducking him. The candidates will meet for an Oct. 18 debate sponsored by a group of television stations that includes KEYC in Mankato, KTTC in Rochester, KBJR in Duluth and KXJB in Fargo, North Dakota. Another debate is scheduled for Oct. 28 on Minnesota Public Radio. Jensen called Walz’s announcement “a classic case of too little, too late” because early voting begins this week. Jensen, a former state senator, and Walz previously debated at Farmfest, a yearly agricultural expo near Redwood Falls. The Walz campaign said that holding three debates matches the number of forums “that were held in the U.S. Senate elections won by Amy Klobuchar in 2018 and Tina Smith in both 2018 and 2020.” Both debates will be streamed online, according to Walz’s campaign.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city’s water crisis isn’t over, even if its boil-water advisory was lifted Thursday. While the state stopped handing out free bottled water at sites around Jackson on Saturday night, the city said water pressure still hasn’t been fully restored, and state health officials said lead in some pipes remains so worrisome that pregnant women and young children should still use bottled water. “The water that’s coming out of my kitchen sink smells like fresh sewage … as soon as you turn it on, it hits you right in the face. It’s horrible,” resident and mother Carey Wooten said earlier this month. “I’ve tried to give one of my dogs the water, but when she smells it, she won’t even touch it. She walks away from it.” Wooten said Friday that the liquid flowing into her kitchen sink still smells like sewage, but not as bad as before, and she’s glad she won’t have to run to distribution sites before their bottled water supplies run out each day. Other residents said Friday that their water remains too discolored to count on, so now they’ll have to rely on water distribution by community-run charities or buy water again themselves, adding insult to injury. Residents, politicians, experts and activists say systemic racism is the root cause of the crisis. White flight that began accelerating around 1980, a decade after the city’s schools began integrating, left less revenue to maintain infrastructure. Middle-class Black people then moved out to escape urban decay and rising crime. State and federal spending never made up the difference.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: A convicted felon accused of livestreaming threats to bomb and kill people while dressed as Batman villain the Joker was sentenced Friday to 60 days in jail, with credit for several months served after his arrest. Jeremy Garnier, 51, of University City, was sentenced after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of making a terrorist threat. Prosecutors reduced the charge from a felony for the March 2020 incident. Garnier told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he never intended to make a threat and pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor to avoid many more months in jail. “I was talking like the Joker,” Garnier said Saturday in an interview. “I was in character. Everybody knew that it was a joke and that I had no intentions of following through with a threat.” Garnier told the Post-Dispatch he served more than 20 years in federal and state prison for robbing a credit union in the 1980s and for other felonies in order to support his crack habit. He said he is now sober and wants to use his platform to raise awareness about the opioid epidemic. He said he has learned another hard lesson. “Think before you act,” he said. “Your actions have repercussions. No matter how trivial and joking I thought it was, people took it seriously.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge has determined three laws passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature to regulate activities on university campuses are unconstitutional, including one that sought to ban transgender women from participating on female collegiate sports teams. Montana’s Constitution gives the state board of regents full authority to govern public college campuses and precludes state lawmakers from imposing their own rules, District Court Judge Rienne McElyea said in a ruling issued Wednesday that was emailed to attorneys in the case Friday. Her ruling noted that the Montana Supreme Court recently affirmed the same conclusion in a challenge to a bill that sought to allow more people to carry guns on campuses. The ruling was the second judicial setback of the week on laws passed by Montana’s 2021 Legislature that affected transgender residents. A different state judge on Thursday clarified that he temporarily blocked health officials from enforcing a state rule that would prevent transgender people from changing the gender on their birth certificate. In response, the Republican-run state on Thursday said it would defy the order. The ruling comes amid a heated national debate over whether transgender women should be allowed to participate in female sports at the high school and collegiate level.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by two Omaha women who sought to have both their names listed as parents on their children’s birth certificates, saying the request conflicts with state law. Lancaster County District Judge Ryan Post said in his ruling last month dismissing the lawsuit that state law requires birth certificates to acknowledge paternity. Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services policy also requires that parents listed on birth certificates be the biological parents of the child, he said. The Nebraska chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sued the state last year on behalf of Erin Porterfield and Kristin Williams. They said the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services repeatedly denied their request to amend one son’s birth certificate in their effort to get full legal recognition as parents of both their sons – one born to each woman conceived through a sperm donor. Porterfield and Williams were in a romantic partnership from 2000 to 2013 – two years before same-sex marriage was legalized in Nebraska. Porterfield gave birth to their first son in 2002, and Williams gave birth to their second son in 2005 before their romantic relationship ended in 2013. But both women continue to share parenting duties. In their lawsuit, the women said that state officials treat unmarried, same-sex couples differently than unmarried, opposite-sex couples, violating their due process and equal protection rights.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The GOP’s nominee for governor said Thursday that he would fight against a national abortion ban if Congress were to pass one. “It’s the vote of the people within the state of Nevada, and I will support that,” Joe Lombardo, who is generally anti-abortion, told reporters while campaigning. “That is an issue that doesn’t need to be in politics.” Nevada voters codified the right to abortion up to 24 weeks into pregnancy into law in a 1990 referendum. Any order to further restrict abortion would have to come from a vote of the people, not the Legislature, unlike in many other states. Last week U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., proposed a near-total abortion ban after 15 weeks. The legislation undermined many GOP candidates’ arguments this summer that the future of abortion rights in the U.S. would be decided by individual states. Lombardo, who is the Clark County sheriff, has long maintained that as governor he would respect the 1990 vote, though he is Catholic and holds anti-abortion views. Still, a nationwide abortion ban would supersede Nevada law, and it is unclear how Lombardo could fight one. Republican April Becker, a candidate in Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, opposes abortion except for instances of rape and incest. But she told NBC News last week that she would vote against a nationwide abortion ban, calling it unconstitutional for Congress to regulate abortion.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A legislator on Friday proposed extending the March deadline to close the state’s troubled youth detention center amid concerns that the current timeline would endanger public safety. Debate over the future of the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester began years ago but has come to a boil amid horrific sexual abuse allegations. Frustrated with spending $13 million a year to operate a 144-bed facility for about a dozen teens, lawmakers set a mandatory March 1 closing date. But the center’s fate remains unclear after lawmakers were unable to agree this year on how to replace it. Rep. Jess Edwards, R-Auburn, said Friday that he plans to introduce two bills for the legislative session that starts in January: one to extend the deadline by three months and another calling for a new 12- to 14-bed facility, with room for 18 if necessary. He told Deputy Health Commissioner Lori Weaver he is concerned about what will happen March 1 without such measures. “The Legislature let you down,” he said. “We just could not reach agreement, so we gave you nothing to go on in terms of money to plan and design it.” Weaver said she can’t predict the center’s population six months in advance, but based on the current situation, “there would be a definite impact on public safety” if the deadline arrived without further guidance.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Township: In 2020, as saxophonist Steve Barlotta was recovering from a near-fatal bout with COVID-19 that included 24 days on a ventilator, the Jackson resident made a promise to everyone who treated him at CentraState Medical Center. “He was like, ‘I’m going to play a concert out in the parking lot for everyone,” said Shannon Lenahan, a neurologic clinical specialist who helped Barlotta bounce back from near-total paralysis. “We were like, ‘OK,’ People say stuff like that all the time, and they go home and get sidetracked.” Barlotta did not get sidetracked. On Wednesday, he and his band Sensational Soul Cruisers performed a 90-minute concert on the hospital’s campus as a thank-you to the doctors, nurses and rehab therapists who saved his life and restored his health. “To see it actually happen and come to fruition was really special,” Lenahan said. “He didn’t forget. He was a little emotional, and it was a little emotional for us to be able to say, ‘This is why we did it.’ ” Barlotta, who has played alongside Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Gary U.S. Bonds and the Monkees, capped the show with two numbers that came straight from the heart: “You’re All I Need to Get By” and “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” both made famous by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s green chile season is in full swing as the aroma of fresh roasted peppers permeates the air, but growers and exporters in Mexico are just as busy, and that’s causing a crunch at the international border. Authorities said last Monday that agricultural inspectors with U.S. Customs and Border Protection have been processing dozens of chile imports daily at the port of entry in Columbus, New Mexico. They’re looking for any pests in the shipments that could affect domestic production in the state where green chile is a signature crop and a cultural icon. “Chile is a huge crop for farmers in New Mexico, so it is important that CBP agriculture specialists identify and stop any dangerous pests from making it into the state and potentially spreading,” acting Columbus Port Director Sam Jimenez said in a statement. As part of “Operation Hot Chile,” Jimenez said agricultural inspectors are being assigned to Columbus from other locations to help with the increased traffic. The inspectors will process around 100 chile shipments a day during the busiest part of the season. Imports have grown significantly each season, with inspectors seeing a nearly 25% jump since 2016. Officials are expecting continued growth this year. Despite more imports, New Mexico farmers are seeing higher yields from their crops, and the state’s reputation for growing what many have anointed as “the best green chile in the world” is expanding, said Travis Day, executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Yeshiva University has abruptly suspended student club activity in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision last week that ordered the school to recognize – for now – an LGBTQ student group. In an email to students, university officials said Friday that the school would “hold off on all undergraduate club activities while it immediately takes steps to follow the roadmap provided by the U.S. Supreme Court to protect YU’s religious freedom.” On Wednesday, the high court cleared the way for the LGBTQ group, YU Pride Alliance, to gain official recognition from the Jewish university in New York. The undergraduate group describes itself as “a supportive space for all students, of all sexual orientations and gender identities, to feel respected, visible, and represented.” By a 5-4 vote Wednesday, the justices lifted a temporary hold on a court order that requires Yeshiva University to recognize the group, even as a legal fight continues in New York courts. Two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, sided with the court’s three liberal justices to form a majority. The disagreement among the justices appears to be mostly about procedure, and the case is being closely watched by other faith-based institutions.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s hospitals and hospital systems on Friday unveiled an offer that could shake up stalled negotiations to pass legislation that would expand Medicaid to cover hundreds of thousands of low-income adults. The North Carolina Healthcare Association said the offer sent to Republican legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper also contained reforms to some state laws that require regulatory approval before certain medical buildings can be constructed or services offered in a region. Senate leader Phil Berger this summer accused the association of refusing to compromise on “certificate of need” rules. Changes to these rules were contained in the Senate version of an expansion measure approved in June. Berger said they were needed to increase the supply of medical services that would be needed to treat the growing Medicaid population. Cooper, a big expansion proponent, told reporters last week that it would make sense for hospitals to negotiate with Berger on those rules, which hospitals contend help community facilities that disproportionately serve the uninsured or underinsured remain open. “Our board of trustees has made the difficult decision to propose certificate of need law reforms,” board chair Dr. Roxie Wells said in a news release.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state would spend up to $80 million over the next two years to address child care under a proposal pitched Tuesday by Gov. Doug Burgum. The GOP-led Legislature meets again in January and will consider the plan that also includes a child care tax credit for low- to middle-income families, expansion of child care assistance, and matching money for businesses that offer their employees child care. The second-term Republican governor said the lack of available and affordable child care for families contributes to workforce shortages that have hamstrung the state’s economy. Adequate and affordable child care helps attract and retain companies in the state, he said. North Dakota has “tens of thousands” of unfilled jobs, and many families “have to make a choice to work and pay for child care or not work at all,” Burgum said. North Dakota has more than 64,000 children under the age of 5 in some 45,000 households across the state, Burgum said. The state’s more than 800 licensed child care providers employ more than 6,000 people, he said. “In spite of that … working families are experiencing a child care crisis,” Burgum said. “There are more children than there are slots.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s efforts to curb gerrymandering are not working, and voters must once again amend the Ohio Constitution to take politics completely out of the process, the retiring chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Thursday. The current redistricting commission, created by constitutional amendment in 2015, has had no discernible effect on gerrymandering, and as a result voters this fall will elect candidates based on unconstitutional legislative districts, Republican Maureen O’Connor said in her annual and final state of the judiciary speech. A new amendment must create a commission that restricts partisan politics by prohibiting elected officials from serving, O’Connor said. The current Ohio Redistricting Commission consists of elected lawmakers and state officeholders, including the governor, and has a 5-2 Republican majority. Instead, commission members must consist of “sensible people who are not driven by politics but rather by what’s fair,” O’Connor said. “Fair representation and justice.” O’Connor’s remarks echoed the position she took in January when the court first ruled – in a 4-3 decision with O’Connor in the majority – that initial maps drawn by the commission were unconstitutional. The court made similar rulings four more times before a federal court ordered Ohio to use the third set of Statehouse maps approved by the Ohio Redistricting Commission, maps the state Supreme Court had also found unconstitutional.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An embattled jail is facing even more criticism after an inmate was able to leave the booking area unsupervised and raped a handcuffed female inmate who was awaiting release, according to charges filed Thursday. The victim “was handcuffed to a bar attached to a wall in the receiving area of the Oklahoma County jail and unable to escape” when Donta Ramone Thomas, 44, was able to remove her pants and rape her July 19, according to charging documents submitted by District Attorney David Prater. Jail surveillance video of the incident showed Thomas ignored orders to stand with his back to the wall and wait for other inmates to be processed after he was booked into jail on assault charges. “Thomas disregarded these instructions and walked away from the area,” according to an affidavit. “He walked down the hallway toward the old medical screening area, where (the victim) was sitting, handcuffed to a bar.” The incident is the latest at the jail, where a nine-member trust took over the jail from the sheriff’s office in 2020, tasked with managing its operation and finances. Oklahoma County’s Board of Commissioners unanimously approved of the trust the previous year. “This is another example of the jail trust failing to protect those who they are responsible to care for,” Prater said.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: A 23-acre property near Willamette Falls has a new name, based on its old name. Formerly known as the Blue Heron Paper Mill, the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde has renamed the site Tumwata Village in recognition of the native name for the falls, tumwata, and the ancestors who called the site home. “As a name, Tumwata Village represents the Grand Ronde tribe’s connection to the falls, as well as the sacred lands and practices of our ancestors,” said Cheryle A. Kennedy, chairwoman of the Grand Ronde tribe and descendant of the Clackamas people. The Grand Ronde tribe’s connection to the falls goes back to creation, Kennedy said. Pre-European contact, the land was home to her ancestors, including the village of the Clowewalla– the Willamette band of Tumwaters. It was also the Kosh-Huk-shix Village of Clackamas people. They lived and used the area to hunt and fish before the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855 led to the forcible removal of the tribal populations from the falls area to the Grand Ronde reservation. Even after removal, people still went back to fish and gather at the falls. “The connection has remained,” Kennedy said. The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde began the process of acquiring the land around the falls at least two decades ago, Kennedy said. The purchase was finalized in 2019.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More than 1.7 million public and private school students in the state will be able to get breakfast for free under a plan that will begin next month and run through the school year, officials announced. The $21.5 million plan will be paid for with money from the previous year’s School Food Services General Fund appropriation. Schools that participate in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs will receive support from the program. The pandemic-era federal aid that made school meals available for free to all public school students ended this past school year, despite a push in Congress to extend it. In Pennsylvania, officials say breakfast consumption under the free meals program increased by 16%, compared to pre-pandemic levels. Nationwide, other states have adopted legislation to provide free meals regardless of income level.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: Short-term rentals such as those offered through websites like Airbnb and VRBO could be severely restricted as town officials contemplate an ordinance to limit them to owner-occupied units in just a few zoning districts. The Warwick Planning Board, in front of a nearly empty meeting room Wednesday night, voted to ask the planning staff who helped draft the ordinance to make a recommendation to the City Council, with instructions to ensure that rules around accessory dwelling units conform to a new state law. Planner Tom Kravitz said he was directed to get an opinion on the ordinance from the board. However, aside from asking Kravitz to issue a recommendation and worries about the state law change to accessory dwelling units, the Planning Board members did not discuss the regulation. Kravitz said the owner-occupied regulation should reduce the chances for complaints around parking and noise, citing the example of Newport, which now requires owners to occupy the units they are renting. Making the owner live in or adjacent to the property being rented provides oversight over guests, he said. The proposed zoning change cites short-term rentals as a source of “noise, congestion, pollution and disorderly behavior” and of generally disturbing the peace.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Lawsuits filed to stop the removal of memorials to Confederate leaders and a pro-slavery congressman have been dropped. The Post and Courier reports that the American Heritage Association helped fund one of the lawsuits. It had been filed by descendants of John C. Calhoun, a former congressman and vice president who died before the Civil War, opposing the city of Charleston’s removal of Calhoun’s statue. The association also had filed a lawsuit opposing the removal of a Robert E. Lee Memorial Highway marker from the campus of a charter school in Charleston and the renaming of an auditorium that had been named after Christopher Memminger, a treasury secretary of the Confederacy. The stone-and-metal monument to Lee was removed in July 2021 and placed in storage. The city made a deal with the South Carolina State Museum to take the statue of Calhoun. Both suits had been filed in state court. The highway marker and auditorium lawsuit was dropped Sept. 13. The Calhoun lawsuit was dropped Sept. 15, the newspaper reports. AHA President Brett Barry declined to comment on the status of the Calhoun case, despite the descendants’ request for dismissal. “Charleston monuments are an integral part of the city’s historical and artistic American landscape,” Barry told The Post and Courier.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s corn harvest may not have much juice this year. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service’s latest crop production report, the state’s crop yield is estimated at 138 bushels per acre – a number nowhere near the record-breaking harvest of 2020, when farmers gathered a staggering 162 bushels per acre. In the northeastern counties, springtime floods and incessant rainfall oversaturated the region with moisture. The precipitation flooded some fields, preventing producers from being able to plant their seeds during a critical planting window. “Things did turn drier up in the northeast corner over the last two weeks, but, really, the question is whether that corn actually got planted,” said DaNita Murray, executive director of South Dakota Corn Growers Association. John Horter is one producer who received a mixed bag from the wet spring. On his farm in western Day County, he called the rains “timely” and the weather conditions “almost perfect.” The past two weeks of heat, he said, are drying out his fields just in time for the harvest. But there’s a lot of lost potential: The corn in his fields looks good, he said, but the rains flooded what’s traditionally his highest yielding areas of the farm, which kept him from being able to plant those acres.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The police officers who fatally shot a man walking on an interstate will not face criminal charges, a district attorney announced Friday. A lawsuit filed last week by the widow of Landon Eastep alleges that law enforcement used excessive force and should be liable for his death in Nashville. Chelesy Eastep argued it was unfair to expect her husband to act reasonably with multiple guns pointed at him. However, Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk said in a statement that after reviewing the case, Eastep’s actions “were designed to cause officers to perceive an immediate threat.” Eastep’s encounter with police began with a state trooper checking on him as he sat on a guardrail along Interstate 65 the afternoon of Jan. 27. After a brief interaction, Eastep pulled a box cutter, and the trooper called for backup, police said. Many other officers arrived, blocking traffic along the normally bustling travel corridor in both directions as a helicopter circle overhead. Authorities pleaded with Eastep, 37, to surrender while they kept their guns drawn. “During this encounter with law enforcement officers, Mr. Eastep became emotional, began sobbing, and reportedly started cutting his wrists a few times with a box cutter from his pocket,” Chelesy Eastep’s lawsuit says.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A judge on Friday expanded her order blocking the state from investigating families of transgender youth who have received gender-affirming medical care. Judge Amy Clark Meachum issued a temporary injunction preventing the state from investigating members of the LGBTQ advocacy group PFLAG Inc. over the medical care. The group has more than 600 members in Texas. Meachum in July issued an order blocking the investigations against two families of transgender children who had sued the state. Meachum’s order Friday also blocked the state from investigating the family of another teen who had sued, though the family said after the lawsuit was filed that they learned the investigation against them had been dropped. Meachum wrote that without the order, the families would “suffer probable, imminent, and irreparable injury in the interim.” The ruling was the latest against the state’s efforts to label gender-affirming care as child abuse. The Texas Supreme Court in May allowed the state to investigate parents of transgender youth for child abuse while also ruling in favor of one family who was among the first contacted by child welfare officials following the order by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Gov. Spencer Cox took to Twitter on Saturday night to call out the behavior of University of Oregon fans during a game against Brigham Young University. UO’s student section, The Pit Crew, has since issued a public apology, as have university officials. In a video posted to Twitter, Oregon fans in the school’s student section can be seen chanting “(expletive) the Mormons.” BYU is a private university sponsored by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Cox retweeted the video, calling it “religious bigotry alive and celebrated in Oregon.” Other videos and photos of attendees who also allegedly participated in the chanting were posted on Twitter. The Pit Crew on Twitter issued an apology Saturday night, saying its members “do not condone or support any hateful speech directed towards one’s religion and are ashamed of those who participated.” In contrast, BYU kicked off the game by honoring former Oregon tight end Spencer Webb before the game, running onto the field with a flag bearing Webb’s No. 18. Webb, who would’ve been a junior this season, died in July during an outing at Triangle Lake.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The U.S. Department of Labor is getting involved after finding some businesses in the state have failed to protect teenage workers. There has been a national trend of increased child-labor law violations, which had been steadily decreasing until 2015, when the numbers began to tick up again. The Department of Labor’s Northern New England office said it “has taken strong enforcement actions” including conducting investigations and engaging in outreach in order to decrease federal labor violations at businesses across the region. A news release from the labor department cited examples of violations in the food service industry this year at McDonald’s and Dunkin’ franchises. At nine New England McDonald’s locations run by Coughlin Inc., 142 workers ages 14 and 15 worked more hours than federal law permits. And an investigation found 18 workers ages 14 and 15 illegally operated an oven or a fryer without a device to automatically raise and lower the basket. Two minors were burned, and the company paid $109,125 in penalties. Vermont Donut Enterprises LLC and related companies running 12 Dunkin’ franchise locations were also cited for not adhering to restrictions on 14- and 15-year-old workers. There were 44 violations involving hours worked and 17 violations for operating high-speed ovens. A 16-year-old was illegally allowed to drive a vehicle between two locations. Six minors received burns, and the company was fined $15,737 in civil penalties.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has rewritten the state’s model policies for the treatment of transgender students, issuing guidance for school divisions that would roll back some accommodations and tighten parental notification requirements. The new model policies from the Virginia Department of Education, which were posted online Friday, say students’ participation in certain school programming and use of school facilities like bathrooms or locker rooms should be based on their biological sex, with modifications offered only to the extent required under federal law. The policies also say that students who are minors must be referred to by the name and pronouns in their official records, unless a parent approves the use of something else. Regarding parental notification, the guidelines say school divisions may not encourage teachers to conceal information about a student’s gender from his or her parents. And they say parents must be given an opportunity to object before counseling services pertaining to gender are offered. The guidance is subject to a 30-day public comment period that opens later this month. Then, in accordance with a 2020 state law, local school boards must adopt policies that are “consistent with” the department’s but may be “more comprehensive,” the document says.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: After 21/ 2 years of inspection and repair work, authorities have reopened the West Seattle Bridge, the main route between the peninsula of West Seattle and the rest of the city. The Seattle Department of Transportation announced that the bridge had reopened Saturday night, even as crews continued removing some barricades and detour signs. Officials closed the span in March 2020 after cracks were found to be growing rapidly. The repair work included 60 miles of steel cables that form the new backbone of the bridge. Each of the cables was anchored into new specialized concrete blocks woven into the structure. The department said crews also installed a network of reinforced carbon fiber sheets wrapped inside and outside the bridge walls and injected 240 gallons of epoxy into cracked concrete. Authorities say the bridge is now much stronger and more resilient to seasonal temperature changes and will last for decades to come. Engineers will continue to monitor the bridge using cameras, sensors and inspections.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republican Gov. Jim Justice on Friday signed into law a ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, making West Virginia the second state to enact a law prohibiting the procedure since the U.S. Supreme Court’s June ruling overturning its constitutional protection. The bill will go into effect immediately, except for the criminal penalties, which will go into effect in 90 days, Justice said. He described the legislation on Twitter as “a bill that protects life.” “I said from the beginning that if WV legislators brought me a bill that protected life and included reasonable and logical exceptions I would sign it, and that’s what I did today,” he said. The ban has exemptions for medical emergencies and for rape and incest victims until eight weeks of pregnancy for adults and 14 weeks for those under the age of 18. Victims must report their assault to law enforcement 48 hours before the procedure. Minors can report to the police or a doctor, who then must tell police. The bill requires abortions to be performed by a physician at a hospital – a provision that at least two Republican lawmakers have said was intended to shut down abortions at the Women’s Health Center, which has provided the procedure since 1976 and was the state’s sole abortion clinic. Providers who perform illegal abortions can face up to 10 years in prison.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A local alderman whose name appears on the membership rolls of a far-right extremist group has resigned, citing safety concerns for his family. Madison Alderman Gary Halverson was among hundreds of elected officials, military members and law enforcement officers who were on a leaked list of Oath Keepers members, the group that’s accused of playing a key role in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Halverson said his resignation follows some vandalism at his house, which he said has triggered symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder for his wife. “For anyone who has PTSD, or lived with someone who does, knows that when something happens that is triggering, it is absolutely terrifying, and that terror can last for days or weeks or longer,” Halverson said in a statement. He did not specify what damage was done to his property or how it might be linked to his Oath Keepers membership. Halverson was elected in April 2021 and had one year left in his term. He said he joined the Oath Keepers in mid-2020 without vetting the organization. “I thought I joined an organization that welcomed veterans who cared about our democracy,” Halverson said earlier this month. “I was misled and I terminated the membership two months later in Aug 2020.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State transportation officials have asked the Biden administration to ease proposed federal requirements to receive funding toward a network of electric vehicle chargers. EVs account for 0.1% of vehicle registrations in Wyoming, and state Department of Transportation Director Luke Reiner told federal officials that it would be “irresponsible and illogical” to spend now on requirements that include four charging ports at stations every 50 miles. It will be more than 20 years before there’s enough EV adoption in the state to worry about lines at a four-port station, Reiner said. So instead of concentrating solely on major highway corridors, Reiner said, the federal money should also be used in areas away from interstates that attract lots of tourists, such as Yellowstone National Park. “Most of our EVs will be tourist traffic,” Reiner said Wednesday. “The idea is if you’re a nice lady from Iowa with an electric car, and you want to get to Yellowstone, we want to get you there. ... We want to make sure these stations are in populated areas so there’s more chance of success.” Wyoming asked for exceptions from the mileage requirement for 11 stretches of highway. Federal officials have not yet responded, Reiner said, and the state’s plan is still pending.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}]}

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/politics/jack-smith-special-counsel/index.html", "title": "Who is Jack Smith, the special counsel named in the Trump ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nJack Smith, the special counsel announced by Attorney General Merrick Garland on Friday to oversee the criminal investigations into the retention of classified documents at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, is a long-time prosecutor who has overseen a variety of high-profile cases during a career that spans decades.\n\nSmith’s experience ranges from prosecuting a sitting US senator to bringing cases against gang members who were ultimately convicted of murdering New York City police officers. In recent years, Smith has prosecuted war crimes at The Hague. His career in multiple parts of the Justice Department, as well as in international courts, has allowed him to keep a relatively low-profile in the oftentimes brassy legal industry.\n\nHis experience and resume will allow him, at least at first, to fly underneath the type of political blowback that quickly met former special counsel Robert Mueller’s team. It also shows he is adept at managing complex criminal cases related to both public corruption and national security – and that he has practice making challenging decisions with political implications.\n\nSmith is widely expected to be tasked with making policy decisions around whether to charge a former president of the United States. Garland’s statements on Friday and the recent steps taken in the Mar-a-Lago and January 6 investigations have signaled that, at the very least, Donald Trump is under investigation and could potentially be charged with a crime.\n\n“He knows how to do high-profile cases. He’s independent. He will not be influenced by anybody,” said Greg Andres, a former member of Mueller’s team.\n\nAndres, who has known Smith since the late 1990s when they started at a US attorney’s office together and ultimately became co-chiefs of the office’s criminal division, said it’s the breadth of Smith’s experience that will enable him to withstand the public scrutiny and make tough judgment calls.\n\n“He will evaluate the evidence and understand what type of case should be charged or not. He has the type of experience to make those judgments,” said Andres.\n\n“He understands the courtroom. He understands how to try a case. He knows how to prove a case,” he added. “Particularly in these circumstances it will be critical to understand what types of evidence is required to prove the case in court.”\n\nIn a statement following his announcement, Smith pledged to conduct the investigations “independently and in the best traditions of the Department of Justice.”\n\n“The pace of the investigations will not pause or flag under my watch. I will exercise independent judgment and will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate,” Smith said.\n\nOne former colleague highlighted that Smith has prosecuted members of both parties.\n\n“He’s going to be really aggressive,” the person said, adding that “things are going to speed up.” Smith, they said, “operates very quickly” and has a unique ability to quickly determine the things that are important to a case and doesn’t waste time “hand-wringing over things that are real sideshows.”\n\nIn court, Smith comes off as very down-to-earth and relatable, this person said, characterizing that as a good attribute to have as a prosecutor.\n\nSmith also will not care about the politics surrounding the case, they said, adding he has very thick skin and will “do what he’s going to do.”\n\nA career prosecutor\n\nSmith began his career as an assistant district attorney with the New York County District Attorney’s Office in 1994. He worked in the Eastern District of New York in 1999 as an assistant US attorney, where he prosecuted cases including civil rights violations and police officers murdered by gangs, according to the Justice Department.\n\nAs a prosecutor in Brooklyn, New York, one of Smith’s biggest and most high-profile cases was prosecuting gang member Ronell Wilson for the murder of two New York City police department detectives during an undercover gun operation in Staten Island.\n\nWilson was convicted and sentenced to death, the first death penalty case in New York at the time in 50 years, though a judge later found he was ineligible for the death penalty.\n\nMoe Fodeman, who worked with Smith at EDNY, called him “one of the best trial lawyers I have ever seen.”\n\n“He is a phenomenal investigator; he leaves no stone unturned. He drills down to get to the true facts,” Fodeman said.\n\nFodeman, who is still friends with Smith, said he is a “literally insane” cyclist and triathlete.\n\nBeginning in 2008, Smith worked for the International Criminal Court and oversaw war crimes investigations under the Office of the Prosecutor for two years.\n\nIn 2010, he became chief of the Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department, where he oversaw litigation of public corruption cases. Lanny Breuer, the former assistant attorney general for the DOJ’s Criminal Division who recruited Smith, said his onetime employee was “a terrific prosecutor” with a “real sense of fairness.”\n\n“If you are going to have a special counsel, in my view, and you want someone who is going to be fearless, but fair, and not going to be intimidated and not overly bureaucratic, that’s Jack – he is all of these things,” Breuer told CNN.\n\n“Smith brings cases quickly. … He doesn’t sit on cases. He is a person of action,” Breuer added.\n\nAfter his stint at the Public Integrity Section, Smith was appointed first assistant US attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee in 2015.\n\nThough he is not widely known in Washington, DC, legal circles, Smith is described as a consummate public servant.\n\nAbout a decade ago, he hired waves of line prosecutors into the Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department, supervising dozens over his years in charge there.\n\nBrian Kidd, whom Smith hired at the unit, recalled how his boss walked him through every step of a complicated racketeering case against corrupt police officers.\n\n“He was not going to tolerate a politically motivated prosecution,” Kidd said. “And he has an incredible ability to motivate the people working with him and under him. He’s incredibly supportive of his team.”\n\nSmith handled some of the most high-profile political corruption cases in recent memory – to mixed outcomes.\n\nHe was the head of the public integrity unit when then-Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was indicted in 2014, and was in meetings with the defense team and involved in decision-making leading up to the charges, according to a person familiar with the case.\n\nMcDonnell was initially convicted of receiving gifts for political favors, but then his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court.\n\nSmith was also at the helm of the unit when the DOJ failed to convict at trial former Senator and vice presidential candidate John Edwards.\n\nA Republican source familiar with Smith’s oversight of the investigation into former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay commended Smith’s non-biased approach, saying that he ultimately made a “just” decision to conclude the investigation without alleging DeLay committed any crime.\n\nIn recent years while working at The Hague, he has not lived in the United States. He’s no longer on the US Triathlon team but is still a competitive biker.\n\nSmith took over as acting US Attorney when David Rivera departed in early 2017 before leaving the Justice Department later that year and becoming vice president of litigation for the Hospital Corporation of America. In 2018, he became chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague, where he investigated war crimes in Kosovo.\n\n“Throughout his career, Jack Smith has built a reputation as an impartial and determined prosecutor, who leads teams with energy and focus to follow the facts wherever they lead,” Garland said during the announcement on Friday. “Mr. Smith is the right choice to complete these matters in an even-handed and urgent manner.”\n\nSmith interviewed as part of Republican-led IRS probe\n\nIn May 2014, the House Oversight Committee interviewed Smith behind closed doors as part of the Republican-led investigation into the alleged IRS targeting of conservative groups. Then-Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa launched the probe following a 2013 inspector general report that found delays in the processing of applications by certain conservative groups and requesting information from them that was later deemed unnecessary.\n\nRepublicans sought testimony from Smith, who at the time was Public Integrity section chief, due to his involvement with arranging a 2010 meeting between Justice Department officials and then-IRS official Lois Lerner, the official at the center of the IRS scandal. The meeting had been convened to discuss the “evolving legal landscape” of campaign finance law following the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, according to a May 2014 letter written by Issa and Rep. Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican who is expected to be House Judiciary chairman next year.\n\n“It is apparent that the Department’s leadership, including Public Integrity Section Chief Jack Smith, was closely involved in engaging with the IRS in wake of Citizens United and political pressure from prominent Democrats to address perceived problems with the decision,” Issa and Jordan wrote in the letter seeking Smith’s testimony.\n\nSmith testified that his office “had a dialogue” with the FBI about opening investigations related to politically active non-profits following the meeting with Lerner, but did not ultimately do so, according to a copy of his interview obtained by CNN.\n\nSmith explained that he had asked for the meeting with the IRS because he wanted to learn more about the legal landscape of political non-profits following the Citizens United decision because he was relatively new to the public integrity section. He said that Lerner explained it would be difficult if not impossible to bring a case on the abuse of tax-exempt status.\n\nSmith repeated at several points in the interview that the Justice Department did not pursue any investigations due to politics.\n\n“I want to be clear – it would be more about looking at the issue, looking at whether it made sense to open investigations,” he said. “If we did, you know, how would you go about doing this? Is there predication, a basis to open an investigation? Things like that. I can’t say as I sit here now specifically, you know, the back-and-forth of that discussion. I can just tell you that – because I know one of your concerns is that organizations were targeted. And I can tell you that we, Public Integrity, did not open any investigations as a result of those discussions and that we certainly, as you know, have not brought any cases as a result of that.”\n\nSmith also testified that he was not aware of anyone at the Justice Department placing pressure on the IRS – and that he was never pressured to investigate any political groups.\n\n“No. And maybe I can stop you guys. I know there’s a series of these questions. I’ve never been asked these things, and anybody who knows me would never even consider asking me to do such a thing,” Smith said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Kara Scannell Jeremy Herb Katelyn Polantz Chandelis Duster", "Zachary Cohen", "Kara Scannell", "Jeremy Herb", "Katelyn Polantz", "Chandelis Duster"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/05/18/k9-advantix-flea-tick-medicine-generic-bayer-tevra/70220325007/", "title": "'No generics' deals blocked pet owners from cheaper flea-and-tick ...", "text": "Emily Le Coz, USA TODAY and Johnathan Hettinger, Investigate Midwest\n\nPet owners paying for Advantage II and K9 Advantix II topical flea-and-tick treatments could have saved hundreds of dollars by now had they switched to the generic versions that first hit the market six years ago.\n\nBut first, they would have had to find them.\n\nCheaper equivalents for the blockbuster brands, which both kill and repel pests, have quietly eluded consumers for years. Even today, they’re nowhere to be found at many of the biggest pet specialty stores, like PetSmart or Petco. And they’re absent from popular online pet pharmacies like Chewy.com or PetMed Express.\n\nTheir elusiveness is not by accident, according to a federal lawsuit by one of the generic’s makers, but a scheme by the brand-name products’ company to block competition.\n\nFiled in the U.S. District Court in Northern California, the lawsuit by Tevra Brands offers a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse of the multibillion-dollar pet medication market, where a few major companies have a stranglehold on pricing. Tevra’s suit claims it lost tens of millions of dollars because Bayer Animal Health, a former subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical giant, conspired to maintain its monopoly over the treatment it created.\n\nTevra sells its generic topical treatments for cats and dogs on its website, on Amazon and elsewhere, but the company argues that Bayer prevented it from reaching pet owners where they’re most likely to shop and depriving them of a better deal.\n\nIts line includes TevraPet Activate II for dogs and ActiSpot II for cats, as well as Vetality Avantect II for dogs and Advotect II for cats. Its ActiSpot II six-dose treatment for large cats cost $30 on Amazon.com, as of May 15. The brand-name equivalent, Advantage II for cats, cost more than twice as much – $64 – on Chewy.com.\n\nUnlike the human pharmaceutical industry which abounds in cheap alternatives once brand-name patent protection expires, the pet med market offers relatively few choices.\n\nJust 14% of federally approved animal drugs have a generic version, according to the Generic Animal Drug Alliance. Meanwhile, generics in human health care last year accounted for 9 out of 10 filled prescriptions, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAmong the many reasons for the difference is that human health insurance requires generic drug substitution whenever possible, which has spurred the development and availability of low-cost alternatives. Pet insurance is nowhere near as widespread or influential.\n\nThat allows pioneer drug companies – those that own the brand-name or patented versions – to dominate much of the pet medication market. And industry insiders have long decried their outsize leverage through exclusivity agreements.\n\nSuch agreements block vendors – including pet stores, online pharmacies and wholesale distributors that supply retailers and veterinarians – from selling products that directly compete with their brand-name goods.\n\nTied to those deals are often lucrative financial incentives such as discounts and rebates that vendors can ill afford to turn down, especially if their rivals are taking advantage of them.\n\nIt’s ‘price-fixing in its purest form’\n\nExclusive dealing is a common and legal practice in many industries, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces consumer protection laws. The practice can encourage distributors and retailers to specialize in specific products and offer consumers related services and amenities.\n\nWhen big companies use them to choke rivals out of the market, however, the deals become unlawful and the FTC can intervene.\n\nThe agency has known about the dubious use of exclusivity deals in the pet medication market since at least 2012; industry stakeholders complained about it during a public workshop the FTC hosted that year “to examine competition and consumer protection issues in the pet medications industry.”\n\nA representative of the Generic Animal Drug Alliance told the agency she knew of at least two large drug companies whose agreements banned national distributors from carrying the generic versions, or any similar versions, of their brand-name products.\n\nThe alliance’s then-chairperson, Jennifer S. Johansson, said in a statement sent to the FTC that such deals limit the availability of generic treatments and drive up consumer prices. She didn’t name any companies.\n\nIn an email to USA TODAY, Vicky Graham, a spokeswoman for the FTC declined to comment on whether the agency investigated any such complaints raised during or after the workshop. It appears, though, the FTC took no action; it deemed the evidence and effects of the agreements presented at the workshop contradictory, according to a staff summary report.\n\nThe report was published in 2015, just as Tevra Brands was being formed. Two years later, the Omaha, Nebraska-based startup says it learned for itself the effects of the agreements.\n\nIt’s “price-fixing in its purest form,” Tevra said in its complaint against Bayer, which it initially filed in 2019 and has amended twice. “The only losers in the deal were consumers who were forced to pay higher prices, generic manufacturers such as Tevra that were foreclosed from competition, and the rule of law as enshrined in the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act.”\n\nThe Sherman Act prohibits actual or attempted monopolization, as well as any contracts and conspiracies that result in the unreasonable restraint of trade. The Clayton Act bans certain discriminatory prices or services between merchants, as well as mergers and acquisitions that restrict competition.\n\nTevra claimed in its lawsuit that Bayer’s scheme cost it more than $76 million in net profits that it would have earned on the sale of those products from 2017 through 2021.\n\nBayer denied Tevra’s allegations in court filings. It said Tevra failed to make a case that Bayer intended to, or even succeeded in, blocking generics from the market. Bayer claimed that its agreements with distributors and retailers were legal and provided only “modest incentives” for exclusivity but did not require it.\n\nEven if the deals blocked Tevra’s generics from the online and brick-and-mortar pet specialty stores – which Bayer denied – Bayer said Tevra could still sell elsewhere, including directly to consumers on websites like Amazon, or through veterinarians.\n\nBut Tevra said in its lawsuit that it does not market its over-the-counter generics to veterinarians, most of whom prefer private-label brands. And its lack of name recognition makes direct-to-consumer sales difficult. Without access to the biggest pet retailers, the lawsuit said, Tevra's financial aspirations were dashed.\n\nBayer sold its entire animal health division in 2020 to Elanco, an animal health business spun off from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co., for $7.6 billion. Although Elanco is not named as a party in the lawsuit, it is now responsible for defending the case. It said in its latest Securities and Exchange Commission report in March that it intends “to defend our position vigorously.”\n\nUSA TODAY asked Elanco if the company has maintained any exclusivity agreements in effect at the time of the acquisition, but Colleen Dekker, a spokeswoman declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Elanco’s attorneys did not respond to requests for comments.\n\nBayer’s parent company, Bayer AG, is no longer a party in the case, nor is its Bayer Healthcare subsidiary, both of which initially were named as defendants, along with its former animal health division. Bayer AG spokesman Philipp Blank had no comment other than to note the company’s lack of involvement.\n\nTevra did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Polsinelli Law Firm, which represents Tevra, said attorneys there are unable to discuss the lawsuit.\n\nThe case, which has survived several motions to dismiss, is still in the discovery and deposition stages. It could go to trial as early as July 2024.\n\n‘If I lose Bayer, I’ll get fired’\n\nEven before it won federal approval to sell its line of generics in May 2017, Tevra had hired a sales team to pitch it to major pet product distributors, retailers and e-pharmacies for pets.\n\nTevra had expected to sell nearly $10 million of the topicals the first year and projected steady annual sales revenues of nearly $30 million by 2019. Instead, it sold less than $600,000 worth in the first year as, one by one, distributors and retailers turned the company down, citing the “no generics” agreements with Bayer, its lawsuit claims.\n\nThat included at least two major national distributors: Veterinary Service and Animal Supply Company.\n\nIn March 2017, according to the lawsuit, a Veterinary Service representative told a Tevra salesperson they weren’t sure whether the “Bayer agreement” allowed them to purchase another product made with imidacloprid and would have to find out. Imidacloprid, an insecticide, is the key ingredient in both the brand name and generic versions of the flea and tick treatment.\n\nUltimately, the company chose not to purchase Tevra’s topicals.\n\nAnimal Supply Company “was even more explicit when its agent told a Tevra salesperson in March 2021 that they could not purchase ‘any products with Imidacloprid’ from Tevra because of an agreement with Bayer, and added ‘If I lose Bayer, I’ll get fired,’” according to the lawsuit.\n\nSimilar statements were made by representatives of PetMed Express, which owns 1-800-PetMeds; Drs. Foster & Smith, which is now Petco.com; and Chewy.com, the lawsuit said.\n\nA representative of Chewy.com told Tevra if they bought its imidacloprid generics, they’d forfeit a huge rebate from Bayer.\n\nWithout the rebate, the lawsuit said, Chewy.com, “would lose $3 million dollars in net margin taking into account the reduced Bayer rebate vs. what they thought they would make” selling Tevra’s imidacloprid products.\n\nAt least one national pet retail chain that bought Tevra’s products still got discounts from Bayer by agreeing not to say the generics “compared to” the brand name versions in store displays or on websites and advertisements, the lawsuit said. The discount applied not just to the spot-on treatments, but an entire bundle of Bayer products, including the popular Seresto flea-and-tick collar.\n\n“This restriction severely handicapped the sale of the generic Imidacloprid topical at Pet Supplies Plus,” Tevra said in its lawsuit.\n\nIn court filings, defendants dispute Tevra’s allegations that Bayer had a “no generics” agreement with retailers or that it used discounts to block generic competition.\n\nBayer’s marketing efforts “in no way point to the existence of an exclusive dealing arrangement, much less the who, what, where, and when of an extra-contractual conspiracy,” defendants said in a 2021 motion to dismiss the case. They described Bayer’s purchase agreements with retailers as being of “short duration and easy terminability.”\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the vendors cited in the lawsuit for comment. Petco.com and Chewy.com did not respond; PetMed and Animal Supply declined to comment.\n\nLoyal Burns, chief operating officer at Veterinary Service, said he doesn't recall Tevra Brands pitching its products and denied that his company ever had a “no generics\" agreement with Bayer.\n\nFlea-and-tick products market grows as Americans spend more on pets\n\nMore Americans own pets than at any time in recent history, and more of them treat their fur babies like members of the family. Nothing’s too good for Fluffy and Fido and, last year alone, we collectively spent $137 billion on them – from pet food and supplies to boarding and veterinary care.\n\nThat’s more than double spending from a decade ago.\n\nA sizable chunk went toward flea-and-tick treatments, according to the 2023-2024 American Pet Products Association’s National Pet Owners Survey. Roughly 6 in 10 dog owners use some form of flea-and-tick treatment, ranging from collars and shampoos to pills or spot-ons, for which they spent an average of $92 in the past year, the survey said.\n\nUsage was less common among cat owners – about 4 in 10 collectively spent an average of $76 over the same timeframe.\n\nThose numbers have climbed from the group’s previous survey. And there’s no slow down in sight, especially as veterinarians and public health officials push for more pets to use them.\n\n\"Preventing tick bites on people and pets is a critical issue,” said tick expert Thomas Mather, a professor of public health entomology at the University of Rhode Island. Mather added that protecting pets also protects humans from the many diseases these pests can carry.\n\nBut consumer surveys show that cost is the top reason people don’t protect their pets from fleas and ticks, Mather said. And cost can vary significantly depending on how the products are marketed and where they’re sold.\n\nCompanies typically develop different lines of the same product, each with a different price: a generic line that offers the best value; a brand-name line that’s modestly priced; and an exclusive veterinary line that’s more expensive, according to the lawsuit and industry experts.\n\nNovartis said its generic topical was blocked, too\n\nVeterinarians have long relied on product sales for a significant chunk of income, and for many years, they were often the sole supplier of such treatments. Vets used to be able to mark up prices by as much as 100%, said John Volk, a senior consultant for Brakke Consulting focusing on the animal health industry.\n\nOnline and retail competition has cut into that markup, though. The industry standard for flea-and tick-treatments today is about 65%, according to the American Animal Hospital Association.\n\nMost people, Mather said, \"want to buy the less expensive product they think is the same.\"\n\nBut while generics offer the best bang for the buck, exclusivity deals have interfered with their widespread availability. Even big pharmaceutical firms have been thwarted in efforts to get their generics to the masses.\n\nNovartis, itself a major drug company, couldn’t overcome the exclusivity deals it blamed for dooming one of its generic pet medications, its then-Animal Health Division Vice President Clinton Vranian said at the 2012 FTC workshop.\n\nVranian, who did not name the branded product or its generic equivalent, said the generic was more effective than the brand name version and well-received by veterinarians, but distributors wouldn’t touch it.\n\nNovartis achieved just 1%-2% market penetration in the drug’s launch, Vranian said.\n\nEli Lilly and Co., the pharmaceutical giant that used to own Elanco, acquired Novartis in 2015.\n\nElanco’s spokeswoman at the time revealed the generic product as Parastar Plus, a flea-and-tick treatment that directly competed with the brand name version, Frontline, then owned by Merial, according to a story by VIN News Service, which serves the veterinary industry.\n\nThe spokeswoman, Christina Diane Gaines, told the news service that Elanco itself does not use blocking agreements.\n\n“Elanco believes competition drives innovation in the industry, which results in greater customer benefit,” the article quotes Gaines as saying. “Our product strategy is focused on investing in innovation over restrictive contracts.”\n\nElanco’s current spokeswoman, Colleen Dekker, declined to answer a question from USA TODAY about whether the company still eschews such agreements.\n\n“Because this is part of pending litigation,” Dekker said, “we don’t have any further comment beyond what’s in our legal documentation.”\n\nGenerics give consumers ‘lower prices and more choices’\n\nNot all flea-and-tick treatments are the same.\n\nProducts like Frontline Plus, whose active ingredient is fipronil, are effective at killing fleas, ticks and lice only after they’ve bitten pets. Treatments made with imidacloprid, like K9 Advantix II, not only kill, but repel the parasites, making them more effective at preventing the spread of flea-and-tick-borne diseases.\n\nBy the time Tevra came along, the market for fipronil-based topical treatments was saturated. Frontline, first introduced in 1997, faced a host of generic competition starting in 2011 and, by 2018, had lost more than half its market share, according to Tevra’s lawsuit.\n\n“The results of generic Fipronil topicals entering the separate market for Fipronil topicals have been more competition against Frontline, lower prices, and more choices for retailers and consumers in that market,” Tevra’s lawsuit said.\n\nTevra decided to introduce its own line of fipronil-based generic topicals, which includes Vetality Firstect Plus and TevraPet FirstAct Plus, from which it anticipated modest revenues. But, according to the lawsuit, it believed its biggest moneymaker would be in the imidacloprid market, where, at the time of the company’s founding, only one line of treatments was available: Bayer’s.\n\nTevra hoped to capture a large chunk of the untapped market – with earnings potentials 10 times greater than that of its fipronil line – by being one of the first to roll out a generic equivalent.\n\nWhen another company with the same plan, CAP IM Supply, introduced its generic line a few months before Tevra, in January 2017, Bayer sued for patent infringement. The parties settled two years later.\n\nAs part of that settlement, CAP IM Supply had to pay Bayer royalties on its generic products, which allowed Bayer to maintain a monopoly of the imidacloprid-based topical flea-and-tick market, Tevra’s lawsuit said, since it earned money from both its brand-name line and the generic equivalent.\n\nBecause Tevra’s formulation differs from the patented version, the lawsuit said, it does not infringe on Bayer’s patents.\n\nHow the Brown Shoe case factors into flea-and-tick treatments\n\nThe outcome of the case likely will hinge on which side’s definition of the “relevant market” prevails, said R. Mark McCareins, a clinical professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who spent three decades litigating antitrust cases for a global law firm.\n\nTevra’s lawsuit defined the relevant market as one that includes only topical, squeeze-on flea-and-tick treatments whose active ingredient is imidacloprid.\n\nSeveral product lines fit that definition, most notably: Bayer’s brand-name Advantage and Advantix series, now owned by Elanco; the generic Advecta and PetLock series for which CAP IM Supply pays royalties; and Tevra’s Activate, ActiSpot, Avantect and Advotect products, which have struggled to gain a foothold.\n\nBayer made roughly 85% of all sales in that market in 2018 and earned patent license royalties for most of the other 15%, Tevra said in its lawsuit, arguing that Bayer effectively had monopolized the market.\n\nOther generic imidacloprid topicals also are now on the market, but are equally absent from major pet specialty stores and online pharmacies. They include, PetArmor Max, Adventure Plus for Dogs and Amazon Basics Flea, Tick & Mosquito Topical.\n\nBut Bayer argued the market encompasses all flea-and-tick treatments regardless of insecticide or delivery method. That includes fipronil topicals like Frontline, as well as shampoos and collars, Bayer said.\n\nIn that case, Bayer said, the brand name Advantage and Advantix products represent a fraction of the market and its contractual agreements did nothing to block Tevra from fairly competing.\n\nCourts determine a product’s relevant market based on which other products consumers would reasonably consider a substitute for it. And within that market may exist separate submarkets, which courts determine by considering things such as the product’s “peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors,” according to the landmark antitrust case, Brown Shoe v. United States.\n\nThe Brown Shoe case, in which the government sought to block the merger of two of the nation’s then-biggest shoe manufacturers and retailers, set the standard for this process more than 60 years ago and is still used today.\n\nBoth sides cited Brown Shoe in various court filings.\n\n“If Bayer is able to convince the court that its broader market definition conforms better to the legal requirements – set forth first before (the U.S. Supreme Court) in a case called Brown Shoe in 1962 – then Bayer is a likely winner in the case,” McCareins said. “Alternatively, through the same type of evidence, if the plaintiff prevails in its narrow market definition, then the odds shift in its favor.”\n\nEmily Le Coz is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

Dastagir and Cara Richardson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAngelina Jolie writes about excruciating choice to remove her ovaries, and world falls in love with her all over again\n\nFor many women, Angelina Jolie's op-ed in The New York Times is the most important thing they'll read today. Two years after the actress revealed she'd undergone a preventative double mastectomy, she delivered another bombshell: Last week she had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.The Times is the same place she wrote about her mastectomy in 2013. After the piece today, Jolie was a trending topic on Twitter. She was lauded for her strength, bravery and openness in helping empower women to make educated choices about their health. A doctor at the American Cancer Society in Atlanta says the Angelina Jolie effect is real and will mean a huge uptick in cancer screenings. Jolie's mother, Marcheline Bertrand, died at age 56 after a nearly decade-long battle with ovarian cancer. Jolie is taking hormone replacements but says she's now in menopause. \"I will not be able to have any more children, and I expect some physical changes,\" she writes. \"But I feel at ease with whatever will come, not because I am strong but because this is a part of life. It is nothing to be feared.\" Here's what you need to know about testing for ovarian cancer.\n\nWhat else in #TheShortList:\n\n• Tragic plane crash in the French alps\n\n• George Zimmerman is at it again\n\n• Ted Cruz makes some dubious claims\n\n• A glimpse into the future of women's basketball\n\nShort on time? Listen to the audio version of #TheShortList in the player below:\n\nGermanwings jet descended rapidly for 8 minutes\n\n\n\nEight minutes. That's how long the airliner fell before crashing. A German commercial jet went into a sudden, steep and horrifying descent before slamming into the rugged terrain of the French Alps today. Flight tracking systems indicated the plane's altitude was 38,000 feet at 10:30 a.m., when it began declining at a rate of more than 3,000 feet per minute. French President Francois Hollande said there aren't likely to be any survivors. There were 144 passengers and six crewmembers on board. Two of the passengers were babies. Sixteen passengers were exchange students. What we know so far: One of the black boxes has been located, no link to terrorism has been found, the pilot had more than 10 years' experience, and the plane was inspected last summer. Germanwings, the operator of the plane, is a well-known, low-cost carrier in Europe that's owned by Lufthansa. It has a good safety record.\n\nGeorge Zimmerman bashes 'Barack Hussein Obama' and references Anne Frank\n\nWell, this is bold. Remember when President Obama said, \"If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon\"? Yea, George Zimmerman really didn't like that. The man acquitted in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin says Obama amped up racial tensions by allowing a Justice Department investigation of him. \"For him to make incendiary comments as he did, and direct the Department of Justice to pursue a baseless prosecution, he by far over-stretched, over-reached,\" Zimmerman told his lawyer in a videotaped interview obtained by The Orlando Sentinel. Zimmerman said rather than the president saying, \"If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon,\" Obama should have said something like, \"Let's not rush to judgment.\" The Sentinel also reported that Zimmerman referred to the president as \"Barack Hussein Obama.\" But the priceless quote had to be when he referenced Anne Frank: \"I still believe that people are truly good at heart, as Anne Frank has said, and I will put myself in any position to help another human in any way I can.\" You can watch more of the interview in the video below.\n\nLet's fact-check Ted Cruz so you don't have to\n\n\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz became the first major Republican candidate to declare himself officially in the 2016 presidential race. That means we've now entered the campaign twilight zone of candidates getting hyped on rhetoric and disregarding facts. Don't worry, our friends at FactCheck.org are here to help. In announcing his presidential ambition Monday, Cruz repeated a number of dubious claims we've heard before, and a few we haven't. Let's debunk: 1) Cruz railed against a \"government … that seeks to ban our ammunition.\" The Obama administration sought to ban a certain type of armor-piercing bullet, not all types of ammunition. The proposal has since been postponed. 2) Cruz claimed that as a result of the Affordable Care Act \"millions … have lost their health insurance.\" In fact, about 10 million people on net gained insurance between September 2013 and December 2014, according to the Urban Institute. (Interestingly, Cruz said today he's signing up for Obamacare.) 3) Cruz also claimed that as a result of the law \"millions (have been) forced into part-time work.\" There's no solid figure on how many people may have had their hours cut to part time, but one analysis of monthly labor surveys said the number was \"likely\" a few hundred thousand. You can read the full fact-check here. Oh, and in case you didn't know, Cruz is getting seriously trolled.\n\nMaryland and Princeton gave us a women's basketball game that mattered\n\n\n\nPrinceton women's basketball season ended last night, but wow, what a game. And what a powerful way to inspire young girls everywhere. First, the teams: Princeton was the last undefeated Division I women's team in the country. Maryland hadn't lost a game since Dec. 3. Princeton had the backing of President Obama, whose niece is a forward on the team, making for a great storyline. And the game: It was back-and-forth in the first half with Maryland edging ahead; in the second half, the Terrapins caught fire and turned the tight game into a rout. USA TODAY Sports columnist Christine Brennan (who also broke the news of the threat against Obama's niece at the game) was impressed, writing that the game was a level of play that should appeal to anyone. She lauded that both teams are coached by daughters of Title IX: \"... women coaching women, which is increasingly as it should be if we are to show our daughters all the possibilities inherent in sports.\" The full women's tournament bracket is here.\n\nStories you're clicking on today:\n\nBoehner 'shocked' by report of Israeli spying\n\nPolice: Idaho family behind fatal Walmart brawl\n\nPossible Nazi hide-out found in Argentina\n\nBracing for a big power grid attack: 'One is too many'\n\nTom Cruise tells how 'Mission' plane stunt could've killed him\n\nExtra Bites\n\nDolly Shivani Cherukuri is 2 and attempting to set an archery world record.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nAh, Riverdale. This insane teen drama is one of the most popular ones that's aired in the last few years. This CW show is (and I can’t emphasize this enough) loosely based on the Archie comics of the same name and takes the epic highs and lows of high school football to the next level. From serial killers to cults run by Chad Michael Murray, the TV show’s dedication to absurd plotlines that are discarded after a few episodes and a Twin Peaks-esque noir is admirable.\n\nYou can catch seasons 1-4 of the series on Netflix, and the latest season is airing on the CW, but what should you watch after you've binged all the Southside Serpent content you can handle? We've rounded up 20 teen dramas that are just as deliciously dramatic as Riverdale. Here are some of the most popular teen drama shows you can stream right now on HBO Max, Netflix, Hulu, and more.\n\n1. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\n\nIf you're scrambling for another teen show to watch while you wait for more episodes, you can't get better than the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, which literally takes place in the same universe and has some Riverdale Easter Eggs sprinkled throughout. The series is a much darker take on the story of Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Watch as Sabrina navigates high school drama, coven drama, everyday family life... and literally marrying the Devil. The series was ended in July 2020, but you can catch it all on Netflix.\n\nStream Riverdale on Netflix\n\n2. Outer Banks\n\nI’m not lying when I say that the Outer Banks single-handedly saved me at the beginning of quarantine. The Goonies meets summer vacation in this steamy teen drama show, which premiered at just the right time for everyone to be obsessed with it. There’s no better dynamic than the rich kids versus the poor, and John B. and his pack of Pogues try to deal with their arch-nemesis known as the Kooks while looking for treasure. Set in beautiful North Carolina (technically South Carolina), the Netflix original series a breezy escape into warmer days, teen love, and, of course, mystery.\n\nSteam Outer Banks on Netflix\n\n3. Euphoria\n\nI like to describe Euphoria as Degrassi on drugs. This dark teen drama show centers around Rue (Zendaya), a recovering drug addict who falls in love with her new transgender classmate Jules (Hunter Schafer). It dips into every teenage issue imaginable from bad romances to bondage to abuse to toxic masculinity to homosexuality to identity. Each character gets their own backstory and you’re in for a wild ride. The acting is insanely good (Zendaya deserved her Emmy win) and the makeup leaves us wondering why we never thought to bedazzle our faces or experiment with bright colored eyeshadow before.\n\nStream Euphoria on HBO Max\n\n4. One Tree Hill\n\nOne Tree Hill is the pinnacle of 2000s teen dramas: basketball, half-brother rivalries, high school weddings, murders, stalkers, a budding music career. As my friend once put it “everything bad that could happen does.” It gave us teen heartthrobs Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) and Nathan Scott (James Lafferty) and the iconic empowering Brook Davis (Sophia Bush). Sorry if you’re team Payton (Hilarie Burton). I was so obsessed with this TV show that I drove around filming locations in Wilmington, North Carolina, for my birthday. It’s worth a binge if you haven’t already seen it (or a rebinge in that case).\n\nStream One Tree Hill on Hulu with the Disney+-Hulu-ESPN+ bundle\n\n5. The Vampire Diaries\n\nVampires, witches, werewolves, oh my! The Vampire Diaries is the ideal fantasy teen drama show combining the perils of falling in love while dealing with mythical forces invading the town aptly named Mystic Falls. It follows recently orphaned high schooler, Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev), as she falls for a vampire named Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) and deals with immense family drama when his bad boy brother Damon (Ian Somerhalder) comes to town. The TV show is so good it inspired two spinoffs, The Originals and Legacies, both of which I recommend watching as well.\n\nStream The Vampire Diaries on Netflix\n\n6. Elite\n\nThe only thing better than a teen drama is a foreign teen drama that actually makes you pay attention because you need to read the subtitles. Each season of Elite centers on a mystery, starting with a murder (obviously), and follows the classic trope of a poor kid struggling to fit in with the preppies at an elite boarding school. But this hot Spanish drama will keep you on the edge of your seat and features school uniforms you’ll actually want to wear.\n\nStream Elite on Netflix\n\n7. The Fosters\n\nI think The Fosters is one of the most underrated teen drama shows in history. It follows a family known as The Fosters who, well, foster four children while raising a biological son. It touches on loss, identity, racism, the foster system, and features an interracial lesbian couple as the matriarchs of the family. It has its fair share of drama but a whole lot of love and acceptance. It’s also the TV show where teen heartthrob Noah Centineo got his start after replacing Jake T. Austin as Jesus halfway through the series.\n\nThe series may have ended, but you can follow foster sisters Callie (Maia Mitchell) and Mariana’s (Cierra Ramirez) post-college adventures in Good Trouble.\n\nStream The Fosters on Hulu with the Disney+-Hulu-ESPN+ bundle\n\n8. Pretty Little Liars\n\nThe Pretty Little Liars theme song lives rent-free in my head. The TV show follows four former best friends—Aria, Spencer, Hanna, and Emily—who come back together to investigate the death of their friend Ali while being haunted by a mysterious figure known as “A.” Is there anything more horrifying? The show comes with its fair share of problems (mainly, a questionable student-teacher relationship) and falls off the rails as the creators needed to create more identities for “A” in the later seasons. But the thrilling psychodrama will keep you hooked for at least the first few seasons.\n\nWhile its spinoff The Perfectionists was short-lived, Pretty Little Liars is getting a reboot on HBO Max, so we won’t have to wait long to watch “A” torture another pack of teenage girls.\n\nStream Pretty Little Liars on HBO Max\n\n9. Gossip Girl\n\nGossip Girl was every parent's worst nightmare, but every high schooler’s dream. From the iconic fashion (you can thank Blair Waldorf for an obsession with headbands) to steamy hookup scenes to the extravagant parties, you just wanted to be a teen living in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The TV show follows a rich group of teens—and lonely boy Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) from a massive loft in Brooklyn—who navigate the trials and tribulations of being socialites whose every move and secret is broadcasted on an anonymous blog. You just had to be there.\n\nThe unmasking of Gossip Girl was quite the letdown, but with a Gossip Girl reboot on the horizon, I’m hoping for redemption there.\n\nStream Gossip Girl on HBO Max\n\n10. On My Block\n\nAnother underrated Netflix original teen show? On My Block. The show is filled with hilarious dry humor as it follows four childhood best friends as they navigate high school in the intercity. There’s a touch of a treasure hunt, secret romances, and gang wars that keep the drama flowing, but the cast is utterly charming and the storylines cut deep. The episodes are under 30 minutes, so it’s super bingable, too.\n\nStream On My Block on Netflix\n\n11. Friday Night Lights\n\n“Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose.” It’s somehow the Instagram bio of way too many questionable men, and it’s also the iconic chant of Friday Night Lights. It doesn’t get much better than Texas, football, and drama—even if you don’t care for sports. The TV show focuses on Coach Taylor (Kyle Chandler) as he coaches a high school football team in Dillon, a small town in Texas. From the first episode, you’ll be hooked as an injury changes the trajectory of the entire team, but you’ll likely stay for Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch) who arguably has the greatest character development of all time.\n\nStream Friday Night Lights on Peacock\n\n12. All American\n\nI consider All American the modern-day Friday Night Lights—if it was set in Beverly Hills/Compton. The TV show is loosely based on the life of professional football player Spencer Paysinger and it’s genuinely the most realistic teen drama out there. When Spencer James (Daniel Ezra), star player at South Crenshaw High, gets recruited for Beverly Hills High by coach Billy Baker (Taye Diggs), he moves to the rich town and drama ensues as he navigates his new life while dealing with issues from his past. The acting is superb, the storyline keeps you on edge, and there’s also plenty of football scenes.\n\nStream All American on Netflix\n\n13. Marvel’s Runaways\n\nLove superheroes and teen drama shows? Then Marvel’s Runaways is for you. The Hulu original show is based on the Marvel comic series of the same name. It doesn't necessarily deserve a place in the MCU but stands out as a teen drama. When a pack of childhood friends realizes their parents might be evil, naturally, they run away (hence the title) and discover they all have their own set of powers. It’s packed with action, adventure, and some teenage romance.\n\nStream Marvel’s Runaways on Hulu with the Disney+-Hulu-ESPN+ bundle\n\n14. Buffy The Vampire Slayer\n\nBuffy is the OG supernatural teen show, exploring the premise that “high school already feels like hell, but what if it actually was?” While struggling with the traumas of high school like puberty, romance, and mean queen bees, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) must fight actual evil in the form of vampires and demons. Honestly, I don’t know what’s worse.\n\nStream Buffy The Vampire Slayer on Hulu with the Disney+-Hulu-ESPN+ bundle\n\n15. The Society\n\nI’m going to say it loud for the people in the back, JUSTICE FOR THE SOCIETY. The criminally underrated series was unjustly canceled after initially being renewed for a second season (thanks Ms. Rona), but the one and only season is worth the watch. As a modern-day Lord of the Flies, a bunch of teenagers return from a field trip only to find all the adults are gone and they can’t leave the New England town. Things erupt into chaos as teens—namely the intelligent Allie (Kathryn Newton)—attempt to form a just society while maintaining law and order in this supernatural realm. It touches on a variety of governance styles while tackling darker issues like gun violence and abuse. I’m still praying season two of the Netflix original series does pop up.\n\nStream The Society on Netflix\n\n16. Degrassi: The Next Generation\n\nDegrassi gave us so many things: Drake, Nina Dobrev, actors playing teenagers who are actual teenagers, and so much drama. The Canadian teen show is the most realistic out there, focusing on actual teen issues like abuse, school shootings, drugs, identity, and the like. The TV show doesn’t rely on any supernatural or sports-heavy background (it’s really just a normal high school), which makes it so genuine and relatable. It’s likely why it’s been around for years and has spun off into a new generation known as Degrassi: Next Class.\n\nStream Degrassi: The Next Generation on Amazon Prime Video\n\n17. Veronica Mars\n\nWe all love a little mystery, especially when it’s solved by a high school heroine. Veronica Mars stars Kristen Bell as the titular character, a popular girl turned private detective when her best friend (Amanda Seyfried) is murdered. Fair warning, the show is dark. Throughout the series, Veronica attempts to solve the murder among other mysteries. The TV show touches on themes of suicide, the mass murder of teenagers, pedophilia, and rape, with a stellar cast of supporting characters bringing them to light.\n\nIt’s so great we were blessed with not only a movie but a Hulu reboot filled with more mysteries as it follows Veronica through her adult years.\n\nStream Veronica Mars on Hulu with the Disney+-Hulu-ESPN+ bundle\n\n18. The O.C.\n\nThere are two teams of people who watched teen drama shows in the 2000s: Team East Coast and Team West Coast. Team East Coast was for Gossip Girl and One Tree Hill while Team West Coast were lovers of The O.C. and had us all dreaming of moving to California. Filled with likable nerds and the classic girl-next-door romance, The O.C. also gave us Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) and Summer Roberts (Rachel Bilson), Chrismukkah, and an iconic indie soundtrack.\n\nStream The O.C. on HBO Max\n\n19. Looking For Alaska\n\nThis show could not have captured John Green’s Y.A, novel Looking For Alaska more perfectly. The cast, the setting, the pranks are all chef’s kiss. The mini-series follows Miles “Pudge” Halter (Charlie Plummer), an expert in last words, as he attempts to find the “Great Perhaps” by attending the Alabama boarding school his dad went to. He immediately winds up in a group of hijinking teens and falls for the troubled Alaska Young (Kristine Froseth). It’s sad, beautiful, and tragic, and completely worth the watch.\n\nStream Looking For Alaska on Hulu with the Disney+-Hulu-ESPN+ bundle\n\n20. Skins\n\nAnother dark teen drama show, Skins (the U.K. version, not the unfortunate American remake) touched on every issue under the sun. I applaud the TV show for managing to tackle heavy topics like drug abuse, eating disorders, and unexpected death without using trauma for shock value and instead show these issues in a raw, real way. The early cast is star-studded, too, with Nicholas Hoult, Dev Patel, and Daniel Kaluuya.\n\nStream Skins on Hulu with the Disney+-Hulu-ESPN+ bundle\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

The centerpiece of the new Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum is Muriel – the world’s last remaining Lockheed Electra 10-E. Named after Earhart's younger sister, Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey, Muriel is identical to the plane Earhart flew on her final flight around the world.\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: An organization that has staged dozens of protests against a Confederate monument in north Alabama filed suit contending the city is trying to limit the demonstrations in violation of free-speech guarantees. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Project Say Something and its founder, Camille Bennett, claims the city and Police Chief Ron Tyler are trying to clamp down on the protests by telling the group when, where and how it can demonstrate against the monument, located at the Lauderdale County Courthouse. Bennett said the organization, a nonprofit she founded about eight years ago, has tried to work with the city, the TimesDaily reports. “Alabama has a long history of confronting racial injustice through peaceful demonstration, and it is imperative that we not lose that ability to speak truth to power when the situation demands it,” Bennett said in a statement. The city has not responded to the federal lawsuit in court, and city officials declined comment. Project Say Something held as many as 175 demonstrations at the monument in 2020 but cut back the following year because the city used its noise and parade permit ordinances to discourage them, the lawsuit said. The chief relocated the demonstrations to a “protest zone” away from the courthouse to shrink the potential audience, it claimed, and he threatened to issue citations.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is in the midst of her first visit to the state in the role, including a visit to a community at the center of a long-running dispute over a proposed land exchange aimed at building a road through a national wildlife refuge. Residents of King Cove have seen a road as a life and safety issue. Haaland was in King Cove on Wednesday with Gov. Mike Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Dunleavy’s office said. King Cove residents have long sought a land connection through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to Cold Bay, which is about 18 miles away and has an all-weather airport. The refuge is near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula and contains internationally recognized habitat for migrating waterfowl. “The federal government needs to consider human safety and quality of life factors for residents in King Cove. The locals deserve to be heard by the federal government,” Dunleavy said in a statement. A U.S. Justice Department attorney last summer said Haaland had not decided what position she would take on a proposed land exchange, saying Haaland planned to review the record and visit King Cove before making a decision. A planned trip to Alaska last year didn’t materialize.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s Republican House speaker on Thursday was named one of five recipients of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage award for his refusal to consider overturning the 2020 election results despite massive pressure from ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters. Speaker Rusty Bowers rebuffed repeated direct efforts by Trump, his attorney Rudy Giuliani and others to overturn results that saw President Joe Biden narrowly defeat Trump in Arizona. Trump and Giuliani urged Bowers in a phone call to retroactively change Arizona law to allow the Legislature to chose a different slate of presidential electors than those picked by the voters. “I am very grateful for this honor yet cannot help but feel undeserving of it,” Bowers said in a statement. “Honoring my oath and the people’s choices at the ballot box are not heroic acts – they are the least that Arizonans should expect from the people elected to serve them.” The award created by Kennedy’s family in 1989 is designed “to recognize and celebrate the quality of political courage that he admired most” and is given each year to one or more political figures. This year’s award honors those who showed “courage to protect and defend democracy in the United States and abroad.” The awards will be presented at a May 22 ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: A local agency says it’s seeing an uptick in calls for help after the end of a statewide rent relief program. The Arkansas Department of Human Services closed its program April 1, leaving many renters struggling to find additional avenues to keep their families housed. The Arkansas Rent Relief Program provided up to 15 months of relief for unpaid rent and utilities due on or after April 1, 2020. As of the beginning of this month, about 30,000 applications had been paid at the close of the program, totaling $92.5 million in funding distributed. Some households are still waiting for assistance as their applications are being processed. As of April 7, about 3,700 applications were still being processed across the state. In the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey taken from Jan. 26 to Feb. 7, 41.4% of Arkansas households surveyed said they were not current on rent or mortgage, making eviction or foreclosure either very likely or somewhat likely in the next two months. Dana Crawford, family services manager at the Crawford-Sebastian Community Development Council, said she has seen an uptick in calls looking for help following the closure of the state’s rental assistance program. “We did have the Arkansas Fresh Start, but we have since depleted those funds,” Crawford said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Parents of middle and high school students in the state would be warned about the dangers of firearms every year under a measure that advanced Wednesday. But they would no longer be required to tell school officials if they keep guns in the house, under the revised legislation. The state Senate Education Committee three weeks ago rejected the firearms reporting requirement as an invasion of privacy. So Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino reworked his bill, eliminating the parental reporting. The narrower version cleared the same committee Wednesday on a 5-1 vote. His revised bill requires schools to include information on the safe storage of firearms in the annual notifications they send home to parents of students in middle and high schools, starting in the 2023-24 school year. Legislation with a similar requirement has already passed the California Assembly. More than two-thirds of school shootings involve weapons taken from the students’ home, friends or relatives, Portantino said. “This is an attempt to try to empower school districts to do everything they can to make the school environment safe,” he said. “This errs on the side of caution.” If there are threats or perceived threats of school shootings, the proposal requires investigators to check the state’s firearm database to see if the suspect’s family has registered firearms.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: The police chief who led the force in the Denver suburb when a gunman killed 12 people in a movie theater a decade ago is returning to temporarily lead the embattled department following the firing of its last chief. Daniel J. Oates, who served as police chief in Aurora from 2005 to 2014 before retiring as police chief in Miami Beach, Florida, will serve as interim chief and help in the selection of the next police chief, the city announced Wednesday. City manager Jim Twombly said he hired Oates “because he has established trust within our community and many of our officers.” Earlier this month Twombly fired Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who was hired in 2020 as the city faced scrutiny over the death of Elijah McClain – a case that received widespread attention in the wake of protests of racial injustice and police brutality. McClain died after being stopped by police, put in a chokehold and injected with the powerful sedative ketamine in 2019. Three police officers and two paramedics were indicted in McClain’s death last year. Wilson acted quickly to fire officers for misconduct, including officers who took and shared photos appearing to mock McClain’s death. Twombly praised Wilson’s community outreach but said he fired her because of concerns about her leadership and management of the department, without getting into specifics. Wilson disputed Twombly’s assessment and alleged she was forced out for political reasons.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: Emergency responders rescued 50 dogs and cats from a fire at a pet boarding facility after three people had escaped the flames by jumping from a second-floor window, authorities said Thursday. The fire was reported shortly before midnight Wednesday in a two-story building on Post Road East, Assistant Chief Jeff Gootman of the Westport Fire Department said in a news release. Firefighters responded and found heavy fire on the second floor of the building, which housed a pet boarding facility on the first floor and basement and an apartment on the second floor, Gootman said. After firefighters extinguished the flames, they searched the building and determined that the three people on the second floor had jumped to safety from a window, Gootman said. None required hospitalization. Westport firefighters and police officers removed approximately 50 dogs and cats from the boarding facility, Gootman said. The cause of the fire was under investigation Thursday.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After decades of criticism over use of force and a strained relationship with the community, the Wilmington Police Department’s policies and procedures are coming under legal scrutiny. A federal lawsuit filed against Wilmington officers involved in the 2020 shooting of a man found sleeping in an SUV lists years of departmental procedures claiming city police are unable to handle many situations, including making contact with unarmed individuals. The civil lawsuit touches on documented accounts of how Wilmington officers have not been taught to give proper verbal warning prior to using deadly force or to take cover when officers believe someone is armed. The lawsuit also claims department supervisors, among others, fail to check that officers use their standard-issue equipment and fail to prohibit officers from making false statements. These failures create unwritten policies, allowing Wilmington officers to engage in acts of excessive force without accountability, which in turn result in injury to civilians, according to the lawsuit filed on behalf of Jabri K. Hunter, who was shot by a Wilmington officer April 12, 2020. “These inadequate training policies existed prior to the date of this incident and continue to this day,” said the lawsuit targeting the officers involved in the shooting, Chief Robert Tracy and the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser and other community leaders announced Thursday that the city’s annual census of individuals experiencing homelessness showed a decline for the sixth straight year, WUSA-TV reports. Over the past year, the overall number of people experiencing homelessness has dropped 13.7%. Since 2016, when the Bowser administration began its Homeward DC plan, homelessness has declined by 47% total, data show. For the 2016 Point in Time count, 8,350 people were experiencing homelessness. In 2022, that number was 4,410. That’s the lowest recorded number going back to at least 2005, the mayor’s office said. The 2022 results also show declines in family homelessness (down 14%), homelessness among single adults (down 12%), and chronic homelessness for families (down 26%) and single adults (down 22%). “These results are a culmination of years of working together – across government, with our community partners and providers, and with residents in all eight wards – to implement Homeward DC and build systems and resources that meet the needs of D.C. residents,” Bowser said in a statement. “While we are proud of these results, we know there’s more work to do.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Black lawmakers staged a sit-in on the Florida House floor Thursday to protest a congressional map pushed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that they say will diminish the state’s Black representation in the U.S. House. The DeSantis map would increase Florida’s GOP presence and dismantle two districts now represented by Black members of Congress. As debate on the maps was nearing an end, Reps. Angie Nixon and Tray McCurdy opened up their suit jackets to display “Stop the Black Attack” T-shirts and shouted the same phrase. They sat on the state seal in front of the House speaker’s rostrum and were soon joined by other other Black Democrats and other supporters. The Republican-led chamber called a recess, all GOP lawmakers left the floor, and the state Florida Channel stopped broadcasting the proceedings. “This is good trouble! Necessary trouble!” Nixon shouted, echoing a phrase used by the late civil rights activist and congressman John Lewis. The group sang “We Shall Overcome” and prayed. Some members went on Facebook to stream live feeds of the protest. Nixon said in a text message to the Associated Press that the lawmakers would not leave the floor unless they were physically removed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Democrat Stacey Abrams’ gubernatorial campaign asked a federal judge Wednesday to shut down unlimited contributions to a committee controlled by Republican incumbent Brian Kemp. The filing is yet more litigation over the constitutionality of a 2021 Georgia law that allows certain top elected officials and party nominees to create “leadership committees” that can raise campaign funds without limits and coordinate spending with campaigns. The judge earlier denied a request by Abrams to start taking unlimited amounts before she clinches the Democratic nomination May 24. Kemp narrowly beat Abrams in the 2018 general election, and they would match up again if Kemp survives a Republican primary challenge from former U.S. Sen. David Perdue and others. The law allows the governor and lieutenant governor, opposing major party nominees, and both party caucuses in the state House and Senate to form leadership committees. Donors can give as much as they want, while they can’t directly give candidates for statewide office more than $7,600 for a primary or general election and $4,500 for a runoff election. Opponents say the law unconstitutionally favors incumbents over challengers because they can raise limitless sums for years ahead of an election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Public school students must continue wearing masks in classrooms despite state officials lifting the same rules for airports and public transportation following Monday’s federal judge decision to remove mask requirements on U.S. flights. Masks are no longer required in Hawaii airports, on city buses or in handicapped vans, but all public students will be required to wear masks through the end of the school year, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “I understand that there are different perspectives regarding the Hawaii State Department of Education’s indoor masking in schools,” interim Superintendent Keith Hayashi said in a letter to parents. “We will continue to implement universal indoor masking in schools.” Federal transportation officials announced Monday that they would no longer enforce mask rules after a U.S. judge’s decision to strike down the mandate on domestic flights. The four largest U.S. airlines almost immediately dropped their mask requirements, and Hawaiian Airlines announced late Monday that it would follow suit. “We ask for our guests’ patience and understanding as we update all our communications and announcements,” the airline said. “We advise travelers to stay informed and follow mask requirements that may remain in effect at their origin or arrival airports.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two men have been sentenced to jail time and banned from hunting for years after pleading guilty to poaching a grizzly bear near Yellowstone National Park. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game said in a press release that Rex Baum, 79, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with the female grizzly’s death last year. He was ordered to serve 3 days in jail and was banned from hunting for a decade. Baum’s son, Jared Baum, of Ashton, was sentenced to 30 days in jail and banned from hunting for life after pleading guilty to a felony in connection with the incident. Fish and Game officers discovered the grizzly’s carcass April 9, 2021, after the bear’s radio tracking collar signaled it had died, the Idaho Statesman reports. X-rays of the bear showed she had been shot more than a dozen times. Conservation officers visited the bear’s den, discovering a dead male cub. The agency contacted the two men after sending a warrant to Google for records of electronic devices that had been in the area around the time of the grizzly’s death. Idaho grizzlies are federally protected. Last month, Gov. Brad Little joined Montana and Wyoming governors in petitioning for the bears to be removed from Endangered Species Act protections.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The city will have a starring role in the state’s latest marketing campaign, with the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Cozy Dog Drive-In, and other sites featured in the new promotion. Gov. J.B. Pritzker officially announced the new campaign, “Middle of Everything,” at a ceremony Monday at Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium. While the Windy City is spotlighted heavily, Springfield gets plenty of love as well, with sites related to the 16th president, such as Lincoln’s Home and Lincoln’s Tomb, promoted in addition to the museum and a statue of Lincoln sitting on a park bench outside the museum. Pritzker said the $30 million campaign would help to recover tourism dollars lost during the COVID-19 pandemic and put the state in a position to grow in the years to come. A series of TV ads will run with the campaign, directed by Illinois native Jane Lynch, famous for roles such as in the TV series “Glee” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” The Dolton-raised actor, a graduate of Illinois State University, narrates a quartet of 30-second ads that showcase a Lincoln impersonator at the Lincoln Home, a muscle car at the Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices downtown, Lynch interviewing a family at the Cozy Dog and speaking with a ghost of Lincoln at “Ghosts of the Library” in the ALPLM, among others.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Thomas McDermott Jr. released a new video ad Wednesday of him smoking marijuana in honor of 4/20, a cannabis-related celebration. McDermott, who will face Republican Sen. Todd Young on Nov. 8, has been vocal about his support for the legalization of marijuana, but the video of him lighting it up is a first. In the video the Hammond mayor posted on Twitter, McDermott lights a joint and smokes it in an Illinois backyard, where marijuana consumption has been legalized. He talks to an attorney, a physician, a criminal defense attorney, a professional distiller and another elected official about the benefits of legalizing weed. “Here’s the bottom line,” McDermott says in the video. “We need to legalize marijuana on the federal level. We need to also legalize cannabis in Indiana as well, so Hoosiers can get the health and economic benefits of cannabis.” The mayor admitted last year on his “Left of Center” podcast that he smoked marijuana at a recent Grateful Dead show at Wrigley Field. McDermott unveiled the ad the same day the Indiana Democratic Party launched a tour to push marijuana legalization. It started publicly advocating for the policy change in November, but with Republicans in control at the Statehouse, it went nowhere in the 2022 legislative session.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: This year’s Major League Baseball Field of Dreams game between the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs will have an opening act. The Cedar Rapids Kernels and Quad Cities River Bandits will play a regular season minor league baseball game in the stadium located near the iconic diamond from the movie Aug. 9. That showdown is set to take place just two days before MLB’s second-straight visit to the famous farmland and in the same ballpark used last season by the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees. The Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds will play on the same field Aug. 11. “I think it just adds to an entire week now up there,” said Kernels general manager Scott Wilson. “Instead of just one night even with the major league game, you’ve got Tuesday night with us. It gives the Field of Dreams some opportunity to do some things on Wednesday between us and have that game on Thursday.” It’s a marquee matchup of minor league teams have been rivals in the Midwest League for years. The River Bandits are the High-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals. The Kernels are the High-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. The two teams, who are are located in Eastern Iowa, will become the first two minor league teams to play on the field.\n\nKansas\n\nAtchison: Aviator Amelia Earhart vanished as she tried to fly around the world in 1937, along with navigator Fred Noonan and their Lockheed Electra 10-E airplane. The centerpiece of the new Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum is Muriel – the world’s last remaining Lockheed Electra 10-E. Named after Earhart's younger sister, Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey, Muriel is identical to the plane Earhart flew on her final flight around the world. That museum is in the works in Atchison, Earhart’s birthplace. Museum founder and president Karen Seaberg announced last week that supporters had already donated $10 million of the estimated $15 million needed to create the museum, including corporate powerhouses FedEx, Garmin and Lockheed Martin. The museum is expected to open next year, according to its website. Earhart, born in 1897 in Atchison, was a social worker in Boston in 1923 when she became the 16th woman in the U.S. to be issued a pilot’s license. She subsequently became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic and the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. She was also the first woman to fly nonstop across the U.S. She became a celebrity and drew attention by rejecting traditional women’s roles and speaking in support of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. Earhart also created her own line of women’s clothing, featuring comfortable outfits designed for “active living.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday that he will form an advisory team amid a broad review as he weighs whether to take executive action to legalize access to medical marijuana. Beshear said he instructed his legal team to analyze potential options for executive action to create a framework to make medical cannabis available for people suffering from specified ailments. The Democratic governor also made a direct appeal to Kentuckians to offer their views on the issue. “I want to be clear: I am for medical cannabis,” Beshear said at his weekly news conference. “I want it done in the right way. And we’re going to be looking at our legal options very closely. And at the same time, we want to hear from you.” The advisory team will travel the state to gather public input, and Kentuckians will be able to express their views directly to the governor’s office, he said. The expanded review reflects the governor’s growing frustration after the latest bill to legalize medical marijuana died in the state Senate during the legislative session that ended last week. Lawmakers failed to “get the job done,” with Kentucky falling behind the majority of states that make medical cannabis available as an alternative to opioid medications, the governor said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A federal judge and court-appointed monitors hired to oversee reform of the New Orleans Police Department said Wednesday that the long-troubled agency could reach full compliance this year after a nearly decade-old court-backed overhaul of its policies and practices. “I’m proud of how far NOPD has come,” U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan, who approved the agreement in 2013 a highly critical 2011 investigation and report by the U.S. Justice Department. Morgan tempered her praise with acknowledgment of continuing problems, including the short-handed department’s slowdown in recruiting and allegations of wrongdoing by officers who work private duty details arranged through the department. But the department has shown transparency in dealing with such setbacks, Morgan said. The reform agreement, embodied in a court document called a consent decree, was welcomed by department critics when it was negotiated during former Mayor Mitch Landrieu’s administration. They said it was needed for a department that had been plagued by recurring scandals involving corruption or questionable use of force for decades. But the consent decree had its critics as well, including police officer representatives who said it hampered police work.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed off on a $1.2 billion supplemental budget Wednesday that sends more than half the money to residents in the form of $850 relief checks. Backed by dozens of lawmakers and Cabinet members, the governor signed the bill into law in the State House Hall of Flags. “What this budget shows once again – through hard work and good faith negotiation – Democrats, Republicans and independents can come together to do what is right for Maine people. And that we can do so without rancor or bitter partisanship that has sometimes divided Augusta in the past,” she told the assembly. The swift action means the checks will be mailed to more than 850,000 Mainers as early as June. Lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the budget proposal in a show of bipartisanship. Mills proposed returning much of the money to Mainers, taking a suggestion from Republicans as a historic surplus ballooned thanks to federal spending and rosier-than-expected revenue forecasts. It was originally touted as pandemic relief but is now called inflationary relief. Mills’ opponent in the upcoming election, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, derided the relief checks as a “gimmick.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan signed measures into law Thursday aimed at increasing public safety, jobs, environmental stewardship and mental health resources. The Republican governor, who prioritized initiatives to support the police and fight crime this legislative session, signed legislation to increase transparency in the criminal justice system and to create a state gun analytics center to coordinate resources to screen and vet gun cases to improve the prosecution of gun crimes. “Violent crime continues to be Marylanders’ top priority, and today we’re signing our Judicial Transparency Act so that the public knows more about the sentences that are being handed down for violent criminals,” Hogan said. “We’re further expanding our warrant apprehension efforts and strengthening prosecutions on gun crimes.” Hogan opened his remarks before signing 103 bills with House Speaker Adrienne Jones and Senate President Pro Tem Melony Griffith by noting it was the first time two Black women were the presiding officers representing the Maryland House and Senate together at a bill signing. The criminal justice measures marked a compromise between the Republican governor and the General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMartha’s Vineyard: A local family will go to court Friday over its continuing fight over a piece of land in Aquinnah that the Kennedy family donated to the Vineyard Conservation Society in 2013. Tanisha Gomes and her family say they are the rightful owners of that 5.7-acre property and are challenging the society’s motion for summary judgment, which asks a judge to throw out the case. In 2017, Gomes received a letter from Fidelity National Law Group, a firm that represents Vineyard Conservation Society Inc., to inform her and 19 members of her family about title problems with the land. The letter informed Gomes and her relatives that a lawsuit was filed with Dukes County Superior Court against the family, who are considered heirs of Louisa Pocknett. Pocknett, described in the complaint as the former owner of the property, died Aug. 29, 1874, and was a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. The family members were asked to sign an agreement to verify they had no right, title or interest in Lot 240, which was indicated on a plan entitled “Plan of Gay Head.” After further research, Gomes and her family found that Lot 240 remains in Pocknett’s name on the town of Aquinnah’s assessor’s website and objected to the lawsuit due to discrepancies surrounding incomplete deeds.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republican state Sen. Lana Theis opened a session with an invocation by claiming children are being attacked by “forces” that want to indoctrinate them with ideas their parents do not support. Three Democrats walked out of last week’s meeting to protest her apparent reference to how schools address sexual orientation and gender identity and critical race theory. Within days, one who tweeted criticism of the prayer was targeted by Theis in a fundraising email, calling Sen. Mallory McMorrow a liberal social media “troll” and accusing her of wanting to “groom” and “sexualize” kindergartners and teach “that 8-year-olds are responsible for slavery.” McMorrow responded Tuesday with a forceful, impassioned floor speech that resonated nationwide. “I am a straight, white, Christian, married, suburban mom” who wants “every kid to feel seen, heard and supported – not marginalized and targeted because they are not straight, white and Christian,” she said. Theis, who declined to speak after the session, released a statement in which she did not apologize but again accused Democrats of trying to undermine parents as the primary decision-makers in their children’s education. McMorrow’s 5-minute speech found an engaged audience on social media, racking up millions of views across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Mike Dando, a St. Cloud State University English professor, has helped to create a new superhero comic and is aiming to teach students in grades 5-12 literacy skills, critical thinking and self-reflection this summer through an often overlooked medium. Exploring concepts like Afrofuturism and the African diaspora, students can imagine new worlds by reading and analyzing the story of the first Black superhero, Lion Man. In 2018, after the highly successful “Black Panther” movie debuted, Dando worked with a group of artists and professors around the world to revisit Lion Man, the first Black superhero comic, written in 1947 by Black Philadelphia journalist Orrin Cromwell Evans. The original story follows Lion Man, a scientist turned superhero tasked by the United Nations to watch over a magical mountain full of uranium in Africa to prevent war. When All-Negro Comics Inc.’s paper supplier refused to help the company produce another book because its founders were Black, only one Lion Man issue was ever published – until now. Dando’s new, much longer Lion Man comic book follows the character’s journey of self-discovery and heroism as he works to save a group of other heroes trapped in monstrous bodies. He served as editor and project manager for the work written by John Jennings and illustrated by David Brame. Thanks to a grant from St. Cloud State, the team was able to make copies of the comic book – one of which is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York – and Dando will work with a variety of after-school clubs this summer to talk about the narrative structure and themes of the book, as well as teach students how to make their own comics.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Volunteers on Thursday planted several types of grasses along a stretch of Mississippi Gulf Coast beach to help restore habitat for newly hatched Least Tern chicks. Audubon Delta, along with Harrison County Sand Beach Authority and Gulfport High School, partnered to install several species of beach grasses into a globally recognized conservation zone in Gulfport in order to stabilize the beach, encourage dune formation and provide coverage for the endangered birds. The area was destroyed after hurricanes Ida and Zeta and several tropical storms over the past two years, officials said. The project was made possible by a Caring for Our Coasts grant issued by Citgo and Restore America’s Estuaries.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: City leaders on Thursday announced plans for a new institute designed to make the region a major player in geospatial technology. Andy Taylor, executive chairman of the rental car company Enterprise Holdings, is providing financing for the Taylor Geospatial Institute, along with eight St. Louis-area research institutions. The institute will provide funding for research and program development and expects to attract leading scientists to St. Louis, organizers said. Taylor said in a statement that he hopes the institute “will cement St. Louis as the world’s true center for geospatial excellence.” A news release says research and training will focus on topics such as food security, improving health care systems, and national security. Officials did not disclose how much money the Taylor family is investing, but the family has funded more than $1 billion in St. Louis civic initiatives and cultural institutions through the years.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Lawmakers have rejected an attempt to call a special legislative session to investigate the state’s election processes amid continued false claims by ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters that the 2020 election was stolen. A poll of 149 lawmakers found just 44 approving a special session by Tuesday’s deadline, short of the 75 needed. The secretary of state’s tally showed 60 lawmakers rejected the special session, and another 45 didn’t return their ballots, which counts as a “no” vote. One legislative seat is vacant. Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers tried to reach an agreement to ask Gov. Greg Gianforte to call a special session to create new voting districts for the Public Service Commission before three federal judges had to decide how to even out the populations in the five districts. However, GOP leaders were unable to get a commitment from all Republicans to limit the special session to addressing just the voting districts. Gianforte said he would not call a special session without such an agreement. After the court set the PSC districts for the 2022 elections, 10 lawmakers asked for the poll on whether lawmakers wanted to hold a special session on election integrity.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Former U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson endorsed state Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks on Thursday in her campaign for the state’s 1st Congressional District. Pansing Brooks, a Democrat, is looking to replace former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who resigned after he was convicted on charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal campaign contribution. Nelson, a Democrat, said Pansing Brooks has worked with both parties while in the Nebraska Legislature and passed more than 60 bills. Pansing Brooks will face state Sen. Mike Flood, a Republican, in a June 28 special election to determine who will serve the remainder of Fortenberry’s term in Congress. She’s also expected to face Flood again in November, assuming that they both win their parties’ May 10 primary nomination as expected. Nelson is the most recent Democrat to have served as Nebraska’s governor, with a tenure from 1991 to 1999. He was a U.S. senator from 2001 to 2013. Pansing Brooks has served in the Legislature since 2015 and is leaving office in January due to term limits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Most of the five leading Republican candidates for governor who gathered Wednesday for a campaign forum offered dire assessments of the state’s tourism-dependent economy, rising crime and struggling schools – and asked for votes for their visions to fix them. Several also blamed Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, the consensus GOP front-runner, for skipping the event. “We want to have the best, well-run, state in the country,” said Guy Nohra, a Reno venture capitalist, drawing applause from among about 100 people at a Republican women’s club luncheon in Las Vegas. “But we don’t. We’re 50th in everything,” said Nora, who called his foray into politics the culmination of an American dream after his own teenage experience fighting a war in his home country, Lebanon, and his business ventures in the U.S. The event also featured North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, Gardnerville surgeon Fred Simon, former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller and firebrand northern Nevada lawyer Joey Gilbert.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House approved a resolution Thursday in support of New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary before advancing a bill opponents said would threaten it. The nonbinding resolution came a week after the Democratic National Committee approved a plan to revoke the guaranteed first-place spots in the presidential nominating calendar long held by the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. Noting New Hampshire has withstood previous challenges, lawmakers affirmed their commitment to the tradition and said candidates are well-served by campaigning in a state with an engaged citizenry and “well-run, free and fair elections.” But a supporter of a bill to create a provisional ballot system later called the current system “laughable,” claiming it allows people to cast fraudulent ballots with virtually no consequences. Under current law, voters who arrive at the polls without the necessary identification fill out affidavits promising to provide documentation within 10 days; those who don’t can be investigated and charged with fraud. The votes themselves remain valid, but under a bill sent to the House Finance Committee on Thursday, the state would create a new type of “affidavit ballots” that would be thrown out if voters fail to follow up. Opponents called it an expensive and complicated solution to a problem that doesn’t exist and said creating a system that would delay the final results for more than a week would threaten the state’s ability to hold the first primary.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBloomfield: The flowers were finally on full display Thurday as recreational marijuana sales began in the Garden State. Michael Barrows wore his Grateful Dead T-shirt and Jerry Garcia face mask for opening day of legal cannabis sales and was one of dozens of people who lined up before dawn to join the celebratory scene. “It’s pretty amazing, exciting, and if I get pulled over on the way home, and I’m ever asked if I have any drugs in the car, now I’m allowed to say ‘only this,’ ” Barrows said, holding up the canister of marijuana flower he had just purchased. Possession of cannabis is legal now in New Jersey, though driving under the influence is still prohibited. Barrows, 60, joined a steady stream of other novelty-seekers, longtime marijuana users and medical patients at RISE in Bloomfield, near the state’s biggest city, Newark, and not far from New York City. With soul music blaring, free doughnuts in the parking lot, a steel drum and a balloon arch at the entrance, New Jersey’s cannabis kickoff for people 21 and older had the feel of a fair more than a store opening. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who has long backed recreational marijuana legalization and signed the bill that set up the new marketplace kicking off at 13 existing medical marijuana facilities across the state, appeared at ZenLeaf in Elizabeth for its first day of recreational sales. The governor said he wouldn’t be trying any pot; earlier this week he said it’s not his “thing,” and he prefers scotch.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: Habitat for about a million bats will be protected from human impacts through a deal between a nonprofit and the federal government. About 315,000 acres of southern New Mexico land owned by billionaire media tycoon Ted Turner were protected from development in a partnership between the U.S. Department of Defense and New Mexico Land Conservancy. The deal saw a conservation easement added to Armendaris Ranch, owned by Turner, due to perceived cultural significance and biological diversity on the land in Sierra and Socorro counties. The ranch land supports more than 500 vertebrate species, according to a report from the Land Conservancy, including multiple listed for federal and state protections. It also contains the Fra Cristobal Mountain Range, home to 230 desert bighorn sheep, and lava fields that include the Jornada cave system that houses bats of multiple species. “This land is laden with important and unique natural and cultural resources, and the opportunity to permanently protect a property with conservation values of this magnitude was at the heart of our organization’s decision to tackle this landscape-scale project,” said Ron Troy, southern New Mexico program manager with the Land Conservancy.\n\nNew York\n\nOlive: As western regions contend with drier conditions, New York City is under fire for sometimes releasing hundreds of millions of gallons of water a day from a key reservoir in the Catskill Mountains. The occasional releases, often around storms, have been used to manage water levels in the Ashokan Reservoir and to keep the water clear. But residents downstream say the periodic surges cause ecological harm along the lower Esopus Creek. They say the high flows churn up the water so much it turns the scenic Hudson River tributary the color of chocolate milk. “These people can afford to offer New York City cheap, clean, beautiful water by destroying ours,” said Michael Vallarella, who lives on the creek in Saugerties. Standing on his back deck recently, he swiped through pictures on his phone of the water looking like “Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory river.” The tensions between upstate residents and the city of 8.8 million people to the south touch on how the largest unfiltered water supply in the country will operate in an expected stormier future. Opponents pushing for changes to the water releases got a boost recently when state regulators told the city to take a deeper look at their effects. City officials say they’re trying to strike the difficult balance of responding to downstream concerns while delivering quality water.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The fight over a downtown Confederate marker is not over, according to the attorney challenging the city’s removal of Vance Monument, and documents filed Wednesday attempt to take the issue to North Carolina’s highest court. Despite an April 5 ruling from the N.C. Court of Appeals in favor of the city, affirming a lower court judgment to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing removal of the monument, the city finds itself again in limbo. Nearing midnight Wednesday, Edward Phillips, lawyer for the Society for the Historical Preservation of the 26th North Carolina Troops, which brought the challenge against the city, filed a petition for discretionary review with the N.C. Supreme Court. This document is a request for the Supreme Court to review the decision by the Court of Appeals. It does not ensure the high court will hear an appeal, said City Attorney Brad Branham. “I am not going to cede the point until I’m told there’s just no path forward,” Phillips said. The filings add to an already lengthy process to determine the fate of the obelisk that was built to honor racist Civil War-era Gov. Zebulon Vance. The 75-foot-tall granite Vance Monument stood in Pack Square Plaza in the heart of downtown Asheville. All but its base was taken down as of June 2021 after the City Council voted to remove it. The historical preservation group is seeking to stop and potentially reconstruct the monument to Vance.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that dismisses a lawsuit brought by the state and several western counties that could have resulted in the construction of additional roads in parts of the Badlands. The Badlands Conservation Alliance says the ruling protects some of the most pristine areas of the Badlands from traffic and potential oil development. “I think it’s a really serious win for the Badlands, for the long-term integrity of those areas that are still roadless and considered suitable for wilderness,” said Connie Triplett, president of the alliance. A three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals found the state’s and counties’ claim is barred by a 12-year statute of limitations that was passed years ago. Their ruling upholds an earlier decision by U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Hovland, who dismissed the matter in 2017, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The case began a decade ago when Billings, Golden Valley, McKenzie and Slope counties sued the federal government. The state followed with its own lawsuit, and the court consolidated the two cases. The plaintiffs sought to claim rights to section lines used in land surveying and mapping in the Little Missouri National Grassland and other areas that make up the Dakota Prairie Grasslands.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A lawsuit has been filed targeting legal protections granted to health care providers that allow them to deny treatment they oppose on the basis of their conscience or religious beliefs. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein on Wednesday sued the state over the measure known as the “conscience clause.” According to the law, a medical provider can be “excused from participating” whenever a treatment conflicts with a provider’s “moral, ethical, or religious beliefs or convictions.” Opponents of the law say it could limit abortions or other medical care. The city also argues the measure violates Ohio’s Constitution and the federal Affordable Care Act. If nurses employed by the city are opposed to a medical procedure, “they can refuse it, and we as a city can’t do anything about it,” Klein said. He also said insurance companies could refuse to pay for certain procedures, and “that obviously causes significant problems for our employees.” Republican Gov. Mike DeWine kept the language of the law in place when he signed the 2021 budget. DeWine said the provision merely sets into state law what’s already being practiced. In a statement, Attorney General Dave Yost called the lawsuit “meritless, anti-democracy and authoritarian.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Plans to fully legalize marijuana can proceed to the signature-gathering stage, the state Supreme Court ruled, paving the way for two more cannabis plans seeking voter approval. The high court’s ruling late Tuesday comes amid a marijuana boom in the Sooner State after voters in 2018 approved the most liberal medical marijuana program in the nation. Nearly 10% of Oklahoma’s 4 million residents have qualified for a medical-use card – by far the highest percentage in the country. Supporters of the two separate proposals still need to gather enough signatures to put the plans on the ballot for voters. The plans approved Tuesday, State Question 819 and a companion State Question 818, would amend the Oklahoma Constitution to protect the right of residents age 21 and older to use marijuana. It’s part of a nationwide push to legalize the recreational use of cannabis for adults, which 18 states and the District of Columbia have already approved. Because the two proposals seek to amend the constitution, supporters will have to gather more signatures, about 178,000 in 90 days, for them to qualify for the ballot. “Whether we’ll get on the November ballot this year remains to be seen,” said Jed Green, a longtime Oklahoma cannabis activist behind the plans. “We’re going to push, push and push to get it done.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A Native American tribe in the state said it is assessing its legal options after learning the U.S. government plans to release water from a federally operated reservoir to downstream farmers along the Oregon-California border amid a historic drought. Even limited irrigation for the farmers who use Klamath River water on about 300 square miles of crops puts two critically endangered fish species in peril of extinction because the water withdrawals come at the height of spawning season, the Klamath Tribes said. Last year, critically endangered sucker fish central to the Klamath Tribes culture and religion didn’t have enough water to spawn, and thousands of downstream juvenile salmon died without reservoir releases to support the Klamath River’s health. The tribes said in a statement that the decision to release any water to about 1,000 farmers in the massive, federal agricultural project was “perhaps the saddest chapter yet in a long history of treaty violations” and placed the blame for the current water crisis on “120 years of ecosystem mismanagement at the hands of settler society.” The fish are important to the inland tribes’ cultural and religious practices and were once a dietary staple. The Klamath stopped fishing for the sucker fish in the 1980s as numbers dwindled. They now run a captive breeding program to ensure the species’ survival and note that no juvenile sucker fish have survived in the wild in recent years. “We have nothing left with which to ‘compromise,’ ” the Klamath Tribes said in a statement. “Global warming is certainly a global problem, but thus far its local consequences appear to be exacerbating existing and systematic inequalities between ourselves and the larger society.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Prosecutors said Thursday that they will not re-try a Philadelphia man whose 2012 murder conviction was overturned earlier this month, citing weak evidence and the involvement of a disgraced former detective now charged with sexually assaulting witnesses in other cases. Rafiq Dixon, 40, had been serving a life sentence in the 2011 fatal shooting of Joseph Pinkney. The 40-year-old was expected to be released from prison Thursday afternoon, hours after a Common Pleas Court judge granted the motion to withdraw charges, his attorney said. The initial case relied heavily on testimony from three witnesses who gave inconsistent accounts. All three were interviewed by former homicide detective Philip Nordo, who has been charged with various crimes including stalking, intimidating, and sexually assaulting male suspects and witnesses during his career. In June, a judge reversed the 2015 conviction of Arkel Garcia, who confessed to murder during an interrogation in which, his lawyer said, Nordo asked the teenager to view pornography with him. The ruling came after both sides presented evidence that Nordo had sexually groomed witnesses in the case and trial prosecutors had suppressed his misconduct. Garcia was also serving a life sentence.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic former state lawmaker David Segal has joined the race to succeed U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, a fellow Democrat who’s retiring after more than two decades in office. Segal announced his decision Wednesday, saying that many voters are fed up with federal politics and that “government should be able to do more to address the concerns of our neighbors.” Segal served on the Providence City Council before winning a seat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He served for two terms, from 2007 to 2011. In 2010 he lost a bid for Congress and founded a national liberal advocacy organization known as Demand Progress. He’s the latest entry in a crowded Democratic field that also includes state Treasurer Seth Magaziner; Joy Fox, a former top aide to Langevin; Biden administration official Sarah Morgenthau; Omar Bah, executive director of the Refugee Dream Center in Providence; and former political strategist Michael Neary. “We have the people power to reach the voters, we have the money to compete, and we have the urgent case to make that we deserve leaders who can bring people together and ensure their voices are heard,” Segal said in his campaign announcement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s highest court on Wednesday issued a temporary stay blocking the state from carrying out what was set to be its first-ever firing squad execution. The order by the state Supreme Court puts on hold at least temporarily the planned April 29 execution of Richard Bernard Moore, who drew the death sentence for the 1999 killing of convenience store clerk James Mahoney in Spartanburg. The court said in issuing the temporary stay that it would release a more detailed order later. Attorneys for the 57-year-old inmate had sought a stay, citing pending litigation in another court challenging the constitutionality of South Carolina’s execution methods, which also include the electric chair. Moore’s lawyers also wanted time to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether Moore’s sentence was proportionate to his crime. It has been more than a decade since the last firing squad execution in the U.S. The state of Utah carried out all three such executions in the nation since 1976, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. The most recent was in 2010. The South Carolina Supreme Court on Wednesday also set a May 13 execution date for Brad Sigmon, 64, convicted in 2002 of the double murder of his ex-girlfriend’s parents in Greenville County.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A leadership shake-up and shorter wait times for service are welcomed changes for disgruntled military veterans who say the federal health care system is failing them, but that’s still not enough to appease the dozens of former soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, as well as a handful of elected officials, who showed up at the South Dakota Veterans Council’s quarterly meeting Wednesday. Praises of this week’s removal of the now-former Sioux Falls Veterans Affairs director were tempered by caution for a need for more systematic improvements. “If you walked the halls on Tuesday, there were more smiles in the Sioux Falls VA Hospital than there have been in 14 months,” said Hawk Mayor, a Vietnam combat veteran, referring to the departure of now former Sioux Falls VA director Lisa Simoneau. “But we’ve been shut out.” Simoneau was removed from the position as of Monday after growing pressure for a regime change from both veterans, VA employees and South Dakota’s congressional delegation. Since at least October, members of the South Dakota Veterans Council have voiced concerns about a lack of responsiveness from Simoneau regarding what’s described as an inadequate level of care being provided to veterans entitled to medical services through the veterans’ health care system. Some employees at the VA have also blown the whistle in recent weeks on poor management practices and a hostile work environment under Simoneau.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state would become the latest to impose harsh penalties on doctors who violate new, strict regulations dictating the dispensing of abortion pills under a proposal headed to Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s desk. It’s part of a coordinated nationwide effort spearheaded by anti-abortion groups upset over the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recent decision to remove a rule that required women to pick up the abortion medication in person. After Tennessee’s GOP-controlled House approved the measure last week, Senate Republicans on Thursday signed off on sending the proposal to the governor. Lee hasn’t publicly weighed in on the measure, but he has yet to veto a bill while in office and frequently stresses his opposition to abortion. According to the bill, delivery of abortion pills by mail would be outlawed, and anyone who wanted to use abortion pills would be required to visit a doctor in advance and then return to pick up the pills. The drugs may be dispensed only by qualified physicians – effectively barring pharmacists from doing so. Violators would face a Class E felony and up to a $50,000 fine. The in-person requirement had long been opposed by medical societies, including the American Medical Association, which said the restriction offers no clear benefit to patients.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A prominent conservative activist has been charged with unlawful restraint and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon over an October incident involving a contractor the activist hired, his attorneys said Wednesday. Jared Woodfill and Gary Polland, attorneys for Dr. Steven Hotze, said the Harris County District Attorney’s Office told them Wednesday that Hotze was indicted over allegations against a former police officer, Mark Aguirre, who worked for Hotze. Aguirre had been retained to pursue a voter fraud investigation on behalf of Houston-based Liberty Center for God and Country, a nonprofit organization Hotze runs. Aguirre was charged Dec. 14 with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after a man accused him of running him off the road and holding him at gunpoint in an effort to prove what authorities have called a bogus voter fraud scheme. Aguirre claimed an air conditioner repairman was the mastermind. He said the man’s truck was filled with fraudulent ballots when he ran his SUV into it Oct. 19, according to authorities. Aguirre told police he and some friends set up a “command post” at a Marriott hotel in suburban Houston that conducted 24-hour surveillance on the repairman for four days, according to a police affidavit.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Faced with continuing drought and one of the fastest-growing populations in the U.S., the Washington County Commission voted unanimously Tuesday to apply new water restrictions to every new residential and commercial development. The new rules won’t apply to any existing homes or commercial buildings, but they could hopefully provide a better balance between what water is available and the continued demand for new construction, said Adam Snow, a member of the three-member commission, which regulates buildings requirements for all of the unincorporated areas of the county. “We want to have beautiful communities and a beautiful place to live and maintain our quality of life,” Snow said. “We’re doing it as effectively and efficiently as possible with our water, which is a very sacred resource right now.” The changes will be written into Title 10, Chapter 27 of the county code. They will only apply to projects on unincorporated county land that still need approval from the county to go forward, although they resemble similar measures being passed by cities and towns in the area. Snow said about 5% of the county’s population lives on unincorporated land.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Property owned by Vermont-recognized Native American tribes will be exempt from property taxes under a new law that takes effect in July. The legislation, signed by Gov. Phil Scott on Wednesday, recognizes that Vermont lands “are the historic and current territories of the Western Abenaki people.” “I sign it out of respect for the heritage of our Native American communities and traditions,” Scott wrote in a letter to the Legislature. “Further, the associated costs to the Education Fund and the General Fund borne by all Vermonters are forecast to be negligible.” To be exempt from the state and municipal property taxes, the property must be used for the purposes of the tribe and not leased or rented. Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki Nation, has said the tax exemption allows the tribes, which rely on grants and donations, to be able to use those resources “to help uplift our people” with food security and other needs. The legislation states that “stewardship of these lands was removed from the Abenaki by European governments and settlers” and acknowledges “the Abenaki people as the traditional land caretakers of Ndakinna, which includes parts of Vermont, New England, and Quebec.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWestlake: Officials at Booker T. Washington National Monument are asking the public for help in unraveling one of its biggest mysteries. Hidden away in a section of the park just off its Jack O’ Lantern Trail rests a cemetery that predates much of the known history of the former plantation where Booker T. Washington was born a slave and later freed. The cemetery has few markings to provide context to who was buried there or when they were buried. “It’s definitely one of the biggest mysteries at the park,” said Tim Sims, senior park ranger. Archaeologist with New South Associates recently began taking a deeper look into the cemetery, commonly referred to as the Sparks Cemetery named after a person who once lived nearby. Some of the Black families who have lived near the cemetery include the Brown, Holland, Divers, Burroughs, Ferguson, Taylor, Green, Harris, English, Edwards, Starkey, Swain, Saunders, Childress and Dudley families. Sims said the names of the families were found looking through property deeds, slave records and federal census records. People with information on those possibly buried in the Sparks Cemetery are asked to contact Velma Fann, historian, at New South Associates at 770-498-4155, x126 or vfann@newsouthassoc.com.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously ruled that an Edmonds city ordinance requiring that guns be locked up and kept out of unauthorized hands is preempted by state law. The ruling affirmed a three-judge state of appeals ruling last year in the case sparked by a lawsuit filed by three residents against the city of Edmonds after it approved an ordinance in July 2018 requiring residents to lock up their guns or else face fines. “Under our system of divided government, many elected bodies hold legislative power, including elected city councils. These councils, however, must legislate within constitutional constraints,” Chief Justice Steven González wrote, joined by the eight other justices on the high court. “One of those constraints is that city ordinances must not ‘conflict with general laws’ that have been enacted by the people of our state by initiative or by our state legislature.” A statewide ballot measure that passed later that same year on gun safety doesn’t mandate that a firearm be stored in a particular way or place, but it created criminal penalties for when a gun isn’t properly stored and accessed by someone who is prohibited from possessing a firearm – such as a child – and used to injure or kill, displayed in public in an intimidating manner or used during a crime.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A health care system has partnered with a junior college on a program aimed at addressing the shortage of nurses in the state. Mon Health System and West Virginia Junior College signed a letter of intent to launch a nursing education program that will put students at the school on an accelerated path to becoming nurses, officials said during a signing ceremony Monday. Mon Health nurses will serve as faculty, and the students will have digital coursework as well as learning through work at the hospital – what Mon Health System President and CEO David Goldberg called patient-side, The Dominion Post reports. The program plans to open enrollment in September and start its first class next April. The collaboration, Goldberg said, will serve “to bring not only the best nurses to patient-side through Mon Health, but keep people in this community, grow our own, take care of our own neighbors, family members and friends, so we continue to be the best health care location in north-central West Virginia and improve our health care outcomes.” West Virginia Junior College CEO Chad Callen said nursing shortages are at near crisis levels in some areas of the state. “Such challenges require bold thinking and innovative, out-of-the-box approaches,” he said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The work of an investigator looking into the 2020 presidential election generated fresh criticism Thursday after newly posted documents included a memo describing one elections worker in the state as “probably” a Democrat in part because she loves snakes and “has a weird nose ring.” Also on Thursday, a judge ordered Michael Gableman to stop deleting records, the latest legal defeat for the former state Supreme Court justice. Gableman has released two interim reports on the election won by President Joe Biden and has suggested the GOP-controlled Legislature look into decertifying his victory. Republican leaders including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who hired Gableman, have repeatedly said they have no intention of trying to decertify the win. Gableman’s reports have not included evidence to back up the false claims that Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2020. A recently posted unsigned document on Gableman’s website, titled “cross pollinators,” details his probe into public employees who work in elections. That memo contends that a geographic information system analyst for Milwaukee is “probably” a Democrat because she plays video games, “has a weird nose ring,” sometimes colors her hair, “loves nature and snakes” and lives with a boyfriend but is not married to him.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s senior population grew at the nation’s second-fastest rate in the second decade of the millennium, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Citing research from online resource hub AgingInPlace.org, the newspaper points to a 40% increase in the proportion of Wyoming residents who are 65 or older between 2010 and 2020, with the level sitting at 17.8% in the latest census. Only Alaska was found to have a faster-growing senior population when comparing U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/columnists/chuck-campbell/2020/07/05/eurovision-soundtrack-will-ferrell-rachel-mcadams-6-lack-jessie-ware-dream-wife-peter-manos-review/5378820002/", "title": "Marilyn Manson's 'We Are Chaos' gets a shot from Shooter Jennings", "text": "Like most of Marilyn Manson’s previous releases, his new “We Are Chaos” is good music for Halloween. And in a year blighted by a worldwide pandemic, his material is all the more appropriate for 2020.\n\nManson hits the familiar marks here with metal-draped rage, industrial-sized rhythms and histrionic posturing delivered with monster-modulated vocals and acidic lyrics.\n\nShooter Jennings is the surprise weapon: The alt-country star produced or co-produced (with Manson) every track on the release. The two previously worked together on a song for an unlikely 2016 Jennings album that paid tribute to electronic-music/disco icon Giorgio Moroder, though “We Are Chaos” fits snugly in the Manson oeuvre, with a Bowie-esque glam rock edge that likely owes something to Jennings.\n\nYet this is mostly Marilyn Mason just being Marilyn Manson, whether he’s swimming through the saturated framework of the title track to find an anthemic payoff, striding through the grind of “Red Black and Blue” with the hook “Am I garbage or God?” or chugging along in the dramatic spin of “Don’t Chase the Dead” to offer the advice, “Don’t chase the dead, or they’ll end up chasing you.”\n\nUnlike others in the hard/industrial/death/rock/metal subgenres, Manson delivers his venom with his tongue in cheek, and he hits irresistibly accessible highs, as when he commandeers the crushing dance cadence of “Perfume” to offer the winking warning, “If you conjure the devil, you better make sure you got a bed for him to sleep in.” He also fits snugly in the surreal power-ballad mode of “Paint You With My Love”\n\nManson ventures over a lot of familiar territory on “We Are Chaos” and sounds a little tired at times (you try being Marilyn Manson for 30 years), but he offers a satisfying and sneering explanation on the track “Solve Coagula”: “I’m just broken, and I don’t wanna be fixed.”\n\nMarilyn Manson\n\n\"We Are Chaos\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nGuyton gets somewhere on 'Bridges'\n\nThirty-something years ago, Mickey Guyton was growing up in small-town Texas, listening to Dolly Parton tapes with her grandmother and falling in love with classic country music. She sounds like countless other Southern girls with Grand Ole Opry dreams, but as she sings on her new song “Black Like Me,” “I did my best just to fit in.”\n\nGuyton has lived her dream of being a country singer, though in a genre dominated by men – and especially white men – she isn’t a household name. But that could change, or at least her profile should grow, with her new “Bridges,” a disarmingly honest EP that is infectious, poignant and (mostly) country.\n\nProduced by Karen Kosowski, the release is authentic, opening with a prayer for an ailing society on the infectious power ballad “Heaven Down Here” and then segueing to a title track where Guyton sings “we’re gonna need more than prayers and wishes” to put out the fire on the street.\n\nGuyton is genuine, soulful and charismatic. She’s straightforward, but hopeful, and unifying, not divisive.\n\n“What Are You Going to Tell Her” is heart-wrenching, a piano-based reality check for parents of color who try to foster their children’s hopes, yet “do you let her think the deck’s not stacked?” And on the moving “Black Like Me” she makes a plaintive pitch: “If you think we live in the land of the free, you should try to be black like me … I know I’m not the only one who feels like I don’t belong.”\n\nHeavy and beautiful as these songs are, Guyton also has a wicked playful side, evident in the Western showdown of “Salt” (“You think you’re getting’ sugar, but boy you’re gettin’ salt”). Plus, on the giddy toast to her favorite beverage, “Rose,” Guyton sounds like Parton, chirping, “Pretty in pink, baby that’s my kind of drink!”\n\nNow that’s country.\n\nMickey Guyton\n\n\"Bridges\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBrian's '1999' hits the spot in 2020\n\nRich Brian is at his worst when he’s at his technical best and at his best when he’s at his technical worst on his new “1999.”\n\nThe 21-year-old Los Angeles-based vocalist from Jakarta, Indonesia, rips through the rapid-fire rap of the track “Long Run” in a dazzling display of speed and an absolute lack of personality as he dispenses a lot of words that don’t say much against the thumping bass and tinny synthetic sweeps.\n\nBy contrast, in the woozy vibe of “When You Come Home,” Brian is all over the map – uneven, imperfect and completely endearing in the dreamy arrangement, offering lines like, “You always make me laugh when you speak/And you always thought my laugh was funny.”\n\nBrian is impressively dexterous here, writing and producing on a handful of tracks that range from the strident nervous energy of “Don’t Care” to the oddly spiritual-esque melancholy of “Sometimes,” where he says his life is like the movies because “I skip the drama and get right to the action.”\n\nBrian is also a singer, taking a page from The Weeknd in the sleek synth/dance of “DOA” to sing, “Nights like this could make the brightest days overrated,” and later protecting himself on “Sins” with, “I can’t let your sins just take away my faith.”\n\nPlus on the uncharacteristic pop song “Love in My Pocket,” Brian shows his agility by singing and rapping through wry ambivalence and amusing twists.\n\nBrian is barely 21 and “1999” is only seven songs long, but he shows more range here than most artists twice his age with twice as many songs … even if the speed rapping is gratuitous.\n\nRich Brian\n\n\"1999\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nRichie unearths her comedic side\n\nIt should be no surprise that fashion designer/actress/celebrity Nicole Richie would get around to making an album: Her father is Lionel Richie, her husband is Good Charlotte lead vocalist Joel Madden, and even her onetime bestie Paris Hilton has indulged in making music. But nearly everything else about Nicole Richie’s new “Unearthed” – which is credited to her alternate persona, Nikki Fre$h – is a surprise.\n\n“Unearthed” is comedy rap, a Lonely Island-ish “conscience trap album” where Richie plays an overly woke pro-environment troubadour.\n\nThe release features half a dozen “voicemails” where friends and associates (and Lionel Richie himself) are baffled by her new persona and try to talk her out of releasing the album.\n\nBut here it is, with the mother of two warning her kids not to “bring the Virgo out in me” on first song “Parent Trap” (and telling them to “go do your homework”) before she turns her attention to nature.\n\nShe frets over the loss of honeybees on “Bee’s Tea” (“I’m just tryin’ to save a queen”), worries about rejected not-traditionally-attractive fruits and vegetables on “U.G.L.Y.” (“We take damn good food, and we kiss it goodbye”), advocates for clean water on “Drip Drip” (“Everything requires water and so do me”) and recognizes kindred spirits in plant life on “We Are a Garden” (“A kumquat tree … an epiphany … it’s just like me”).\n\nThe standout track is “Lil Gems,” a well-executed modern dance song about the power of gems to repel negative energy. And there’s an extended spoken track, “Knuckle Fresh,” where Nikki visits a senior living home to give away her music and receptive resident Trixie says, “We have literally nothing to do and all the time in the world.”\n\nFans of eccentric diversions might find time for “Unearthed,” too.\n\nNikki Fre$h\n\n\"Unearthed\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nSweeping tones compensate for vocals\n\nSuburban Living bridges shoegaze music to the sweeping tones of Gothic rock on its new “How to Be Human,” creating thoughtfully ornate soundscapes suitable for reflection, rumination and/or relaxation by its listeners.\n\nThe Philadelphia by way of Virginia Beach band builds its textured sound on layers of guitars from Wesley Bunch and Chris Radwanski plus Radwanski’s keyboards and the rhythm section of drums by Mike Cammarata and bass by Peter Pantina.\n\nThe tracks sprawl with effective disembodiment, typically elevating in intensity on each track, though the shifts are subtle. The resulting psychological impact of “How to Be Human” is primal as the thick arrangements sink into the psyche and absorb into the soul.\n\nBut there’s an all-too-human aspect to the release: Bunch’s vocals are subpar, weakly navigating through the swarming instrumentation and serving as a mildly irritating distraction to the aural effect. His words are spiked with passion, but Bunch’s mundane and hookless vocal delivery sinks into the mix, corrupting the lyrical intent.\n\nThe words do bleed through – whether on the lush city-themed “Main Street,” where he sings, “I look to you in my time of need … I’m begging you, please let me in,” or when he wonders in the insinuating intoxication of “Video Love (T’s Corner),” “Is this my time?”\n\nApart from the occasional tedium that surfaces on a few songs, “How to Be Human” compensates for the vocals with the music, as when Max Swan steps in with a saxophone solo in the flooded sound of “Indigo Kids” or when the indulgent 7-minute arrangement of closer “Once You Go” pays off with an evocative atmosphere.\n\nIf only the vocals were better, “How to Be Human” could have been transcendent.\n\nSuburban Living\n\n\"How to Be Human\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nCools finds 'Paradise' in California\n\nMusicians are often inspired by locations for their material, and so it is with Evelyn Cools on her California-based “Misfit Paradise,” which explores a time in 2018 when she “experienced love like she never had before,” according to a press release.\n\nDespite some lyrical references to the state and Southern California folk-rock leanings in the arrangements, however, “Misfit Paradise” seems far more informed by that unprecedented love experience, which comes off as elusive, potentially obsessive and also both blissful and oddly threatening.\n\nCools – a native of Belgium who lived in London, Budapest and Hong Kong before moving to the United States – starts strong on “Misfit Paradise” with the starry-eyed piano ballad “Another Night,” where she wonders, “What if we never met? What if I never said, ‘Could I come over, I want to know you better?’” Later, on the bucolic “Yosemite,” where Cools sings in the measured style of an old folk song until she gives way to distant feral wails by song’s end, she issues the invitation, “The howling winds are calling me/Meet me at Yosemite.”\n\nThe title track is the messiest song on “Misfit Paradise,” with the vocalist’s delivery not enough to take over a largely uneventful, if over-complicated, arrangement as she sings lines like, “the only way we know is never to let go.” On the flipside, the rocking “Gold Woman” might be the tightest track, alive and raw as she sings of a femme fatale only to pivot to a confession that she’s a “gold woman” herself.\n\nYet the acoustic-guitar-driven closing cut “Soaring” is the best overall representative of “Misfit Paradise” as Cools struggles to articulate her intense feelings: “It’s hard to explain the grip you’ve got on me/It’s hard to explain everything I fear.”\n\nSometimes love is like that.\n\nEvelyn Cools\n\n\"Misfit Paradise\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nKaty Perry offers humble 'Smile'\n\nKaty Perry may get knocked for sticking to formula on her new “Smile,” but it works.\n\nPerry’s last release – 2017’s “Witness” – was abysmal, an attempt at something innovative and “purposeful” (Perry’s word) that was soulless, overproduced and overlong. On the final track, she sang the symbolic line, “No one’s ever seen me like this,” and it’s doubtful many would want to see her like that again.\n\nThe humble “Smile” – released within days of the birth of her daughter, Daisy – is an about-face. Like Lady Gaga’s retreat from art pop into her comfort zone earlier this year with “Chromatica,” Perry is blithely unassuming, breaking no ground and visiting familiar territory.\n\nAlthough nothing overwhelms, there are several highlights. Perry’s audience can be swept along with the muscled rhythm of “Cry About It Later” as the singer goes drinking, contemplating a new tattoo and looking for a new love: “I think I’m ready to be someone’s new muse.” She’s equally confident in the ticking timebomb of “Resilient” (ready to grow “right through the cracks”), playful in the plucky tropical R&B diversion of “Harleys in Hawaii” and determined in the swooping aural storm of “Teary Eyes.”\n\nAnd unlike the ill-fated closer of “Witness,” “Smile” punches out with a grandiose “What Makes a Woman,” a self-assured anthem about learning to love yourself.\n\nMuch of the rest of “Smile” is fairly forgettable, though never bad, with Perry forcing the drama with fits of oversinging, accompanied by snappy pop and EDM-blasted arrangements.\n\nPerry has said in interviews that “Smile” was her effort to put a dark time behind her, and it sounds like she did.\n\nNot every album has to change the world.\n\nKaty Perry\n\n\"Smile\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBraxton's 'Name' is (mostly) healthy\n\nToni Braxton’s new “Spell My Name” feels like a healthy break-up album at first.\n\nBusted relationships can be a mess, sometimes driven by devastating heartbreak, desperate attempts at reconciliation and relentless rage. Yet at the onset of “Spell My Name,” Braxton is where she needs to be, with a little bitterness and a lot of pride fueling her resolve to move on.\n\nThe stirring groove of buoyant opening cut “Dance” is all she needs to deliver a kiss-off to a fresh ex, employing her robust vocal with dignified restraint: “Tonight you’ll see I won’t be lonely.”\n\nSubsequent tracks follow a similar theme: Missy Elliott pops in for some sass on the rich call of “Do It” (a unifying anthem to support women who need to break away from a bad relationship), Braxton navigates the unhurried strings and hefty textures of “Gotta Move On,” and “Fallin’” adds a gorgeous context for a biting send off.\n\nBut on the fifth song, “Spell My Name’s” title track, there’s a pivot as Braxton plies the suggestive swirling rhythms and percolating percussion to make a play for a younger man.\n\nThen Braxton simply spins out in all directions – stuck in the limbo of a half-broken relationship on the intoxicating “O.V.E.Rr.” and swamped by ambivalence on the slow sprawling “Saturday Night.” Meanwhile, standout track “Happy Without Me” is a showcase of excruciating heartbreak, with Braxton pouring on the passion with wrenching despair.\n\n“Spell My Name” closes with the earthy soul of “Nothin’,” which finds our hero reduced to rubble with the sobering realization, “Without your love, I ain’t nothin’.”\n\nIt’s a heartfelt, albeit disappointing, finale, but that’s the way love goes.\n\nToni Braxton\n\n\"Spell My Name\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nGeorgas confronts 'All That Emotion'\n\nHannah Georgas has used her immaculate voice as a vehicle for vulnerability. It’s clean and soft and inspires empathy for all the betas and introverts who are overpowered and overshadowed by alphas and extroverts. She can break a heart and prompt a chuckle with one line.\n\nThe Canadian singer-songwriter treads into even darker territory on “All That Emotion,” which suits the title with ambivalence – resentment, resolve, frustration, anger and something more sinister as she confronts what could be lovers, friends, relatives, or perhaps all of the above, who have held the upper hand, manipulated her and left her feeling helpless and untrusting.\n\nNo, this isn’t a traditional breakup album.\n\nWorking with producer Aaron Dessner, Georgas creates a more fleshed out sound for her electronic-based arrangements, and the restless rhythms and muted frenetic touches serve to underscore her anxious lines, though her voice is soothing, save for palpable ache on mesmerizing closing track “Cruel.”\n\nIn the percolating cadence and meditative strains of “Easy,” Georgas contemplates how a dead relationship can transform the soul, on the sweet-sounding “Same Mistake” she calmly notes, “I grew up in a family of wolves,” and on “Pray It Away” she wonders, “Will you still love me even though I’m not what you thought?”\n\nIt’s weighty material and beautifully executed. Listeners may long for more of the dry humor and higher energy that Georgas has employed in the past, but that wouldn’t have been appropriate on most of these songs.\n\nBesides, there’s a refreshing truth at the core of “All That Emotion,” and when Georgas dovetails with the ginger rhythm of opening cut “That Emotion” – singing, “Hide behind all that emotion/See how long, how far, you can keep going” – it’s an oddly liberating challenge.\n\nHannah Georgas\n\n\"All That Emotion\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMorissette's lyrics offset shortcomings\n\nAlanis Morissette released her groundbreaking “Jagged Little Pill” 25 years ago, and now she releases a “Such Pretty Forks in the Road” that is simply grounded.\n\nYes, it’s a letdown, a musically monotonous string of unadventurous arrangements that could use more hooks and shimmer. But it’s also a platform for Morissette’s trademark introspective thoughts.\n\nSo, while “Such Pretty Forks in the Road” is short on sing-along choruses and aural dazzle, the 46-year-old Morissette compensates with moody monologues about middle-age life – in her case, with a focus on motherhood and complex relationships shaded by the residual damage of abuse.\n\n“This is the sound of me hitting bottom,” she warns on opening cut “Smiling” that hints at a darkly sedate Lana Del Rey vibe, but without mystique or sensuality. Subsequent songs are dominated by piano with flourishes of strings as Morissette offers loving warnings and encouragement to her children on “Ablaze,” ponders the elusive keys to successful relationships on “Missing the Miracle” (“You see the figure skater, and I fear the ice is thin”) and grieves “the end of superwomaning” on “Losing the Plot.”\n\nMorissette’s challenges are many, whether sheds concerns about the opinions of others as she collapses into a meltdown on “Diagnosis” (“I’m folding in on myself since I am out of order”), struggles with her paralyzing fear of change on “Nemesis” or falls victim to opportunists on “Pedestal.”\n\nYet her often-poignant thoughts are prone to underwhelm with flaccid sonics as their foundation. It’s not a deal-breaker because Morissette is still that intriguing provocateur she was in her alt-rock 1990s. But it could have been more persuasive.\n\nAlanis Morissette\n\n\"Such Pretty Forks in the Road\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nProducer highlights deserving singers\n\nHitmaking producer Ricky Reed – who has worked with the likes of Lizzo, Halsey and Twenty One Pilots – puts out his own album with the new “The Room,” though he still throws focus on his guest vocalists.\n\nIt’s a smart move: His revolving cast of singers are an underappreciated group of talented performers who deserve a boost to their exposure. Plus, it’s still clearly Reed’s album, his aesthetic of glossy R&B blended with discrete electronic touches and warm jazz creating a signature sound that gives “The Room” smooth continuity.\n\nAnd for their part the vocalists are distinct, though they complement each other in Reed’s finessed sound.\n\nAfter free-floating through the ambience of opener “Shipwreck,” “The Room” brings aboard new singers with every song, and many unpack emotional baggage. There’s romanticism weighted by separation in the lush “Us (How Sweet It Was),” featuring Duendita and My Morning Jacket’s Jim James, and Godfather666 is uneasy in the lonely soul of “No Future” (where he wonders, “How can anybody love me?”).\n\nElsewhere, Malaya dovetails with the busy percussion and throbbing riffs of “In a New Place,” urgently noting, “I ain’t got no time for your words or your games,” and John-Robert and Alessia Cara offer coy humor on their flirty duet “Fav Boy.”\n\n“The Room” also cooks up a heated vibe for “Real Magic” (featuring Terrace Martin and St. Panther) and classic R&B for “Better” (featuring Leon Bridges and Kiana Lede), and Ayoni’s sumptuous delivery brings “The Room” to a spiritual-esque close with “No Stone.”\n\nLyrically, “The Room” is fairly barren, and the well-executed atmosphere sometimes feels more important than the passion of the vocalists. But overall, it’s a sophisticated and engaging package.\n\nRicky Reed\n\n\"The Room\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nErasure is half-lit on 'Neon'\n\nU.K. duo Erasure – aka Andy Bell and Vince Clarke – has been making pop songs on both sides of the Atlantic since the 1980s, though its last release, 2017’s “World Be Gone,” was a marked diversion, a dispirited collection of serious songs that broke from form and came across as clunky.\n\nBut the act’s new “The Neon” is a celebration of ’80s synth-pop, and at least half of the duo is fully invested.\n\nClarke’s production is crisp, synthetic confections that lovingly throw back to the dance floors and airwaves of decades ago. He creates a rolling hook for opener “Hey Now (Think I Got a Feeling),” shifts to the up-tempo percolation of “Fallen Angel,” churns through the gripping groove of “Shot a Satellite” and hitches to springy infection on “Diamond Lies.” And as usual, Clarke’s instrumentation is packed with nuances, decorative touches that dovetail with and add contrast to melodic backing vocals.\n\nUnfortunately, Bell’s vocals, which have in the past matched Clarke’s energy and enterprise, is a tougher sell. Perhaps he still feels drained from the darkness of “World Be Gone,” maybe his voice has aged into a lower range that doesn’t rise to Clarke’s peaks, or it could be that the well-intended-but-often-superficial lyrics don’t inspire him.\n\nWhatever, Erasure’s momentum routinely dips, and Bell is the cause, whether he’s fading in the subtle textures of “Nerves of Steel,” overshadowed on “Tower of Love” or lost in the uneventful “Careful What I Try To Do.”\n\nAt least Bell also turns it up, bringing vocal zest to the brighter arrangements (for example singing on “Diamond Lies,” “I’ve gotta stop pretending I can be that guy … Gotta wash my hands of you”) and supplying sincerity to the lesser material, as when he transcends his own awkwardness on “New Horizons” to sing, “When all is lost, don’t you ever give up hope/There will be new horizons/We will live to love again.”\n\nGiven Erasure’s long history, you have to believe him.\n\nErasure\n\n\"The Neon\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nHalestorm reimagines itself\n\nHard rock band Halestorm has a history or recording EPs of cover songs in between releasing their full-length albums, but with “Reimagined” they mix it up: They cover their own songs.\n\nFans of the bracing Pennsylvania band might be apprehensive to hear the group has stripped down their songs for the new renditions, but they shouldn’t worry: Frontwoman Lzzy Hale has never been one for subtleties, and she makes up for any instrumental restraint with blunt (sometimes too blunt) firepower.\n\nHale carries the newly R&B-flavored “I Get Off” with blistering lines like, “I get off on you getting off on me” as she boils into full fury on the bridge. Her passion is also at the helm of the plaintive “I Miss the Misery,” and Hale bellows and wails through the strident drama of a retro-stadium-anthem version of “I Am the Fire,” asking, “Am I brave enough? Am I strong enough?”\n\nFellow rock belter Amy Lee of Evanescence joins Hale for a new take on “Break In,” turning the song into a raspy duo, an empowering statement of mutual support – which with a bit more finesse could have been a convincing throwback to the Wilson sisters of Heart.\n\nThere’s also an audacious cover of “I Will Always Love You,” which isn’t nearly as moving as the original version by Dolly Parton or the powerhouse rendition by Whitney Houston, but the Parton-penned song’s stately beauty nevertheless shines through.\n\n“Reimagined” comes to life at the end with “Mz. Hyde,” Hale glowing in the added voltage to bask in the electric crunch, bringing a feisty sense of character to the song that doesn’t show as prominently elsewhere on the EP.\n\nThat closing track underscores the fact that though “Reimagined” is an interesting diversion, Halestorm is simply better with all guns blazing.\n\nHalestorm\n\n\"Reimagined\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBrandy makes an eccentric return\n\n“Sorry for the tardy” sings Brandy on “Saving All My Love,” the first track on her new “B7” – the singer’s first release in 8 years. It’s a curious track, with Brandy showing rich nuance with her now-41-year-old voice as she skirts along the irregular rhythm, merging with the music and vocalizing multiple voices as she also declares “I ain’t saving all my love for you.”\n\nBrandy has been missed in the pop/R&B world, yet her return is odd, refreshingly anti-formulaic most of the time and strangely both intimate and obscure. It’s a personal journey that is only clear in flashes.\n\nFrom the sweeping effects and electronic bloops of “Unconditional Oceans” to a swirling duet with her teen daughter Sy’rai (where Brandy uses her rap alias Bran’Nu), “B7” is comfortably erratic.\n\nFor her part, Brandy is also all over the place, luxuriating in the pretty strains of “No Tomorrow” while singing “When you stare at me I feel so beautiful,” funneling an angry rasp over the jazzy piano of “Say Something” to rage, “You take back promises, where did they go?” and accentuating the electric jabs of “I Am More” by declaring she “can’t be the other woman … I need more ’cause I am more.”\n\nBrandy also drops in references to mental health, sadly battling deep insecurities on the humming “Borderline” with “Don’t wanna be schizo this time” and bashing a bad beau on “Bye Bipolar” with a spiritualistic combination of bitterness and humor (“I lost your ring, and you can keep your last name”).\n\nThere are also accessible and rewarding duets with Daniel Caesar (“Love Again”) and Chance the Rapper (“Baby Mama”), which underscore the trippy and sometimes overly eccentric adventures elsewhere on the release.\n\n“B7” is mostly a win, however, and hopefully enough to motivate Brandy to forego another disappearing act.\n\nBrandy\n\n\"B7\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nSwift matures on subtle 'Folklore'\n\nTaylor Swift is 30 years old and several years deep into what appears to be a satisfying relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn. Not coincidentally, her new “Folklore” simmers all of the fire, anger, joy and vindication of her previous albums into a sophisticated and quiet brew, markedly nostalgic and fueled by long-term undercurrents of emotion rather than fresh love or hurt.\n\n“Folklore,” concocted by Swift in quarantine with help from The National’s Aaron Dessner and producer Jack Antonoff, is a boldly thorough departure in form, a gamble that her unwavering fan base will embrace it nonetheless, even if the tone is understated, free from pep … and honestly a bit overlong.\n\nYet it’s also the most consistent of her eight albums, packed with confident and effective songwriting convincingly voiced by Swift and free from pop pandering (not to shade those wildly infectious hits from her past).\n\nListeners will be swayed from her one-two opening punch of tearjerker songs “The 1” and “Cardigan,” the former a mellow heartbreaker with a wistful Swift mourning a lost relationship with someone who should have been “the one,” and the latter a soft-rumbling and poignant tale: “When I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone’s bed, you put me on and said I was your favorite.”\n\nThere are no flops on the release that also finds Swift taking the role of a corpse seeing her tormentor at her funeral (“My Tears Ricochet”), remembering an endangered childhood friend in the gorgeously gauzy “Seven,” tortured by the ache of unrequited infatuation (“August”) and enchantingly broken in the folkish “Mirrorball.”\n\nAnd perhaps in a nod to her unsettled days, Swift closes the release with “Hoax,” where she flails helplessly in the grip of a poisonous relationship: “I am ash from your fire.”\n\n“Folklore” didn’t need a dance song.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\n\"Folklore\"\n\nRating: 4-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\n'Dreamland' shimmers with surrealism\n\n\"Dreamland” is an absorbing trip into emotional otherworldliness from the U.K. band Glass Animals.\n\nThe group layers synth-pop and hip-hop elements to create a luxurious, yet relatively delicate, atmosphere enhanced by frontman Davy Bayley’s high, and melodically inviting, vocals.\n\nIt’s an elusive brew, with rays of truth arcing out of a fanciful foundation, and the effect can be narcotic.\n\nThe shimmering title-track opener sets the tone for connection in a stay-at-home world – “You’ve had too much of a digital love/You want everything live, you want things you can touch,” sings Bayley. And much as society takes on a surrealistic air when its members are self-isolated in their safe spaces, “Dreamland” labors away in an altered state. It’s akin to taking hallucinogens at a crowded festival; sharing the moment, though your experience is yours alone.\n\nThere’s an intoxicating flow in the infatuation-based “Hot Sugar,” hazy minimalism in the peculiar break-up-themed “Melon and the Coconut” and a commanding beat loop for “Waterfalls Coming Out Your Mouth.”\n\nThe themes are provocative – like when Bayley rides the compressed teeter of “Space Ghost Coast to Coast” to address a childhood friend who plotted a mass killing, or when he assumes the role of a child whose mom is abused by his dad on “Domestic Bliss,” and pleas with her to escape with him: “Fight for me.”\n\nEven Bayley’s relationship songs are complicated, such as when the mutually self-destructive pair on the booming “Your Love (Déjà Vu)” prove hellbent on normalizing chaos, and “It’s All So Incredibly Loud” is about the point of no return in a doomed relationship, the moment when one person fatally wounds the bond with a statement that can’t be retracted.\n\n“Dreamland” may not be lucid, but it’s rewarding for the adventurous.\n\nGlass Animals\n\n\"Dreamland\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nDeborah Silver shines on 'Glitter'\n\nDeborah Silver’s new “Glitter & Grits” is a breezy joy, an inventive spin on classic songs from the “Great American Songbook” that serves as a respite from a pandemic year. And Silver knows firsthand about COVID-19: She contracted it and had to spend 58 days in isolation from her family.\n\nShe has since recovered, however, and is actively promoting “Glitter & Grits,” which she made with the help of producer Ray Benson of the Texas swing band Asleep at the Wheel. Benson brought along bandmates to the project, too, putting the “Grits” in these renditions of the standards.\n\n“Glitter & Grits” does more than just swing: It’s flush with other strains of jazz and Americana, awash with the nostalgia of these familiar songs and cushioned by the mildly restrained theatrics of Silver’s delivery.\n\nIt’s unavoidably hokey at times – “Ac-cent-tchu-ate the Positive” sounds like a children’s song, “Get Happy” is steeped in cheesy backing vocals, and “Deep in the Heart of Texas” is cornpone cliché, albeit well-executed.\n\nNevertheless, most tracks are balanced by their dignified arrangements, comfortably lived-in songs dressed up with flare from fiddle, mandolin, harmonica and rootsy piano. For her part, Mississippi-native Silver keeps the tone generally upbeat and polished – and fortunately, never hammy.\n\nSilver is playful in the uplifting cadence of “I Got Rhythm” and romping rendition of “Bill Bailey, Won’t You Please Come Home,” while she stretches out in the regal refrains of “Almost Like Being in Love,” the absorbing rendition of “After You’ve Gone” and the sultry take on ‘I’m Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter.” She’s also oddly perky on “that Old Black Magic,” and stately as she glides along the brushed rhythm on the sauntering “Embraceable You.”\n\nPair “Glitter & Grits” with a cocktail, and you’ll have a relaxing evening.\n\nDeborah Silver\n\n\"Glitter & Grits\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nDenny dip into eccentric 'Exotic Moog'\n\nMartin Denny’s “Exotic Moog” was a peculiar 1969 release, an alternate universe of sound from the father of exotica music in which he reimagined his songs, as well as those of other contemporary performers, by using the Moog synthesizer. The then-futuristic instrument helped birth the electronic music genre, though now it sounds technologically quaint and whimsical.\n\nAs odd as “Exotic Moog” might have sounded when it originally came out, it likely sounds even more bizarre more than 50 years later in its first-ever reissue, which was designed to coincide with Record Store Day (Aug. 29).\n\nDenny built a career on tiki-bar-friendly lush tropical soundscapes, percussion-heavy lulling rhythms, surreal vocals (usually wordless) and signature special effects like (human-made) rare “bird” calls. But whereas exotica provides the perfect narcotic effect for a cocktail party, “Exotic Moog” is something else altogether, establishing a psychedelic backdrop for, say, dropping acid at a sci-fi festival at a planetarium.\n\nIt might be a challenging listen for Denny fans to hear him reconstruct his songs “Quiet Village” and “The Enchanted Sea” into quirky space-jazz themes for cheesy aliens.\n\nWhat’s more, the Everly Brothers’ “Let It Be Me” is recast into something unsettling and trippy, Vince Guaraldi’s “Cast Your Fate to the Wind” veers into cartoonland, and Tom Jones is revamped twice – in a swarm of buzzing faux hornets on “Delilah” and an obstacle course of glitchy nuance on “Love Me Tonight.”\n\nOther dramatic makeovers include works by Herb Alpert (“A Taste of Honey”) and Astrud Gilberto (“Let Go”), and there’s even a baffling take on the theme from “Midnight Cowboy.”\n\nDenny obviously had a grand time with these remakes and “Exotic Moog” is a curious moment in music history.\n\nJust don’t expect to sing along when you listen.\n\nMartin Denny\n\n\"Exotic Moog\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMichael Love Michael makes mark\n\nThere’s so much going on with Michael Love Michael’s debut, “XO,” that listeners may struggle to break it down. Complicated as it is, however, it’s an ambitiously distinct statement from the artist.\n\nMichael is a nonbinary Black performer from the Midwest who is now based in New York. Although “XO” is rooted in Michael’s specific experiences, “XO” will provoke emotions from a universal audience: It’s unsettling, angry, dreamy, resigned and hopeful.\n\nThe release is likewise complex sonically as the arrangements mash grunge and industrial rock into aggro-techno and cinematic electronica, decorated with elements of mainstream popular music. Many tracks are grounded in high-voltage foundations and hitched to rugged rhythms, while Michael’s singing soars untethered from the mix.\n\nThose vocals – thin and delivered unevenly – will prove a sticking point for some, yet they also serve to underscore Michael’s fears and vulnerabilities, from the anxiety in the menacing “Rope” (“Born to live a life of terror and pain”) to the disheartened observations in the bleak march of “On God.”\n\nThere’s a neo-Goth allure in “XO” as Michael weaves through the unsolvable mazes of “Mother’s Day,” “Million Girls” and “The Hatred,” but the release hits an affecting soft spot midway, where the artist revisits an unrequited love on “Blueberry” (“Without you, I’m barely breathing”) and a former love on the R&B-kissed “Orion.”\n\n“XO” ends with a title track about the kind of love that can be the hardest to come by – self-love – with Michael’s ghostly vocals massaging the atmosphere with a refrain of “I love you.”\n\nThis release may be more phantasm than fantasy, but Michael comes through when it counts.\n\nMichael Love Michael\n\n\"XO\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nNeon Trees want to be remembered\n\nThere’s something revealing about the title of the new release from Neon Trees, “I Can Feel You Forgetting Me”: It’s been 6 years since the Utah pop-rock group’s last release, “Pop Psychology” – a lifetime in pop years.\n\nIn the interim between albums, frontman Tyler Glenn performed on Broadway (in “Kinky Boots”) and put out a solo release, and his return with “I Can Feel You Forgetting Me” is darker and stripped down as it conveys the tale of a man who has been knocked down and is learning to live on his own.\n\nYet the group’s return lacks the infectious spirit of past releases, and the band that has so handily resurrected the sound of 1980s music has now inadvertently conjured another trope from the era: the lackluster follow-up.\n\n“I Can Feel You Forgetting Me” sounds like a selection of B-sides (from when B-sides were a thing), castoffs and filler songs. All the pieces are still there, from the dynamic blend of synth and organic music to the sing-along choruses to the playful attitude. However, it’s mostly a little off, a bit flat, a tad slow or just not catchy enough. And Neon Trees are a little more Yacht Rock than New Wave this time around, which we could have done without.\n\nThe busy arrangement of opener “Nights,” the hum and frustration of “Used To Like,” the classic strains of “Skeleton Boy” … they all help the cause. And later, “Everything Is Killing Me” hitches to an engaging groove and lines like, “I used to lie enough to get by … I couldn’t keep up with it.”\n\nBest of all is the sweeping closing track, “New Best Friend,” the most engaging song in the lot with a self-accepting Glenn seemingly taking comfort that he is “always forever a black sheep.”\n\nBy contrast there’s the inconsequential rumbling of “Holy Ghost,” the random energy of “Going Through Something” and the sappy “Mess Me Up” that at least offers, “If you’re gonna mess me up, don’t do it slowly.”\n\nUltimately, “I Can Feel You Forgetting Me” isn’t very memorable.\n\nNeon Trees\n\n\"I Can Feel You Forgetting Me\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n+++++++++++\n\nPretenders conjure a lovable 'Hate'\n\nPretenders vocalist Chrissie Hynde sings on the jangly new song “Maybe Love Is in NYC,” “Things change and they’re never quite the same for anyone.” Yet her band’s new album, “Hate for Sale,” defies those words.\n\nIt’s been 40 years since the group made its groundbreaking self-titled debut, and Hynde has been the only consistent member of Pretenders over the years. However, “Hate for Sale” could easily pass for an immediate follow-up to 1980’s Pretenders, not something that came about four decades, 10 albums and numerous lineup changes later.\n\nThe group’s 2020 sound is barely different from “Pretenders” and the structure is the same – quickly dispatched rock songs that cruise on infectious melodies and periodically blaze with guitars, contrasted with an occasional ballad or some sonic switch-up. And Hynde’s characteristic warble is remarkably unchanged as she shifts from plaintive tones to punkish derision, gliding along “Hate for Sale’s” complicated jumble of emotions.\n\nFrom the false start of the album’s classic title track to the cello-and-piano foundation of closer “Crying in Public,” Pretenders delivers distinctive diversions, but Hynde’s dominating and empathetic persona lends continuity. She wrestles the crunchy cadence of “Turf Accountant Daddy” to deliver a searing indictment of a womanizing traveling salesman, and she fuses sarcasm and pain on the comfortable “Didn’t Want to Be This Lonely.” And always at ease, whether in the slinky reggae of “Lightning Man” or the R&B vibe of “You Can’t Hurt a Fool,” Hynde is ever tough, pointedly not romanticizing drug abuse in the electrified “Junkie Walk” and taking a shot at vulnerable women on “Crying in Public.”\n\n“Hate for Sale’s” tone is a tad flat at times, though Hynde still sounds amazingly close to her prime.\n\nPretenders\n\n\"Hate for Sale\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nRetro vibe takes unconventional turns\n\nLos Retros methodically builds his aesthetic with his second EP in two years, “Everlasting.”\n\nThe Oxnard, California, native – aka Mauri Tapia – follows the 2019 EP “Retrospect” with an “Everlasting” that fuses elements of early synth music and soft rock for a throwback sound that didn’t really exist before, but maybe it should have.\n\nUndoubtedly by design, the off-center release feels both familiar and unreal as the disparate pieces work together, fitfully, forcing listeners to get in the right head space to accept it.\n\nFor instance, “Sweet Honey” feels like a hallucination when it sets sail on a yacht rock vibe that carries more soul in the mix than typical for the genre, and as it cruises along, the journey becomes increasingly eccentric until it’s facsimilating Prince with its high vocals and lyrics like, “There’s something about the way you look.”\n\n“The Messiah” sounds like a classic pop-rock ballad blended with a sci-fi horror theme, and as it gurgles woozily in a synthetic stew, it simmers into what could be an otherworldly porn soundtrack as Tapia sounds both earnest and stilted with his vocal delivery. Meanwhile, the keyboard-heavy “Cry of the Humble” sounds like an interlude for a rock opera with Tapia crooning away, and “New Humanity” burnishes shinier tones to accompany his drunken meander of la-la-la’s and ah’s.\n\nFinally, “Everlasting” ends with a drowsy “Fruitful” that tops jazzy drums with blooping synths.\n\nAlthough it’s discombobulating the first time around, “Everlasting” makes more sense with repeated listens … so much so that Tapia’s audience may wish the EP had more than five songs.\n\nLos Retros\n\n\"Everlasting\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nPaul Hardcastle takes it easy\n\nPaul Hardcastle came up with a peculiar song in 1985. Using a propulsive, state-of-the-art synthetic foundation for his anti-war single “19,” Hardcastle layered in a spoken broadcaster voice reiterating the point that the average age of a combat soldier in the Vietnam War was 19, with stutter-cut vocals going “nu-nu-nu-nu-nineteen” against a melodic group of backing vocals blithely singing along.\n\nDifficult as it might be in 2020 to think of such a grim song packing out the dancefloors (well, it was the 1980s), “19” went to No. 1 in Hardcastle’s native U.K. and was a hit around the world, including in the U.S.\n\nIn the 35 years since, the 62-year-old has toyed with electronica, dance, funk and pop to settle on what is essentially ambient chill/smooth jazz with his latest, “Nine.”\n\nHe took a long journey to end up with something so deceptively simple and formulaic, yet the release is an effective escape, music to block out the background of noise and implied noise during troubled times.\n\n“Nine” could be the sounds of an upscale hotel lobby or a sedate coffee shop.\n\nOpening cut “Welcome to the Morning” might suit a stretching sequence in a yoga class, while more rhythmic tracks such as the shuffling “Let It Go” and sci-fi-tinged “Falling” could offer soothing strains (with a little kick) for a home project. Meanwhile, the throbbing undertones and percussive loop of “Tropicool” is perfect cocktail music.\n\nHardcastle employs the usual suspects to achieve drowsy mystique – piano, synths, guitar, horn – and occasionally unobtrusive vocals that edge into creepy whispers for “Outside My Window” and bloom into full-blown cheesy splendor on “Lovin You Lovin Me.”\n\nMostly, though, everything about “Nine” stays out of your way so you can do your thing.\n\nPaul Hardcastle\n\n\"Nine\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nKinane does tricks on 'Trampoline'\n\nAs society continues to tweak the line between “entertaining” and “offensive,” comedy takes the brunt of the censorship. For good reason: The “edge” in edgy comedy typically refers to comics pushing the limits of good taste, eliciting laughs from audiences who are taken to the brink (and beyond) of acceptability.\n\nTo be sure, much of what is culturally allowable today will soon enough be forbidden, and that undoubtedly has a chilling effect on some comedians who don’t want to be forced to edit or apologize for their material in the future.\n\nBut not Kyle Kinane, the 43-year-old Midwesterner who is arguably the best active stand-up in the business. His delivery is comfortable, growly-voiced storytelling that gets laughs from jokes, jokes within jokes, asides and overall absurdity. He’s relatable and self-effacing, but winkingly savvy and deceptively smart.\n\nHis themes bounce around on “Trampoline.” He talks about reaching “rock bottom” when he was sober for three weeks and caught himself cleaning his bathroom on a Saturday night. He struggles with the discomfort of self-doubts in an era of sexual harassment claims. And he gently mocks the behavior of an aging couple – his own parents – like when his mom declared, “I’ll never have a mail slot in my door, only a mailbox.”\n\n“Trampoline” also includes satisfying longer tales, about everything from Kinane’s unnerving visit to a walk-in clinic to his attempt to prank his roommate with a life-size dummy that backfires when he freaks out about the prop before his roommate comes home. There’s also a tale about how his DUI in America got him sent out of Canada.\n\nIn other words, much of Kinane’s “Trampoline” humor is connected to getting drunk, sexual harassment, making fun of old people and getting a DUI. And somehow, thanks to Kinane’s thematic pivots and endearing personality, it’s still OK … for now.\n\nKyle Kinane\n\n\"Trampoline in a Ditch\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nWainwright isn't just a showoff\n\nIn the past decade or so, Rufus Wainwright wrote two operas, put William Shakespeare’s sonnets to music, got married and became a father.\n\nSo it’s not surprising that with all that going on, his new “Unfollow the Rules” is his first traditional singer-songwriter release since 2012’s “Out of the Game,” though it might not be accurate to call it mainstream accessible.\n\n“Unfollow the Rules” drips with privilege, from the elevated vocabulary to the worldly lyrical references, and Wainwright’s operatic indulgences seem to have heightened his sense of theater, which will undermine the authenticity of “Unfollow the Rules” for some listeners.\n\nStill, those who can hang with lyrics about a “fecund resource for anger,” “a flaying funeral snare,” the Conservatorio Luigi Cherubini (in Florence, Italy) and Welsh-born actress Sarah Siddons (who died in 1831) will find much to appreciate here, from the lush orchestration led by venerable producer Mitchell Froom to Wainwright’s croon, which has settled into a deeper, more palatable range than the high, sometimes-whining delivery of his youth.\n\nDespite his proclivity to show off, Wainwright fills these beautiful songs with humor, poking at absurd emphasis on regional popularity on the wry “You Ain’t Big” and singing against the resonant beat of “Trouble in Paradise,” “There’s always trouble in paradise/Don’t matter if you’re good of bad or mean or awfully nice.”\n\nWainwright also hits notes that will disarm those dealing with middle-age introspection, including a touching “My Little You” for his daughter and a “Peaceful Afternoon” for his husband, Jorn Weisbrodt, where Wainwright says the relationship is “running at full steam” and then hitches to a swaying melody to sing, “I pray that your face is the last I see on a peaceful afternoon.”\n\nWith lines like that, it’s easy to overlook his esoteric tendencies.\n\nRufus Wainwright\n\n\"Unfollow the Rules\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\n'World' aims to inspire children\n\nAfter building a career of making music for films, TV shows and commercials – as well as pop music for adults – Rhode Island native Greg Lato pivots to his first album for children, “Create My Own World.”\n\nLato is gentle and heartfelt on the release. He’s not one to hype up kids with a barrage of infectious hooks, though a little more bounce could help the momentum lags on “Create My Own World.” Instead, the father of two daughters aims to uplift and inspire as he entertains.\n\nIn one of several spoken interludes, Lato speaks of an imaginary friend named Gene who taught Lato healthy habits when he was a boy. Queue the track “Hi Gene” (“hygiene,” get it?), a sweet synthpop number where the singer references brushing and flossing teeth and keeping clean because, “I don’t want to smell like an elephant!”\n\n“Share My Stuff” is an enthusiastic endorsement of sharing, and fellow children’s music star Bill Harley helps Lato offer encouraging tales of perseverance on “Two Slow Snails.” Elsewhere, Lato’s jazz saxophonist father, Vinny Lato, has a solo part on “Create My World’s” imagination-themed title track.\n\nAlso “Try” is a reggae-lilting mental-health pep talk for kids (a complement to Lato’s sing-along children’s book of the same name), and “What Daddies Do (I Will Be With You)” is a touching vow of support from parent to child.\n\nThe music is a pleasing mix of retro pop-rock, even if Lato isn’t the strongest singer, and those who fear “Create My Own World” is too heavy with messages can enjoy lighter fare such as the dancey tribute “I Like Sprinkles” and the lighthearted mystery “I Can’t Find My Sock!”\n\nStill, the soft sonics and understanding themes of “Create My Own World” would be better suited for introspective children than those who generally bounce off the walls.\n\nGreg Lato\n\n\"Create My Own World\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nIris Lune processes grief\n\nThe death of a parent can be a particularly disorientating loss, and artists have shown ingenuous ways to process their feelings. For example, Canadian singer Jane Siberry created a devastating 10-minute song, “The Vigil (The Sea),” about grieving beside her mother’s deathbed, telling her mom it’s OK to let go and leading her to the afterlife. And American singer Poe commemorated her late father on the album “Haunted” by inventing interactions with her dad by using snippets of spoken recordings of him that she found after he died.\n\nIris Lune, aka Brooklyn-based Ella Joy Meir, is similarly enterprising, if not quite as successful, in dealing with her mother’s death on “Love Loss Love.”\n\nMeir’s voice is mellifluous yet vulnerable as she copes with hurt, fear, uncertainty and emptiness while also taking comfort in deep and forever love. Likewise, the songs feature contrasting textures – at their heart, many are uncomplicated folk songs improbably draped in layers of dissimilar electronica.\n\nAt best, “Love Loss Love” pierces the soul with a quiet passage in “Summer Blue” – Meir singing, “I need to know that you’ll be OK, that we’ll be OK, that I’ll be OK” – sends mixed signals in the calming vocals pinned to an anxiety-prompting rhythm on “Haven” and tethers the jazz-parallel arrangement of “Hiding Behind Glass” to glitchy vocals with lines like, “Tried hiding behind glass, but everyone just saw right through me.” And despite the life-affirming softness on “Bottled Up,” Meir drops lyrics such as, “Never thought I’d be so brave with all my insides splashed like roadkill.”\n\nAt worst, the experimentalism goes astray, be it in the clunkily unconventional cadence of “Note to Self” or the wobbly strains of “Treasure.” But even then, “Love Loss Love” is intriguing.\n\nIris Lune\n\n\"Love Loss Love\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\n'Eurovision' kicks up the camp\n\nThe soundtrack for “Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga” is an absolute hodgepodge of music, which is exactly what it should be.\n\nThe Netflix film is a parody of the Eurovision competition, which is often so campy that it seems like a parody of music on its own. Yet Eurovision (which annually pits music acts from mostly European countries against each other) is inescapably popular and ripe for this film starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as a duo from Iceland.\n\nThe soundtrack features goofy brief songs by the duo (with Ferrell doing his own vocals and Molly Sanden of My Marianne singing the vocals for the McAdams character), ranging from the over-the-top EDM of “Double Trouble” (also featuring Tiesto) to the Old World-flavored “Jaja Ding Dong,” which is loaded with hilarious innuendo.\n\nThere are also full-length songs from the likes of the English pop band Anteros (“Fool Moon”), Portuguese crooner Salvador Sobral (“Amar Pelos Dois”), Swedish singer Petra Nielsen, who offers a rousing caberet-esque sing-along “Come and Play (Masquerade),” and “Eurovision” star/American icon Demi Lovato (“In the Mirror”), who plays the ill-fated Icelandic singer Katiana Lindsdottir in the film.\n\n“Downton Abbey” star Dan Stevens also shows up in the cast as one of the competitors, and many former Eurovision competitors appear in cameos – and in a grab-bag cast medley of Cher’s “Believe,” Madonna’s “Ray of Light,” Abba’s “Waterloo,” Celine Dion’s “Ne Partez pas Sans Moi” and The Black Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta Feeling.”\n\nThe soundtrack also includes a pleasantly non-kitschy suite of the film’s score by Atli Orvarsson.\n\nnfortunately, this year “Eurovision” was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But maybe this loving Netflix film tribute, and its soundtrack, can help fill the void.\n\nvarious acts\n\n\"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nAtlanta's 6lack stays in his lane\n\n6lack’s music is rich in a spellbinding, narrowly focused atmosphere on his new “6pc Hot EP.”\n\nBut don’t let that mislead you: The lyrics show that the Atlanta R&B singer has a lot on his mind, despite the monochromatic, albeit bewitching, arrangements.\n\n“6pc Hot EP” will put listeners in an altered state with its textured, relaxed vibe. There are quirks and whimsical twists built into the mix, but nothing that detours away from a chilled and easygoing ambience – the wonky strum of “ATL Freestyle,” the unconventional cadence of “Elephant in the Room” and the offbeat piano of “Outside” are all just decorations to distinguish the individual rooms in the same sonic house.\n\n6lack’s delivery likewise stays in its lane, a soothing voice with nuanced tones (and electronic modulations) to indicate shifts in sentiment and mood. So, if you’re looking for a club banger followed by a crooning ballad followed by trumped-up classic soul, keep looking.\n\nInstead, “6pc Hot EP” intoxicates as 6lack takes a cruise through the streets of Atlanta on “ATL Freestyle,” feeling underappreciated and frustrated. On “Float” he drops wry lines and says he needs a drink to help him get by (“I’m just trying to stay afloat”), he stands up for himself on “Elephant in the Room,” and in the hypnotic “Know My Rights” he counters the music-box intoxication of the arrangement by wearily singing how he’s paid his dues.\n\nHowever, he’s endearing on closer “Outside,” yearning for happier times and confessing, “I’m excited just to hold your hand/I’m still stuck on love like it’s Krazy Glue.” And though he’s looking for carnal pleasure on the sensual “Long Nights,” featuring a sax-garnished jazz groove and flirty guest vocals from Ari Lennox, he indicates that he might be looking for more than a friends-with-benefits relationship.\n\nHe knows how to work it.\n\n6lack\n\n\"6pc Hot EP\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nWare fine-tunes pop sophistication\n\nAmerican pop music is more age-centric than in other countries. Not only does the audience tend to drift away as they get older, the performers (especially the women, unfairly) can be washed up by the time they hit 30.\n\nSo English singer Jessie Ware’s career has more breathing room, at least outside of America, than her U.S. counterparts; the vocalist may be 35, but she’s hardly aged out of the game.\n\nThat said, Ware’s new “What’s Your Pleasure?” doesn’t chase music trends and it doesn’t wallow in teen angst. Instead, the release is a throwback to the 1980s and ’90s, when the “adult contemporary” charts were more vibrant and its hits consistently overlapped with the Top 40.\n\n“What’s Your Pleasure?” is a stylistic hybrid, packed with politely insistent dance songs tempered by Ware’s measured delivery and framed with jazz nuance. And those dance styles typically nod to past, beloved sub-genres.\n\nThe release repeatedly conjures 1980s-era Prince – with tracks like the dancefloor-friendly “Ooh La La,” the funk-kissed “Read My Lips” and a “Soul Control” that finds Ware breathily sidling up to heavy bass. Even better, Ware plays the suggestive chanteuse to the Giorgio Moroder disco-rumble of the title track, and she brings a sophisticated air to opening track “Spotlight” when the synthesizers take over.\n\nElsewhere electronic undertones texturize the sprawling sensuality of “In Your Eyes,” the chiming hypnosis of “Adore You” and the alluring surrealism of “The Kill.” And the infectious “Mirage (Don’t Stop)” echoes Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines,” which in turn “borrowed” from Marvin Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up.”\n\nOn the downside, the lyrics aren’t groundbreaking and “What’s Your Pleasure?” stumbles into cheesiness at times. Yet the classy atmosphere more than compensates.\n\nJessie Ware\n\n\"What's Your Pleasure?\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nDream Wife is rousing, if uneven\n\nDream Wife’s new “So When You Gonna …” is a battle between versatility and continuity as the London-based trio reveals itself to be both remarkably well-rounded and distractingly incongruous.\n\nThere’s an exciting punk undercurrent from the band that comes to the surface with fierce attitude and occasional screams from Icelandic-native vocalist Rakel Mjoll, yet on the flipside there’s a catchy pop side that appears with melodious hooks and romanticism.\n\nIn addition to the band’s multi-dimensional character, Dream Wife impresses with dexterous instrumentation, shifting from the indie-rock blast of “Sports!” (where Mjoll asks, “Dropping balls, missing goals/Do you even play this sport?”) to the humming dreampop of “Hasta La Vista” to the edgy rock of “Homesick” (“You got me feelin’ kind of homesick, so I threw up all over you”).\n\nLater Dream Wife serves a surf guitar suitable for a beachside campfire on the disarming “Temporary,” hitches to the fluttering rhythm of the meditative “Old Flame” and escalates the retro-Goth-pop philosophy of “RHRN” into a forceful conclusion: “We are the youngest we will ever be and the oldest we have ever been.”\n\nDream Wife also digs through the off-kilter tension of the title track for a demanding refrain of “When you gonna kiss me? When you gonna kiss me” and succumbs to the cutesy (and complicated) infatuation of “Hold on Me.”\n\nTrouble is, the trio suffers with transitions, flipping from jarring contrast to jarring contrast, and the group gets mired in meandering passages and ultimately slumps into an enervating, near-six-minute mopey closer, “After the Rain.”\n\nSo, while Dream Wife is adroit at handling the extremes, the group struggles in the in-between spaces.\n\nDream Wife\n\n\"So When You Gonna ...\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nDan Cummins fires up for \"Devil\"\n\nDan Cummins is fed up with those who don’t care about others as well as those who concern themselves too much about others, landing himself in a happy middle ground where most of us think we live, even if we don’t.\n\nThe comedian/host of the podcast “Timesuck” lets out a stream of frustrations on his new stand-up release, “Get Outta Here; Devil!” – including his struggle to understand how to use the semicolon (hence the title).\n\nHis targets include flat-Earthers, anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, IRS workers, those who get on elevators before others can get off, those who talk instead of whisper in movies, those who put their phone calls on speaker in public, those who believe in the lizard illuminati, parents who believe teachers have an agenda against their kids, and perhaps most of all, those who think something they read on Facebook or something they watched on YouTube makes them more qualified to speak on a medical issue than someone who actually went to med school.\n\nBut “Get Outta Here; Devil!” isn’t merely a screed against humanity. Cummins is an easy conversationalist who reveals plenty of droll self-effacing material to make him relatable to his audience, such as when he talks about his awkward parenting with his daughter’s questionable art skills and with his well-behaved son’s quest for credibility.\n\nHe also has an even more personal tale of post-puberty embarrassment, and he reveals that as a full-grown man, he has struggled with curved glass, including when he broke a tooth because, “I thought it would be hilarious to scare a fish in a fishbowl.\n\nYet he seems most fired up when he talks about how some easily triggered folks attempt to censor comedians’ jokes: “They want to take the thing they don’t like personally away from everyone else.”\n\nSo be warned, if you don’t like what Cummins has to say, that’s on you.\n\nDan Cummins\n\n\"Get Outta Here; Devil!\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nJuniper has a one-track mind\n\nA press release touts Juniper Shelley, 15, as demonstrating what it’s like to be a “normal teenaged girl in 2020” on her new debut, “Juniper,” though it helps that she’s surrounded by veteran music professionals.\n\nHer dad, radio DJ and singer-songwriter Michael Shelley, is a driving force behind “Juniper” (his daughter gets many co-writing credits), but a few other songs and the instrumentation are credited to members from a number of alt-rock, indie and other noteworthy acts including The Drive-By Truckers, Belle and Sebastian, Marshall Crenshaw, Yo La Tengo, Son Volt, Mekons, Teenage Fanclub and The Muffs.\n\nYet the sound is a blast even further back, to the likes of surf rock and 1960s girl group material, though shaded with a wry edge that brings to mind early Blondie albums before all the No. 1 hits started rolling out.\n\nThen there’s Juniper at the center, a “normal” 15-year-old girl armed with smart lines about falling for a boy at an amusement park (“The Dragon Coaster”), falling in line to fall for the magnetic Chad (“Everybody’s Got a Crush on Chad”), falling for a bad boy in tight jeans (“Punk Rock Boy”) and refusing to fall for all the enticing boys who aren’t her stable boyfriend (“Sticking With My Henry”).\n\nShe waltzes through an R&B-styled “Girls Just Want a Boy to Rest Their Head Upon,” tries to resist her dreamboy in the psychedelic “I Don’t Want to Dream About You” and fusses that “Dreaming about you is taking all of my time” on “Best Kept Secret.” Plus, the title of “Boys! Boys! Boys! Boys! Boys!” speaks for itself.\n\nThe relentless boy-crazy themes are kinda ugh, but you be you, girl.\n\nAnd Juniper does branch out: The jumpy “Kids on My Corner” is a gleeful blast about a local band that “wrote a song/It’s not that good, but it’s not that long.” And “Gotta Draw the Line” is about her undying devotion to her BFF, whom she would do anything for … er, unless she flirts with Juniper’s boyfriend.\n\nStill, despite the narrow focus, “Juniper” is a smart and rewarding release.\n\nJuniper\n\n\"Juniper\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nPeter Manos will get in your head\n\nPeter Manos is fast-tracking his slow-lane style in the music business with his new debut EP, “Do You Turn Red?”\n\nIn 2017 the Texas native was eyeing a music career while studying at Nashville’s Belmont University when he created the song “In My Head” in his dorm room. The brooding, quiet number hinges on lines filled with regret and sadness like, “You say it’s all alright, but you’re not the one who’s up at night.”\n\nThe song went on to be streamed hundreds of millions of times, including more than 100 million times on Spotify alone while also generating almost 70 million views on YouTube.\n\nIt was enough to prompt Manos to move to Los Angeles, where he created a home studio to record “Do You Turn Red?” And as sparse as “In My Head” is, the other songs on the EP are almost subliminal.\n\nManos creates a distinct air in this minimalistic, electronic-based marvel, compounding the woozy instrumentation with indistinct, albeit soulful, enunciation and the somber vibe of downbeat lyrics that dwell in disappointment.\n\nThe chilled environment is surreal and lowkey mesmerizing, whether Manos is reverberating in the smoky realm of “My Mind,” glowing through the gorgeous translucence of “Zach’s Ballad” or slow-dripping emotion in the cool “You Don’t Know Me,” where he sings, “I don’t think you know me like you thought you did.”\n\n“At Night” employs a thickened sound, a relatively dense foundation that creates more impactful support for his lonely vocals, and the swirling tonic of “Tennessee” finds his modulated vocals meandering through a soundscape of compressed bass as he realizes, “Nothing ever changes and nothing ever changes … and I wish I could change this.”\n\nCompared to the other songs, the gentle EP closer “In My Head” sounds downright lively.\n\nNever underestimate the power of understatement.\n\nPeter Manos\n\n\"Do You Turn Red?\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nChiasm gets carried away\n\nLongtime darkwave star Chiasm, aka Emileigh Rohn, gives a taste of her upcoming album “Missed the Noise” with a new EP, “Away.”\n\nThe Detroit-based performer has put out some austere material the past 20-something years, industrial-drenched noise explosions and implosions, but “Away” is considerably more accessible thanks in part to her collaboration with John Fryer, producer for the likes of Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails.\n\n“Away,” featuring four distinctly different mixes of “Away,” is actually accessible from four different directions.\n\nThe original mix is a dramatic, hard-rubbed-synthesizer brand of electro, a Goldfrapp-meets-Grimes instrumental context for the vocals of Rohn, who at times sounds like a dead ringer for the Bangles’ Susannah Hoffs (of all people). The subsequent “Interface Remix” of the song rides a thumping dance beat and rolling electronic pulses plus piano-esque nuance – ideal club music that reverberates with Rohn’s refrain, “Why don’t you take me away?”\n\nLater, a “Skydeck Mix” of “Away” puts the song in sleek-stalker mode, an NIN-reminiscent blend of alt-rock foreboding with suggestions of quiet horror that create an impenetrable mystique. Then a “GW4 Mix” of the song takes the insistent rhythm into a lowkey, electronic-chill mode, the vibe merging with lines about “our lives are churning away, our hearts are churning away …”\n\nFor good measure, the EP closes out with a “:10:” mix of the song “Frantic,” a less-inviting track than any of the versions of “Away” as it disintegrates in the collapsing crunch of an electric fire.\n\nThat closing cut may be a memento to hardcore fans who feast on Chiasm’s artful tangents, but the cornucopia of “Aways” on the EP show broader promise for her next move.\n\nChiasm\n\n\"Away\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBerger's \"Moon\" proves enlightening\n\nCalling Mare Berger’s new 8-song “The Moon Is Always Full” a chamber-pop EP doesn’t begin to describe it.\n\nThe jazz-trained performer doesn’t merely sing along to easily digestible string-and-piano arrangements. Instead, the composer/vocalist/pianist creates a provocative alternate universe that basks in a mind-bending assortment of philosophical and existential observations and suggestions, and the tracks are shaded in a range of genres outside the traditional chamber-pop realm.\n\nBut sure, there are strings.\n\n“The Moon Is Always Full” opens with a somewhat strident “Even When We Forget,” with lines like “We are the ocean, we are the drop … Even when we forget, we are … We are everything.” From there, Berger’s pure voice rings out in “Step Away My Dear,” singing, “When we think we know, we know nothing.” Subsequent lines include the mantra “I pray that the seed will grow” on the title track and on the less ornate “Praise This Fear,” “Praise this fear that holds me down … Praise this fear that makes me, me.”\n\nThe latter track has a spiritual air in its clean mix, but other songs display markings of rock (e.g. Lilith rock) and folk (especially indie or alt-folk), and the meditative “Stardust” sounds like an old mountain ballad. Meanwhile, the instruments, especially the strings, are often employed in aggressively experimental bursts to keep listeners alert.\n\nThere’s also a complicated, ever-shifting “Wondering” that pivots and builds into what sounds like a Jane Siberry mini-musical from the 1990s, Bergen asking, “When does a person become a thought? … What does a memory mean?” The release then moves into its swooning finale, “You Are Within.”\n\nIt’s hard not to be temporarily absorbed into Berger’s realm (even if some of the lines sound more like smart bumper stickers than profound thoughts), yet why resist?\n\nMare Berger\n\n\"The Moon Is Always Full\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/happyeverafter/2013/12/02/contemporary-romance-romantic-suspense-new-releases/3800889/", "title": "Lots of opportunity to get seduced by new contemporaries", "text": "Joyce Lamb\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nHere are some new contemporaries and romantic suspense, compiled for you and HEA by some of our favorite authors (info provided by publishers and/or their websites):\n\nSeduced by His Target by Gail Barrett (Harlequin Romantic Suspense).

This new strain has spread to at least 12 nations in Africa, one in Europe and another in Asia. Thailand is the second country outside of Africa that has confirmed a new case of the variant. More than 17,000 cases and 517 deaths have been reported this year in 13 African countries. More than 95% of those cases and deaths occurred in Congo.\n\nLast week, Sweden became the first country outside Africa to report an infection involving the Ib strain, traced to a person who had traveled to the continent. The previous day, the WHO had declared the mpox virus a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nSo while Hans Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe, rejected the notion that mpox might follow COVID’s deadly path, he also warned, “We can and must tackle mpox together, across regions and continents.’’\n\nWhat is mpox and how does it spread?\n\nFormerly known as monkeypox because it was initially discovered in that animal in 1958, mpox is a virus that derives from the same family as smallpox. It can spread from animals to humans and between people, typically through bodily fluids or close physical contact, as well as through contact with contaminated objects.\n\nThe two types of mpox are clade I and clade II, the latter usually leads to milder disease and is less likely to cause death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says mpox often manifests in a rash on the hands, feet, chest, face, mouth and around the genital area. Lesions from the rash can get painful or itchy.\n\nOther symptoms can be similar to the flu, such as a sore throat or cough, congestion, fever, chills, muscle aches and fatigue.\n\nThe CDC says that both during the 2022 outbreak of the clade II strain in the U.S. and in continued but much fewer instances now, the virus is “still mostly being spread through sexual and intimate contact, and gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men are at the highest risk of getting mpox.’’\n\nEmbedded content: https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/08/15/mpox-who-global-health-emergency/74800667007/\n\nHow big a threat is mpox to the US?\n\nMpox reached the U.S. as part of a global outbreak in 2022, resulting in 32,000 known infections and 58 deaths domestically. All those cases have been linked to the less virulent and contagious clade II type. The CDC says no clade I infections have been found in the U.S., and that the U.S. is at low risk of this strain arriving.\n\nBut Dr. Kyle Enfield, an associate professor and pulmonary disease expert at the University of Virginia, says international travel makes it likely the more harmful form of the virus will reach American shores eventually. He did have some encouraging words for those who might be bracing for such news, though.\n\n“When you have diseases like mpox where close skin-to-skin contact or close human contact is necessary, as opposed to respiratory diseases, you’re likely to see a slower spread than you are in a disease like influenza, COVID and other respiratory diseases, which just have a better ability to spread from human to human and therefore disseminate across populations faster,’’ Enfield said.\n\nAre there treatments and vaccines?\n\nThe CDC says mpox infections usually last two and four weeks, and most cases resolve themselves without treatment. There’s no specific medication for mpox, but the CDC says symptoms can be managed with over-the-counter medicines and prescription mouthwashes. The agency strongly advises patients not to touch or scratch the rash.\n\nThe CDC recommends the two-dose mpox vaccine for at-risk populations in the U.S. and provides a vaccine finder by ZIP code on its website. An agency study found the approved JYNNEOS vaccine, administered within a four-week interval, is not only highly effective at preventing the disease, but it also helps minimize the impact of symptoms for those who get infected.\n\nContributing: Reuters, Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/21"}]}

Located outside of Savannah, Georgia, Affleck's 87-acre compound sits on Hampton Island, which served as land for rice and cotton plantations, according to an overview of the property.\n\nBen Affleck, JLo's wedding venue:What we know about actor's Georgia estate\n\nJLo releases 'The Greatest Love Story Never Told' starring Ben Affleck\n\nLopez beat Affleck to the punch of telling their love story in the eclectic film, \"This Is Me… Now: A Love Story,\" which was released in February with her latest album, \"This is Me … Now,\" and the making-of documentary, \"The Greatest Love Story Never Told.\"\n\nThe Amazon Prime documentary was named for a collection of letters Affleck wrote to his wife and showed the making of her album and $20 million self-financed film.\n\nIn the film, Lopez's music soundtracks a bonkers quest for love, starting with a fiery motorcycle crash with a guy who shares Affleck's profile. The film stars Affleck and a host of celebrity friends, including Fat Joe as her therapist and a love zodiac council including Keke Palmer, Kim Petras, Sofia Vergara, Jenifer Lewis, Post Malone and Jane Fonda.\n\n\"I never thought I’d get a second chance at this love. I’d like to capture this moment in time because I feel it’s even more incredible than the first time,\" Lopez told USA TODAY earlier this year.\n\n\"What I want to say with this album is that true love does exist and some things are forever. They may not take a straight road, but they don’t leave you. I made the most honest, true music I’ve ever done … So I sat with (director) Dave (Meyers) and said, 'I want to do a mini-movie-musical, but also not just videos. I want to do something new and different.'\"\n\nIn the documentary, Fonda shared skepticism about the film. \"I want you to know that I don’t entirely know why, but I feel invested in you and Ben, and I really want this to work,\" she said. \"However, this is absurd. Like, it feels too much like you're trying to prove something instead of just living it.\"\n\nJLo and Ben Affleck spark rumors of a split\n\nAs spring was underway, so were rumors that Bennifer was on the rocks.\n\nIn May, rumblings began about Lopez and Affleck not appearing together in public for over a month. That month, Lopez went to the Met Gala solo and ramped up speculation weeks later by showing up to the premiere of her Netflix film \"Atlas\" sans Affleck.\n\nThough they made occasional appearances together, by late June reports claiming Affleck had moved out of their home started emerging.\n\nTabloids and fans alike tried looking for clues by following the status of the duo's accessories, specifically whether they were wearing their wedding bands. Both were pictured with and without their rings throughout the summer.\n\nMore bad news for JLo fans:Jennifer Lopez cancels 2024 tour This Is Me\n\nBennifer 2.0 is over as JLo files for divorce from Ben Affleck\n\nOn Aug. 20, Lopez opened up divorce proceedings with a filing in Los Angeles Superior Court on the second anniversary of her and Affleck's wedding.\n\nPer TMZ, in her filing Lopez asked the judge to waive spousal support for both her and Affleck.\n\nContributing: Cydney Henderson, Elise Brisco, Edward Segarra, Melissa Ruggieri, Charles Trepany and KiMi Robinson, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/02/29/anant-ambani-radhika-merchants-pre-wedding-events/72792844007/", "title": "Inside Anant Ambani, Radhika Merchant's star-studded wedding ...", "text": "If there is one thing that you should know about India's Ambanis', it is that they like to go all out.\n\nCase in point, the pre-wedding festivities of Anant Ambani, the son of Asia's richest man and his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant.

I saw some of my Facebook friends naming their favorite albums for every year they've been alive. Cool, right? You can get neat ideas from social media.\n\nThen I saw some other folks start joining in. And before long, I was seeing Facebook groups getting into it. In a very short time, it seemed to become a minor viral event.\n\nAnd it got me thinking about my favorite albums, from 1980 to 2015. Boy, it is difficult. Some years had so many fantastic albums. Other years, well ... Yeah, they were easier.\n\nIt took me a while. I had to look at charts, I looked for lists of album releases. You wouldn't believe how incomplete and patchy they can be. You have to be a detective to start piecing things together just to make a list that doesn't completely overlook genres like country, hip-hop and some alternative albums.\n\nAfter I'd made my list, I was kind of surprised at how relatively predictable it was. But you know what, we like what we like. I make no apologies for the music I love.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nI started thinking about how this would make a great column. That I could talk about each album, discuss why it made the cut, do a miniature review for each one.\n\nThen I started to face some realities. There are 36 albums on this list. If I did two paragraphs for each one, I'd have this massive story that would eat up too much real estate in the print world. And for online, I'd feel like I'd only brushed on things and would want desperately to build on it.\n\nThus, inspiration led to a special project. I allowed myself to really stretch out and tackle this idea in a special online presentation. It is too large for print, so the Times won't be reproducing it in the newspaper.\n\nWith this special package, you'll get my album reviews, with some album art and a video for each. Yup, I just might eat up your afternoon. Or maybe you'll want to space it out over the weekend.\n\nAnd I want to stress that this is about favorite albums, not best albums. In some cases, you'll often find that there's a superior artistic expression, or a more controversial or critically acclaimed work in the mix ... but it doesn't trump an album that you just like better, for whatever reason. To thine own self, be true.\n\nIn any event, I enjoyed seeing so many people get into this idea on Facebook. And I want to give special props to a musician, music fan and music columnist who I feel fortunate to consider a friend. Thanks, Jon Hunt, for being one of the sparks that got me launched on this project. Music you love is always best shared with people you enjoy.\n\nAfter reading my picks, maybe you would enjoy making your own list. Maybe this will give you some ideas. Or heck, maybe this is a good conversation starter as you get together with your families for the holidays. Maybe it'll make some fun office talk. \"Say, what was your favorite birth-year album?\" For you, my fellow music fans, I hope you have a ball. You may agree with some of the picks, you may disagree, you'll no doubt have your own thoughts. Share them! Let's jaw a bit about our favorite music.\n\nAnd with that, let's get to the fun. I hope you enjoy it, and that it inspires you to think about your favorite music over the years.\n\nThis is the opinion of music enthusiast and audio addict Chris Shields. Contact him at clshields@stcloudtimes.com and follow him on Twitter @clshields1980. Read more of his columns at www.sctimes.com/cshields.\n\nWhen I listen to music, I hear details that make a difference, that leave a mark. If a song isn't particularly amazing in terms of songwriting or construction, genuine feeling and zeal can still elevate it. Take \"Tutti Frutti\" for instance. There's a great hook to it, but what sells it? Little Richard's vocal investment. \"A wop bop a loo bop,\" indeed.\n\nBob Dylan's \"Saved,\" if nothing else, is a triumph of conviction. And by nothing else, I only mean that some will dismiss it for the direction of the content. As the middle of the \"Born Again\" albums (sandwiched between \"Slow Train Coming\" and \"Shot of Love\"), \"Saved\" often gets ignored. \"Slow Train Coming\" has great songs, sounds great and was something new as Dylan \"reinvented\" himself yet again. And \"Shot of Love\" features \"Every Grain of Sand,\" one of Dylan's finest songs.\n\nConviction, I say, and conviction I mean. Listen to Dylan's voice. His earnestness. He is invested in these songs. His passion was righteous, the words and beliefs sincerely conveyed. The gospel stylings he encourages and invests into album opener \"A Satisfied Mind\" gets things going. Hums and affirmations abound, and show that Dylan really is identifying with this sound, with these feelings.\n\nAt the time of release, Dylan often spoke of his belief that Jesus' return was nigh, that the end times were upon us and that any moment we'd face Armageddon. There's fear, there's guidance, strong declarations of faith and stirring warnings in this music. And you'd better believe that Dylan puts everything he has into this album. He sounds so committed, you can't help but believe the dedication. It's potent stuff, no matter your religious outlook.\n\nYou don't have to share the beliefs to appreciate the sincerity, or even to be moved by the outpouring of faith. You'll get portions of devotion and grace with condemnation and hellfire. And Dylan tends to work some magic when he is properly motivated. Considering the uneven quality of Dylan's 1980s albums, it is worth noting the high quality with which he started the decade.\n\nI think one reason \"Saved\" gets little love is that it tends to go unrepresented in compilations, and the period hasn't really gotten any love in the \"Bootleg Series\" collection so far. But some artists don't work well in a \"greatest hits\" or \"best of\" situation. In Dylan's case, there are precious few actual \"hits\" but so many high-quality compositions and performances. So maybe \"Saved\" also gets lost in the shuffle because of so many wonderful records. But with such great songs as \"Pressing On\" and \"In the Garden\" among the tracks, this is an album that really deserves reappraisal. This material is inspired, his performances top notch.\n\nI know, I know, reading about and listening to \"Christian music\" isn't always the cool thing to do. But I encourage you to listen to Dylan's take on the gospel/faith genre. When he tackled this material, it wasn't to tap into a solid commercial base. If anything, it put him on dangerous financial grounds. The guy refused to do his best-known songs in concert and would only perform his new, Christian-aligned material. Hard to entice old and new audiences with that. But artists follow their inspirations and instincts. Even if it was a path Dylan would soon abandon (at least in a direct musical fashion), it took great courage to pursue higher truths and find spiritual, personal fulfillment.\n\nAnd it led to a great album.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1980\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBilly Joel's \"Glass Houses.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Game.\"\n\nAC/DC's \"Back in Black.\"\n\nABBA's \"Super Trouper.\"\n\nJohn Lennon & Yoko Ono's \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nSome concept albums can feel overblown. Pretentious. Bloated.\n\nAnd taken at face value, a concept album that charts the successful opening and the eventual dilapidated closing of Chicago's Paradise Theatre, and also incorporates elements to mirror the evolving social and economic realities in contemporary times, certainly sounds like it could be, er, well ... overreaching.\n\nBut it is one of those rare marvels, a single-record concept album that works AND carries the concept throughout with enjoyable music, memorable melodies and some bombastic choruses.\n\nWhen I was growing up, we had three Styx albums in the house: \"The Grand Illusion\" and \"Pieces of Eight\" on vinyl, and \"Paradise Theatre\" on cassette. And while I spent most of my time with Beatles records, hearing the bombastic and catchy-as-heck music by Styx definitely grabbed my attention.\n\nWhen my father loaned me some of his cassettes, I was curious about the \"Paradise Theatre\" tape. I recognized a couple of songs (like \"Too Much Time on My Hands,\" \"The Best of Times\" and \"Snowblind\"), but the others? Brand new. And I remember my first listen. I was sitting next to my bed, with my dad's headphones on. When \"A.D. 1928\" started up, I had to check the cassette lineup. Isn't this \"The Best of Times?\" Nope! But it established the narrative musical thread. And it segues directly into \"Rockin' the Paradise,\" a very cool li'l rock track.\n\nI'm an unabashed Styx fan. I love the pure pop confection of \"Lorelei.\" I really dig the almost Beach Boys-esque arrangement of \"Mademoiselle\" (if you think about the \"20/20\" and \"Sunflower\" era of the Beach Boys, maybe you'll dig where I'm coming from). I think that all members of the band, but most especially Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw and James Young, were able to tap into a spirit that is so American — bold, brash, occasionally dramatic but with an embrace for the good things in life. And \"Paradise Theatre,\" a No. 1 album for the group, should have helped establish the group's legacy in American music. And maybe it did, for those listeners who don't get too hung up on what's \"hip.\"\n\nBut maybe the album is better known for its controversy. If you Google backward messages and Styx, I'm sure you'll find everything you'd want to know about the Parents Music Resource Center and the allegations of satanic messages in the music, particularly \"Snowblind.\" It's a fun story, popular, but it just isn't true — Styx wasn't trying to warp minds with unholy images and messages. But I'm betting the headlines didn't hurt the band get some sales from curious younger (and older) listeners.\n\nStill, Styx is Styx. Bad headlines, bad reviews, bad impressions, polarization of fans in a \"Dennis camp\" or a \"Tommy Camp,\" Styx seems to regularly find itself on the receiving end of misfortune. It's a shame. But that's where I can let the music speak for itself.\n\nUnfortunately, good music or not, some bands seem easier to dismiss. As I've written before, Styx is one of those bands people say they just don't like. But if you give them a chance, and \"Paradise Theatre\" in particular, you might just hear a few songs (or a whole album) that you'll find refreshing. Set aside popularity contests, unburden yourself of the need to diss \"uncool\" music and give yourself permission to embrace the pop-rock goodness of Styx.\n\nOr just groove to \"Rockin' the Paradise\" in the safety of your car, bedroom or office.\n\nSo, whatcha doin' tonight?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1981\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Hard Promises.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Shot of Love.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Tattoo You.\"\n\nJoan Jett & The Blackhearts' \"I Love Rock 'n Roll.\"\n\nI read about it before I ever heard the record.\n\nI'm sure I was reading a John Lennon biography and I'd gotten to the post-murder material, when reactions and tributes were discussed. No doubt there was a mention of the track \"Here Today\" on \"Tug of War,\" Paul McCartney's first album to follow Lennon's death.\n\nThe curiosity was planted. Obviously, I knew some of McCartney's solo stuff. You couldn't be a big Beatles fan like I was and not have been exposed to \"Band on the Run\" and other material. But the only connections I had to most of the \"Tug of War\" material came from some of the songs being featured in McCartney's feature film \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" (though in re-recorded form).\n\nHearing the album the first time, I was struck by the variety of styles and how McCartney's gift as a tunesmith hadn't been hurt by the loss of his friend and former songwriting partner. Even the oft-mocked \"Ebony and Ivory\" holds its own (yes, the white keys and black keys on a piano might actually lead to more dissonance than harmony, but Paul and Stevie Wonder still get the noble point across).\n\nTwo of my favorites on the album, \"Wanderlust\" and \"Ballroom Dancing,\" are pure McCartney — I can't imagine anyone else writing them. \"Wanderlust\" is a cousin to \"Mull of Kintyre,\" this irresistible melody that feels somehow timeless. \"Ballroom Dancing\" more fits the mold of \"When I'm 64,\" \"Your Mother Should Know\" and \"You Gave Me the Answer.\" It's the kind of song that would appeal to moms and grandmas, but with a bouncier track. Fun for the sake of fun.\n\nAnd what can be said about \"Here Today\" that hasn't been said over the years? Paul sings to John, and he is holding back the tears no more. If you've seen Paul perform the song in concert the last several years, he often does tear up, choke up, the emotions are palpable. Paul lost a brother, a partner, a rival, an important figure in his life. The song conveys that in every possible way.\n\nReally, when it comes right down to it, there aren't any songs I dislike on \"Tug of War.\" The title track and \"Take It Away\" are pure Paul at his best. And the album's other duet with Stevie Wonder, \"What's That You're Doing,\" basically lays the groundwork for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller.\" Stevie's scatting at the end is ... odd, but fun.\n\nThere are link tracks, brief interludes. Maybe some folks would call them scraps, or would find them jarring. Me, I find them to be emotional and creative transitions.\n\n\"Tug of War\" is an album that justifies every view of McCartney as a musician, for good or bad. It stands as a synthesis of McCartney's skills as a Beatle, as a solo artist and as the leader of Wings. And \"Tug of War\" climbed to No. 1. It established itself as a classic, one that sets a standard that all following McCartney albums have had to measure against.\n\nPaul weathered the storm after Lennon's untimely death, and emerged from the darkness with an album that still stands the test of time today. He endured his own internal and external tugs of war, and came out on top. You gotta respect that.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1982\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRichard and Linda Thompson's \"Shoot Out the Lights.\"\n\nQueen's \"Hot Space.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"The Nylon Curtain.\"\n\nPrince's \"1999.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Thriller.\"\n\nYou can learn a lot about a person when you talk about favorites. And you can learn a lot about Pink Floyd fans from their favorite albums.\n\nI honestly have different favorites based on my moods. Sometimes I want \"Wish You Were Here,\" sometimes I want \"Meddle,\" sometimes I want \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\" etc.\n\nBut one album that I always find myself putting on the list, at No. 1 or No. 2, is \"The Final Cut.\"\n\nThe last studio album to feature Roger Waters, \"The Final Cut\" also is the first Pink Floyd album not to credit Richard Wright as a member. Tensions were high, creative differences had forced some unpleasant ultimatums, and group members David Gilmour and Nick Mason were shunted to the side and used basically as session players. Gilmour, who'd been one of the primary vocalists of the group from 1968-1977, had seen his vocal presence (and artistic input) diminish in the group as Waters took on more of the vocals and asserted himself as the creative force of the band. On \"The Final Cut,\" Gilmour contributes some tasty guitar lines, but he only features as the lead vocal on one track: \"Not Now John.\"\n\nThe drama aside, the narrative of the album is one of the group's strongest. It builds upon themes expressed in \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" \"Animals\" and \"The Wall.\" The struggle to live life in a world controlled by corporate and military forces, humans treated as pawns in a global chess game, the loss of family, isolation, etc. You get it — not the cheeriest content. And how does the album end? \"Two Suns in the Sunset\" might give you all the clues you need. (No? Nuclear annihilation.)\n\nWaters' vocals are strong and expressive. The lyrics are personal, and illustrative. The album unfolds in such a cinematic fashion. And the production? Wow.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" polarizes fans. Some see it as Waters seizing ultimate control for his own glory, and attempting to tank the band. Some see it as the most powerful and focused album in the group's catalog. But with songs like \"Your Possible Pasts,\" \"The Hero's Return,\" \"The Gunner's Dream,\" \"The Fletcher Memorial Home,\" \"Southampton Dock\" and \"The Final Cut,\" it's impossible to dismiss it as artistically bankrupt.\n\nMy younger brother and I got into the album after we'd devoured \"The Wall.\" We were in our mid teens and that kind of power, that kind of imagery, that kind of angst was impossible to ignore. It was passionate. It was fearful. It was angry. And sadly, the themes of the album were still relevant. And they still are.\n\nArt endures, right? And while some of the references may have dated, the sense of betrayal to those who make the ultimate sacrifice, to the families who lose loved ones, to the people who work hard to live their lives only to have \"the powers that be\" control (and end) them, well ... I imagine many of us can understand that anger and identify with the emotional outpouring.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" may have been Waters' final work with Pink Floyd, but what a way to go. You can't ask for a better exit than this.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1983\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Police's \"Synchronicity.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"An Innocent Man.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Swordfishtrombones.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Infidels.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"Hearts and Bones.\"\n\nJohn Lennon was brutally killed on Dec. 8, 1980. He was shot outside of his home. And with his death, many of the dreams and hopes that had taken shape in the 1960s and had endured the 1970s came to an abrupt end. No possibility of a full Beatles reunion. No more collaborations with Paul McCartney. No more concerts. No more songs that were so personal and somehow universal at the same time. No more lyrical gobbledygook that captured the imagination.\n\nNo more Lennon songs.\n\nA couple weeks before his murder, Lennon had released \"Double Fantasy,\" a collaborative album with wife Yoko Ono. The album seemed to celebrate a mature outlook on life, a more domestically inclined point of view. Songs like \"(Just Like) Starting Over,\" \"Woman\" and \"Watching the Wheels\" were welcome additions to Lennon's output, and his song for son Sean — \"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)\" — is touching beyond words. But not everything was flowers and rainbows. \"I'm Losing You\" taps into a bit of anger and desperation, and \"Cleanup Time\" is pretty forward looking in how it was time to clear the slate and get moving again.\n\nThe album certainly set the stage for a follow up, one that could build on the positives established in \"Double Fantasy.\" And the material existed, as another album was being worked on simultaneously with \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nComing in early 1984, a full three years after Lennon's death, \"Milk and Honey\" gave fans some of the final fruits of Lennon's studio labors. And the songs on this new album were fun. Vital. Maybe even a little more scattered or casual. Obviously, the final polishing and mixing with Lennon's cooperation had never been done before his death. But the energy and off-the-cuff looseness of some of the performances make his songs on \"Milk and Honey\" easily the equals of those on \"Double Fantasy,\" and possibly even superior.\n\n\"Nobody Told Me\" may have been meant for Ringo Starr's \"Stop and Smell the Roses\" album, but Lennon's engaged vocal and the snappy arrangement make it one of my favorite late Lennon tracks. \"I'm Stepping Out\" has such a groove, and gives a few clues that Lennon's \"househusband\" role wasn't one he always embraced (just check out his vocal ad-libs near the end at the fade). \"I Don't Wanna Face It\" and \"Borrowed Time\" seem somehow ... foreboding, but without darkness or depression. It's like Lennon had a premonition that the end was near. Listen to the songs, tell me I'm wrong.\n\nAnd then there's \"Grow Old With Me.\" Oh, beautiful. Simple, and showing its home recording demo roots, the song was envisioned to become the kind of standard that people would play at weddings. It is beautiful, touching, sweet without being saccharine, and devastating considering Lennon's death.\n\nOno's contributions to \"Double Fantasy\" and \"Milk and Honey\" are pretty progressive, and show some skill. Ono will always have her detractors, but her songs work to both enhance Lennon's and also to provide artistic contrasts that may have been more commercially viable in the early 1980s than Lennon's own songs. Her talent should not be denied, nor should the loss she faced.\n\nThese albums stand as monuments to Lennon's life, his hopes for the future and for the love he had in his heart. There would be more posthumous releases, but \"Milk and Honey\" and its Lennon songs send the man off on a high note. The rock-and-roller, the guy with the mischievous twinkle in his eye, he was still there. And then he was gone.\n\nThe parting after \"Milk and Honey\" certainly was some sweet sorrow.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1984\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1984 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nVan Halen's \"1984.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Works.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"The Pros and cons of Hitch Hiking.\"\n\nSpinal Tap's \"This is Spinal Tap.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\"\n\nPrince's \"Purple Rain.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Let It Be.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Valotte.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nThe Meat Puppets' \"Meat Puppets II.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think life is just a rodeo / The trick is to ride and make it to the bell.\"\n\nKnow my first memory of John Fogerty's \"Centerfield\" album? It isn't the use of the title song at baseball games. It's of mowing.\n\nI'd been a fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival's music for, well, pretty much my whole life. I can remember hearing the songs on the radio as a very young boy. One of the first cassettes I owned (a gift from my grandmother) was of CCR's \"Chronicle\" album, a great selection of the group's hits. Fogerty's voice is one of the greats in rock and roll.\n\nSo what does mowing have to do with \"Centerfield?\"\n\nI'd done some reading about Fogerty and CCR that mentioned the acrimony of the group's split. And I remember reading about the comeback that was Fogerty's 1985 album. So I got curious. I picked up a bargain bin copy of the album on cassette. I popped it into my Walkman and got on the riding lawnmower and started to mow.\n\nAnd wow! What an album. What a good, solid, punchy record.\n\nThe album starts off with a sound that is pure Creedence. \"The Old Man Down the Road\" has that classic Fogerty sneering drawl, a ridiculous guitar hook and a jumping rhythm. Apparently others thought it sounded like pure Creedence, too ... almost too pure. Fogerty was sued by the owner of Fantasy Records, the label CCR recorded for. It was alleged that Fogerty had plagiarized his own earlier work, ripping off \"Run Through the Jungle.\" Eventually the case closed in favor of Fogerty. But forget that. Just listen to the song, It cooks!\n\nAnd then there's \"Rock and Roll Girls,\" the song that opens with the lyrics I quoted at the start of this chapter. Fogerty's voice comes across so high and clear, a blast of summer sunshine and hope. \"Hey, let's go all over the world.\" It puts a rainbow in my mind, for sure.\n\nAnd of course, there's the title track. \"Centerfield\" and baseball, the song and the sport belong together. And when Fogerty performs the song in concert, he even uses a guitar shaped like a Louisville Slugger baseball bat. It's a history lesson and a vibe that all fans and participants of the sport can appreciate, can feel.\n\nThere are sounds that put this album clearly in the 1980s, but if you listen to the songs, if you listen to Fogerty as he sings and whoops, you could be forgiven for thinking this album slots in at the end of the 1960s, maybe between \"Willy and the Poor Boys\" and \"Cosmo's Factory.\" That's no faint praise, \"Centerfield\" is that solid, it's that classic sounding.\n\nSome voices in music just have the right feel. A little sandpaper here, a little smoke, the right amount of power and an absolute sense of purpose. Fogerty has one of those voices. His vocals reach you all the way out in center field, and his songwriting just tends to feel comfortable. Lived in. Real. Like an old ball glove, perfectly worn, battle tested and trustworthy.\n\nIt'll be several months until green grass pokes through and we're enjoying another season of baseball.\n\nBut that's OK. We have \"Centerfield.\" And say, do you smell something? I swear, it smells just like freshly cut grass ...\n\nHonorable mentions, 1985\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Southern Accents.\"\n\nDire Straits' \"Brothers in Arms.\"\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Dare to Be Stupid.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Rain Dogs.\"\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain's \"Psychocandy.\"\n\nWhen you hear \"Graceland,\" what's the first thought that comes to your mind?\n\nElvis Presley, maybe?\n\nI'd understand that. And hey, Elvis, the King of rock and roll. The man who inspired so many major artists of the 1960s. The swiveling hips, the curling lip. You ain't nothing but a hound dog!\n\nSo if an artist names an album \"Graceland,\" maybe you'd expect ... what? A tribute album? An album in the style of Elvis? Or at the very least, maybe a record recorded at the site?\n\nBut if you're giving Paul Simon's \"Graceland\" a spin, you aren't gonna get that. Any of that. Sure, the title track mentions Elvis' estate. The narrator (Simon) is traveling with his son. For reasons he can't explain, some part of him wants to see Graceland (in Memphis, Tennessee). But after that? Not much Big E.\n\nBut that's OK. In fact, it's more than OK. Paul Simon may have wanted to find something new. He may have wanted inspiration. He may have wanted to visit the site of Elvis' home, to try to plug into the spirit that may have once moved him, but this new album and the songs on it are a big departure. His muse took him to South Africa. Rhythms, complex vocal arrangements, energy ... \"Graceland\" has all the promise and mystery and soul one might expect from Presley's manor, but it all comes in an unexpected direction. Elvis grew up with gospel and soul music, American \"black\" music. Simon comes back with mbaqanga and isicathamiya, South African \"black\" music.\n\nYou get the parallels?\n\nOK, OK, so let's get to the music. It's fresh. It's fantastic. The record came out in 1986 and it still feels so different than what we hear so regularly on TV, radio, the Internet, etc. While the genre of \"world music\" has grown, I still don't expect that I could just spin a dial on the Minnesota AM/FM spectrum and come across Ladysmith Black Mambazo unless it is one of the \"Graceland\" songs the group sings on.\n\nDepending on who you are, that isn't necessarily a good thing. But for me? It opened my ears to different music. Not just genres, like rap or country or rockabilly. Hearing music made in different styles, with different instruments, in arrangements we wouldn't consider conventional because of our Western mindset, it was (and still is) kinda exciting.\n\nOh, \"The Boy in the Bubble.\" THE SOUND. You can be completely consumed in that track. \"These are the days of miracle and wonder,\" indeed. Then there's the title track (I just love the lyric \"the Mississippi Delta was shining like a national guitar\" ... not only because it refers to resonator guitars, but because you can also consider the Mississippi River and the music that has grown out of the blues traditions around it to be a national treasure, a national emblem).\n\nI figure just about everyone knows \"You Can Call Me Al,\" even if you haven't heard any of the other songs. And the video with Simon with Chevy Chase is pretty fun. But what about the other gems on the album? \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,\" \"Under African Skies,\" \"Homeless\" and \"That Was Your Mother\" are so vital. And ... can you hear country music in the background? Is that a hint of rockabilly? Sweet lord, that guitar is cooking. Rock and roll!\n\nI guess it doesn't matter if you are visiting Elvis' Graceland or if you're just drawing inspiration from it, maybe there's something transcendent in the experience. Something motivational in the place, in the man, in his music. Maybe it takes you on a search, until you find just the right something, the right sound, the right instrument, the right collaborators. Something that encourages a kind of musical alchemy, a combination of cultures and sounds that leads to vibrant, beautiful sound.\n\nThe music hits us in different ways, takes us down different paths. The journey is what's important, and what you take from it. An appreciation of other cultures? A love for new sounds? What you find on the path is all that matters. And I've reason to believe we all will be received in \"Graceland.\"\n\nHonorable mentions, 1986\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nPeter Gabriel's \"So.\"\n\nQueen's \"A Kind of Magic.\"\n\nMadonna's \"True Blue.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys' \"Licensed to Ill.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"Deep in the Heart of Nowhere.\"\n\nYou know, I really had no idea that \"Got My Mind Set on You\" was George Harrison.\n\nOh, don't get me wrong. I know he didn't write it. But that sound, that song, that voice ... I'd heard it all over the radio. I remember hearing older kids singing bits of it when I was 9 or 10. That hook. \"I got my mind / SET ON YOU.\" Sure, now that I'm older and pay attention to things like voices, of course it's George Harrison.\n\nBut when I picked up my first copy of \"Cloud Nine,\" I really had no idea.\n\nI picked up a used copy of a CD after The Beatles' Anthology project wrapped up. I'd loved a lot of George's Beatles music, and I owned a couple of the solo albums (\"All Things Must Pass\" is an essential album, gotta have it), but I had never really made an effort to pick up his solo works.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nHere's the thing: John Lennon and Paul McCartney get all the credit for The Beatles. I get it, they were two of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century, one of the most powerful songwriting partnerships. But the sound? That took the whole group. And after The Beatles broke up, Lennon went one way with his sound and McCartney went another. But Harrison? Listen to his music. I often think that George may have been the musical glue of the group. When I listen to \"Cloud Nine,\" I hear what The Beatles could have sounded like had they gotten together in 1986 to start putting a record together. The Rolling Stones had \"Dirty Work,\" and I think this sound could have easily skunked that.\n\nBut this isn't about The Beatles, It's about Harrison's last album released while he was still alive. And it is song after song of great quality. Yes, the album \"suffers\" from the 1980s production and Jeff Lynne's bright touches (as you can probably tell, I don't think the album \"suffers\" at all ... I like the lively sound).\n\nThe opening track is also the song from which the album takes its name, and I love that bass sound, the funkier feel. Starting off the album with this kind of track is brave, in that it isn't a sure-fire hook-driven ear grabber, but it is a wonderful song. Then you launch into other terrific songs. \"That's What It Takes,\" \"Fish on the Sand,\" both songs I really got into.\n\nBut the big songs? \"This Is Love\" is catchy and strident; you feel the breeze behind you. \"When We Was Fab\" recalls \"I Am the Walrus\" and certainly comes across as a tribute to the fallen Lennon. And if you don't love \"Devil's Radio,\" well ... maybe you just like your gossip too much.\n\nAnd there's the last song on the album ... \"Got My Mind Set on You.\" It has that 1980s sound, but with a real feel. The singing is true, and you buy into the music. Go on, listen. If you're not tapping your toe, bobbing your head, snapping your fingers or singing along, maybe your ears aren't working.\n\nThere would be some music released posthumously, and there was the Traveling Wilburys music as well, but \"Cloud Nine\" was the last album of original material to bear George's name while he still walked the earth. And what a joy it is, what a revelation. It feels so good, it makes you feel good. In a way, it puts you on your own cloud nine. Nice when the music lives up to its name, isn't it?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1987\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nU2's \"The Joshua Tree.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Radio K.A.O.S.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Pleased to Meet Me.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Bad.\"\n\nR.E.M.'s \"Document.\"\n\nAll things considered, I'm a relatively recent convert to Beach Boys / Brian Wilson fandom. But as happens with so many converts, I have a tremendous zeal and loyalty now that I'm in the tent.\n\nAnd when I was first digging into Brian Wilson's solo catalog, there wasn't a lot to track down. At the time, the only legitimate releases were Brian's self-titled solo debut, the \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" soundtrack, the \"Imagination\" album and his \"Live at the Roxy\" release. (The Van Dyke Parks collaboration \"Orange Crate Art\" is quite good, but Wilson contributes only vocals to it). And the only one of the bunch I could actually buy in stores at the time was \"Imagination.\"\n\nI think \"Imagination\" gets a bad rap. For me, it is one of those perfect summer albums. And I listened to it a lot in the summer of 1998.\n\nBut the summer of 1999? I spent it with Wilson's 1988 effort.\n\nIf you've seen this year's \"Love & Mercy\" film starring Paul Dano and John Cusack, it is this album that Brian is working on with Eugene Landy when Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) tries to help Wilson break free.\n\nStrip away the history and the drama (and some of that late 1980s production), and you get some pretty great songs. \"Pet Sounds '88\" might be a bit of a stretch, but it was still the finest collection at the time of Brian Wilson tunes since 1977's \"Love You\" (or 1968's \"Friends\" album).\n\nFrom 1997-99, I was hitting eBay regularly. I bought a lot of Beach Boys / Brian Wilson material (legit and bootleg). And my first copy of Wilson's debut album was an eBay purchase. I remember the excitement I had as I ripped open the mailing packaging to find the CD looking up at me. (I still dig the cover art ... I feel oceans and darkness and light in it).\n\nAs for the music: Want a timeless ballad, with a lot of spirituality and heart? You get \"Love and Mercy.\" Want a cool rock tune? \"Walkin' the Line\" (and its footstep percussion) might get you where you want to go. Want some lovely vocals and that traditional Beach Boys harmony? You have got to try \"Melt Away.\" That's three-for-three in great tunes, and all at the front of the album.\n\nIf you like something a bit more challenging, a bit more progressive, something more \"pocket symphony\" like the \"SMiLE\" music, give \"Rio Grande\" a shot.\n\nMy favorite track on the album is \"Meet Me In My Dreams Tonight.\" The arrangement, the sounds, the sleigh bells! It's Brian freaking Wilson, man! Here he is! He's still got it. And is that a little bit of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" in there? Shhhhh ... (And before I forget, I've gotta give a lot of praise to producer, musician, singer and songwriter Andy Paley for meeting the challenges, collaborating with Brian, getting the best out of him, giving Brian the immediacy and versatility he demands in the studio).\n\nWhen the album came out, it received a lot of praise from critics. And the Brian Wilson faithful rallied around it. But it was a different Beach Boys-related project that got the success. \"Kokomo\" came out and it became the sound of The Beach Boys, the song of the summer and the major hit.\n\nYou can say what you want about \"Kokomo\" (and EVERYBODY has an opinion), but none of it changes the fact that Wilson's solo debut is a work of tremendous talent and skill. It feels like an old friend. And that's because the music is from an old friend. An old friend who saw a world full of sex and violence and upheaval, and offered up a little hymn that gives everyone a little bit of what they need — a comforting helping of love and mercy.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1988\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nLeonard Cohen's \"I'm Your Man.\"\n\nKeith Richards' \"Talk Is Cheap.\"\n\nFreddie Mercury's and Montserrat Caballe's \"Barcelona.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"The Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Daydream Nation.\"\n\nMy first introduction to The Beastie Boys has nothing to do with \"Paul's Boutique.\" But we'll get to the album soon, I promise.\n\nMy introduction didn't even come from the ubiquitous \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!).\" No, even that came later.\n\nI got introduced to The Beasties from the unlikely source of \"Beavis and Butt-head.\" At least, that's my memory. I remember my brother and I enjoying some parentless cable TV time and watching a \"moron-a-thon.\" And in one of the episodes, I seem to recall one of the music videos showing this really cheesy, 1970s-influenced cop schtick scene. But that music was so insistent. There was nothing schtick about it.\n\nThe song was \"Sabotage,\" and it is still one of my favorite Beastie Boys songs. But we always tend to have special feelings for our firsts, right?\n\nIt was in the later 1990s, after high school graduation, maybe even during my freshman year of college, when I heard bits of Beatles songs being worked into this, well, audio collage. What the heck is this?\n\nAnd that, my friends, was how I found \"Paul's Boutique.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys made heavy use of samplings in their music. What makes \"Paul's Boutique\" so special over many other artists and albums that feature the same technique is that The Beasties were very, very, very unfettered in their use of other people's music. And The Beatles' material had never really seen that kind of use in anything before. It maybe even led to some artists and companies to re-examine their policies and restrictions, because of lawsuits (and threats of lawsuits) from the blatant sampling.\n\n(As a brief aside: A lot of the music sampled actually did have permission given for use. But The Beastie Boys paid a lot less for the samples than would become the standard. It is unlikely you'd see people being able to sample Beatles music in such a way again, because it would be so cost prohibitive.)\n\nI don't think it'd be unfair to suggest that \"Paul's Boutique\" changed the industry and shook up hip-hop. It wasn't just in the sampling, either. There are references, musically and lyrically, that work together to create these huge messages and homages. And the variety! This isn't \"thrown in a blender and see what happens\" material. Nor is it noise, for the sake of sound. This is an elaborate aural tapestry, where everything has its place.\n\nThe lyrics are still pretty great today. Consider this material, from \"Shadrach\":\n\n\"It's not how you play the game, it's how you win it / I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic.\n\n\"For those about to rock, we salute you / The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to.\n\n\"I once was lost but now I'm found / The music washes over and you're one with the sound.\"\n\nThese guys knew what they were doing, from the sampling and to the allegations of how they were contributing to the delinquency of younger listeners, but it also revels in this music. Not just their music, but the music that came before them, the music that they use to contribute to their own sound. Ya know, if it wasn't for the rapping and sampling and the arrangements, this follows a lot of the folk tradition of appropriation.\n\nLet that sink in for a minute ...\n\nOne of the issues I see in classifying music under any kind of genre is that it is package-to-sell labeling. And if you are packaging to sell, you also are packaging to avoid. \"I don't like rap, and that is in the rap section, so I won't like it.\" Ditto country, rock, metal, etc.\n\nBut if you listen to \"Paul's Boutique,\" you get a lot of styles. It's not just hip-hop. It's not just using The Beatles or following usual hip-hop tropes of being \"bad\" or substance abuse or violence. There's complexity, sophistication. Would it go too far to say this material is literate, skilled? No. It'd be totally fair. What's even cooler is that it isn't pretentious, it isn't beating you over the head with a \"look how clever we are\" vibe. It's just, simply, great.\n\nGive The Beastie Boys their due, they were true MCs. They'd do more albums, including the \"Ill Communication\" album that features the song \"Sabotage,\" but my favorite remains \"Paul's Boutique.\" I get something new every time I listen to it.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1989\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1989 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nLou Reed's \"New York.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Prayer.\"\n\nTom Petty's \"Full Moon Fever.\"\n\nThe Cure's \"Disintegration.\"\n\nThe Stone Roses' \"The Stone Roses.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Flowers in the Dirt.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Bleach.\"\n\nDon Henley's \"The End of the Innocence.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Steel Wheels.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Oh Mercy.\"\n\nBefore I get to the actual assessment of the They Might Be Giants' album \"Flood,\" I really have to apologize.\n\nIn high school, a good friend of mine tried to get me to give the album a chance. But I was really heavily into The Beatles at the time, and I considered everything else inferior music. And not just inferior, but irrelevant.\n\nTo my friend: I am sorry.\n\nI'm sorry I didn't listen to the music with open ears. There's some fun stuff here! (\"Dead\" is one heck of a trip.) There's some serious stuff cloaked as fun stuff, too. (\"Your Racist Friend\" is some great social commentary.) There's some classic singalong goofiness. (\"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" is just so oddly compelling.) There's a great cover song. (\"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\" is catchy and fun, the kind to crank loudly in the car.)\n\nI'm sorry I didn't appreciate the variety. There's brevity (\"Minimum Wage\" and its whip, ha!), there's comic book hijinx (\"Particle Man\") and great grooves (\"Whistling in the Dark\").\n\nAnd I'm sorry that I was so caught up in the greatness that IS The Beatles that I couldn't appreciate that other music was also great, on its own terms. It took a while, but I got there. I learned that fun music, and pop music, and all kinds of music, are all as important and vital as anything \"serious\" or \"classic.\"\n\nSo ... about the album \"Flood.\"\n\nIt's pretty darn good. It is the kind of album you can love as a 9-year-old or as a 19-year-old or as a 29-year-old. Different jokes hit you as funnier when you have your own experiences. And some remain oddly touching. I first heard \"Particle Man\" as a boy, in an episode of \"Tiny Toon Adventures,\" the spinoff of \"Looney Tunes.\" The lyric seemed so easy, and the animation of the cartoon suited it so well. So when I hear the song today, I remember watching the cartoons with my younger brother, and I remember that video. Funny how we can be sentimental about such light fare.\n\nHow often do you laugh out loud at music that isn't parody, or that isn't strictly comedy music? Because this is real music. And it isn't all laughs and grins. It just doesn't take itself too seriously. The group, the songs, the album all have this open-door communication that is almost childlike without being childish. Sounds and textures and words that come out as these very colorful expressions.\n\nAhhhh, \"Dead.\" Coming back as a bag of groceries? How'd TMBG get there? No idea. But bless the quirkiness. Sometimes off-the-wall is just what you need. Let the world wash away for a bit with \"Flood,\" you'll come out of the album feeling refreshed.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1990\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nWilson Phillips' \"Wilson Phillips.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Vegetarians of Love.\"\n\nDread Zeppelin's \"Un-Led-Ed.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"The Rhythm of the Saints.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.\"\n\nConsidering that Freddie Mercury was dying, and that he knew he was dying, and that his bandmates knew he was dying, \"Innuendo\" could have been a very dark, very sad, very downbeat album.\n\nAnd while the album certainly has its reflective and introspective moments, songs that touch on mortality, \"Innuendo\" is one of the best Queen albums released in several years. It was the last Queen album released before Mercury's death in late 1991, and it sounds like a return to the progressive hey-days of the 1970s albums like \"Queen II,\" \"A Night at the Opera\" and \"A Day at the Races.\" Whereas the 1980s seemed to latch on to R&B, dance music and middle-of-the-road chart pleasers (and I'm not knocking any of that), the edge and energy and charisma in the music was lacking.\n\nSongs like \"The Show Must Go On\" and \"These are the Days of Our Lives\" cannot be seen in any other context than through Mercury's impending death. But the former is active, raging at the dying of the light. \"I'll face it with a grin, I'm never giving in, on with the show!\" I get chills. And the latter is touching, a love song, a song that finds peace in the immutable truth that we all go someday, to enjoy the days we have. \"I still love you.\" Freddie's last four words of the song drive it home.\n\nThe title track recalls the days when the band would construct elaborate multi-section songs, like \"March of the Black Queen,\" \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"The Prophet's Song.\" And the song, written and intended as a sort of homage to Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir,\" succeeds as a modern Queen epic. It is masterful, powerful and fabulous.\n\n\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\" seems an exercise in bizarre one-liners, and \"Delilah\" is really just a charming ode to one of Freddie's favorite cats (you won't find another song with the lyric \"And then you make me slightly mad / when you pee all over my Chippendale suite\").\n\nWant something a little more rock and roll? \"Headlong\" is more of a traditional rocker, and certainly would have made a concert staple had Mercury been healthy and the band had toured.\n\nAnd the beauty of \"Bijou\" ... rather than being a Queen track that's mostly vocal with a guitar solo, the guitar is the main presence and Freddie's vocal is the solo. And the singing and lyrics are so touching, so wonderful, that I ache every time I listen to the song:\n\n\"You and me, we are destined / you'll agree ...\n\n\"To spend the rest of our lives with each other / the rest of our days like two lovers ...\n\n\"Forever, yeah forever ...\"\n\nFreddie knew he was dying, and he puts his heart into that short lyric. It is electrifying, crushing and breathtaking all at once.\n\nThat's the album in a nutshell: Electrifying, crushing and breathtaking. Every element that had made Queen so great, so alluring, so fun and fabulous, is right here on this album. It was a grand, eclectic, satisfying work with which to bow out.\n\nThere'd be more music after Freddie passed, including the \"Made in Heaven\" album that featured Freddie's last works before he succumbed to AIDS. There'd be live albums issued, and so many compilations of the band's work. Queen's legacy will never fade, the music retains its power and catches new generations by storm with regularity.\n\nFreddie went out on a high note, and who could ask for anything more?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1991\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Gish.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Into the Great Wide Open.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Help Yourself.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Nevermind.\"\n\nMy Bloody Valentine's \"Loveless.\"\n\nEven if it was only \"Drive\" on this record, \"Automatic for the People\" would top my list for the year.\n\nWith \"Drive,\" I was unexpectedly pulled out of contemporary sounds and was rocketed back to ... when? I don't know. Some 1850s Western setting? A 1950s Western TV show? The song has this guitar progression and effect that brings to mind cowboys. It kind of reminds me of Bon Jovi's \"Wanted Dead or Alive,\" but I prefer R.E.M.'s take.\n\nBut the song has transitions and a build in strings, it has processing, it's kind of a throwback sound with a futuristic process. Make sense? No? Just listen.\n\nAnd \"Automatic for the People\" isn't limited just to the glory of \"Drive.\" As far as the well-known songs are concerned, it also boasts \"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite,\" \"Everybody Hurts,\" \"Man on the Moon\" and \"Nightswimming.\" That's a veritable greatest hits collection right off the bat (even if some, like \"Everybody Hurts,\" got overplayed and overexposed to the point where it's hard to listen to the music without an automatic groan).\n\nThe first copy of \"Automatic for the People\" that I owned came in used condition from a store I worked at, and it came into my possession years after the album was recorded. And though it kind of embarrasses me to admit it, I bought it because of the \"Man on the Moon\" song, which had been used as the title song to an Andy Kaufman movie starring Jim Carrey. I liked the song, I got curious, I looked for the original album (avoiding the film's soundtrack). When I found which album the song was on, and saw some familiar song titles rounding out the album, I pulled out my wallet.\n\nYou ever have that one album that is just bliss on a first listen? Where every song seems to hang together, weaving some kind of beyond-words perfection? \"Automatic for the People\" was that kind of record for me. Even when \"Everybody Hurts\" had its turn in the sequence, I was amazed at how much I actually enjoyed hearing it in the album context. It hung as part of the record's fabric. Whereas radio listens never did much for me, hearing it as a part of the greater whole made a kind of sense to me.\n\nAnd of course, I was transfixed by opening track \"Drive.\" I grabbed my brother and played it for him, and we both saw it as an incredibly picturesque, vivid soundscape with a vocal that struck something inside us. I STILL don't know whythat song resonates with me, but it does. \"Drive\" remains one of my all-time favorite R.E.M. songs, and it feels like a major piece just waiting for the right exposure to become a mammoth anthem. The album only came out in 1992, there's still time ...\n\n\"Automatic for the People\" has its big majestic moments, but largely feels more intimate, more pared down. It is music that demands to be taken seriously, with lyrics that insist upon being heard. Everyone has their favorite R.E.M. records, but I don't think the group has ever topped the glory or the beauty of this record.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1992\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1992 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nGreen Day's \"Kerplunk.\"\n\nThey Might Be Giants' \"Apollo 18.\"\n\nRingo Starr's \"Time Takes Time.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Dirty.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Gordon.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Amused to Death.\"\n\nSugar's \"Copper Blue.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Bone Machine.\"\n\nBlind Melon's \"Blind Melon.\"\n\nDr. Dre's \"The Chronic.\"\n\nEvery time I listen to \"In Utero,\" I get a tingle of electricity down my spine.\n\nEvery time.\n\nThere's something in the music, something in the sound, something in Kurt Cobain's voice and in the band's collective presence. Something primal and pure, it strikes right at the nervous system.\n\nThere's no doubt that \"Nevermind\" is the group's commercial masterpiece, but \"In Utero\" is my favorite. It's a more organic record, it's got such a punk discipline in sound. The songs feel immediate, even now, more than 20 years after the album's release. Every note, every jagged shot of feedback, every howl feels so precisely perfect on a record that was to be the antithesis to precise perfection.\n\nI've written about Cobain and Nirvana before, and touched on my love for the \"In Utero\" album. But sometimes words fail to convey the power that music holds on you, emotionally and spiritually.\n\nIsolate that bassline to \"Heart Shaped Box\" and tell me that isn't the most supremely wicked, fascinatingly dark sound you can conjure. (You can tell me otherwise, but I'll disagree with you.) I think you could release just that bassline for Halloween CDs and it'd be massively popular in its own right.\n\nListen to that overblown surf guitar sound on \"Serve the Servants.\" Surf guitar sound? How so? Man, imagine Dick Dale in plaid, with emotional baggage, more than a little anger and the commercial clout to do whatever he wants. Then get back to me. The guitar skips and dives, runs up and down, it jitters and it conjures frantic power. 'Nuff said.\n\nListen to the words of \"Dumb.\" \"I think I'm just happy.\" I mean, doesn't that say something to you? Have you ever been able to relate to a mindset where something negative might actually be positive, or vice versa? Sniffing glue? Floating on clouds? The lyrics maybe sound like teenage foolishness, but dig the sound with it. The song is like a burned-out daydream.\n\nOh, \"Pennyroyal Tea.\" How many people did I know when I was growing up who tried to make this concoction? And how many songs do you know that manage to work \"cherry-flavored antacids\" into the lyric? And that sound ... Desperation? I don't know, but it has a soothing quality to it.\n\nWhen I think of all the great work Nirvana did, all the excellent material recorded in the various incarnations of the group, and I reflect on what was lost when Cobain died, the first thing that comes to mind isn't the immortal \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" or the baby in the swimming pool cover of \"Nevermind.\" It is the power and depth of \"In Utero.\"\n\n\"In Utero\" was everything that was scary and unfettered and powerful in Nirvana. It was everything honest and dishonest and playful. \"In Utero\" is power and introversion, combined, a sonic and emotional powerhouse that darn few can claim to approach in quality. John Lennon's \"Plastic Ono Band\" is the only album that I'd put above \"In Utero\" for the complete catharsis and pain and psyche examination found in the music.\n\nNot bad for a record recorded at Pachyderm Studio in Minnesota's own Cannon Falls.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1993\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Happy Club.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Off the Ground.\"\n\nAerosmith's \"Get a Grip.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Siamese Dream.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"River of Dreams.\"\n\nI was driving back from a Boy Scouts camping trip when my friend asked, \"Do you listen to much Johnny Cash?\"\n\nI didn't. As I've written elsewhere, my parents weren't big on country music. But I knew some of the big Cash songs, like \"Ring of Fire,\" Walk the Line\" and those early hits. So I told my friend, \"I know a couple songs, but not enough to call myself a fan or anything.\"\n\nHe said, \"Oh, you have to try out this album. It is track after track of good stuff.\" And he handed me a copy of Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings.\"\n\nI admit, I didn't get to it right away. I imagine you've been in the situation where people loan you music, encourage you to try it, piling adjective upon adjective so that you'll listen to it ... but you're just really not that interested. It is no reflection on that music itself, it's more of your state of mind.\n\nAfter a couple weeks, I had nothing going on and was starting to feel bad that I was still borrowing the album and hadn't even tried it. So I popped it in.\n\nWhat can I say? I liked it. But I didn't love it. It sounded good, I liked the variety. \"The Beast in Me\" and \"Drive On\" were pretty cool, and \"Thirteen\" was a dark classic. I enjoyed pretty much all of the songs, but none of them made me want to drop what I was doing and devote my full attention to the record. So I returned the CD to my friend, thanked him, offered a few bland compliments (\"Boy, he sure sounds good on this album\") and moved on.\n\nFast forward five or more years, to when I was living in St. Cloud. Mick Hatten and I were having one of our many music talks, and the discussion turned to Johnny Cash in general and the American albums, in particular. Beyond having heard the first album and then enjoying some of the songs on \"IV,\" I had nothing much to contribute. So Mick loaded me up and my education began.\n\nWhile the \"American Recordings\" album in its own right isn't my favorite of the series, it is nonetheless a landmark album and a treat from start to finish. It is a record that tends to feel like an old friend, a record you enjoy spending time with whenever you put it on. Listening to Cash's voice soar on \"Down There by the Train\" is a treat, and his recitation of \"Delia's Gone\" is by turns sorrowful and regretful, then plainspoken and matter-of-fact.\n\nWithout the \"American Recordings\" album and the series of records under the American label, Cash's legacy would still have been strong and defined by a number of hits and stylistic evolutions. However, the American albums created a foundation for a new image, perhaps even a new myth, of the man in black. The quality was supremely high, the content varied, the myriad styles somehow all brought under the sound of Cash's guitar and voice. He proved himself the master of song, of any song.\n\nAnd that is made abundantly clear on the first record of the American series. For that reason alone, \"American Recordings\" should be feted.\n\nWhat about Tom Petty?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1994 is Tom Petty's \"Wildflowers.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1994\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1994 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe new Beatles, man! The biggest thing to hit music since Elvis! The best songs since (insert artist here) gave us (insert song here)!\n\nGet the point?\n\nOK, all those qualities may be exaggerations, but in 1995 all the hyperbole was in the air, on TV and in the trades. It sure felt true, at the time.\n\nAnd \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" was the album that sealed it. Whether or not you liked Oasis, you couldn't have gone through the 1990s without hearing \"Wonderwall\" or \"Champagne Supernova.\" It sounded enough like 1960s pop that oldies stations would play it, and it was a bright pop sound, so it did well on contemporary stations.\n\nI was 15 at the time, and my devotion to The Beatles was nearing its peak. What was this blasphemy? A new Beatles? Hadn't this label been used before? (The Knack come to mind.) Was music so creatively bankrupt that soundalikes were the only way to make it big?\n\nAh, but then, I hadn't heard any of the music. And judging any artist or album without hearing the music for yourself is always bad policy (beware of tastemakers who encourage you to skip something on their say-so ... you have your own ears).\n\nSo I gave the album a listen, and I loved it. The next Beatles? Yes, that was an exaggeration. But darned if the album didn't sound really good. My favorites were \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" (which truly does sound Beatles-esque) and \"She's Electric,\" which to this day is one of my favorite Britpop songs. \"There's lots and lots for us to do / she is electric, can I be electric too?\" Gets me every time.\n\nIn the 1990s, if you were into the Britpop sound, you tended to either be in the Oasis camp or the Blur camp. I didn't listen to Blur much, and I still haven't. I'm sure Damon Albarn and company are great, but ... I had Oasis. I was pretty comfortable with that selection.\n\nOf course, the band's lineup changed over the years. And then brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher had yet another huge falling out (shades of The Kinks and their brothers, Ray and Dave Davies) and Oasis split.\n\nConsidering the \"next Beatles\" label that Oasis itself was pinned with, I won't go so far as to say that we'll never see the like of Oasis again. But records like \"Definitely Maybe\" and \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" reflect just how good it was to have the band while it was here. And if you haven't already, check out \"Don't Believe the Truth\" and \"Dig Out Your Soul,\" the band's last two albums. The band went out the way it came in, with two excellent albums and a high bar set for its contemporaries.\n\nSo if you enjoy some good British pop music, with a solid back beat and catchy guitar solos and plenty of \"that sounds like ...\" hooks, you can do far worse than revisiting this Oasis classic. As their song \"Roll With It\" suggests, \"don't let anybody get in your way.\" The album was big for a reason, no shame in enjoying it now. Who cares what some might say?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1995\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1995 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nRadiohead's \"The Bends.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"I Should Coco.\"\n\nAlanis Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill.\"\n\nThe Presidents of the United States of America's \"The Presidents of the United States of America.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Clouds Taste Metallic.\"\n\nShane MacGowan and the Popes' \"The Snake.\"\n\nGreen Day's \"Insomniac.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Return of the Rentals.\"\n\nQueen's \"Made in Heaven.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 1.\"\n\nWhen I first heard Weezer's \"Pinkerton,\" I hated it. Like, HATED it.\n\nMy best friend got me into Weezer, with their debut album, and it took me a while to get into it. But once I got there, I really enjoyed it. Songs like \"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here\" left a big mark on me, and I had a set belief in how the band should sound and the kinds of songs it should perform.\n\n\"Pinkerton\" took those notions and tossed them into the trash.\n\nThe sound was raw, dark. Where were the peppy, geeky kind of songs? I sure didn't hear them in the mix of songs about sex, lesbians and Japanese girls.\n\nAfter the success of Weezer's debut album (known affectionately as the \"Blue Album\"), group leader and main songwriter Rivers Cuomo went to Harvard. He wrote about some confusion, some anger, some physical ailments (walking with an old man's cane), and it all took this kind of anguished, introverted atmosphere.\n\nIf you wanted more \"Buddy Holly,\" you didn't get it. Instead, you got the grandfather of emo records. \"Getchoo\" maybe puts things in the proper perspective: \"This is beginning to hurt, this is beginning to be serious.\" The sound is live, the bass thrums and guitar lines are jagged. Cuomo gives some of his best tuneful howls, and \"Pinkerton\" becomes this great flood of passion and pain.\n\nBut on the first few listens, it just seemed like noise. Melodic noise, anthemic noise, but noise nonetheless.\n\nI think my younger brother caught on to it before I did, really. He listened to it with more regularity, and stuff started to sink in. I started to get into songs like \"The Good Life\" (a song I'll always associate with my brother), and I enjoyed the intricate lyrics of \"Across the Sea.\" And album closer \"Butterfly\" has such a wistful tune and ends with the words \"I'm sorry,\" in a straight-from-the-heart voice.\n\nAnd I think that kind of emotional and stylistic purity is what keeps \"Pinkerton\" so fresh and important to me. Strip away the Ric Ocasek production from the first album, get back to a sound more like a live experience, then dig deep into affairs of the heart and mind and then let loose as microphones pick up the crashing drums, the angry guitars and the exasperated vocals.\n\nThis, my friends, is all your growing-up angst and all those late-at-night-and-in-the-dark thoughts, thrown onto an audio canvas.\n\nAfter I'd finally given in and gave up my prejudices on how Weezer music should sound, I got heavily emotionally invested in the record. Bitter disappointment on the love front? Sure, I can relate. A general feeling of isolation and loneliness? Heck, who doesn't feel that from time to time? Feeling like you're a million miles away from someone who could make everything feel better? Oh, sure, if you've got a romantic stripe in you, you've had to have felt that sometime in your life.\n\n\"This is beginning to hurt,\" indeed. But thanks for hanging in there, Weezer. The pain led to a masterpiece.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1996\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1996 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Bad Hair Day.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 2.\"\n\nSuperdrag's \"Regretfully Yours.\"\n\nThe Wallflowers' \"Bringing Down the Horse.\"\n\nSquirrel Nut Zippers' \"Hot.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Songs and Music from 'She's the One.'\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"That Thing You Do!\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 3.\"\n\nWilco's \"Being There.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"Unchained.\"\n\nI came to Radiohead's \"OK Computer\" in an unusual way.\n\nI was a sophomore in college and I was playing an online game, and one of my friends on the game was a fella from Australia. We were talking about music, and I was undoubtedly gushing about Pink Floyd (my musical obsession at the time). He asked me about what I liked about Pink Floyd's music. I undoubtedly went into long rhapsodies about the song constructions, how some of the music has an organic buildup, that I could get washed away in blankets of sound, that the lyrics had an odd way of peering into neglected nooks and crannies that other music never penetrated.\n\n\"I think I know what you mean,\" he said. \"You've got to give Radiohead's 'OK Computer' a try.\"\n\nI'd heard, and even liked, other Radiohead material before this recommendation. But \"OK Computer\" was virgin territory for me.\n\nCurious, I eventually wandered out to a store and picked up a copy.\n\nAnd I really wasn't sure how I felt about it, even after a handful of listens. How did my love of Pink Floyd music lead me here?\n\n\"OK Computer\" and its lyrics weren't necessarily personal, they were more abstract. But there was this probing quality to them.\n\nThe music was, well, layered and atmospheric, collages of sounds that would flow together and then there'd be a tension that'd give way to something in a lyric or a vocal.\n\nI wasn't really quite sure how much of \"OK Computer\" was deliberately produced, or how much of it was a product of chance, of pure serendipity.\n\nAnd maybe that was the real hook for me. The music kept me guessing, it kept me involved. The song titles were a mix of standard fare and peculiar (the former including \"Let Down,\" \"No Surprises,\" \"Lucky\" and the latter featuring \"Paranoid Android,\" \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and \"Exit Music (For a Film).\"\n\nThe lyrics, the sounds, the song titles, they all appealed to different parts of my head.\n\nI tend to think that music is a very personal experience in life. Sure, you have massive hits that everyone buys and become global anthems. But what we hear in the music, what we feel from the music, what we respond to in the music are very personal. And when you move away from the big hits, the chart toppers, and you're listening to music that is more soundscape than guitar-hero hijinx, it's all about what you find and what you feel and what you take away from it.\n\nI guess I can see the Pink Floyd connection, after all. The material gets into all those nooks and crannies, organic buildups and all.\n\nI may need to track down my Aussie friend and thank him. It's long overdue.\n\nWhat about Paul McCartney?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1997 is Paul McCartney's \"Flaming Pie.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1997\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nElliott Smith's \"Either/Or.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"In It for the Money.\"\n\nJohn Fogerty's \"Blue Moon Swamp.\"\n\nOasis' \"Be Here Now.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Time Out of Mind.\"\n\nThe more things change, the more things stay the same.\n\nAn online pal got me into \"OK Computer,\" and another online pal got me into \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nI think it was around 2013 that a Facebook friend (hi Becknar!) asked me what I thought about Superdrag.\n\nOddly enough, the Superdrag albums I had been exposed to were not their biggest records. Go figure.\n\nA guy I roomed with in college had gotten me into the band a little, and I had copies of \"In the Valley of Dying Stars\" (which I really liked), \"Greetings from Tennessee\" (which was OK) and \"Last Call for Vitriol\" (another excellent record).\n\nBut I had never heard \"Regretfully Yours\" or \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nBecknar, the passionate gent that he is about music, found copies of both albums at basement prices on eBay and sent me the links. Days later, I had these albums in my hands. Headphones ready, I dug in.\n\nBefore I start talking \"Head Trip,\" let me just say this: If you love 1990s power pop and alt rock, you owe it to yourself to get these two records. Part of me wants to say that Superdrag is almost the Cheap Trick of the 1990s (and in case you have mixed feelings on what that could mean, take it as a compliment).\n\nAs for the music? Oh, man. Think about the 1967 era of The Beatles, like \"Sgt. Pepper\" and \"Magical Mystery Tour,\" with sitars and orchestrated hooks and lush backing tracks. The vocals are crisp, there are tasty hooks and everything sounds so punchy and vibrant. Getting the Cheap Trick angle, yet?\n\nBut Superdrag's members aren't just copying a sound or replicating a style. The best music can pay homage to a sound while also creating something distinctive and refreshing.\n\nLooking for hits or key cuts? You won't find any. The album is a triumph of studio use, but it isn't a collection of radio hits or chart toppers. If you've heard any of the songs on the record, it's likely it was \"Do the Vampire.\" But don't be dismissing the album because you don't recognize the song titles or haven't heard the tracks. \"I'm Expanding My Mind\" has to be one of the great leadoff tracks on a 1990s album, and the group's purpose for the album is right there in the title. Imagine you're outside on a hot day, and you step into an air-conditioned sanctuary. That woosh of refreshment, that sudden relief, an immediate comfort. That's the opening track. Comfortable, engaging, getting you ready for more.\n\nHats off to you, Becknar. How'd I miss this back in the day? It only took me 15 years, but now I'm in love with one of the late 1990s great lost albums. No drag in that.\n\nWhat about Madonna?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1998 is Madonna's \"Ray of Light.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1998\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Photograph Smile.\"\n\nLucinda Williams' \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Stunt.\"\n\nThe Beach Boys' \"Endless Harmony Soundtrack.\"\n\nElliott Smith's \"XO.\"\n\nWhen I first moved to St. Cloud in late 2004, I made a number of new friends. With new friendships came exposure to music I hadn't tried. I knew some Nine Inch Nails material, but it took a copy editor friend to get me into \"The Fragile.\"\n\nIt goes something like this. The copy desk was talking about key albums and artists that meant a lot to them for whatever reason. I talked about Brian Wilson and his recently released \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE,\" and others were contributing their favorites. The copy editor, a good dude named Ryan, spoke of \"The Fragile.\" Excited discussions were had, and this led to people burning CDs of albums to introduce everyone else to the music.\n\nAnd folks, the proper etiquette when sharing favorites with each other always is to at least try the favorites given by others in the conversation. That give-and-take is part of the fun.\n\nSo I popped in \"The Fragile,\" sat in a comfy chair and started to listen.\n\nSome music, you're just going to dislike for whatever reason. If you hate rap, you hate rap. If you hate country, you hate country. If you hate industrial music, you hate industrial music. And Nine Inch Nails is heavily rooted in industrial music, but it has a heavy rock vibe to it. If you like pop or lighter fare, this is probably not for you.\n\nBut oh, seriously, just listen. This isn't the usual NIN (if NIN can ever be described to be \"usual\"). It's avant garde, artsy, multifaceted, complex, almost symphonic, a truly layered work. Is this prog rock? Maybe?\n\nWhat I know for sure is that it is experimental and pushes the envelope of what Trent Reznor had done on previous albums. It can alternate from airy to suffocating, chillingly isolated and then overheated and claustrophobic. I mean, how do you zigzag like that, sometimes just one moment to the next on the same track? It's like capturing wind and trying to shape something from it, powerful and frightening and then gone. And it's angry. It is so angry.\n\nBut let you think this is some atmosphere album, no, it has songs. It has lyrics. While all the pieces fit together as a disjointed and compelling whole, you can pull out individual tunes. But it almost feels a disservice to talk about individual songs when the impact of the album is from its totality. You can thrash and wail, or you can hug yourself and chant. You feel eerily alienated and disturbingly understood.\n\nSound frightening? It is. But the best art grabs you and doesn't let you go. And \"The Fragile\" refuses to let you go, it lingers, and it draws strength over the years. It isn't that it is lyrically inventive or sonically original, but there's this cumulative effect that blows you away. It isn't for the faint of heart, but it is an album worth experiencing.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1999\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1999 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nEminem's \"The Slim Shady LP.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Echo.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Californication.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"The Soft Bulletin.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Seven More Minutes.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Fly.\"\n\nThe Magnetic Fields' \"69 Love Songs.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Run Devil Run.\"\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young's \"Looking Forward.\"\n\nBeck's \"Midnite Vultures.\"\n\nMy first impressions of Eminem's \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" came from selling it.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, I was working at a store that sold music, movies and books. I really enjoyed that job and the people I worked with, and we had our regulars as customers — the folks who'd come in every day and would chat about their favorite music, concerts they'd gone to, celebrities they'd met, that kind of thing.\n\nOne day, one of our regulars (a guy in his early 40s) came in wearing a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, and he headed right over to the music section. I figured there'd be some classic rock or maybe some metal coming up to the register with him. Nope.\n\nHe had a copy of Eminem's latest release, \"The Marshall Mathers LP.\"\n\nI asked him about it. Was he a fan? What got him interested in buying the album? Had he heard much Eminem before?\n\nIt turns out that he'd never heard an Eminem song before, but he was buying it for his son and had heard and read that it was a very strong album, with adult themes and language, but that it also was very artistic and intriguing. Fair enough. He bought it, and that was that.\n\nI hadn't actually heard the record. In fact, it would take another year before I'd hear more than a few tracks (you couldn't really get away from \"Stan\" or \"The Real Slim Shady,\" as they were on TV and everyone was listening to them). I had friends who listened to hip-hop regularly, and they talked about how revolutionary the record was, and they played me select tracks.\n\nAs a narrative piece, the album hangs together really well. Eminem's conflicts with authority, with fame and with his wife and mother, as well as his anger, his drug use and his violent outlook, didn't come across as gimmicks or stereotypes. Sincerity is a quality that can add quite a bit to art, and you'll find quite a bit of sincerity throughout this record — some of it quite scary.\n\nBut there's a lot of humor (sometimes dark, but humor nonetheless) on this album. The themes jump from the kind of material that could make horror movie fodder or content for a \"CSI\" episode, then jump to songs that deflate the situation and basically ask the listener, \"Are you actually taking this seriously?\" I find him refreshing, provocative, intelligent, surreal.\n\nIf you have a preconceived notion of Eminem as a violent, foul-mouthed thug, \"Stan\" still stands as one of the best challenges to that image. It gives you a glimpse behind the public face, demonstrating the fan expectations, the pressures of fame and the downsides of adulation brilliantly. Eminem knows who he is, and what he is.\n\nHe's the real Slim Shady, sometimes. He's Marshall Mathers, sometimes. He's who he needs to be, what he has to be, and this album is just an early part of an important musical and cultural legacy.\n\nHe's released some great albums since, too. And if you've never seen his film \"8 Mile,\" give it a shot. Give all his records a shot. Maybe you'll glean some understanding from all the material. Or maybe you'll be entertained. Or maybe you'll find it disturbing, or vulgar, or obscene.\n\nI'm sure Eminem would welcome any of those views. He's heard it all, been called it all. That's just the way he is.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2000\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"De Stijl.\"\n\nColdplay's \"Parachutes.\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\nRadiohead's \"Kid A.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"You're the One.\"\n\nAfter being introduced to Weezer's \"Blue Album\" and taking a while to really embrace sophomore effort \"Pinkerton,\" I was finally primed for a new Weezer release when it was announced that a third album was on the way.\n\n\"Would it be as dark and personal as 'Pinkerton?' \" I asked myself. \"Oooh, or maybe it'll be some new rock opera, some artful new expression of frustration!\"\n\nWhat we got was quite the opposite of that.\n\nPower pop, huge bursts of guitar riffs and catchy hooks, an album seemingly created to be a summer masterpiece. This was what Weezer gave us for album No. 3.\n\nAnother self-titled effort, like the group's debut, this one has taken to being called the \"Green Album\" because of the vivid green background on it. Also like the debut, the group members are lined up on the cover (though the band's personnel had changed, with a new bassist in the group).\n\nBut that's about where the similarities end. Whereas \"Blue\" had an alt-rock feel with some pop sensibilities, \"Green\" is pure pop sweetness with a tendency to rock.\n\nAnd \"Green\" is short; it runs less than 30 minutes. \"Blue\" has \"Only in Dreams,\" which is more than eight minutes by itself.\n\nIn the end, though, the length didn't matter, nor did the style. I didn't find myself disappointed by \"Green.\" In fact, I was pretty happy with it. It came out in the middle of May 2001, and I bought my first copy after finishing a couple of my more-challenging college finals of the school year. The relief I felt at being done with those classes was nicely boosted by the mostly happy feeling to the majority of the songs. Even the sadder sounds felt upbeat.\n\n\"Photograph\" was so much fun ... \"If you want it, you can have it / but you're gonna have to reach out there and grab it.\" So simple, but so true. Nothing wrong with simplicity, folks. And then there's the Sumo wrestlers in \"Hash Pipe\" (and that song has a wicked groove, I still get grabbed by it). \"Island in the Sun\" definitely grabbed a lot of ears (hip hip), and \"Crab\" is some singalong fun.\n\nMy favorite from the album then, as now, is \"Smile.\" A little different production or a little different approach and the track could have easily slipped on to \"Blue\" or \"Pinkerton.\" An off-kilter love song, I'll grant you, but I love it. \"The way you wanna wrap me up inside your smile,\" a wonderful idea.\n\n\"Green\" is probably the easiest of Weezer albums to play for new listeners, as it is fun, catchy and not terribly challenging. Beyond the drug references in \"Hash Pipe\" or the word \"knickers\" in the song \"Crab,\" it is the kind of music that 8-year-olds and 80-year-olds would find pleasing to the ear.\n\nSound awful? Sound like a sellout? Sound like commercial fluff? Bah. Get over it. Pop it in a player, crank it up and have some fun. You might just find that you like it. Maybe you'll find that it makes you feel better. Heck, maybe it will even make you feel happy. Who knows? Maybe it'll make you feel so fine, you can't control your brain. (Hip hip.)\n\nWhat about Bob Dylan?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2001 is Bob Dylan's \"Love and Theft.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2001\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"White Blood Cells.\"\n\nSuper Furry Animals' \"Rings Around the World.\"\n\nSlipknot's \"Iowa.\"\n\nElton John's \"Songs from the West Coast.\"\n\nThe Strokes' \"Is This It.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks get a lot of crap thrown at them. Too pop to be country. Too country to be pop. The George Bush and \"Shut Up and Sing\" stuff. Their brashness, their fierce \"we don't care what you think or what you want, we'll be us and you can take it or leave it\" stance on things (which would likely be celebrated if they were men instead of women ... but that's a topic for another time).\n\nBut damn, do they have a sound. Whether it is Natalie Maines' vocals or the combined instrumental and harmony sounds with bandmates Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, there's a powerful combination of sweetness, determination, mischief and joie de vivre that is as compelling as the guitar strums and fiddle flourishes.\n\nI was walking between two dorms on the University of Missouri campus in autumn 2002 when I first heard them. It was this bouncy (and laid back, at the same time) track, it almost reminded me of Civil War music but was way, way too modern. What the heck was it?\n\nI was talking to a friend about songs we liked, and out of the blue she played \"Travelin' Soldier.\"\n\nThat was IT. That was THE SONG.\n\nWell, forget the Civil War. A bus, Army greens, this was definitely a more modern setting (Vietnam). But the sound and sentiment leaps generations, and the words ring true no matter the age. \"Our love will never end, waitin' for the soldier to come back again / never more to be alone when the letter said, 'A soldier's coming home.' \"\n\nOK, so I knew the song. I knew the artist. Now to add the album to my collection. I hit a music store, and there it was: \"Home.\" That was the album. Picked up, purchased, mine. Mission accomplished (I trust you'll forgive the situational humor). And it was love from first listen.\n\nIt sounded so natural. It had more of a folk and bluegrass leaning, heavy on acoustic instrumentation and sounding fantastic. Honestly, it sounded like a classic album that had been around for decades but was freshly discovered somehow. It was warm and comfortable and exciting, something I hadn't really thought possible for a country music album at that time.\n\nCollege is a good time for getting over biases. With \"Home\" and my exposure to Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings,\" I started to set aside biases of songs about pickup trucks, drinking and \"she done me wrong\" stereotypes and started to acknowledge the depth and artistry within the genre. And \"Home\" by itself was quite an education.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks even took on Fleetwood Mac's \"Landslide\" and covered it admirably, standing tall right up there against Stevie Nicks' own definitive performance.\n\nAnd the instrumental \"Lil' Jack Slade,\" wow, really, that's a headphones track. I enjoy every listen.\n\nSure, on \"Home\" you still get some traditional country music references (song titles like \"White Trash Wedding\" and \"Tortured, Tangled Hearts\" sound tailor-made for jukeboxes at honky tonks), but I like that. It's history, it's part of the genre, it's part of the tradition. It's fun, it pulls on nostalgic heartstrings that you may not even know you had until the sounds pluck them.\n\n\"Home\" is damn good music. Setting aside the politics and the situation, this is a great American album, an important entry in country music and is my favorite Dixie Chicks album by a wide margin (and I've since picked up and enjoyed all the Maines-era Chicks records).\n\nTurn it on, let it play. See if you'll shed a tear with the pretty little girl with a bow in her hair.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2002\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2002 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe Streets' \"Original Pirate Material.\"\n\nWilco's \"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\"\n\nEminem's \"The Eminem Show.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.\"\n\nMy Chemical Romance's \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"The Rising.\"\n\nInterpol's \"Turn on the Bright Lights.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"The Last DJ.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"American IV: The Man Comes Around.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison's \"Brainwashed.\"\n\nGosh, is there anyone older than 18 who hasn't heard \"Seven Nation Army?\" I'd be inclined to guess not.\n\nFor quite a stretch there, it seemed to be everywhere. It's one of The White Stripes' signature songs, and it kicks off their 2003 album \"Elephant\" with insistent, undeniable, unavoidable energy. And it is one of those earworms that you just cannot get out of your head. I know. I've tried.\n\nIt isn't a bad song. In fact, it's a pretty cool song. But like all cool songs that have been overplayed, one may find oneself skipping the track to get to other goodies. The blessing of \"Elephant\" is that there are many goodies worth skipping to.\n\nMy personal favorite is their cover of \"I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself,\" the Burt Bacharach / Hal David song that has been recorded by such greats as Dusty Springfield and Dionne Warwick. And with all respect to those versions, The Stripes' rendition is my favorite. It has a snarling, carnal quality that is both seductive and bombastic. And the video, well, it didn't hurt things either.\n\nOne of the cool touches on \"Elephant\" is the use of antiquated equipment during the recording and production of the album. No computers, no modern processes. What does this mean to the casual listener? Maybe not a whole lot (though I suspect you'll sense some undefinable something that you can't articulate). For dedicated students of sound and those who spend some time with headphones, the old equipment adds a dimension and sonic quality that conjures the live energy and excitement of earlier recordings. There's a spark, a crackle, a fuzz, not an imperfection but an enhancement, a \"you are here\" buzz that can suck you right into the music.\n\nAt least, that's how it feels to me.\n\nEarlier White Stripes albums had several good songs, and the garage rock sound was well established. But \"Elephant\" was where Jack and Meg White really kicked things up a notch, cranked the volume to 11 and blew the doors off garages near and far. And it set the stage for \"Get Behind Me Satan,\" my favorite Stripes album.\n\nIf you like you rock a bit loud and bluesy, if you like some slashing guitars and your drums to feel like thunder, \"Elephant\" has those qualities in spades. You want things a bit more toned down, intimate, you want to be coaxes through songs? \"Elephant\" has that too. There's such a variety of styles, I never get bored with \"Elephant.\" No one-trick pony, The White Stripes.\n\nAnd if all else fails, there's always \"Seven Nation Army.\" It's one of the 14 great songs on the album, and every single one's got a story to tell.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2003\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRingo Starr's \"Ringo Rama.\"\n\nAvenged Sevenfold's \"Waking the Fallen.\"\n\nWarren Zevon's \"The Wind.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Let It Be ... Naked.\"\n\nAlicia Keys' \"The Diary of Alicia Keys.\"\n\nIn 2004, My Chemical Romance was nowhere near my radar. I had college graduation, my first newspaper job in North Carolina, my first car that was all mine and then the move to St. Cloud. And Brian Wilson released two albums that year, so I was pretty preoccupied.\n\nAnd to be honest, I don't know if I'd have paid any attention to My Chem even if the rest of the variables weren't in play. The band looked like the goth guys you maybe avoided in class. And songs about vampires and zombies and ghosts and ... well, there you go.\n\nBut then I discovered \"The Black Parade,\" and everything changed. I learned the ever-popular (and generally true) creed of not judging books by their covers.\n\nAfter I got hooked on \"The Black Parade,\" I started filling in the past releases. The excellent 2002 debut \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\" is a much rawer effort than \"The Black Parade,\" and makes one wonder if the 2004 sophomore effort \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" would bridge the harder punk sounds and the smoother rock opera touches.\n\nNope. \"Three Cheers\" is a polished effort, too. And that's OK, because it's a great polished effort at that.\n\nWhen I started listening to \"Three Cheers,\" I got swept away by the variety of textures and by the operatic sweep of the sound. My first thought was, \"This band has to have been inspired by Queen.\" My second thought was, \"This is really freaking good.\"\n\nAnd it is. It is really freaking good. \"Helena,\" \"You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison,\" \"I'm Not Okay (I Promise),\" \"The Ghost of You,\" \"Thank You for the Venom,\" \"Cemetery Drive\" and \"I Never Told You What I Do for a Living\" ... all great! Yes, this is a band influenced by horror movies, by comic books, by classic rock albums and punk rock albums and by old movies ... and dang it, that's great! If you enjoy that kind of stuff, if you have similar tastes and influences, isn't it great to see (or hear) a band that combines it all so well and makes music you can relate to?\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is.\n\nCall me a sucker for liking soaring vocals and catchy guitar riffs, but there is some dimension to this music. Chiming guitars, propulsive drum fills, bass notes that bubble up, all combining into a layered sound and complexity that tickles the ears.\n\nOh, and all the videos released to promote the singles are pretty sweet too. \"I'm Not Okay\" is like a trailer to a film, \"Helena\" is a funeral (with some epic dancing), but my favorite is the retro \"The Ghost of You,\" with its World War II era vibe. Good stuff.\n\nSet aside the goth clothing, ignore the hairstyles, pay attention to the situations, the stories, the performances. Once you've jettisoned your prejudices (just as I had to do), there's something altogether human, quirky and enjoyable to this music. Allow yourself to bask in the outsider mentality a bit (it may be no stranger to you, anyway). An open mind can take you places, from the Old West to Omaha Beach.\n\nIf you like your music dramatic, My Chemical Romance and \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" may be right up your alley.\n\nWhat about Brian Wilson?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2004 is Brian Wilson's \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2004\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Killers' \"Hot Fuss.\"\n\nMatt Sharp's \"Matt Sharp.\"\n\nArcade Fire's \"Funeral.\"\n\nIf \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" doesn't come up in a conversation about Paul McCartney's best solo work, then the people in that conversation need to give it another try (and use their ears this time). Simply put, it isn't just one of McCartney's finest solo albums, it is one of his finest albums. Period.\n\nThe guy who really flowered on The Beatles' \"Revolver\" and gave us \"Eleanor Rigby,\" \"Here, There and Everywhere\" and \"For No One\" is right here. That's no hyperbole, my friends. Emotional music, introverted, personal. For folks who think Sir Paul is only good for catchy melodies and grandma music (and shame on you if you're one of them), \"Chaos and Creation\" will put you in your place.\n\nThat isn't to say the music isn't tuneful. Of course it is. But it tends to be more intimate, with Paul singing of topics in a first-person narrative that transcends the \"silly love songs\" for which he tends to be known. A more reflective, from-the-heart bend is found in these songs.\n\nWhen I bought the album, I didn't have a lot of high expectations. Obviously, I'd dearly loved \"Flaming Pie\" when it came out, and I enjoyed \"Run Devil Run\" quite a bit when it was released. But I find the bulk of 2001's \"Driving Rain\" lackluster, abysmal, tedious. The album was littered with good song ideas, but mostly the performances lacked any kind of spark or energy that would lift the songs from middle-of-the-road compositions to lively or engaging favorites.\n\n\"Chaos and Creation\" was the first release after \"Driving Rain,\" so I was curious (and more than a little worried) to hear what Paul would give us next. Would there be a new direction, or would he be settling into a \"well, this is good enough\" mindset and give us a \"Driving Rain II?\"\n\nRelief, friends. Sheer relief. From the strident piano of opening track \"Fine Line\" to the looped sounds on \"How Kind of You\" to the playful whimsy of \"English Tea\" and the aching beauty of \"Too Much Rain,\" there were many standout tracks. Many? Try all. ALL. No lie. Sure, some songs bear stylistic similarities to past glories (you'll no doubt note that \"Blackbird\" and \"Jenny Wren\" sound like the cousins they are), but there's a maturity and emotional fullness to the new pieces that lifts them from being recreations or homages. Some songs start out in one style and then deftly transition to a different style entirely, in completely unexpected ways (\"Promise to You Girl,\" for example).\n\nThe album is one reward after another, an artistic achievement followed by another artistic achievement, and all while staying accessible, melodious, friendly to the ear.\n\nAnd some credit must be given to producer Nigel Godrich, who has coaxed sounds and feelings out of Radiohead's best works as almost an auxiliary band member, using the studio to bring out textures in the music beyond those created with instruments and computers. Godrich would challenge McCartney, he'd set goals, he'd discuss the emotional qualities and anthemic possibilities, he'd slow down songs, he'd add sounds, all while keeping Paul very much Paul. In fact, most of the instrumentation on the album is played by McCartney himself (shades of \"McCartney\" and \"McCartney II\" in the mix).\n\nIn the final assessment of the album, it is one of the most well-rounded, sincere and inclusive McCartney records released, to date. You'll still get pieces of good-time Paul, and balladeer Paul, and romantic Paul ... and you SHOULD. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I think the best music is music with sincerity, and Paul is sincerely that kind of musician. But he's also a human, a man who has had losses, has suffered setbacks, has fought for what he has, and knows that not everything is wine and roses. And nowhere is Paul more reflective (while also being colorful and stirring and inventive) than he is on \"Chaos and Creation.\"\n\nPost Beatles, post Wings, McCartney has some great albums. And with \"Tug of War,\" \"Flaming Pie\" and 2013's \"New,\" \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" is at the top of the heap. It is a genuine classic, and I hope it grows in stature as more and more people give it a try. It took emotional and creative courage to put this material out there, to buck some of the expectations McCartney has just for being Paul McCartney, and it is a rewarding listen time after time. If you don't feel a tug within you, a recognition of yourself in the music of \"Too Much Rain,\" well, do some living.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2005\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Fiery Furnaces' \"EP.\"\n\nWeezer's \"Make Believe.\"\n\nOasis' \"Don't Believe the Truth.\"\n\nThe White Stripes' \"Get Behind Me Satan.\"\n\nNeil Diamond's \"12 Songs.\"\n\nOver the course of my time as a music columnist, one of the genuine delights I've encountered has been email conversations with folks out in the real world about music. One of the most regular and insightful has been area columnist Dennis Dalman. His love for Bob Dylan, his deep interest in Dylan trivia and his pool of anecdotes have been interesting and enjoyable over the last year.\n\nWe've talked about Dylan's evolution, his different styles and personas, and we've discussed the merits of many of the albums about which I've written. From \"Love and Theft\" to \"Blood on the Tracks\" and discussions about Dylan's speed-induced electric years, it's been fun to trade notes.\n\nOne album we haven't talked much about has been \"Modern Times,\" the 2006 album that picks up where \"Love and Theft\" left off.\n\nIf you enjoyed the bluesy tones and rockabilly charms of \"Love and Theft,\" then \"Modern Times\" will be right up your alley. You can look up the controversy about lyrical and musical influences and uncredited contributions, but Dylan has long been a man who has made use of old folk songs, old blues songs and standards in his music. To me, what matters is the performance, the personal investment in the material.\n\nAnd with \"Modern Times,\" Dylan is in fine performance form. There are some excellent later-period vocals, jauntiness on more upbeat songs and a reservedness to the ballads (of which there are a few). When an album features such fine pieces as \"Thunder on the Mountain,\" \"Rollin' and Tumblin',\" \"Someday Baby,\" \"Workingman's Blues #2,\" \"Nettie Moore\" and \"Ain't Talkin',\" it is going to be worth your while. (Truth be told, I prefer the version of \"Someday Baby\" on \"The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989–2006,\" but that's a conversation for another time.)\n\n\"Modern Times\" was the first Dylan album released after I'd moved to St. Cloud, and my first impression was that it is a very long record. Though only 10 songs, the album lasts more than an hour. Brevity apparently wasn't on Dylan's mind. But rather than feeling bored or distracted by the longer songs, I enjoyed that you had time to absorb and digest the songs. Like with blues and jazz albums, the journey is at least half of the experience; it isn't about the instant payoff or the standard verse-chorus-verse construction.\n\nTake \"Ain't Talkin',\" for instance. That's a journey song if ever there is one. We're with the narrator as he wanders, as he tries to do good, and we see when the narrator falters and how he is distracted into darkness. That's not the kind of song you sum up in three minutes with the chorus repeated four times.\n\nOver the years, I've grown to enjoy \"Modern Times\" as a worthy successor to \"Love and Theft.\" \"Love and Theft\" may be my favorite of the two, but in a world where you can have both, why not indulge in the greatness of the pair of albums?\n\nConsidering the streak that started with at least \"Time Out of Mind\" and led to \"Love and Theft\" and then \"Modern Times,\" it is hard to deny that Dylan was on one heck of a hot streak. If only we could all be so lucky at age 65. Here's hoping ...\n\nWhat about My Chemical Romance?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2006 is My Chemical Romance's \"The Black Parade.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2006\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2006 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs' \"Show Your Bones.\"\n\nEagles of Death Metal's \"Death by Sexy.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Stadium Arcadium.\"\n\nDavid Gilmour's \"On an Island.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Taking the Long Way.\"\n\nThe Decemberists' \"The Crane Wife.\"\n\nThe Killers' \"Sam's Town.\"\n\nFoo Fighters' \"Skin and Bones.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards.\"\n\nStart with a little R.E.M. Toss in a bit of Bruce Springsteen. Add a pinch of Roger Waters. Mix it up, and you get some music resembling Arcade Fire's \"Neon Bible.\"\n\nDon't you hate trying to describe how a group or an album sounds to someone who hasn't heard it? What you hear, the similarities or echoes, may hit others differently. \"Th", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/08/19/love-island-usa-season-6-reunion/74826986007/", "title": "What time is the 'Love Island USA' Season 6 reunion?

Naomi Biden, Biden’s oldest granddaughter, married Peter Neal on the White House South Lawn on Saturday.\n\nOne day following the nuptials, Biden will mark his spot in American history as the only octogenarian president, a numerical milestone that shines a spotlight on a primary issue plaguing Biden with his opponents: his age. Despite a spate of recent wins – better-than-projected midterm elections for Democrats, a relatively gaffe-less trip to Egypt and Asia, and a lackluster presidential announcement from his old rival, Donald Trump – Biden cannot shake being the oldest commander-in-chief America has ever had.\n\nBut a glossy wedding of two twenty-somethings, kicking off a fresh life chapter with music and dancing and revelry, could put a youthful spin on the 80th birthday weekend. Two people familiar with the planning of the wedding say it was not a coincidence Naomi Biden’s wedding weekend coincides with the president’s day – noting the “age issue” is never something Biden wants to highlight.\n\n“The wedding gives some cover,” says one of the people.\n\nThe wedding, which CNN is told includes the extended Biden clan on the guest list, as well as friends and family of the couple, also marks a kickoff of sorts for the tight-knit Bidens to begin earnest discussions over whether Joe Biden should run for a second term.\n\nShortly after the wedding, Jill Biden and Joe Biden will travel to Nantucket, Massachusetts, for the Thanksgiving holiday; Christmas follows quickly on its heels, as the clock ticks toward Biden’s need to say whether he will be in for 2024, or out. Both the president and the first lady have said they will weigh the pros and cons of a second run, something Biden has previously said he “intends” to undertake.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden attend the wedding of Peter Neal and Naomi Biden Neal, Saturday, November 19, 2022 on the South Lawn. Adam Schultz/White House\n\nA family affair\n\nThe wedding itself consists of three parts, a person familiar with the planning told CNN. The ceremony, which was set to begin at approximately 11:15 am ET and ended at 11:50 am, took place on the South Lawn – a location that hadn’t previously been used for a White House wedding. There was no tent, the source had confirmed earlier, which made for a chilly outdoor morning, with the temperature at 39 degrees. Guests arrived early Saturday morning to the White House complex, where they were all administered Covid-19 tests, two people familiar told CNN. They were given blankets and shawls at their seats to keep warm.\n\nPresident Joe Biden celebrates his 80th birthday, blowing out the candle on his coconut birthday cake with first lady Jill Biden, Naomi Biden, her husband Peter Neal and other Biden grandchildren on Sunday, November 20, 2022. Flotus/Instagram\n\nAccording to two people familiar with the wedding details, the bride’s parents, Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, walked her down the aisle. As Naomi Biden walked down the aisle, the band played “Bitter Sweet Symphony” by The Verve. The bride wore a long-sleeved gown with a veil and train, designed by Ralph Lauren, the same sources said.\n\nJoe Biden escorted Neal’s two grandmothers – Paulita Neal and Betty Thum – down the aisle to their seats, a source said. The president then turned back and did a “classic Biden jog” up the aisle, according to the source, to meet the first lady and walk her down the aisle to their seats.\n\nThe program, which was seen by CNN, listed Naomi’s sister Finnegan James Biden as her maid of honor and her sister Roberta Mabel Biden, also known as Maisy, and Katherine Elizabeth Neal as bridesmaids. The groom’s best man was his brother Robert Eliot Neal, and groomsmen were listed as Joseph Robinette Biden IV and Charles W. Gerdts.\n\nPeter’s father, Dr. William Neal, who was accompanied by vocalists, sang a song during the ceremony, the source said. There was also a reading of the poem “I Carry Your Heart With Me” by E.E. Cummings, which was read by Amy D’Amato.\n\nThe bride and groom wrote their own vows for the ceremony, according to the source.\n\n“It has been a joy to watch Naomi grow, discover who she is, and carve out such an incredible life for herself,” the president and first lady said in a statement released by the White House on Saturday. “Now, we are filled with pride to see her choose Peter as her husband and we’re honored to welcome him to our family. We wish them days full of laughter and a love that grows deeper with every passing year.”\n\nNotable attendees included former Sens. Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Ted Kaufman of Delaware, and Secretary of State Tony Blinken and his wife, Evan Ryan, who has served as White House Cabinet secretary.\n\nFollowing the exchange of vows, a smaller, family-and-wedding-party-only luncheon took place in the White House.\n\nThe celebration continued Saturday night, with approximately 325 guests – more than attended the ceremony – invited to the White House for dancing and dessert. The black-tie reception began at approximately 7:30 pm ET and was scheduled to end at midnight.\n\nThe president and first lady mingled with guests, according to two people in attendance who spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity to protect relationships. Guests were asked to relinquish their cell phones, the sources said.\n\nA massive, seven-tier wedding cake was positioned in the Blue Room, and Naomi Biden and her husband Peter Neal used a small ladder to climb up and cut into an upper tier. Guests were given slices of the cake as parting gifts – a tradition that Tricia Nixon, Lynda Johnson and Luci Johnson all did at their White House receptions.\n\nDessert stations were set up in the State Dining Room, and a large band was playing on a stage erected in the East Room.\n\nThe bride wore a strapless Reem Acra dress, according to the two people; she was also scheduled to change into a second party dress later in the evening.\n\nThe grandchild closest – literally – to her grandfather\n\nIn a way, Naomi Biden, 28, experienced a White House wedding thanks in large part to her own gumption. Biden, an associate at the Washington, DC, law firm Arnold & Porter, pushed her grandfather to run the first time.\n\nThough the patriarch, Joe Biden has always included his larger family circle, including his five oldest grandchildren when weighing life choices. His sensitivity to their feelings, and the invasive nature of a nasty political battle weigh heavy on his mind.\n\n“I don’t think there’s been any decision, no matter how big or small, that we haven’t decided as a family,” said Naomi Biden in a video interview played at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.\n\nThough typically called by the elder Biden family members, it was Naomi Biden who convened the most critical, in-person, all-hands-on-deck family meeting, the one that would have the most impact on Joe Biden’s future. Biden was concerned – they, however, were not.\n\n“He thought we were calling a meeting sort of to discuss whether or not we wanted him to [run,] but really were calling it to be like, ‘Get in that race! Hurry up!’” said Naomi Biden. In the years since, it has been Naomi who has been most publicly vocal on her social media channels about Democratic issues, and championing her grandfather. On November 12, she tweeted, “Democracy wins in the Senate. Never think your vote doesn’t matter.”\n\nNaomi is also the grandchild closest – literally – to her grandparents. She and Neal, 25, a recent University of Pennsylvania Law School graduate who works at Georgetown University Law Center on National Security, moved into the White House last August, a person familiar with the living arrangements tells CNN.\n\nThe close proximity to the couple’s wedding site only increased their involvement in the planning. Jill Biden was primarily the person involved in the wedding planning, CNN is told, working with wedding planner Bryan Rafanelli, founder of Rafanelli Events. Rafanelli is no stranger to whipping up fantastical parties at the White House; he oversaw seven State Dinners during Barack Obama’s presidency, including the final of the administration for Italy, which included a tent with a glass ceiling on the South Lawn and a performance by Gwen Stefani.\n\nHe also planned and orchestrated the wedding of Chelsea Clinton in 2010.\n\nA Rafanelli-produced wedding is not an inexpensive endeavor. The price tag for many of his events starts at around $300,000 and can go into the millions of dollars. “Consistent with other private events hosted by the First Family and following the traditions of previous White House wedding festivities in prior Administrations, the Biden family will be paying for the wedding activities that occur at the White House,” Jill Biden’s communications director, Elizabeth Alexander, told CNN.\n\nNaomi Biden’s parents, who divorced in 2017, have each written memoirs about struggles in their relationship, many of which involved Hunter Biden’s yearslong struggle with addiction.\n\nNeal’s family is from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the couple was engaged in September 2021. (The engagement ring includes the band of Neal’s grandmother’s engagement ring and was designed by a DC jeweler, a person with knowledge of its construction told CNN.)\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden attend the wedding of Peter Neal and Naomi Biden Neal on Saturday, November 19, 2022, on the South Lawn of the White House.

Reuters In pictures: A history of White House weddings Prev Next\n\nThe social event of the White House this year\n\nNaomi Biden’s choice of a Ralph Lauren as the designer of her wedding dress was not a total surprise; several fashion insiders previously contacted by CNN had speculated that the job had gone to Lauren, perhaps the most iconic American fashion designer alive today.\n\nJoe Biden is partial to Lauren’s suits, having worn one on Inauguration Day, and Jill Biden has also been photographed wearing the label. In March, Naomi and her sister Finnegan, 23, and Neal, attended Ralph Lauren’s Fall 2022 fashion show in New York City, which sparked most of the chatter that she will wear the designer for at least one of her wedding looks. The White House did not comment on the dress speculation, but two people familiar told CNN the bride would wear two different wedding looks, one for the ceremony and one for the reception.\n\nDespite several protestations from the White House Correspondents’ Association, asking that media coverage be allowed as the wedding is taking place at the people’s house, the White House was adamant that the bride and groom wanted privacy for their nuptials.\n\nFloral garlands of white roses and other blooms were hung from the Truman Balcony, and woven along the staircases down to the South Lawn; large matching wreaths and a floral arch surround the entrance to the Diplomatic Room. It is only the 19th wedding to ever take place at the White House, the last one was for Obama’s chief photographer, Pete Souza, who in 2013 was married in the Rose Garden.\n\nThe last presidential daughter to celebrate a wedding at the White House was Jenna Bush in June 2008. Bush held her wedding and reception months prior at the Bush family’s Texas ranch, but her father, George W. Bush, hosted approximately 600 guests at the White House for his daughter’s second reception.\n\nBut the scope and scale of the Biden wedding most correlates with that of Luci Johnson, who held her reception in the East Room after marrying Patrick Nugent, and Lynda Johnson, who in 1967 married Charles Robb in the East Room of the White House. Tricia Nixon in June 1971 married Edward Finch Cox under a flower-laden white gazebo erected in the Rose Garden. All of these weddings were media catnip, with newspapers printing the recipes for the 6-feet tall wedding cakes.\n\nPieces of the Johnson daughters’ and Nixon’s cakes were sent to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. (Nixon’s hardened to a 2-inch by 2-inch piece that now looks like a dried sponge, according to the White House Historical Association.)\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}]}

Niccol's last day as CEO of Chipotle will be Aug. 31, the restaurant announced in a separate press release.\n\nIn the meantime, Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri will step in as interim chief executive officer.\n\nNarasimhan's abrupt departure comes as the chain's stock shares had fallen 17% for the year and in the wake of an open letter penned by former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz blasting the company's leadership. Though Schultz did not name Narasimhan in the LinkedIn post, he wrote that the chain’s U.S. operations are the “primary reason for the company’s fall from grace.”\n\nStarbucks shares were up more than 23% in Tuesday morning trading.\n\nWho is Brian Niccol?\n\nNiccol has been CEO of Chipotle since 2018 and chairman of the company's board of directors since 2020.\n\nNiccol, who is credited with turning around Taco Bell during his prior tenure as its CEO, took the reins from Chipotle founder Steve Ells. In one of his first tests as CEO, he helped the chain respond to a foodborne illness scandal by retraining all the chain's workers nationwide.\n\nNiccol also said in a second-quarter call with investors this year that employees would be coached in \"consistently making bowls and burritos correctly\" in response to rampant complaints about portion sizes. The complaints sparked a viral challenge on TikTok in which customers would film their Chipotle orders being made to pressure workers to add more food to a bowl or burrito.\n\nNiccol was also at the helm in July last year when the company began testing the Autocado. The prototype was designed to cut, core and peel avocadoes before they are hand-mashed to assist in making guacamole.\n\nStarbucks lauded Niccol's tenure as one in which Chipotle's revenue has nearly doubled and the company's stock price has increased by nearly 800%.\n\n\"I'm incredibly proud of the work that has been accomplished since I joined Chipotle in 2018,\" Niccol said in a statement. \"The strategic priorities this team has put in place have positioned Chipotle to win today and enable future growth.

It has 4,000 left to go | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nOn Tuesday, Chipotle celebrated a milestone: The opening of its 3,000th location.\n\nUp until recently, Chipotle would have said that this new restaurant would have put the chain right around halfway to its goal. But last week, CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company has increased its ambitions.\n\n“Over the long term, we now believe we can operate at least 7,000 Chipotle restaurants in North America, up from our prior goal of 6,000,” he said during a call with analysts.\n\nAs the restaurant industry tries to adjust to a new normal, big chains are making moves. Restaurants that can afford to are “accelerating development,” said BTIG restaurant analyst Peter Saleh. “They all see an opportunity to take share from smaller independents and regional chains,” he said.\n\nChipotle opening its 3,000th restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona, on Tuesday. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nNiccol wouldn’t describe Chipotle’s expansion that way. “The Chipotle brand is really strong, and the economics are really strong,” he told CNN Business in a recent interview. “As a result, where we open, we have great success.”\n\nTo accommodate its new goal, Chipotle has plans to open new locations in a relatively under-penetrated market: Small towns with roughly 40,000 residents.\n\nIt may seem odd for Chipotle (CMG), a fast casual brand that has long appealed to busy office workers looking for a quick, not-so-cheap lunch, to pin its ambitions on small towns. But urban areas are becoming increasingly expensive. “Development and leasing costs are increasing, particularly for urban locations,” the company said in its most recent annual report.\n\nAnd although small towns are “a new thing for us,” Niccol said, the strategy has so far “been really effective.” And the company has high hopes for the future.\n\nWhy Chipotle thinks it will be a hit in small towns\n\nBefore it made a big push into less densely populated areas, Chipotle needed to make sure that its restaurants would offer the quick, convenient service its urban and suburban customers expect. The company’s so-called Chipotlanes, drive-thru windows reserved for diners who place orders ahead of time through Chipotle’s mobile app, can help. Chipotle first introduced its Chipotlanes in 2018. The majority of its new locations will have the drive thrus, according to the company.\n\nIn more rural areas, where customers may have to drive further to reach a Chipotle, the Chipotlane could help create a seamless pickup experience, Niccol said.\n\n“To give them the convenience of ordering ahead, taking their time and knowing they can just, zip in and zip out … I think it’s another level that gives people confidence to choose our restaurant,” he said.\n\nChipotlanes offer another advantage over in-store shopping, which doesn’t work very well for large groups\n\n“I have a family of five and when we’re trying to order as one ticket moving down the line, I find it stressful,” Niccol said. “It’s a lot easier to just do it in the app.”\n\nMaking it easy to order for groups also increases the likelihood that more customers will think about Chipotle for dinner rather than a solitary office lunch. With Chipotlanes, there’s an “ease of execution for that dinner occasion,” Niccol said. That could prove an advantage in small towns which are less likely to host offices.\n\nBut then again, the office may never be the same, making urban locations even less desirable.\n\nWith more companies switching to remote or hybrid models, many workers may not return to the office five days a week. So far, Chipotle has seen sales at its “suburban restaurants continue to stay really strong,” Niccol said. But while some urban locations are back to pre-Covid levels, some are “not fully recovered,” Niccol added. “We’re continuing to watch the trends on how people will work and go to school in the future.”\n\nAnd although people may end up working from home more often, they won’t necessarily be making lunch every day.\n\n“As long as people have the confidence and the ability to be out and about, they like to go out to lunch,” Niccol said. “Whether they’re at a central office or a home office.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2019/12/04/chipotle-comeback-fast-casual-chain-makes-commitment-farmers/2588736001/", "title": "Chipotle comeback: Fast-casual chain makes commitment to farmers", "text": "After staging its own comeback in recent months, Chipotle Mexican Grill wants to help lead another resurgence.\n\nThe fast-casual restaurant chain is making a new financial commitment to help tackle the nation's farming crisis and the plight of struggling young farmers, officials shared exclusively with USA TODAY.\n\n“We need to do more than just say we’re committed to ‘food with integrity’; we actually have to help the whole system,” Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol told USA TODAY, speaking of the company's food standards. “It’s not going to just be enough for us to buy ingredients. I think we have to go a step further.”\n\nNiccol, who moved from the top job at Taco Bell to Chipotle in early 2018 when the brand was still reeling from a slew of food-safety issues, including outbreaks of E. coli and norovirus, said that more young farmers are needed.\n\nThis week, the company will hold its first Farmer Friday to support the National Young Farmers Coalition nonprofit.

The data released, last April, shows farmers over 65 outnumber farmers under 35 by a ratio of 6.41 to 1.\n\nSophie Ackoff, co-executive director of the National Young Farmers Coalition, which formed 10 years ago to provide a voice for young people in agriculture, said the dwindling of farming youths has been a trend since the 1980s.\n\n“If farmers aren’t succeeding now and the industry is aging out and retiring, who is going to grow the food?” Ackoff said. “Chipotle making this kind of move sends a real signal and sets a precedent that I hope other companies will see and hopefully respond to.”\n\nChallenges for young farmers include getting financing and access to land, Ackoff said.\n\nOver the last five years, the agriculture industry has lost 40 times more farmers than it gained and more than half of farms lost money in 2018, said Chris Brandt, Chipotle's chief marketing officer.\n\n“Real food needs real farms and what we discovered was that real farms need real help,” Brandt said. “We think that the family farm is the backbone of America and it’s really critical for all the local ingredients that we’re trying to buy across the country as well.”\n\nChipotle stresses fresh ingredients\n\nLast year, 29 million pounds of all produce purchased last year was grown locally, according to the 2018 Sustainability Report.\n\nWednesday’s announcement by Chipotle is an extension of support for farmers, and the company is also committing to increase its local sourcing across the country in 2020, Brandt said.\n\n\"We’re trying to raise attention to this problem a little more and we’re stepping up our financial commitment to help these young farmers get started,\" Brandt said. \"When you support locally, everybody feels good about that local support and it keeps the money locally and it keeps those businesses and towns viable.\"\n\nAnother part of Chipotle's commitment is inking three-year contracts with farmers, which should help them get financing.\n\nThe move is expected to harvest some goodwill with consumers who are increasingly turning more to whole foods.\n\nDavid Portalatin, vice president and food industry adviser of The NPD Group, said young consumers are pursuing a \"path to purity.\"\n\n\"They want foods that are perceived as natural and minimally processed,” Portalatin said. “Long gone are the days when healthy food was defined as low fat, low sugar or 'free from.' Today, healthy food is more likely to be defined as just natural, authentic wholesome food.”\n\nChipotle's comeback\n\nIn October, Chipotle reported 11% comparable restaurant sales growth, including 7.5% transaction growth. Digital sales grew 88% year-over-year, and since the March debut of the company's new rewards program, it has amassed 7 million members.\n\nAt a time when stores and other restaurants are closing locations, Chipotle is expanding. The company plans to open 140 to 155 stores in the current fiscal year, and another 150 to 165 in its next fiscal year.\n\nQuarterly earnings led many analysts to call the growth a comeback.\n\nBut to Niccol, who has been at Chipotle for 21 months, it's about getting back to the company's core values.\n\n“We’re just getting started on what Chipotle can be in three, five, 10 years from now,” he said. “We’re going to be much bigger than we are today and the thing I love about that is with our growth comes our ability to do more on our purpose of cultivating a better world.”\n\nHow Chipotle is helping farmers\n\nAlong with working with the National Young Farmers Coalition, Chipotle is working with its Chipotle Cultivate Foundation to raise money to fund seed grants. It's also calling on consumers to take action.\n\nThis Friday is the first Farmer Friday and $1 from every entrée purchased on the restaurant’s website or app will go towards grants, up to $250,000.\n\nOn Jan. 1, Chipotle will have a “Cultivate the Future of Farming” float in the Rose Parade and will donate $1, up to $250,000, to the coalition for every post on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter using #farmers.\n\nThe chain also is granting three-year contracts for farmers under 40 who meet its food standards starting with beef, pork and dairy.\n\nChipotle leaders hope other restaurants will join the cause.\n\n“We don’t just want this to be a Chipotle initiative,\" Brandt said. \"We hope others follow and would invite any company to join us.”\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/10/29/mcdonalds-dunkin-taco-bell-etc-battle-your-breakfast-bucks/1752641002/", "title": "McDonald's, Dunkin', Taco Bell, etc. battle for your breakfast bucks", "text": "Your new breakfast of champions likely comes in a fast-food wrapper.\n\nMorning is the new hot time for the super-competitive, quick-service restaurants, who each want to entice hungry, possible groggy, customers.

U.S. fast-food restaurants had close to 41.2 billion visits in the 52 weeks ending in August, including 7.3 billion-plus for breakfast. Those numbers are from up from more than 38.9 billion– almost 6 billion of them breakfast – during the same period in 2009.\n\nThe battle for breakfast is in full force. Chains from Sonic to Starbucks have been growing their morning-inspired menus. Plus, those already deeply invested in the morning continue to push the breakfast angle, from the limited-time Dunkin’ All You Can Meat breakfast sandwich (egg and cheese croissant with two strips of bacon, two slices of ham and a sausage patty) to name-changing IHOP’s return to its pancake roots this summer.\n\n\"Companies have focused for so long on changes in lunch and dinner – your typical burger and chicken nugget options – that they haven't spent so much time innovating on breakfast,\" said Ernest Baskin, an assistant professor of food marketing at St. Joseph's University. \"They are viewing it as white space, where they can introduce new things at relatively little additional costs.\"\n\nBreakfast isn't always so bucolic, though. Wendy's attempt failed and even a morning move faces potential problems due to increased staffing and adding complexity – in the form of more ingredients and menu choices – to kitchens that are supposed to be fast.\n\nWhen done right, though, breakfast provides room to grow sales and customer traffic, which pleases Wall Street.\n\n\"Lunch is historically the sweet spot for fast-food restaurants, and lunch is under attack,\" said Portalatin, pointing to the growing number of telecommuters and flex-time employees and the rise of the on-demand workforce. \"The traditional notions of place and working patterns (have changed), so demand for fast-food lunch simply isn’t there.\"\n\nHere are four reasons breakfast may become the most important meal of the day for many fast-food chains.\n\nEasy menu modifications\n\nUnlike your grandma's blueberry muffins, fast-food breakfast menus aren't made from scratch. In most cases, chains' morning food line-ups are simply riffs on their pre-existing lunch and dinner offerings. Companies reverse-engineer breakfast dishes, using ingredients and core menu items. Add an egg here; toss some fruit there.\n\n\"In most cases, they’re using products already have in their restaurants to create new sandwiches or tweak them here or there. They try not to bring in more products,\" said Peter Saleh, restaurant analyst at the financial-services firm BTIG. \"In some cases, they try to scale thing backs (like) lower calorie counts and egg whites only.\"\n\nConvenience is key\n\nMost people have Garfield-esque feelings toward mornings: They hate them. The universal craziness of the a.m. rush to get to work can be alleviated slightly by sidling up to a restaurant and having your breakfast handed to you. Shaving a few minutes off that go-go-go period for a few bucks means the difference between a granola bar stuffed into a briefcase and a hot sandwich.\n\nNPD's Portalatin called it a \"genius invention.\"\n\n\"A breakfast sandwich provides the perfect, tidy little hand-held package of protein and carbs,\" he said. \"I can have it and call it a snack or pair with fries and fruit and coffee and call it breakfast, or I can have two breakfast sandwiches and not spend that much more.\"\n\nIt's OK to toss the toaster\n\nGoing out for lunch and dinner has been the norm for so long, but turning to restaurants for breakfast is, for many, still a no-no, save for the occasional weekend brunch. Now, bought breakfasts are gaining acceptance, a trend with roots in a key part of the morning meal – a cup of caffeine.\n\n\"You can trace bit back to the coffee business,\" Baskin said. \"A lot of people made coffee on their own. Now, people have transitioned, and coffee is easy to get to go.\"\n\nBreakfast on the go is now a given for those coveted young customers ages 18 to 34. Thirty-three percent eat their weekday breakfast en route to another location, according to Technomic. Plus, this group eats a fast-food breakfast an average of 4.3 times a month, compared to 3.7 times for consumers ages 35 and up.\n\nA built-in fan base\n\n\"If you like X, why not try Y?\" is a textbook way to get customers to come back. For companies that serve traditional later-day foods, like burgers, a strong pitch to their p.m. regulars strikes a chord.\n\nWhile the tabs might not be high as they are for lunch and dinner, breakfast screams out for complementary add-ons, like coffee.\n\nThat's someone like Jesse Wilson of Fulton, New York, who eats at Taco Bell three times a week, including once for breakfast.\n\n\"I discovered Taco Bell breakfast maybe a year ago, and I just love it. It tastes great,\" said the 28-year-old salesman, who spends about $8.50 for a sausage Breakfast Crunchwrap or a steak Breakfast Quesadilla, plus a drink. \"It’s a deviation from a bowl of cereal or oatmeal in the morning\" at home.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Zlati Meyer on Twitter: @ZlatiMeyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "Premarket stocks: Fast food prices are jumping.

That means that if a steak burrito cost $8 this time in 2021, it’s now $8.80.\n\nIt’s not the only fast food option to get more expensive. McDonald’s (MCD) increased its menu prices by about 6% last year, while Starbucks (SBUX) hiked prices in October and again in January.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t hit sales. Chipotle reported revenue of $2 billion for the final three months of 2021, beating expectations. Comparable restaurant sales climbed more than 15%. Shares of the company are up 6.5% in premarket trading.\n\n“We’re pretty fortunate with the pricing power that we have,” CEO Brian Niccol said in an interview with CNBC. “Our brand is really strong.” He noted a chicken burrito is still less than $8 in most US markets.\n\nEating out has been a significant component of surging inflation. Food away from home got about 6% more expensive last year, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nDriving the increase: Companies like Chipotle have had to pay workers a lot more to combat staff shortages. In May, the company increased the pay of its restaurant workers to an average of $15 per hour. Ingredients and transporting goods have also become more expensive.\n\nThese factors aren’t expected to dissipate any time soon. Food commodity prices have jumped 6% so far this year, according to Goldman Sachs. And workers continue to be in the driver’s seat as demand for labor stays high.\n\n“We continue to see pressure on wages,” Niccol said on a call with analysts. “We want to make sure that we continue to be competitive on that front.”\n\nWith this in mind, restaurant executives are telling Wall Street they expect price hikes to continue.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) CEO Kevin Johnson told analysts last week that the company has “additional pricing actions planned through the balance of this year” in order to “mitigate cost pressures.”\n\nNiccol also indicated additional price rises are on the table at Chipotle.\n\n“Beef and freight and some of these other things that continue to stay elevated, if we don’t see it abate, we’ll have to take some additional pricing there,” he said.\n\nChipotle’s chief financial officer said they “keep thinking that beef is going to level off and then go down,” but “it just hasn’t happened yet.”\n\nOn the radar: The latest data on US consumer inflation arrives tomorrow. Climbing food prices — both inside and out of the home — are likely to be a big part of the story.\n\nAnd while economists expect inflation to decline in the second half of the year, as central banks pull back support for the economy, executives in the restaurant industry don’t sound like they’re expecting much to change, at least for the time being.\n\nOmicron is hurting demand for Lyft rides\n\nAfter years of burning cash, Lyft (LYFT) is trimming its losses. The ride-sharing company lost $1 billion last year, compared to $1.8 billion in 2020. On an adjusted basis, Lyft (LYFT) posted its first-ever full-year profit, a key milestone for investors.\n\nSo why is Lyft’s stock down 4% in premarket trading?\n\nWhen reporting its latest earnings after markets closed on Tuesday, the company warned that its current quarter will be affected by the Omicron variant.\n\nPreviously, it had expected a “strong” increase in ridership during the first quarter. Now it thinks rides will be “down slightly,” hurting revenue.\n\n“Ultimately, given the expected impact of Omicron on [the first quarter] and the unknown shape of the recovery, which could carry into [the second quarter], our near-term revenue growth acceleration will likely be affected,” CEO Logan Green told analysts.\n\nGreen said he expects demand to recover now that the wave of Omicron infections in the United States appears to have peaked, however.\n\n“In the last week of January, we saw a pickup in rideshare rides that we see as a positive signal,” he said.\n\nInvestor insight: Even though Lyft’s finances are improving, Wall Street has remained skeptical. Shares fell 13% last year, compared to a 27% rise in the S&P 500. They’re down almost 4% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin is four times more volatile than gold\n\nBitcoin has gained 15% so far this month after a dismal December and January. But based on its ongoing swings, mainstream investors are unlikely to get too excited.\n\n“The biggest challenge for bitcoin going forward is its volatility and the boom and bust cycles that hinder further institutional adoption,” JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note to clients published this week.\n\nThere’s been lots of chatter in investment circles about bitcoin becoming a form of “digital gold,” since it’s an asset that theoretically could retain its value even if stocks and bonds drop and can therefore help diversify portfolios.\n\nBut bitcoin is currently about four times as volatile as the yellow metal. Based on this calculation, Panigirtzoglou puts bitcoin’s “fair value” — the best estimate of its price based on market conditions — at $38,000, below its current price near $44,000.\n\nIn the longer term, if investors do start to treat bitcoin like gold, JPMorgan thinks its value could rise to $150,000.\n\nBut that’s a while away. For the time being, bitcoin’s ebbs and flows remain closely correlated with the stock market, Panigirtzoglou notes. And its rockiness compared to other assets is likely to keep some would-be buyers away.\n\nUp next\n\nCVS (CVS), Fox Corporation (FOXA), MSG Entertainment (MSG) and Canopy Growth (CGC) report results before US markets open.

I spoke about this publicly. The head coach came over to me and said there had been an order from above to remove me.”\n\nBelarusian state television immediately attacked Tsimanouskaya, claiming that she “lacked team spirit”, while officials came to her room telling her she had an hour to pack her bags and fly home, according to a video posted in the messaging app Telegram.\n\nIn a leaked call between Tsimanouskaya and a Belarusian sports official, a man can be heard telling the sprinter that she should fly home and remain silent, adding that if she refuses “you’ll be like a fly in a spiderweb – the more you wriggle, the more stuck you become”. Tsimanouskaya is heard bursting into tears at the threat.\n\n“They are trying to get me out of the country without my permission,” she said in the message posted on the channel of the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation (BSSF), a group set up to support Belarusian athletes during last year’s protests against President Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nOn arriving at Tokyo airport, she “summoned Japanese police and refused to board the flight to Minsk via Istanbul”, Sky News says. Activists supporting her have said that “she believed her life was in danger in Belarus and she would seek asylum with the Austrian Embassy in Tokyo”.\n\nThe head of the BSSF, three-time Olympic swimming medallist Aliaksandra Herasimenia, told Reuters that Poland’s consulate was “the first to react” after the group “appealed to a number of countries for help”, adding: “We are ready to accept their help.”\n\nThe Belarusian National Olympic Committee has been asked “for a full report” into the issue, says The Guardian.\n\n‘She feels safe’\n\nA spokesperson for the IOC said that they had been in contact with Tsimanouskaya, tweeting that a member of IOC staff had accompanied her during her stay at an airport hotel overnight and that “she feels safe”.\n\nHowever, the Belarusian authorities’ clash with Tsimanouskaya is not the first time the autocratic regime has found itself at loggerheads with its sporting community.\n\nAmid anti-government protests last year, the Lukashenko government “unleashed a wave of unprecedented repressions against opposition supporters” leading to “over 4,000 criminal investigations into extremism or terrorism, which are the charges that the government typically uses against dissidents”, The Telegraph reports.\n\nLukashenko, who formerly headed the country’s Olympic committee before he was replaced by his son Viktor, has also been “banned from the Tokyo Games after the IOC received complaints from athletes about intimidation and reprisals”, Sky News says.\n\nDuring the pro-democracy protests last year, Tsimanouskaya spoke out on Instagram against the “brutal crackdown”, The Telegraph says.

Though that decision likely came as a surprise to Nike investors, the real news is who's replacing Parker. Nike is turning to a career tech executive, John Donahoe, to be just the third leader in its history.\n\nDonahoe has served on Nike's board since 2014 and is the current CEO of ServiceNow, an enterprise cloud-computing company whose shares fell 9% after hours on the news. While Nike may have little in common with a cloud company, Donahoe also served as CEO of eBay from 2008 to 2015 and is the current chairman of Paypal Holdings, making him a seasoned executive in online retail and payments. Parker will stay on as executive chairman.\n\nPopeye's Q3 sales boom amid chicken sandwich craze:Impossible Whopper boosts Burger King\n\nDoubling down on digital\n\nNike's made no secret of its aspirations in digital as it sees technology as the key to innovation, speeding up production, and reaching more customers more quickly. Parker explained the move, saying of Donahoe, \"His expertise in digital commerce, technology, global strategy and leadership combined with his strong relationship with the brand, make him ideally suited to accelerate our digital transformation and to build on the positive impact of our Consumer Direct Offense.\"\n\nThe consumer direct offense has become Nike's core strategic framework and is the primary reason the stock has nearly doubled since the company announced the initiative in 2017, which promised to double the company's speed, innovations and connections with customers.\n\nNike increasingly sees its future in the digital marketplace, driven by apps like SNKRS and its own Nike app, as well as through its website. In the company's most recent quarter, digital sales jumped 42% as the company continues to shift away from its traditional wholesale business with brick-and-mortar retail chains. On the earnings call, Nike repeatedly talked up its digital transformation.\n\nLast quarter, it acquired Celect, a demand forecasting firm, to add data science and cloud-based analytics to its capabilities in finding customers and meeting their needs. COO Eric Splunk explained the move, saying: \"As demand for our product grows, we must be insight-driven, data-optimized and hyper-focused on consumer behavior. This is how we serve consumers more personally at scale.\"\n\nGiven the range of Nike's ambitions in technology, it's not surprising to see the company tap someone like Donahoe, who can guide its digital strategy in areas like retail, marketing and innovation, along with leveraging assets like Celect to give the company a competitive advantage.\n\nStay prepared:3 retirement expenses you may not be planning for\n\nA proven track\n\nNike isn't the only consumer-facing company to look to the ranks of the tech world for a new leader. In 2016, Starbucks said Kevin Johnson would replace Howard Schultz, the coffee chain's longtime chief, as CEO. Johnson had served as Starbucks' COO since 2015 but prior to that had been the CEO of Juniper Networks and an executive at Microsoft. Like Nike, Starbucks has increasingly built the future of its business around technology, investing in its app, rewards program, mobile order and pickup, and delivery. Since Johnson took the helm, Starbucks shares are up 43%, and the company has posted strong growth in recent quarters.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill has also found success under a tech-focused CEO. Brian Niccol took over the burrito chain while it was in turmoil following a series of food-safety scandals. His focus on the company's app, digital ordering and delivery has helped the stock triple since he was named as CEO.\n\nParker is going out on a high note, as Nike stock is at an all-time high and the consumer direct offense has been a success. Nike isn't in need of a turnaround, but a CEO fluent in technology can help the company extend its lead over the competition and guide innovation for the next generation of digitally native customers.\n\nDonahoe will take over in January.\n\nTeresa Kersten, an employee of LinkedIn, a Microsoft subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

But they still want customers to feel like they’re getting a good deal.\n\nThat’s a tricky proposal, especially for fast food, fast casual and casual dining restaurants — places where low prices are part of the appeal.\n\nTake, for example, Applebee’s and IHOP, owned by Dine Brands.\n\n“Both of our brands are value brands, and that’s particularly important right now,” said Dine Brands (DIN) CEO John Peyton during a March analyst call.\n\nThat means franchisees are walking “a tight rope … maintaining value for our customers as well as protecting their margins.” IHOP and Applebee’s franchise operators raised prices between three and four percent last year. Usually, those prices go up somewhere between one and three percent annually.\n\nRestaurants like Applebee's are focusing on value as they raise prices. John Nacion/StarMax/AP\n\nSo how do you raise prices and still convince customers that your food is cheap?\n\nRestaurants hope that customers take more than absolute price into account when they decide where to eat. They might, for example, consider the restaurant’s ambiance, or the amount of food they’re getting for their buck. And they might swallow higher prices at one of their go-to restaurants because those prices are still lower than a competitor’s.\n\nAs the situation evolves, customers might want to do some comparison shopping to try to make sure they’re not paying too much.\n\nPrice versus value\n\nBrands hope that as prices go up, consumers will make their own calculations — and find that all things considered, the prices are still pretty good.\n\nAt Applebee’s, the “value equation … is so much more than price,” Applebee’s president John Cywinski told CNN Business in a recent interview. “It’s the food, it’s the experience, the packaging [if you get something to-go]” he said. “You can get, for a pretty good price, that Applebee’s experience.”\n\nSome places, like Domino’s (DPZ), are taking a more surgical approach, raising prices on some items while keeping others low.\n\nOn March 14, Domino’s increased the price of its classic “mix and match” deal by one dollar, from $5.99 to $6.99 — but only on delivery orders. For carryout, the deal is still priced at $5.99.\n\n“We believe that $6.99 is still a great relative value for our delivery customers, offering variety, great taste and a competitive price,” outgoing CEO Ritch Allison said during a March analyst call.\n\nMaintaining the $5.99 price point for carryout serves a double purpose: Giving customers the lower-cost option that they’re used to, and encouraging them to pick food up, rather than get it delivered. Carryout is a more cost effective option for restaurants.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI), which owns Olive Garden, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen and other restaurants, also hopes that customers will see its prices as relatively affordable, even as they grow, because the price increases are relatively tame.\n\n“We’re going to continue to look for opportunities to price below inflation,” said CFO Rajesh Vennam during a recent analyst call. Darden’s leaders mentioned that Olive Garden is still less expensive than other full-service restaurants.\n\nInviting customers to compare prices to the competition is a good strategy for major companies that can keep prices low.\n\nBut it can also prompt customers to shake things up. And they should — it’s a good time to look around and make sure that your go-to bargain spot is still actually a bargain.\n\nIt’s all relative\n\nChipotle (CMG) raised its prices about 10% last year. But, CEO Brian Niccol argued during a February analyst call, Chipotle (CMG)’s food is a good deal even with higher prices. “The chicken burrito, for most parts of the country, is still less than $8,” he said. “That’s phenomenal value.”\n\nConsumers may well buy that argument.\n\nIf a product “was 99 cents when everything else was $2, And now it’s $1.99, when everything else is $4 — the same relative price is true,” said Mark Bergen, James D. Watkins Chair in Marketing at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson management school.\n\nChipotle raised prices about 10% last year. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBefore the pandemic, consumers may have had go-to places for the best deal. But a lot has changed since then — and not all in the same way.\n\n“Different companies have different pressures and cost structures,” said Bergen. “It may turn out that Chipotle was the great deal before. But [now] there’s another company that’s a much better deal because of their supply chain or the way they do business.”\n\nBergen pointed out that while prices are rising, not every item is being impacted in the same way.\n\n“Inflation is not a monolith,” he said. A glance at the Consumer Price Index, a key measure of inflation, offers a good example of how prices fluctuate even within a category.\n\nOverall, food at home got about 8% more expensive over the 12-month period that ended in February, without seasonal adjustments. But some categories saw smaller bumps, and other larger ones.\n\nThe price of cheese, for example, went up about 2%. Bacon, on the other hand, went up nearly 19%. So while all companies are dealing with higher prices, not all are necessarily facing the same pressures.\n\nConsumers may be forgiving about price hikes during inflation. But we’re also paying attention to that sticker price, noted Bergen.\n\n“We as consumers tend to experience the absolute prices,” he said. “I think there will be some pushback.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/08/14/evenings-starbucks-coffee-shop-sell-wine-craft-beer-small-plates/31713183/", "title": "'Evenings' at Starbucks: Coffee shop to sell wine, craft beer, small ...", "text": "NEW YORK — After several years of cautiously testing the viability of selling beverages stiffer than a double shot of espresso, Starbucks is accelerating its effort to sell wine and craft beer in its U.S. stores.\n\nThe push goes into high gear this week. The company on Wednesday will begin selling wine and beer, along with the sale of small plates such as bacon-wrapped dates and truffle mac ‘n cheese, at two dozen new locations across the U.S., Starbucks officials told USA TODAY.\n\nThe coffee giant has also submitted liquor license applications for several hundred more locations throughout the country in recent months and is optimistic that it will have many of those stores selling beer and wine by the end the year, said Rachel Antalek, vice president of concept innovations and Starbucks sommelier.\n\n“We learned resoundingly that our customers want to come to Starbucks and have a glass of wine or a craft beer,” Antalek said in an interview at a company store in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, which will sell adult beverages this week. “There aren’t that many places to go in the evening where you can go very relaxed, very casual. It’s not loud. You can actually have a small group and hear yourself talk.”\n\nOnce the new locations roll out this week, Starbucks will have more than 70 locations selling wine and beer. The coffee chain said this new wave of stores joining what it calls “Evenings” marks an inflection point in a push toward a concept company executives project will reap $1 billion in additional annual sales by 2019.\n\nThe ramp up starts in Denver, Miami, Orlando and Northern California markets, as well as a recently-opened, 2,900 square foot location here in Brooklyn, a store that Starbucks officials think can be an incubator for ideas as the company goes all-in on its bet that Americans want the option of a glass of wine or bottle of beer at the place best known for supplying a caffeine fix.\n\nThe company first announced in 2010 that it would experiment with wine, craft beer and small plates at a few stores as it sought to boost traffic after 4 p.m., when sales tended to slow down. Stores in Washington state, Oregon, Los Angeles, Chicago, Florida, and Atlanta markets were the first to test beer and wine.\n\nStarbucks fans = Wine fans?\n\nStarbucks waded carefully into Evenings as some industry analysts questioned whether Americans were interested in buying adult beverages at the same place they get their morning cappuccino. Company officials said they also considered the concerns of their skeptical devotees who worried their beloved coffee shops would transform into bars.\n\nAfter nearly five years of experimenting with the concept, the company said it is confident that it is on to something. In the months ahead, patrons of the coffee chain will see Evenings pop up nearly everywhere as Starbucks introduces the concept in more than 2,000 of its more than 12,000 U.S. stores.\n\nWhen Starbucks launched Evenings, Antalek said company officials believed that they would be able to draw strong interest. Internal data showed about 70% of Starbucks patrons also drink wine. About 31% of Americans who drink alcohol say they prefer wine, according to a 2014 Gallup survey.\n\nAs the pilot stores rolled out, Starbucks officials were surprised at times by the level of interest and how patrons were using the program.\n\nAntalek said from the start she has thought the program could be a winner with women, who she suggested would see Starbucks as a safer and more inviting option to meet friends during evening hours than a bar. The hunch proved largely true, with women accounting for 60% of Evenings patrons, according to the company. Pilot stores found serving wine helped the stores attract book clubs, knitting circles and even the occasional Bible study that would have otherwise taken place at someone’s house, the company said. Managers at the pilots have also noted that the wine and beer menu has drawn a surprising number of online daters meeting for the first time.\n\nThe push by quick service restaurants into alcohol sales isn’t new. Burger King launched the BK Whopper Bar concept more than five years ago, opening several locations where patrons could buy a bottle of beer to wash down their burger. Sonic has tested beer and wine sales to patrons eating at the fast food chains patio at some locations. And Taco Bell recently announced plans to test spiked freezes, beer and wine at locations in Chicago and San Francisco.\n\nBut none of those restaurants have gone beyond selling booze at a few locations.\n\n“There’s consumer demand, but we’ll see how it goes for us,” Taco Bell CEO Brian Niccol told USA TODAY of his chain's soon-to-be launched experiment. “I am very interested to see how it goes for Starbucks. For us, it’s got to be something that goes great with our food.”\n\nBeer and wine drives new design\n\nWith the move into beer and wine, Starbucks has also reconsidered the design of its stores, which company officials say should reflect their community.\n\nWith the Williamsburg store, which sits just blocks from the East River, the company wanted to give a nod to the area’s shipbuilding and manufacturing past while also reflecting the current aesthetic of one of New York’s chicest neighborhoods, said Claudia Woods, a senior store designer for Starbucks.\n\nThe exposed brick walls are decorated with original installations from artists from Brooklyn and Seattle (where Starbucks is headquartered). Among the works is an installation by Brooklyn’s Susan Weinthaler made from found furniture legs that are covered in text from the novel “Moby Dick,\" and mural from Seattle tattoo artist Kyler Martz that depicts the Starbucks’ siren and the Williamsburg Bridge.\n\nWoods said as the Evenings program expands the company’s designers are also paying an increased attention on the types of seating in the store.\n\n“It’s becoming really important for us to have different types of seating that can be used by our customers throughout the day,” Woods said. “As it becomes evening, the lounge seating is more important, and I think having areas for larger groups. We always make sure we have community tables where people can sit together and have a glass of wine and have a conversation.”\n\nStarbucks tapped the expertise of its coffee quality team to help pull together a small group of sensory experts to evaluate more than 500 wines, who then winnowed the list down to 10 wines that they determined would suit their customers.\n\nCustomers, who are served by baristas, said they wanted to continue to pick up their drinks at the counter in the same way they pick up their coffee drinks, Antalek said. To help avoid spills, the company decided to go with stemless glassware. The baristas also fill a ramekin with salt and cayenne dusted pepitas that fits over the lip of the wine glass – a small touch that Antalek said they hope will help make the Evenings experience memorable.\n\n”It’s a different occasion for the customer and what they need from us is different in the evening,” Antalek said.\n\nWith both the wine and beer options, Starbucks says it will try to stay local – in Oregon the menu includes wine from the Willamette Valley, the soon-to-launched program in Brooklyn will sell beers from the nearby Brooklyn Brewery, and Chicago’s menu includes beer from the city’s Goose Island brewery.\n\nThe baristas, who are trained to speak with customers in depth about the flavor profiles of Starbucks coffee beans, are now schooled in wine and beer so they can help direct their customers to something that fits their tastes. Brandon Giles, the store manager of Williamsburg, said having a coffee vocabulary is making beer- and wine-speak easy to pick up for the baristas.\n\n“I think their biggest concern is being sure that we’re able to meet individual customer’s needs in the moment,” Giles said.\n\nFollow Aamer Madhani on Twitter: @AamerISmad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/14"}]}

He also co-founded free online dating platform OkCupid in 2011.\n\nThe OpenAI bosses’ stated aim is “to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) – by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work – benefits all of humanity”. OpenAI’s “primary fiduciary duty is to humanity”, they emphasise in the company charter.\n\nThis charter is “so sacred that employees’ pay is tied to how well they adhere to it”, said MIT Technology Review’s AI editor Karen Hao. Although “the purpose is not world domination”, she wrote, “AGI could be catastrophic without the careful guidance of a benevolent shepherd”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nOpenAI promotes itself as this shepherd and said the company was created as a non-profit in order to “build value for everyone rather than shareholders”. In a statement announcing the launch back in 2015, OpenAI also vowed to “freely collaborate with others across many institutions” and to “work with companies to research and deploy new technologies”.\n\nDoes OpenAI live up to its claims?\n\nAn investigation by MIT Technology Review uncovered “a misalignment between what the company publicly espouses and how it operates behind closed doors”, according to Hao. Former and current employees – many of whom reportedly “insisted on anonymity because they were not authorised to speak or feared retaliation” – were said to have portrayed a company “obsessed with maintaining secrecy, protecting its image, and retaining the loyalty of its employees”.\n\nEven Musk has criticised OpenAI after quitting the board of directors 2018, a decision that the company said was to “eliminate potential future conflict” with the AI goals of Tesla.\n\nIn 2020, Musk tweeted that his confidence in OpenAI was “not high” when it came to safety. “OpenAI should be more open imo,” he wrote in response to MIT Technology Review’s investigation.\n\nIn a Twitter post shortly after the launch of ChatGPT, he wrote: “Need to understand more about governance structure & revenue plans going forward. OpenAI was started as open-source & non-profit. Neither are still true.”\n\nAre there any other issues with ChatGPT?\n\nPlenty, according to Gizmodo. The technology threatens to “kill the college essay and lead to other academic dysfunction”, “make human writers obsolete”, “generate factually inaccurate news articles (already happened)” and “cause a disinformation typhoon”. Concerns have also been raised that the easily accessible AI system could “democratise cybercrime” and help to “fuel easy malware creation”, said the site, as well as “get loads of people fired”.\n\nOpenAI has faced further criticism after Time magazine reported that the company “used outsourced Kenyan labourers earning less than $2 per hour to make the chatbot less toxic”. Workers allegedly said there were “mentally scarred” after sifting through graphic images and disturbing text from the dark web to help build a tool to help build a tool that tags problematic content.\n\nAfter the contractor cancelled the deal early, OpenAI insisted that “we take the mental health of our employees and those of our contractors very seriously”.\n\nBut the Partnership on AI, a coalition of AI organisations to which OpenAI belongs, told Time that “despite the foundational role played by these data enrichment professionals, a growing body of research reveals the precarious working conditions these workers face”.\n\n“This may be the result of efforts to hide AI’s dependence on this large labour force when celebrating the efficiency gains of technology,” the coalition said. “Out of sight is also out of mind.”", "authors": ["Asya Likhtman", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Peter Weber", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "Devika Rao", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Theara Coleman"], "publish_date": "2023/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/tech/artists-ai-images/index.html", "title": "These artists found out their work was used to train AI. Now they're ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nErin Hanson has spent years developing the vibrant color palette and chunky brushstrokes that define the vivid oil paintings for which she is known. But during a recent interview with her, I showed Hanson my attempts to recreate her style with just a few keystrokes.\n\nUsing Stable Diffusion, a popular and publicly available open-source AI image generation tool, I had plugged in a series of prompts to create images in the style of some of her paintings of California poppies on an ocean cliff and a field of lupin.\n\n“That one with the purple flowers and the sunset,” she said via Zoom, peering at one of my attempts, “definitely looks like one of my paintings, you know?”\n\nWith Hanson’s guidance, I then tailored another detailed prompt: “Oil painting of crystal light, in the style of Erin Hanson, light and shadows, backlit trees, strong outlines, stained glass, modern impressionist, award-winning, trending on ArtStation, vivid, high-definition, high-resolution.” I fed the prompt to Stable Diffusion; within seconds it produced three images.\n\n“Oh, wow,” she said as we pored over the results, pointing out how similar the trees in one image looked to the ones in her 2021 painting “Crystalline Maples.” “I would put that on my wall,” she soon added.\n\nAn image created by CNN's Rachel Metz with input from artist Erin Hanson, using the AI platform Stable Diffusion. It resembles Hanson's work, particularly with its colors and simulated brush strokes. AI Image/Stable Diffusion\n\nHanson, who’s based in McMinnville, Oregon, is one of many professional artists whose work was included in the data set used to train Stable Diffusion, which was released in August by London-based Stability AI. She’s one of several artists interviewed by CNN Business who were unhappy to learn that pictures of their work were used without someone informing them, asking for consent, or paying for their use.\n\nOnce available only to a select group of tech insiders, text-to-image AI systems are becoming increasingly popular and powerful. These systems include Stable Diffusion, from a company that recently raised more than $100 million in funding, and DALL-E, from a company that has raised $1 billion to date.\n\nThese tools, which typically offer some free credits before charging, can create all kinds of images with just a few words, including those that are clearly evocative of the works of many, many artists (if not seemingly created by the same artist). Users can invoke those artists with words such as “in the style of” or “by” along with a specific name. And the current uses for these tools can range from personal amusement to more commercial cases.\n\nIn just months, millions of people have flocked to text-to-image AI systems and they are already being used to create experimental films, magazine covers and images to illustrate news stories. An image generated with an AI system called Midjourney recently won an art competition at the Colorado State Fair, and caused an uproar among artists.\n\n\"Crystalline Maples\", a 2021 oil painting by Erin Hanson. Courtesy Erin Hanson\n\nBut as artists like Hanson have discovered that their work is being used to train AI, it raises an even more fundamental concern: that their own art is effectively being used to train a computer program that could one day cut into their livelihoods. Anyone who generates images with systems such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E can then sell them (the specific terms regarding copyright and ownership of these images varies).\n\n“I don’t want to participate at all in the machine that’s going to cheapen what I do,” said Daniel Danger, an illustrator and print maker who learned a number of his works were used to train Stable Diffusion.\n\nWhen fine art becomes data\n\nThe machines are far from magic. For one of these systems to ingest your words and spit out an image, it must be trained on mountains of data, which may include billions of images scraped from the internet, paired with written descriptions.\n\nSome services, including OpenAI’s DALL-E system, don’t disclose the datasets behind their AI systems. But with Stable Diffusion, Stability AI is clear about its origins. Its core dataset was trained on image and text pairs that were curated for their looks from an even more massive cache of images and text from the internet. The full-size dataset, known as LAION-5B was created by the German AI nonprofit LAION, which stands for “large-scale artificial intelligence open network.”\n\nThis practice of scraping images or other content from the internet for dataset training isn’t new, and traditionally falls under what’s known as “fair use” — the legal principle in US copyright law that allows for the use of copyright-protected work in some situations. That’s because those images, many of which may be copyrighted, are being used in a very different way, such as for training a computer to identify cats.\n\nBut datasets are getting larger and larger, and training ever-more-powerful AI systems, including, recently, these generative ones that anyone can use to make remarkable looking images in an instant.\n\nA piece by illustrator Daniel Danger that was included in the training data behind the Stable Diffusion AI image generator. Courtesy Daniel Danger\n\nA few tools let anyone search through the LAION-5B dataset, and a growing number of professional artists are discovering their work is part of it. One of these search tools, built by writer and technologist Andy Baio and programmer Simon Willison, stands out. While it can only be used to search a small fraction of Stable Diffusion’s training data (more than 12 million images), its creators analyzed the art imagery within it and determined that, of the top 25 artists whose work was represented, Hanson was one of just three who is still alive. They found 3,854 images of her art included in just their small sampling.\n\nStability AI founder and CEO Emad Mostaque told CNN Business via email that art is a tiny fraction of the LAION training data behind Stable Diffusion. “Art makes up much less than 0.1% of the dataset and is only created when deliberately called by the user,” he said.\n\nBut that’s slim comfort to some artists.\n\nAngry artists\n\nDanger, whose artwork includes posters for bands like Phish and Primus, is one of several professional artists who told CNN Business they worry that AI image generators could threaten their livelihoods.\n\nHe is concerned that the images people produce with AI image generators could replace some of his more “utilitarian” work, which includes media like book covers and illustrations for articles published online.\n\n“Why are we going to pay an artist $1,000 when we can have 1,000 [images] to pick from for free?” he asked. “People are cheap.”\n\nTara McPherson, a Pittsburgh-based artist whose work is featured on toys, clothing and in films such as the Oscar-winning “Juno,” is also concerned about the possibility of losing out on some work to AI. She feels disappointed and “taken advantage of” for having her work included in the dataset behind Stable Diffusion without her knowledge, she said.\n\n“How easy is this going to be? How elegant is this art going to become?,” she asked. “Right now it’s a little wonky sometimes but this is just getting started.”\n\nWhile the concerns are real, the recourse is unclear. Even if AI-generated images have a widespread impact — such as by changing business models — it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re violating artists’ copyrights, according to Zahr Said, a law professor at the University of Washington. And it would be prohibitive to license every single image in a dataset before using it, she said.\n\n“You can actually feel really sympathetic for artistic communities and want to support them and also be like, there’s no way,” she said. “If we did that, it would essentially be saying machine learning is impossible.”\n\nMcPherson and Danger mused about the possibility of putting watermarks on their work when posting it online to safeguard the images (or at least make them look less appealing). But McPherson said when she’s seen artist friends put watermarks across their images online it “ruins the art, and the joy of people looking at it and finding inspiration in it.”\n\nIf he could, Danger said he would remove his images from datasets used to train AI systems. But removing pictures of an artist’s work from a dataset wouldn’t stop Stable Diffusion from being able to generate images in that artist’s style.\n\nFor starters, the AI model has already been trained. But also, as Mostaque said, specific artistic styles could still be called on by users because of OpenAI’s CLIP model, which was used to train Stable Diffusion to understand connections between words and images.\n\nChristoph Schuhmann, an LAION founder, said via email that his group thinks that truly enabling opting in and out of datasets will only work if all parts of AI models — of which there can be many — respect those choices.\n\n“A unilateral approach to consent handling will not suffice in the AI world; we need a cross-industry system to handle that,” he said.\n\nOffering artists more control\n\nPartners Mathew Dryhurst and Holly Herndon, Berlin-based artists experimenting with AI in their collaborative work, are working to tackle these challenges. Together with two other collaborators, they have launched Spawning, making tools for artists that they hope will let them better understand and control how their online art is used in datasets.\n\nIn September, Spawning released a search engine that can comb through the LAION-5B dataset, haveibeentrained.com, and in the coming weeks it intends to offer a way for people to opt out or in to datasets used for training. Over the past month or so, Dryhurst said, he’s been meeting with organizations training large AI models. He wants to get them to agree that if Spawning gathers lists of works from artists who don’t want to be included, they’ll honor those requests.\n\nDryhurst said Spawning’s goal is to make it clear that consensual data collection benefits everyone. And Mostaque agrees that people should be able to opt out. He told CNN Business that Stability AI is working with numerous groups on ways to “enable more control of database contents by the community” in the future. In a Twitter thread in September, he said Stability is open to contributing to ways that people can opt out of datasets, “such as by supporting Herndon’s work on this with many other projects to come.”\n\nTara McPherson's \"The Wanderers\" is one of her works that was included in the dataset underpinning Stable Diffusion. Courtesy Tara McPherson\n\n“I personally understand the emotions around this as the systems become intelligent enough to understand styles,” he said in an email to CNN Business.\n\nSchuhmann said LAION is also working with “various groups” to figure out how to let people opt in or out of including their images in training text-to-image AI models. “We take the feelings and concerns of artists very seriously,” Schuhmann said.\n\nHanson, for her part, has no problem with her art being used for training AI, but she wants to be paid. If images are sold that were made with the AI systems trained on their work, artists need to be compensated, she said — even if it’s “fractions of pennies.”\n\nThis could be on the horizon. Mostaque said Stability AI is looking into how “creatives can be rewarded from their work,” particularly as Stability AI itself releases AI models, rather than using those built by others. The company will soon announce a plan to get community feedback on “practical ways” to do this, he said.\n\nTheoretically, I may eventually owe Hanson some money. I’ve run that same “crystal light” prompt on Stable Diffusion many times since we devised it, so many in fact that my laptop is littered with trees in various hues, rainbows of sunlight shining through their branches onto the ground below.

Here's why experts are worried ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA million bears walking on the streets of Hong Kong. A strawberry frog. A cat made out of spaghetti and meatballs.\n\nThese are just a few of the text descriptions that people have fed to cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems in recent weeks, which these systems — notably OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 and Google Research’s Imagen — can use to produce incredibly detailed, realistic-looking images.\n\nThe resulting pictures can be silly, strange, or even reminiscent of classic art, and they’re being shared widely (and sometimes breathlessly) on social media, including by influential figures in the tech community. DALL-E 2 (which is a newer version of a similar, less capable AI system OpenAI rolled out last year) can also edit existing images by adding or taking out objects\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine such on-demand image generation eventually serving as a powerful tool for making all kinds of creative content, whether it be art or ads; DALL-E 2 and a similar such system, Midjourney, have already been used to help create magazine covers. OpenAI and Google have pointed to a few ways the technology might be commercialized, such as for editing images or creating stock images.\n\nNeither DALL-E 2 nor Imagen is currently available to the public. Yet they share an issue with many others that already are: they can also produce disturbing results that reflect the gender and cultural biases of the data on which they were trained — data that includes millions of images pulled from the internet.\n\nAn image created by an AI system called Imagen, built by Google Research. Google\n\nThe bias in these AI systems presents a serious issue, experts told CNN Business. The technology can perpetuate hurtful biases and stereotypes. They’re concerned that the open-ended nature of these systems — which makes them adept at generating all kinds of images from words — and their ability to automate image-making means they could automate bias on a massive scale. They also have the potential to be used for nefarious purposes, such as spreading disinformation.\n\n“Until those harms can be prevented, we’re not really talking about systems that can be used out in the open, in the real world,” said Arthur Holland Michel, a senior fellow at Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs who researches AI and surveillance technologies.\n\nDocumenting bias\n\nAI has become common in everyday life in the past few years but it’s only recently that the public has taken notice — both of how common it is, and how gender, racial, and other types of biases can creep into the technology. Facial-recognition systems in particular have been increasingly scrutinized for concerns about their accuracy and racial bias.\n\nOpenAI and Google Research have acknowledged many of the issues and risks related to their AI systems in documentation and research, with both saying that the systems are prone to gender and racial bias and to depicting Western cultural stereotypes and gender stereotypes.\n\nOpenAI, whose mission is to build so-called artificial general intelligence that benefits all people, included in an online document titled “Risks and limitations” pictures illustrating how text prompts can bring up these issues: A prompt for “nurse”, for instance, resulted in images that all appeared to show stethoscope-wearing females, while one for “CEO” showed images that all appeared to be men and nearly all of them were white.\n\nLama Ahmad, policy research program manager at OpenAI, said researchers are still learning how to even measure bias in AI, and that OpenAI can use what it learns to tweak its AI over time. Ahmad led OpenAI’s efforts to work with a group of outside experts earlier this year to better understand issues within DALL-E 2 and offer feedback so it can be improved.\n\nGoogle declined a request for an interview from CNN Business. In its research paper introducing Imagen, the Google Brain team members behind it wrote that Imagen appears to encode “several social biases and stereotypes, including an overall bias towards generating images of people with lighter skin tones and a tendency for images portraying different professions to align with Western gender stereotypes.”\n\nThe contrast between the images these systems create and the thorny ethical issues is stark for Julie Carpenter, a research scientist and fellow in the Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.\n\n“One of the things we have to do is we have to understand AI is very cool and it can do some things very well. And we should work with it as a partner,” Carpenter said. “But it’s an imperfect thing. It has its limitations. We have to adjust our expectations. It’s not what we see in the movies.”\n\nAn image created by an AI system called DALL-E 2, built by OpenAI. OpenAI\n\nHolland Michel is also concerned that no amount of safeguards can prevent such systems from being used maliciously, noting that deepfakes — a cutting-edge application of AI to create videos that purport to show someone doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say — were initially harnessed to create faux pornography.\n\n“It kind of follows that a system that is orders of magnitude more powerful than those early systems could be orders of magnitude more dangerous,” he said.\n\nHint of bias\n\nBecause Imagen and DALL-E 2 take in words and spit out images, they had to be trained with both types of data: pairs of images and related text captions. Google Research and OpenAI filtered harmful images such as pornography from their datasets before training their AI models, but given the large size of their datasets such efforts are unlikely catch all such content, nor render the AI systems unable to produce harmful results. In its Imagen paper, Google researchers pointed out that, despite filtering some data, they also used a massive dataset that is known to include porn, racist slurs, and “harmful social stereotypes.”\n\nFiltering can also lead to other issues: Women tend to be represented more than men in sexual content, for instance, so filtering out sexual content also reduces the number of women in the dataset, said Ahmad.\n\nAnd truly filtering these datasets for bad content is impossible, Carpenter said, since people are involved in decisions about how to label and delete content — and different people have different cultural beliefs.\n\n“AI doesn’t understand that,” she said.\n\nSome researchers are thinking about how it might be possible to reduce bias in these types of AI systems, but still use them to create impressive images. One possibility is using less, rather than more, data.\n\nAlex Dimakis, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said one method involves starting with a small amount of data — for example, a photo of a cat — and cropping it, rotating it, creating a mirror image of it, and so on, to effectively turn one picture into many different images. (A graduate student Dimakis advises was a contributor to the Imagen research, but Dimakis himself was not involved in the system’s development, he said.)\n\n“This solves some of the problems, but it doesn’t solve other problems,” Dimakis said. The trick on its own won’t make a dataset more diverse, but the smaller scale could let people working with it be more intentional about the images they’re including.\n\nRoyal raccoons\n\nFor now, OpenAI and Google Research are trying to keep the focus on cute pictures and away from images that may be disturbing or show humans.\n\nThere are no realistic-looking images of people in the vibrant sample images on either Imagen’s nor DALL-E 2’s online project page, and OpenAI says on its page that it used “advanced techniques to prevent photorealistic generations of real individuals’ faces, including those of public figures.” This safeguard could prevent users from getting image results for, say, a prompt that attempts to show a specific politician performing some kind of illicit activity.\n\nOpenAI has provided access to DALL-E 2 to thousands of people who signed up to a waitlist since April. Participants must agree to an extensive content policy, which tells users to not try to make, upload, or share pictures “that are not G-rated or that could cause harm.” DALL-E 2 also uses filters to prevent it from generating a picture if a prompt or image upload violates OpenAI’s policies, and users can flag problematic results. In late June, OpenAI started allowing users to post photorealistic human faces created with DALL-E 2 to social media, but only after adding some safety features, such as preventing users from generating images containing public figures.\n\n“Researchers, specifically, I think it’s really important to give them access,” Ahmad said. This is, in part, because OpenAI wants their help to study areas such as disinformation and bias.\n\nGoogle Research, meanwhile, is not currently letting researchers outside the company access Imagen. It has taken requests on social media for prompts that people would like to see Imagen interpret, but as Mohammad Norouzi, a co-author on the Imagen paper, tweeted in May, it won’t show images “including people, graphic content, and sensitive material.”\n\nStill, as Google Research noted in its Imagen paper, “Even when we focus generations away from people, our preliminary analysis indicates Imagen encodes a range of social and cultural biases when generating images of activities, events, and objects.”\n\nA hint of this bias is evident in one of the images Google posted to its Imagen webpage, created from a prompt that reads: “A wall in a royal castle. There are two paintings on the wall. The one on the left a detailed oil painting of the royal raccoon king. The one on the right a detailed oil painting of the royal raccoon queen.”\n\nAn image of \"royal\" raccoons created by an AI system called Imagen, built by Google Research. Google\n\nThe image is just that, with paintings of two crowned raccoons — one wearing what looks like a yellow dress, the other in a blue-and-gold jacket — in ornate gold frames. But as Holland Michel noted, the raccoons are sporting Western-style royal outfits, even though the prompt didn’t specify anything about how they should appear beyond looking “royal.”\n\nEven such “subtle” manifestations of bias are dangerous, Holland Michel said.\n\n“In not being flagrant, they’re really hard to catch,” he said.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/technology/956346/elon-musk-twitter-edit-feature", "title": "Elon Musk and Twitter's edit feature experiment | The Week", "text": "Twitter has announced that it is working on an edit button, but denied that the idea came from the company’s new largest stakeholder Elon Musk.\n\nThe social media giant last night tweeted “we’ve been working on an edit feature since last year”, adding “we didn’t get the idea from a poll” alongside a winking emoji.\n\nThe news that the company is working on the new feature immediately gave rise to rumours that it was Musk’s idea.

Currently users are forced to “work around it by deleting and reposting the tweet”.\n\nTwitter said that it is “kicking off testing” with a selection of people signed up for the company’s subscription product – Twitter Blue – in the coming months.\n\nJay Sullivan, head of consumer product at the social media giant, tweeted: “Edit has been the most requested Twitter feature for many years. People want to be able to fix (sometimes embarrassing) mistakes, typos and hot takes in the moment.\n\n“Without things like time limits, controls, and transparency about what has been edited, Edit could be misused to alter the record of the public conversation,” he said. “Protecting the integrity of that public conversation is our top priority when we approach this work.”\n\nSullivan’s intervention speaks to longstanding concerns about “how to execute” an edit feature on the site where tweets often go viral with hundreds of thousands of retweets, the BBC said. It is expected that the feature will allow users to amend or change tweets “without losing any replies, retweets or likes it has already gained”.\n\nFormer CEO Jack Dorsey has been “​​reluctant to add such a feature in the past”, The Verge reported, citing the concern that it “could let users change a tweet’s meaning after it gets widely shared”. In 2020, he said during a Wired question-and-answer video that the company would “probably never” add the feature.\n\nThe company was keen to state that it was working on the plan before Musk joined the board, BBC North America technology reporter James Clayton said. “But it does certainly look like the Tesla boss has moved the process along.”\n\nThe Musk effect\n\nTwitter announced yesterday that Musk was joining its board, a day after the world’s richest person became its largest shareholder, taking a 9.2% stake for $2.9bn (£2.2bn). Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal had urged users to “vote carefully” in a poll set up by the Tesla magnate asking whether users would like an edit feature.\n\n“Twitter polls are notoriously unscientific”, said the BBC’s Clayton, “yet Musk appears to make real-life decisions based on their results.” His survey found that 73.6% of those who responded were in favour of adding an edit option.\n\nThe social media network has “shown a somewhat novel willingness to shape the platform based on user feedback”, TechCrunch said, “so it will be interesting to see what happens as the test begins”.\n\n“Some Twitter power users have clamoured for an edit tweet button for years”, the site added, “while others have serious misgivings about making misinformation and harassment even harder to manage on a social network still rife with serious problems”.\n\nRegardless of whether the feature gets a worldwide rollout, Musk’s investment in Twitter has vaulted “him into an influential position at one of the world’s most widely viewed news sources”, the Financial Times reported.\n\n“Tech billionaires have used their wealth before to make a mark in the news business”, the paper said, with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos purchasing The Washington Post and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff buying Time magazine in 2018.\n\nBut “nobody does it quite like Elon Musk”, the paper said. He “has always made a virtue of being a highly disruptive presence at any company he is involved in” and “comes with a set of strongly held, technocratic views that has brought him many critics”.\n\nTaking up a starring role on Twitter’s board means Musk has “gained an influential voice at a platform that has helped define his disruptive brand”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Xandie Nutting", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Peter Weber", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Joel Mathis", "Justin Klawans", "Theara Coleman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2023/01/27/chatgpt-buzzfeed-ai/11129947002/", "title": "ChatGPT has the answers. How does ChatGPT get its information?", "text": "Jennifer Jolly\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nIn less time than it takes me to write this sentence, ChatGPT, the free artificial intelligence computer program that writes human-sounding answers to just about anything you ask, will spit out a 500-word essay explaining quantum physics with literary flair. .\n\n“Once upon a time, there was a strange and mysterious world that existed alongside our own,” the response begins. It continues with a physics professor sitting alone in his office on a dark and stormy night (of course), “his mind consumed by the mysteries of quantum physics...It was a power that could bend the very fabric of space and time, and twist the rules of reality itself,” the chat window reads.\n\nWow, the ChatGPT answer is both eerily entertaining and oddly educational. In the end, the old professor figures it all out and shares his knowledge with the world. The essay is cool and creepy, especially these last two sentences:\n\n“His theory changes the way we see the world and leads to new technologies, but also unlocks a door to powers beyond human comprehension, that can be used for good or evil. It forever changes the future of humanity.”\n\nYes, it could be talking about itself.\n\nChatGPT ban:Schools nationwide are banning ChatGPT. What we know about the future of AI in education.\n\nChatGPT in real estate:ChatGPT takes on real estate: Agents say the AI could be a game changer in the industry\n\nWhat does ChatGPT stand for?\n\nChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is the latest viral sensation out of San Francisco-based startup OpenAI.\n\nIt’s a free online tool trained on millions of pages of writing from all corners of the internet to understand and respond to text-based queries in just about any style you want.\n\nWhen I ask it to explain ChatGPT to my mom, it cranks out, “ChatGPT is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to understand and respond to natural language text, just like a human would. It can answer questions, write sentences, and even have a conversation with you. It's like having your own personal robot that can understand and talk to you!”\n\nChatGPT is free. Try it yourself\n\nThe easiest way to get a picture of its powers is to try it out for yourself. It’s free, you just need to register for an account, then ask it a question.\n\nYou can even prompt it to write something for you – anything really and in any style – from a poem using your child’s name to song lyrics about your dog, business taglines, essays, research papers, and even software code. It types out responses in a few seconds and follows up in the same thread if you don’t like the first answer.\n\nChatGPT launched as a prototype to the public Nov. 30, 2022. Within five days, more than a million people were using it.\n\nBy comparison, it took Netflix 3½ years to get that many people on board. Facebook didn’t crack its first million people for 10 months, and Spotify went five months before it reached that million user mark.\n\nMicrosoft confirmed on Monday that it’s making a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar” investment in OpenAI, and while they didn’t disclose the specific dollar amount – it’s reportedly a $10 billion deal.\n\nNo more free Netflix?:Netflix says it plans to halt free password sharing before April\n\nHow does ChatGPT work?\n\nChatGPT was trained in writing that already exists on the internet up to the year 2021. When you type in your question or prompt, it reacts with lightning speed.\n\n“I am a machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of text which allows me to understand and respond to text-based inputs,” it replies when I ask it to explain how it works.\n\nThe idea behind this new generative AI is that it could reinvent everything from online search engines like Google to digital assistants like Alexa and Siri. It could also do most of the heavy lifting on information writing, content creation, customer service chatbots, research, legal documents, and much more.\n\n“(OpenAI) will provide vastly new potential … at a scale and speed which we’ve never seen before, reinventing pretty much everything about our lives and careers,” says Neil Voss, Co-Founder of augmented-reality startup, Anima. Voss uses OpenAI's system to create AR-based 'creatures' that can talk to their owners.\n\nHe and many others predict OpenAI’s latest tools will become the most significant since the launch of the smartphone, with potential already being likened to the early days of the internet.\n\n“Very quickly, AI will make not only finding information (much easier) but understanding it – reshaping it and making it useful – much faster, ” Voss explains in an email.\n\nIn a follow-up question about how we’ll use ChatGPT and this kind of next-generation AI in the next year or two, the program highlighted several applications including health care, “for things like diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized treatment plans,” and content creation for, “human-like text, audio, creative writing, news articles, video scripts, and more.”\n\nWhile some worry computers will push people out of jobs, it’s the bots' last sentence that raises the most serious red flags.\n\nWhat are the dangers of ChatGPT?\n\nChatGPT parrots back existing content, and although it “sounds” authoritative, it can be flat-out wrong. (We all know by now that not everything you read on the internet is true, right?)\n\nAI can’t yet tell fact from fiction, and ChatGPT was trained on data that’s already two years old. If you ask it a timely question, such as what the most recent iPhone model is – it says it’s the 13.\n\n“In the past, AI has been used largely for predictions or categorization. ChatGPT will actually create new articles, news items or blog posts, even school essays, and it’s pretty hard to distinguish between them and real, human-created writing,” Helen Lee Bouygues tells me over email.\n\nBouygues is the president and founder of the Reboot Foundation, which advocates for critical thinking to combat the rise of misinformation. She’s worried new tech like ChatGPT could spread misinformation or fake news, generate bias, or get used to spread propaganda.\n\n“My biggest concern is that it will make people dumber – particularly young people, while computers get smarter,” Bouygues explains. “Why? Because more and more people will use these tools like ChatGPT to answer questions or generally engage in the world without richer, more reflective kinds of thinking. Take social media. People click, post, and retweet articles and content that they have not read. ChatGPT will make this worse by making it easier for people not to think. Instead, it will be far too easy to have the bot conjure their thoughts and ideas.”\n\nOpenAI’s use and content policies specifically warn against deceptive practices, including; promoting dishonesty, deceiving or manipulating users, or trying to influence politics. It also states that when sharing content, “all users should clearly indicate that it is generated by AI 'in a way no one could reasonably miss or misunderstand.’”\n\nBut it’s humans we’re talking about. And honesty? Sigh.\n\nBuzzfeed announced Thursday that it will partner with ChatGPT to create content. News site CNET is under fire for using AI to create informational articles in its Money section, without full disclosure and transparency.\n\nA recent survey of 1,000 college students in America by the online magazine Intelligent.com also reports nearly 1 in 3 have used ChatGPT on written assignments, even though most think it’s “cheating.”\n\nNew York City and Seattle school districts recently banned ChatGPT from their devices and networks, and many colleges are considering similar steps.\n\nHow to detect AI written content\n\nIn a statement from OpenAI, a spokesperson told us that the company via email that they’re already working on a tool to help identify text generated by ChatGPT. It’s apparently similar to “an algorithmic ‘watermark,’ or sort of invisible flag embedded into ChatGPT’s writing that can identify its source,” according to CBS.\n\n“We’ve always called for transparency around the use of AI-generated text. Our policies require that users be up-front with their audience when using our API and creative tools like DALL-E and GPT-3,” OpenAI’s statement reiterates.\n\nA senior at Princeton recently created an app called GPTZero to spot whether AI wrote an essay. But it’s not ready for the masses yet.\n\nI used an AI content detector called Writer, and it spotted most cases of ChatGPT that I fed it. But some people fear AI’s ability to mimic humans will move much faster than tech’s ability to police it.\n\nStill, the cat’s out of the bag, and there’s no wrestling it back in.\n\n“This isn’t evil,” says Neil Voss. “On the other side of this are accomplishments we’ve only been able to dream of, but getting there is going to be difficult. It is up to us to apply that potential to things that are worthwhile, meaningful, and human.”\n\nWhen I ask ChatGPT to write a sentence about the ethical implications of ChatGPT in the style of tech journalist Jennifer Jolly, it said, \"ChatGPT is a technological tour-de-force, but it also raises important ethical considerations, like how to ensure that this powerful tool is used responsibly and for the greater good.\"\n\nI have to admit, I couldn’t have said it better myself.\n\nJennifer Jolly is an Emmy Award-winning consumer tech columnist.

Its shares sank in April after it disclosed a higher-than-expected expense forecast, quickly knocking $200 billion off its stock-market value.\n\nThat ended a run of strong quarters for Meta, which has climbed back from a share price meltdown in 2022 by slimming its workforce and leaning in to investor excitement about generative AI technologies.\n\nMeta has picked up hiring over the last year, particularly of AI engineers, while continuing to quietly dissolve teams elsewhere. It said on Wednesday that its head count was down 1% year-over-year.\n\nThe social media giant also signaled it would continue to spend big on AI infrastructure, anticipating 2024 capital expenditure would come in between $37 billion and $40 billion, up $2 billion at the lower end from its previous forecast of $35 billion to $40 billion.\n\nIt left its total expense forecast for the year unchanged at $96 billion to $99 billion, while cautioning that infrastructure costs would continue to be a \"significant driver\" of expense growth in 2025.\n\nLosses associated with the company's metaverse unit Reality Labs, which produces its virtual-reality headsets, smart glasses and upcoming augmented-reality glasses, would also continue to \"increase meaningfully,\" it said.\n\nMeta has been updating its ad-buying products with AI tools and short video formats to boost revenue growth, while also introducing new AI features like chat assistants to drive engagement on its social media properties.\n\nIn a departure from its peers, Meta has released its AI models mostly for free, wagering that this approach will pay off in the form of innovative products, less dependence on would-be competitors and greater engagement on its core social networks.\n\nThe company also stands to benefit if developers use its free models over paid ones, which would undercut the business models of rivals.

These accounts briefly paused on and liked content about body image and mental health. The CCDH said the app recommended videos about body image and mental health about every 39 seconds within a 30-minute period.\n\nThe report comes as state and federal lawmakers seek ways to crack down on TikTok over privacy and security concerns, as well as determining whether the app is appropriate for teens. It also comes more than a year after executives from social media platforms, TikTok included, faced tough questions from lawmakers during a series of congressional hearings over how their platforms can direct younger users – particularly teenage girls – to harmful content, damaging their mental health and body image.\n\nAfter those hearings, which followed disclosures from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen about Instagram’s impact on teens, the companies vowed to change. But the latest findings from the CCDH suggest more work may still need to be done.\n\n“The results are every parent’s nightmare: young people’s feeds are bombarded with harmful, harrowing content that can have a significant cumulative impact on their understanding of the world around them, and their physical and mental health,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the CCDH, said in the report.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson pushed back on the study, saying it is an inaccurate depiction of the viewing experience on the platform for varying reasons, including the small sample size, the limited 30-minute window for testing, and the way the accounts scrolled past a series of unrelated topics to look for other content.\n\n“This activity and resulting experience does not reflect genuine behavior or viewing experiences of real people,” the TikTok spokesperson told CNN. “We regularly consult with health experts, remove violations of our policies, and provide access to supportive resources for anyone in need. We’re mindful that triggering content is unique to each individual and remain focused on fostering a safe and comfortable space for everyone, including people who choose to share their recovery journeys or educate others on these important topics.”\n\nThe spokesperson said the CCDH does not distinguish between positive and negative videos on given topics, adding that people often share empowering stories about eating disorder recovery.\n\nTikTok said it continues to roll out new safeguards for its users, including ways to filter out mature or “potentially problematic” videos. In July, it added a “maturity score” to videos detected as potentially containing mature or complex themes as well as a feature to help people decide how much time they want to spend on TikTok videos, set regular screen time breaks, and provide a dashboard that details the number of times they opened the app. TikTok also offers a handful of parental controls.\n\nThis isn’t the first time social media algorithms have been tested. In October 2021, US Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s staff registered an Instagram account as a 13-year-old girl and proceeded to follow some dieting and pro-eating disorder accounts (the latter of which are supposed to be banned by Instagram). Instagram’s algorithm soon began almost exclusively recommending the young teenage account should follow more and more extreme dieting accounts, the senator told CNN at the time.\n\n(After CNN sent a sample from this list of five accounts to Instagram for comment, the company removed them, saying they all broke Instagram’s policies against encouraging eating disorders.)\n\nTikTok said it does not allow content depicting, promoting, normalizing, or glorifying activities that could lead to suicide or self-harm. Of the videos removed for violating its policies on suicide and self-harm content from April to June of this year, 93.4% were removed at zero views, 91.5% were removed within 24 hours of being posted and 97.1% were removed before any reports, according to the company.\n\nThe spokesperson told CNN when someone searches for banned words or phrases such as #selfharm, they will not see any results and will instead be redirected to local support resources.\n\nStill, the CCDH says more needs to be done to restrict specific content on TikTok and bolster protections for young users.\n\n“This report underscores the urgent need for reform of online spaces,” said the CCDH’s Ahmed. “Without oversight, TikTok’s opaque platform will continue to profit by serving its users – children as young as 13, remember – increasingly intense and distressing content without checks, resources or support.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/special/contributor-content/2023/07/24/20-entrepreneurs-who-are-building-empires-in-2023/70457838007/", "title": "20 Entrepreneurs Who Are Building Empires in 2023", "text": "Maria Williams\n\nContributor\n\n20 Entrepreneurs Who Are Building Empires in 2023\n\nIn the world of entrepreneurship, there come a few individuals in every era who transcend conventional success and set their sights on building empires that shape their industries and leave an indelible mark on the business sphere.

Now it wants to ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nIn recent months, bots have been top of mind for many who track the social media industry, thanks to Elon Musk’s attempt to use the prevalence of fake and spam accounts to get out of his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. But bots aren’t just a challenge for Twitter.\n\nLinkedIn, often thought of as a tamer social platform, is not immune to inauthentic behavior, which experts say can be hard to detect and is often perpetrated by sophisticated and adaptable bad actors. The professional networking site has in the past year faced criticism over accounts with artificial intelligence-generated profile photos used for marketing or pushing cryptocurrencies, and other fake profiles listing major corporations as their employers or applying for high-profile job openings.\n\nNow, LinkedIn is rolling out new features to help users evaluate the authenticity of other accounts before engaging with them, the company told CNN Business, in an effort to promote trust on a platform that is often key to job searching and making professional connections.\n\n“While we continually invest in our defenses” against inauthentic behavior, LinkedIn product management vice president Oscar Rodriguez said in an interview, “from my perspective, the best defense is empowering our members on decisions about how they want to engage.”\n\nLinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft (MSFT), says it already removes 96% of fake accounts using automated defenses. In the second half of 2021, the company removed 11.9 million fake accounts at registration and another 4.4 million before they were ever reported by other users, according to its latest transparency report. (LinkedIn does not disclose an estimate for the total number of fake accounts on its platform.)\n\nStarting this week, however, LinkedIn is rolling out to some users the opportunity to verify their profile using a work email address or phone number. That verification will be incorporated into a new, “About this Profile” section that will also show when a profile was created and last updated, to give users additional context about an account they may be considering connecting with. If an account was created very recently and has other potential red flags, such as an unusual work history, it could be a sign that users should proceed with caution when interacting with it.\n\nThe verification option will be available to a limited number of companies at first, but will become more widely available over time, and the “About this Profile” section will roll out globally in the coming weeks, according to the company.\n\nLinkedin's new 'About this Profile' feature will show users when an account was created, when it was last updated and whether it has been verified using a work email or phone number. Courtesy Linkedin\n\nThe platform will also begin alerting users if a message they have received seems suspicious — such as those that invite the recipient to continue the conversation on another platform including WhatsApp (a common move in cryptocurrency-related scams) or those that ask for personal information.\n\n“No single one of these signals by itself constitutes suspicious activity … there are many perfectly good and well-intended accounts that have joined LinkedIn in the past week,” Rodriguez said. “The general idea here is that if a member sees one or two or three flags, I want them to enter into a mindset of, thinking for a moment, ‘Hey, am I seeing something suspicious here?’”\n\nThe approach is somewhat unique among social media platforms. Most, including LinkedIn, allow users to file a report when they suspect inauthentic behavior but don’t necessarily offer clues about how to detect it. Many services also only offer verification options for celebrities and other public figures.\n\nLinkedIn says it has also improved its technology to detect and remove accounts using AI-generated profile photos.\n\nThe technology used to create AI-generated images of fake people has advanced significantly in recent years, but there are still some telltale signs that an image of a person may have been created by a computer. For example, that person may be wearing only one earring, have their eyes centered perfectly on their face or have strangely coiffed hair. Rodriguez said the company’s machine learning model also looks at smaller, harder to perceive signals, sometimes on the pixel level, such as how light is dispersed throughout the image, to detect such images.\n\nEven third-party experts say detecting and removing bot and fake accounts can be a difficult and highly subjective exercise. Bad actors may use a mix of computers and human management to run an account, making it harder to tell if it’s automated; computer systems can rapidly and repeatedly create numerous fake accounts; a single human could simply be using an otherwise real account to perpetuate scams; and the AI used to detect inauthentic accounts is not always a perfect tool.\n\nWith that in mind, LinkedIn’s updates are designed to give users more information as they navigate the platform. Rodriguez said that while LinkedIn is starting with profile and message features, it plans to expand the same kind of contextual information to other key decision-making points for users.\n\n“This journey of authenticity is really significantly bigger than issues around fake accounts or bots,” Rodriguez said. “Fundamentally, we live in a world that is ambiguous and the notion of what is a fake account or real account, what is a good investment opportunity or job opportunity, are all ambiguous decisions.”\n\nThe job hunting process always involves some leaps of faith. With its latest updates, however, LinkedIn hopes to remove a little of the unnecessary uncertainty of not knowing which accounts to trust.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/12/29/soundhound-ai-stock-new-year/71739447007/", "title": "Where Will SoundHound AI Stock Be in 1 Year? | The Motley Fool", "text": "Leo Sun\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) last April. The audio and speech recognition company's stock opened at $8.72 and hit an all-time high of $14.98 less than a month later.\n\nSoundHound's stock surged as growth of the generative AI market sparked a buying frenzy in AI-related stocks. It was also carving out a niche with speech recognition services that didn't lock its users and clients into walled gardens in the same way as Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and other tech giants.\n\nBut in November, SoundHound's stock was trading at about $2. It lost its luster as revenue growth cooled and the company racked up steep losses. SoundHound fell short of its pre-merger expectations, and rising interest rates exacerbated that pain by compressing its valuations.\n\nSo does this out-of-favor AI stock have a shot at bouncing back over the next 12 months?\n\nWhat happened over the past year?\n\nSoundHound's revenue rose 47% to $31 million in 2022, which surpassed its pre-merger forecast for 41% growth. But over the past year its revenue growth decelerated, gross margins declined, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins remained negative.\n\nSoundHound mainly blamed that slowdown on the macro headwinds, which drove many companies to rein in their software spending. But for the fourth quarter it expects revenue growth to accelerate again − rising 68% to 111% year over year.\n\nThat outlook implies its revenue will rise between 44% and 57% for the full year. That's well below its pre-merger forecast for 245% revenue growth in 2023 but matches its prior forecast for \"approximately 50%\" growth.\n\nSoundHound also claims its adjusted EBITDA will turn positive in the fourth quarter as it streamlines spending. The company laid off 10% of its workforce after its public debut, then laid off roughly half of its remaining employees in early 2023.\n\nWhat will happen to SoundHound in 2024?\n\nFor the full year, analysts expect SoundHound's revenue to rise 50% to $47 million as it narrows its adjusted EBITDA loss from $73 million to $33 million. For 2024, they expect revenue to grow 51% to $70 million with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $5 million. Based on those estimates and its enterprise value of $533 million, SoundHound looks reasonably valued at seven times next year's sales.\n\nDuring the latest conference call, CFO Nitesh Sharan said the company was \"set up well for the future\" and \"had a lot of runway ahead.\" Sharan said its existing contracts provided it with \"good visibility for future growth\" − even as it dealt with some \"very lumpy\" deals from larger customers in the \"dynamic\" macro environment − and he was still \"excited about the growth trajectory building into 2024 and beyond.\"\n\nCEO Keyvan Mohajer also predicted SoundHound's new large language models would enable its platform to \"reach new heights\" as the generative AI market expands. It already provides custom services for major customers like Hyundai, Stellantis, Vizio and White Castle, and it could continue to grow as more companies integrate AI-powered voice recognition features into their products and services.\n\nDon't overlook its obvious weaknesses\n\nSoundHound's future seems bright, but investors shouldn't overlook its three biggest weaknesses. First, it has a customer concentration problem, with more than two-thirds of its revenue coming from its top three customers last year.\n\nSecond, it's still unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis and ended its latest quarter with a high debt-to-equity ratio of 4.6. It was carrying $83 million in long-term debt on its balance sheet, with just $96 million in cash and equivalents. That red ink and high leverage could drive away the bulls as long as interest rates stay elevated.\n\nLastly, as of November, SoundHound's insiders sold more than 10 times as many shares as they bought over the past 12 months. That chilly insider sentiment suggests its stock won't bounce back anytime soon.\n\nWhere will SoundHound's stock be in a year?\n\nSoundHound's downside might seem limited, but the concerns about its poor balance sheet will likely cap its gains in this tough market. Its stock could gradually head higher over the next 12 months if it continues to grow its quarterly revenue by about 50% year over year and achieves its goal of maintaining positive adjusted EBITDA margins − but it could still underperform the market and remain well below its all-time highs until it resolves its biggest long-term challenges.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

After being told by doctors “with 100% certainty” that they would lose their baby, the pair said they had to wait days until Amanda Zurawski was “sick enough” to receive abortion care.\n\n“I’m here tonight because the fight for reproductive rights isn’t just a woman’s fight,” said Josh Zurawski. “This is about fighting for our family and, as Kamala Harris, says our future.”\n\nJoining the Zurawskis was Kaitlyn Joshua of Louisiana and Hadley Duvall of Kentucky, who each shared their own emotional stories.\n\n“I can’t imagine not having a choice,” said Duvall, who was sexually assaulted by her stepfather and became pregnant at 12 years old. “But today, that’s the reality for many women and girls across the country.”\n\n\"What is so beautiful about a child having to carry her parent's child?\" Duvall added.\n\nThe group’s appearance and joint remarks come as reproductive rights weigh heavily on the first post-Roe presidential election.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nAndy Beshear says reproductive rights on the line in 2024\n\nKentucky Gov.

They would say, keep going.”\n\nShe also knocked Trump, saying that it is no surprise the former president “is lying about Kamala's record.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., praised Harris on stage, citing a variety of the vice president’s priorities – including “working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and bringing hostages home.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a member of the House’s progressive “Squad,” has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war has raged on.

The former president also drifted off-topic to attack another prominent Democrat, President Joe Biden. He spoke at length about a House Republican impeachment report, though it seems unlikely the GOP will pursue a case against Biden now that he is out of the presidential race.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHarris calls for raising corporate tax rate to 28%\n\nKamala Harris would propose raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% if she’s elected president in November, her campaign said on Monday.\n\nHarris campaign spokesperson James Singer said the tax increase would be aimed at putting money “back in the pockets of working people and ensure billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share.\"\n\nThe proposal follows a broader economic plan Harris laid out last week seeking to ban price gouging on food and groceries, lower prescription drug costs and aid first-time homebuyers, among other measures. Harris was asked by a reporter on Sunday about how she planned to pay for the tax credits and suggested at the time that they would pay for themselves.\n\nAs president, Trump reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\n\n– Karissa Waddick and Francesca Chambers\n\nAbortions at the DNC?

He’s on an island apart from his Democratic peers, who have struck a balance between supporting Israel’s interest in self defense and condemning the attacks on the Gaza Strip.\n\nFetterman told the Press that his decision to skip the convention was “made well before” the June 27 presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.

This is hard. There's a lot at stake,” he told the Hispanic Caucus as attendees swarmed closer to the stage to take pictures and video. “But that's no different than a lot of people live their lives. It can be challenging and hard, but you can do it with a sense of optimism and, what (Harris) is doing, with a sense of joy, with a sense of joy.

But the actually nominating process looks different this year. That's because the DNC confirmed Harris/Walz during a virtual roll call on Aug. 5 due to ballot deadlines in some states, with 99% of the participating delegates supporting Harris.\n\nHarris and Walz accepted the nomination a day later, but they will formally accept at the convention. Democrats are expected to have a ceremonial vote at the convention for the ticket, but their nominations are already final.\n\n— Marina Pitofsky and C. A.

Bailey\n\nWhere is the DNC?\n\nThe convention will be in Chicago, just 90 miles south of Milwaukee, where the Republican National Convention was recently held.\n\nThe Democratic Party has held a national convention every four years since 1832 to nominate its chosen candidates, and Chicago has a storied history of hosting conventions on both sides of the political aisle dating back to 1860, with the nomination of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Sun-Times, this will be the Windy City’s 26th political convention.\n\n— Maya Homan\n\nWhat happens at the DNC?\n\nUnlike the RNC, the DNC decided to confirm their nominee during a virtual roll call on Aug. 5 to satisfy ballot deadlines in several states. According to a press release, 99% of participating delegates supported Kamala Harris in the virtual roll call, and Harris and Walz accepted the nomination a day later.\n\nHowever, Harris has not yet formally accepted the nomination, which she will do at the convention in Chicago.\n\nIn the meantime, there is still plenty left to do for the Democratic delegates. The DNC offers them a chance to adopt and unify a comprehensive party platform, taking a stance on issues like reproductive rights, immigration and economic policy. They'll also have a kind-of ceremonial vote for Harris, but her position as Democratic nominee is already final\n\nThe Democratic Party will post updates on its convention website, which can be found at demconvention.com.\n\n— Maya Homan\n\nDonald Trump plans counterprogramming during the DNC\n\nAs Trump prepared to speak to voters in Wilkes-Barre over the weekend, he and aides finalized plans to counter this week's proceedings at the Democratic convention − and to play defense as Harris basks in the glow of her formal nomination to the presidency.\n\nTrump aides said they believe Harris will gain in the polls in the wake of the convention that kicks off Monday – most major party nominees do − and they are working to counteract that as the election heads into the final two months.\n\nTrump, vice presidential nominee JD Vance, and other campaign officials will conduct a series of anti-Harris events in key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. The former president is expected to campaign every day of the week, Monday through Friday.\n\n— Zac Anderson and David Jackson\n\nWhen did Joe Biden drop out?\n\nJoe Biden announced on Sunday, July 21 that he would not seek reelection amid intense pressure from Democratic leaders sounding the alarm that his path to beat Donald Trump in November had vanished.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\n— USA TODAY Network", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/14/rnc-2024-convention-in-milwaukee-wisconsin-live-updates-start-schedule-dates/74388277007/", "title": "RNC 2024 convention updates in Milwaukee: schedule, speakers", "text": "After months of preparation, Milwaukee is set to host the 2024 Republican National Convention.\n\nBut now, it's in the wake of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, as news continues to unfold about the incident.\n\nWhile the RNC officially starts Monday and runs through Thursday, but there was a lot going Sunday.

Evers seeks to bar firearms from RNC soft perimeter\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has requested that the decision to allow firearms within the soft perimeter of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee be reconsidered \"immediately\" following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, a source with knowledge of the discussion shared with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThe request was made to the U.S. Secret Service, which would relay the governor's concerns to the Republican National Committee, the source said.\n\nBut the request appears likely to go nowhere. The power to ban firearms in the security \"footprint\" outside the credentials-only \"hard\" security zone seems to rest with the state, not the Secret Service, the RNC or the City of Milwaukee.\n\nRead full story\n\n-- Jessie Opoien\n\nThe Great Milwaukee Block Party hosts puppet-making event\n\nMembers of a UWM student puppet club and various other groups met Saturday and Sunday at Tooth + Nail Studio and Gallery to create puppets from cardboard, paper mache and paint.\n\nThe event was hosted by Milwaukee activist and artist Susan Simensky Bietila and Nora Leccese, a community organizer.

She said it represents clean water. Another artist created an intricate cardboard bird and another created a painted owl to wear on her head. Simensky Bietila said her own work often addresses clean water and environmental advocacy.\n\nLeccese said she thinks elected officials “made a big mistake” in inviting the RNC to Milwaukee.\n\n“[They] invited a bunch of people here who don’t generally like the population of this city,” she said. “We wanted to create safe places outside of downtown for people to come be in joyful resistance together.”\n\nLeccese said they chose puppets because they tell a great story and encourage people to be involved in politics and demonstrations.\n\n-- Claire Reid\n\nInside a quiet Fiserv Forum, RNC staff and media prepare for busy week\n\nThe inside of Fiserv Forum was a focused and quiet atmosphere a day before the big show.\n\nNational TV networks workers lugged wagons of camera equipment into their media suites.

His staff is no more or less competent.\n\nBut suddenly, images of Biden as a feeble septuagenarian atop a mismanaged White House have given way to those of an experienced leader, smiling behind aviator sunglasses, whose battle-tested team has delivered on a range of national priorities. A winning streak does that for you.\n\nIt has not happened because of a strategy shift or staff shakeup, though at low points allies wanted him to take those ritual steps. It’s been a combination of good luck, skill and persistence by a president and Democratic Party determined to act unilaterally where Republicans wouldn’t and strike compromises where Republicans would.\n\nGas prices, which wounded Biden when they spiked, have declined for two months. The President didn’t cause either movement. But the turn of fortune has relieved some of the inflation pressures that remain his single largest political problem.\n\nLate last month, weather conditions cleared the way for a CIA drone to kill al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri on the balcony of his Kabul home. The precision strike, the planning of which began this past spring, vindicated Biden’s assertions that the US could fight terrorism in Afghanistan even without troops on the ground.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Justice has been delivered': Biden says US killed al Qaeda leader 03:00 - Source: CNN\n\nIn Congress, Biden has proven detractors wrong from both directions. Politicians and pundits describing a failed legislative agenda had written their reviews before the end of the play.\n\nProgressive lawmakers who scorned the former senator’s talk of working with the GOP have seen Congress make bipartisan investments in infrastructure, domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, and veterans’ health care. They joined a critical mass of Republicans to pass them.\n\nOthers who complained Biden had veered too far left have seen Congress take the largest-ever government steps to curb climate change. Not a single Republican voted yes. Every single Democrat did.\n\nThis doesn’t make Biden a modern-day FDR or LBJ. He cannot claim a singular monument to rival Social Security, Medicare or even the Affordable Care Act, though he has strengthened it.\n\nProposed investments to expand economic opportunity through child care, child tax credits, paid leave and universal pre-kindergarten have faltered. The bipartisan gun-safety law that ended years of congressional paralysis did not meet his call to ban assault weapons. He has not won legislation to safeguard voting rights at a moment when Republican extremism threatens democracy and the rule of law.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Historian who warned Biden in private White House meeting speaks out 05:37 - Source: CNN\n\nPartisan math has imposed the fundamental constraint. To act alone on the small number of top-priority initiatives shielded from Republican filibuster, Democrats can sustain only a few defections in the House and none in the Senate. The climate package prevailed only because Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, after months of resistance, finally agreed to join hands with party colleagues.\n\nThat legislative tightrope makes all the more remarkable what Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have achieved. To call them “wins” on the political scoreboard, as if governance were a sporting event, obscures their impact on American life.\n\nThe 2021 infrastructure law, which eluded Biden’s two immediate predecessors, means $550 billion for new federal investments in roads, bridges, airports, public transit, railroads, rural broadband, clean water and electric-vehicle charging stations, among others.\n\nThe semiconductor bill provides over $52 billion to spur domestic manufacturing of vital components for products ranging from cars to computers, reducing America’s reliance on foreign suppliers.\n\nThe so-called “burn pits” bill extends new health care and disability benefits to millions of veterans exposed to toxins during their service.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act – named to lure Manchin though it will have negligible impact on inflation this year – means Medicare beneficiaries will pay no more than $35 per month for insulin and no more than $2,000 per year in out-of-pocket drug costs. For the first time, Medicare can use its market power to negotiate lower prices from drug companies.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's how the Inflation Reduction Act could affect you 02:05 - Source: CNN Business\n\nThe IRA also devotes $370 billion to developing clean energy and curbing climate change, which analysts say will help the US reduce carbon emissions 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. It sustains American leadership at a time when extreme weather events increasingly place the dangers to the world in sharp relief.\n\nBiden’s weak public standing has begun ticking slightly up. Democrats on the 2022 ballot have gained more ground from anger over the conservative Supreme Court’s decision to end the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean voters will reward them in midterm elections this fall. Republicans need just a four-seat net gain – well below the historical average for the party not holding the White House – to recapture control of the House.\n\nNor does it mean Biden will follow the precedents of Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan in recovering from early setbacks to win a second term. At age 79, Biden looks the part of the oldest chief executive in American history as restless younger Democrats eye fresh leadership.\n\nBut it does mean the President and his party have capitalized on the opportunity control of government has given them for these two years.

Behind the scenes, the Biden campaign machine switched gears to benefit the vice president.\n\nTrump, 78, reckoned with a new November opponent, one almost 20 years his junior, as some Democratic donors celebrated what one called the \"shot of adrenaline\" Harris could bring to the pivotal race.\n\n\"Now we have to start all over again,\" Trump complained in a Truth Social post Sunday evening.\n\nFollow along with USA TODAY's updates.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nSenate fundraising arm triples individual donations\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee tripled its fundraising record for the cycle in “individual grassroots” donations in a single day on Sunday, a DSCC aide told USA TODAY, though they did not provide exact fundraising numbers.\n\nOther major fundraising arms, including the House’s Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, are reporting big fundraising hauls the day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nDifferent biographies\n\nTo make her case against former President Donald Trump, Harris, in a visit to her new campaign headquarters, sought to highlight their sharp biographical differences.\n\n\"As a young prosecutor, when I was in the Alameda County District Attorney's office in California, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse,” said Harris, a former prosecutor. \"Donald Trump was found liable by a jury for committing sexual abuse.”\n\nHarris continued: “As attorney General of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges and put it out of business. Donald Trump ran a for-profit college, Trump University, that was forced to pay $25 million to the students it scammed.\"\n\nSimilar to Biden’s agenda, Harris vowed to fight for “reproductive freedom” if elected, take action to ban assault weapons and work to pass the John Lewis voting rights bill, among other policies.\n\n“Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. We here know when our middle class is strong, America is strong.

I’m watching you, kid. I love ya,” Biden, 81, told 59-year-old Harris before she delivered remarks to her campaign staff – which was previously Biden’s campaign staff – at the campaign’s headquarters in Wilmington.

While Biden had been slipping in the polls, particularly after his disastrous debate performance, a new national poll indicated that Harris could secure a victory against the Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, in all seven battleground states that are likely to decide the election's outcome, Trump has maintained a slight lead over his Democratic rivals.\n\nHere’s how Harris would fare against Trump in the seven key swing states, according to the most recent polls.\n\nArizona: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released. In a Biden-Trump race, an InsiderAdvantage poll showed 9% supported Trump, 44% favored Biden, 4% chose a third-party candidate, and 3% undecided.\n\nGeorgia: An exclusive poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution released hours after President Joe Biden announced his departure from the ticket showed former President Donald Trump with a slight lead over Harris, with a 51% to 46% rating respectively, and a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nMichigan: Recent polling from the Clean and Prosperous America PAC, a left-leaning environmental advocacy group, showed that voters preferred Trump to Harris, with 46% voting for him and 41% choosing the Vice President.\n\nNevada: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released. In a Trump-Biden poll that offered a hypothetical matchup against Harris, Trump received 50% of the vote compared to Harris’ 40%\n\nNorth Carolina: There are currently no polls pitting Harris against Trump.\n\nPennsylvania: No current polls show Harris-Trump results but before Biden announced his departure from the race, figures from Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling showed that voters were more enthusiastic about Harris than they were for Biden, putting her only two points behind Trump.\n\nWisconsin: A Civiqs survey of 514 voters in Wisconsin showed Trump and Harris tied at 48%, with a 4.8% margin of error.\n\n-Maya Homan\n\nHarris fundraising boom continues, campaign says\n\nThe Harris campaign announced $81 million in donations in the 24 hours since the vice president announced her bid Sunday.\n\nThis number includes money raised through the campaign, the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees.\n\n“The historic outpouring of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections,” Kevin Munoz, campaign spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nAlong with Democratic lawmakers, major donors had raised concerns about Biden following his debate performance and threatened to withhold their financial support if the president continued toward the nomination.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nSenate Republican campaign arm hits Harris\n\nThe National Republican Senate Committee, the fundraising arm for Senate Republicans, released a messaging memo to candidates Monday titled: \"Harris creates strong down-ballot opportunity.\"\n\nThe group argues that the case against Biden − that he was \"mentally unfit to hold office\" − didn't work well against down-ballot Democrats. But Harris \"owns the Biden Administration's baggage,\" they write, making her \"arguably a bigger threat to Democrats' Senate majority than Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe memo details Harris' policy positions and concludes with a section titled \"weird,\" including noting that she laughs at \"inappropriate moments\" and loves Venn diagrams.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nKamala Harris quickly securing votes to become Democratic nominee\n\nA USA TODAY count of delegates shows the 59-year old Harris is more than 40% of the way to the 1,968 delegates needed to become the party's nominee in the first round of voting. There are 3,936 Democratic delegates in total, including former presidents, state and local party leaders, members of Congress and governors.\n\nAfter announcing Sunday afternoon that he no longer sought the nomination, the 81-year-old Biden endorsed Harris, a move that likely inspired delegates pledged to him to endorse her.\n\nIt will ultimately be up to the delegates to pick the nominee, but it remains unclear whether that decision will come by a remote roll call vote early next month as was originally planned by the party or at the Democratic National Convention that's scheduled to run August 19-22 in Chicago.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSchumer, Jeffries praise Harris in statement, stop short of endorsing\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a joint statement Monday saying that Harris is \"off to a great start\" with her pledge to pursue the nomination \"in a manner consistent with the grassroots and transparent process\" set forth by the DNC.\n\nHarris is \"rapidly\" gaining support from delegates, they said, but stopped short of endorsing her for president themselves.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nVance mocks Harris over debate\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance is already taking more than a few shots at Harris, including her debate skills.\n\n\"I was told I was gonna get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump's gonna get to debate her?!\" Vance said during a homecoming speech in Ohio.\n\nHe added: \"I'm kind of pissed off about that if I'm being honest with you.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nJeffries, Schumer to meet with Harris\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris \"shortly,\" Jeffries told reporters Monday.\n\nThere's no exact time for that meeting yet, he said, but they're waiting for Schumer to get back into town. The Senate doesn't return until Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm excited for that meeting,\" Jeffries said when asked why he has not yet endorsed Harris for president, as many of his high-profile Democratic colleagues have. Harris \"has excited the community, she's excited the House Democratic Caucus, and she's exciting the country.\"\n\nHe said he and Schumer will have more to say about \"the path forward\" once that meeting is over.\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nPelosi backs Harris as the vice president locks up congressional support\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., endorsed Kamala Harris on Monday as she continues to pick up key support from Democratic lawmakers.\n\n“Today, it is with immense pride and limitless optimism for our country’s future that I endorse Vice President Kamala Harris,” Pelosi said in a statement. “My enthusiastic support for Kamala Harris for president is official, personal and political.”\n\nPelosi played a key role in Biden’s eventual exit from the race. The former speaker served as a sounding board for Democratic lawmakers who were concerned with Biden’s campaign. Her comments on Biden that were hardly enthusiastic endorsements of Biden over the past weeks gave the green light to Democrats to publicly come out against the president.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n'You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?' Kamala Harris meme resurfaces after Biden drops out\n\n\"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\"\n\nNo, that isn't a quote from an ancient philosopher or a classic author. It's from Kamala Harris.\n\nAs rumors swirled in recent weeks over Joe Biden's ability to win and complete a second term in office, and following the recent news of him stepping down as the Democratic nominee, Harris (as well as the internet-famous coconut tree) has drawn increased interest in the political sphere as voters look to her as Biden's potential replacement on the Democratic side of the ticket.\n\n− Emily DeLetter\n\nHarris celebrates student athletes at the White House\n\nHarris on Monday spoke at an event celebrating college athletes, her first public appearance since Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nNCAA Sports Day brings championship teams from the National Collegiate Athletic Association to the White House.

You remind all of us what can be achieved with hard work and ambition,\" she added.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIn first remarks since launching campaign, Kamala Harris pays tribute to Joe Biden, Beau Biden\n\nIn her first public remarks since she became the de facto presumptive Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris payed tribute to Joe Biden and his son, Beau Biden.\n\n\"Joe Biden's legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history. In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office,\" Harris said during an NCAA event at the White House.\n\nSaid she first met Joe Biden through his son Beau Biden. Beau Biden was the attorney general of Delaware while Harris served in the same role in California. Beau Biden died from brain cancer in 2015.\n\n\"Back then, Beau would often tell me stories about his dad. He would talk about the kind of father and the kind of man that Joe Biden is,\" Harris said. \"The qualities that Beau revered in his father are the same qualities that I have seen every day in our president. His honesty, his integrity, his commitment to his faith and his family. His big heart and his deep love of our country.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nFlorida Democrats endorse Harris\n\nSamuel Vilchez, chair of the Orange County Democratic Party in Florida, said in a press call Monday that the Florida Democratic National Committee is endorsing Harris.\n\n“I’m thrilled to announce a unanimous endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris by the Florida Democratic National Committee members, all 15 of us, we have come together and a resounding show of unity and purpose to stand with (the) Vice President.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKamala Harris expected in Delaware Monday afternoon\n\nKamala Harris, who Joe Biden endorsed Sunday after announcing he will no longer seek reelection, is coming to Delaware, according to U.S. Sen. Tom Carper.\n\nHarris is expected to arrive in New Castle County Monday afternoon, where she will meet with members of the Delaware delegation and go to Biden's campaign headquarters in Wilmington, which is expected to transition to hers as she mounts her presidential campaign.\n\nIt's unclear whether the president will be joining the meeting, as today is Day 5 of COVID isolation after he tested positive Thursday. He's been in Rehoboth Beach battling his latest round of COVID and is expected to address the nation later this week regarding his decision to bow out of the presidential race.\n\n– Isabel Hughes and Esteban Parra\n\nTrump's strategy (so far): Link Harris to Biden\n\nThe Trump campaign is making its opening bid in the new campaign against Harris: Linking her to Biden.\n\n\"Harris will be even WORSE for the people of our Nation than Joe Biden,\" said a memo from Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, describing the vice president as an \"enabler\" for Biden.\n\n\"They own each other’s records, and there is no distance between the two.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nInside KamalaHQ: How Harris quickly began plotting campaign after Biden's shocking exit\n\nKamala Harris was at the vice president’s residence when she got the call from POTUS.

But with Biden exiting the race Sunday and endorsing Kamala Harris, the debate schedule may not go on as planned.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Sunday evening, Trump called for Fox News to host the debate, rather than “Fake News ABC.”\n\n“Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,” he wrote.\n\nABC News has not issued an update on the debate schedule.\n\n– Maya Homan\n\nAs Biden leaves 2024 election, Trump and Democrats need to court these 10 voter groups\n\nPresident Joe Biden's announcement Sunday that he's dropping out and backing Vice President Kamala Harris shakes up the 2024 presidential election in many ways. Perhaps most significantly: Biden's decision could bring millions more voters to the polls, according to a new analysis of the U.S. electorate.\n\nResonate, a consumer data and intelligence company, released exclusively to USA TODAY a new set of 10 distinct voter groups. From its database of 250 million Americans, the 10 groups emerged as company's AI data engine culled and matched thousands of U.S. voter attributes.\n\nEricka McCoy, chief marketing officer for Resonate, predicted Friday that a new Democratic nominee would likely reenergize Gen-Z Zealots, based on insights from these groups.

Biden had been under intense pressure to step aside after a poor performance in a June debate against former President Donald Trump that highlighted concerns about his age.\n\nWhile diplomatic protocol tends to limit what American allies will say in public about an active U.S. election, many international officials applauded what Biden had, in their view, done to give new energy to the NATO military alliance, his administration's support for Ukraine and for democratic principles around the world.\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nBiden news leaves some voters feeling panicked. If you're stressed, read this.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, President Joe Biden ended his bid for reelection. It's a move many voters have called for on social media and around their dinner tables.

Harris “is smart and strong, which will make her a good president,” he said, “but she's also kind and has empathy, which can make her a great president. The contrast between her and those running on the other side couldn't be clearer.”\n\nBeshear, who is in second term as Kentucky governor, said while it’s flattering to be mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate, “the only way I would consider something other than this current job is if I believed I could further help my people and to help this country.”\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nHunter Biden shares emotional post on his father\n\nHunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, gave an emotional tribute to his father after he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Sunday.\n\n“For my entire life, I've looked at my dad in awe. How could he suffer so much heartache and yet give so much of whatever remained of his heart to others?” Hunter Biden wrote. “Not only in the policies he passed, but in the individual lives he's touched.”\n\nHe said that over a lifetime, he’s seen his father “absorb the pain of countless everyday Americans who he's given his personal phone number to, because he wanted them to call him when they were hurting.”\n\n“That unconditional love has been his North Star as a President, and as a parent.

But Mayorkas said the country and world are better for Biden’s leadership in protecting the American people.\n\n“When it comes to homeland security, he has taken and directed bold, innovative, and decisive actions to help safeguard our communities, secure our borders, harness the power of artificial intelligence, advance our cybersecurity, eradicate the scourge of fentanyl, and more – all while standing up for our nation’s values,” said Mayorkas, who was impeached by the House over border security. “It is a privilege to advance his vision of and for a strong, secure, and prosperous America.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nHarris is frontrunner to become Democratic nominee\n\nThe Democratic Party won’t officially name its presidential nominee until its convention in August, but Harris is the immediate frontrunner.\n\nBiden, who chosen Harris as his vice presidential running mate four years ago, emphatically endorsed her to be the party’s nominee in a social media post Sunday shortly after announcing his decision to step out of the 2024 race.\n\nSome other prominent Democrats also endorsed her, including Bill and Hillary Clinton. Others, including Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued statements lauding Biden but without explicitly endorsing Harris to succeed him.\n\nHarris, however, has several advantages.

The revelations further expose a security lapse on January 6 as law enforcement tried to respond to multiple major events, protect highly visible politicians, and fend off tens of thousands of riotous protesters that had flooded into Washington and attacked the US Capitol.\n\nMultiple sources now tell CNN Harris pulled into DNC headquarters in Washington at around 11:30 a.m. ET with her motorcade through the garage leading to the parking deck near where law enforcement discovered the pipe bomb.\n\nHarris’ whereabouts and movements on January 6, 2021, have been shrouded in uncertainty. Her presence at the DNC wasn’t known until earlier this month, when few details became public about her evacuation from its headquarters minutes after a pipe bomb was discovered nearby.\n\nAccording to an internal US Capitol Police timeline, an unnamed “protectee” was removed from the DNC building at approximately 1:14 p.m. ET – seven minutes after Capitol Police began investigating the bomb. CNN reported earlier in January that the person was Harris. The Capitol Police timeline did not specify when Harris arrived at the building. Politico first reported on Harris’ evacuation.\n\nA law enforcement source familiar with the event told CNN that the US Secret Service, which was responsible for Harris’ protection that day, swept the interior of the building, the driveway, parking deck and entrances and exits prior to her arrival. The source said Harris was evacuated using an alternate route away from the bomb.\n\nWhile Harris and then-President-elect Joe Biden had not yet been sworn in, they were afforded Secret Service protection after the election. The fact that Harris was so close to potential danger for that period of time raises additional questions about the security measures in place to protect her.\n\n“In order to maintain operational security, the Secret Service does not discuss protective means and methods,” a Secret Service spokesman told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. The vice president’s office referred CNN to the Secret Service.\n\nAides to Harris previously declined to reveal her movements during the January 6 insurrection, citing security reasons. As violence ravaged the Capitol, an aide would only tell CNN she was “safe.”\n\nHarris first referenced the details of her day during remarks earlier this month, marking one year since the riot, saying she was inside the Capitol that morning for a classified Senate Intelligence Committee briefing before leaving.\n\n“On that day, I was not only Vice President-elect, I was also a United States senator. And I was here at the Capitol that morning, at a classified hearing with fellow members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Hours later, the gates of the Capitol were breached,” Harris said.\n\n“I had left. But my thoughts immediately turned not only to my colleagues, but to my staff, who had been forced to seek refuge in our office, converting filing cabinets into barricades.”\n\nOn January 6, officers from several law enforcement agencies responded to the scene at the DNC and the Republican National Committee buildings. The buildings are less than a quarter mile apart and just blocks south of the Capitol. Further, the bombs were discovered around 12:45 and 1:07 p.m. ET, respectively, around the same time angry pro-Trump supporters descended on the Capitol.\n\nBoth devices were rigged to egg timers and contained an explosive powder. Though neither detonated, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has made clear the bombs were viable.\n\nThe bombs were safely neutralized at the scene by robots.

Wade on Friday, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nThe opinion is the most consequential Supreme Court decision in decades and will transform the landscape of women’s reproductive health in America.\n\nGoing forward, abortion rights will be determined by states, unless Congress acts. Already, nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.\n\n“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion. “Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.”\n\nThe vote was 5-4 in favor of overturning Roe. In a joint dissenting opinion, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan heavily criticized the majority, closing: “With sorrow – for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection – we dissent.”\n\nRELATED: Justices spar over how Roe reversal puts precedents on gay rights and contraceptives at risk\n\nThe opinion represents the culmination of a decades-long effort on the part of critics of abortion seeking to return more power to the states. It was made possible by a solid six-member conservative majority – including three of Donald Trump’s nominees.\n\nAt least 21 states have laws or constitutional amendments already in place that would make them certain to attempt to ban abortion as quickly as possible, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which favors abortion rights. And an additional four states are likely to ban abortions as soon as possible without federal protections.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts did not join the majority, writing in a concurring opinion that he would not have overturned Roe but instead would have only uphold Mississippi’s law banning abortions after 15 weeks.\n\nBiden: Ruling casts a ‘dark shadow’\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday “the health and life of women in this nation are now at risk” after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\n“It’s a sad day for the court and for the country,” Biden said, speaking from the White House, calling for Congress to codify the right to an abortion – something that’s unlikely given the split balance of power in the Senate.\n\n“It was three justices named by one president, Donald Trump, who were the core of today’s decision to upend the scales of justice and eliminate a fundamental right for women in this country. Make no mistake, this decision is a culmination of a deliberate effort over decades to upset the balance of our law,” Biden said.\n\n“It’s a realization of an extreme ideology and a tragic error of the Supreme Court in my view,” he added.\n\n“The court has done what it’s never done before, expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans that had already been recognized. The court’s decision to do so will have real and immediate consequences,” he said.\n\nPolitical response is swift\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Pelosi calls Roe v. Wade ruling a 'slap in the face' to women 04:21 - Source: CNN\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the ruling “such an insult, a slap in the face to women.”\n\n“There’s no point in saying good morning, because it certainly is not one,” she said. “This morning the radical Supreme Court is eviscerating women’s rights and endangering their health and safety.”\n\n“Today the Republican-controlled courts achieve their dark, extreme goal of repealing a woman’s right to make their own health decisions.”\n\nFormer President Barack Obama criticized the decision, saying the high court not only reversed nearly 50 years of precedent but it “relegated the most intensely personal decision someone can make to the whims of politicians and ideologues – attacking the essential freedoms of millions of Americans.”\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence praised the ruling, saying the high court has given the “American people a new beginning for life” and commended the justices in the majority “having the courage of their convictions.”\n\n“Now that Roe v. Wade has been consigned to the ash heap of history, a new arena in the cause of life has emerged, and it is incumbent on all who cherish the sanctity of life to resolve that we will take the defense of the unborn and the support for women in crisis pregnancy centers to every state in America,” Pence added.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who voted to confirm Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, said she objected to the decision.\n\n“This decision is inconsistent with what Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said in their testimony and their meetings with me, where they both were insistent on the importance of supporting long-standing precedents that the country has relied upon.\n\nTrigger bans mean abortion is prohibited in several states\n\nIn at least seven states, state officials say that abortion bans can now be enforced.\n\nThree states – Kentucky, Louisiana and South Dakota – have so-called “trigger bans” that went into effect automatically upon the Supreme Court’s ruling. Ten other states have trigger bans with implementation mechanisms that occur after a set period or after a step taken by a state government entity.\n\nAmong the trigger-ban states in the latter category, Missouri has already made the move required to implement its ban on abortion, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt announcing Friday that he had taken the step of certification laid out by Missouri law.\n\nIt’s likely that elsewhere in the country, state legislatures will soon be called back into session to pass strict abortion laws that previously would have run afoul of Roe.\n\nSimilar to leaked draft\n\nThe final opinion was strikingly similar to the draft written by Alito that was leaked earlier this year. It repeats his scornful language towards the original Roe v. Wade decision that enshrined abortion rights.\n\nLike the draft opinion, Alito included a list of cases that also rested on a right to privacy, as Alito asserted that Roe was distinct from those cases.\n\n“What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call ‘potential life’ and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an ‘unborn human being,’” Alito wrote, in a line that was also present in the draft.\n\nWhat’s new is Alito’s response to the dissent, jointly written by the three liberal justices. The dissent would not have been written at the time that the leaked draft was circulated around the court.\n\n“The dissent is very candid that it cannot show that a constitutional right to abortion has any foundation, let alone a ‘deeply rooted’ one, ‘in this Nation’s history and tradition.’” Alito wrote. “The dissent does not identify any pre-Roe authority that supports such a right – no state constitutional provision or statute, no federal or state judicial precedent, not even a scholarly treatise.”\n\nIn that four-page section, Alito said that the dissent’s failure “engage with this long tradition is devastating to its position.”\n\nDissent points to potential impact on women\n\nThe dissenters said women’s rights are under attack.\n\n“Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of today’s decision is certain: the curtailment of women’s rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens.”\n\nFriday’s opinion, the dissent said, “says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of.”\n\n“Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child,” the liberal justices added.\n\nThe dissent also stressed how the decision will impact poor women who now will have to travel in order to obtain the procedure. “Above all others, women lacking financial resources will suffer from today’s decision.”\n\nThe dissent also lashed out at Justice Brett Kavanaugh for suggesting that the decision simply returns the abortion question to the states.\n\nAs the three liberal Justices wrote, “no language in today’s decision stops the Federal Government from prohibiting abortions nationwide, once again from the moment of conception and without exceptions for rape or incest. If that happens,” they explained, throwing Kavanaugh’s words back at him, “‘the views of [an individual State’s] citizens’ will not matter. The challenge for a woman will be to finance a trip not to ‘New York [or] California’ but to Toronto.”\n\nChallenge brought by Mississippi\n\nChampioned by supporters of abortion and long reviled by critics, Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability which most experts say occurs now at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy. The decision was reaffirmed in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\nA majority of the court in that case replaced Roe’s framework with a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The court said that a regulation cannot place an “undue burden” on the right to abortion which is defined as a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.”\n\nBefore the court was Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act, passed in 2018 but blocked by two federal courts, which allows abortion after 15 weeks “only in medical emergencies or for severe fetal abnormality” and has no exception for rape or incest. A district court blocked the law, holding that it is in direct violation of Supreme Court precedent legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nA panel of judges on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the district court holding that in an “unbroken line dating to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s abortion cases have established (and affirmed and re-affirmed) a woman’s right to choose an abortion before viability.” The court said states may “regulate abortion procedures prior to viability” so long as they do not ban abortion. “The law at issue is a ban,” the court held.\n\nMississippi appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and after the justices agreed to hear the case, the state raised the stakes and argued that the justices should not only uphold the law but also invalidate Roe and Casey.\n\nMississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart was blunt at oral arguments.\n\n“Roe vs. Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey haunt our country,” Stewart said. “They have no basis in the Constitution. They have no home in our history or traditions. They’ve damaged the democratic process. They poison the law. They’ve choked off compromise. For 50 years they’ve kept this court at the center of a political battle that it can never resolve and 50 years on, they stand alone. Nowhere else does this court recognize a right to end a human life.”\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued on behalf of the Biden administration in support of the clinics. She urged the justices to uphold precedent and avoid a ruling that would disproportionally harm women who have come to depend upon the decision.\n\n“For a half century, this Court has correctly recognized that the Constitution protects a woman’s fundamental right to decide whether to end a pregnancy before viability,” she argued. “That guarantee, that the state cannot force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth, has engendered substantial individual and societal reliance. The real-world effects of overruling Roe and Casey would be severe and swift.”\n\nShe added: “The court has never revoked a right that is so fundamental to so many Americans and so central to their ability to participate fully and equally in society.\n\nJulie Rikelman, a lawyer for Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the only licensed abortion clinic in Mississippi and Sacheen Carr-Ellis, the clinic’s medical director, told the justices that Mississippi’s ban on abortion “two months before viability” is “flatly unconstitutional under decades of precedent.”\n\nPublic opposed to overturning Roe\n\nA broad majority of Americans did not want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned, polling taken before the Supreme Court’s decision shows.\n\nIn a May CNN poll conducted immediately after the leak of the draft opinion, Americans said, 66% to 34%, that they did not want the Supreme Court to completely overturn its decision. In CNN’s polling dating back to 1989, the share of the public in favor of completely overturning Roe has never risen above 36%.\n\nIn the CNN poll, 58% of US adults said that, if Roe were overturned, they’d want their state to set abortion laws that were more permissive than restrictive. About half (51%) said they’d like to see their state become a safe haven for women who wanted abortions but couldn’t get them where they lived.\n\nBut not everyone was aware in advance how their own state would be affected. Of Americans living in states with trigger laws to immediately ban abortion after the overturn of Roe, only 45% realized that was the case, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted in May. Another 42% living in those states were unsure what the impact of the ruling would be where they live.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Tierney Sneed Chandelis Duster Devan Cole", "Ariane De Vogue", "Tierney Sneed", "Chandelis Duster", "Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump announces a White House bid for 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign.

A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution,” Trump wrote in a post on the social network Truth Social and accused “Big Tech” of working closely with Democrats. “Our great ‘Founders’ did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!”\n\nTrump’s post came after the release of internal Twitter emails showing deliberation in 2020 over a New York Post story about material found on Hunter Biden’s laptop.\n\nWhite House spokesman Andrew Bates said Saturday that Trump’s remarks are “anathema to the soul of our nation, and should be universally condemned.”\n\n“You cannot only love America when you win,” Bates said in a statement. “The American Constitution is a sacrosanct document that for over 200 years has guaranteed that freedom and the rule of law prevail in our great country.

It’s the ultimate monument to all of the Americans who have given their lives to defeat self-serving despots that abused their power and trampled on fundamental rights.”\n\nRepublican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, an outspoken Trump critic, denounced the former president’s Truth Social statement on Sunday. Cheney, who serves as vice chair of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, tweeted that Trump’s statement “was his view on 1/6 and remains his view today.”\n\n“No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution,” she said.\n\nDonald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election.

Party leaders had hoped that the former president would drop his election denialism rhetoric after lackluster results in the midterms.\n\nEarlier this week Trump expressed support for the rioters behind the deadly January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, saying in a video played during a fundraiser that “People have been treated unconstitutionally in my opinion and very, very unfairly, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it.”\n\nIn a September interview, Trump said he was “financially supporting” some January 6 defendants and promised he would issue pardons and a government apology to those being prosecuted if he were reelected.\n\nHe has also come under fire for having dinner at his Mar-a-lago resort with known White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and rapper Kanye West, who has recently made a slew of antisemitic remarks.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.", "authors": ["Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/politics/donald-trump-jr-meadows-text/index.html", "title": "CNN Exclusive: 'We control them all': Donald Trump Jr. texted ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nTwo days after the 2020 presidential election, as votes were still being tallied, Donald Trump’s eldest son texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that “we have operational control” to ensure his father would get a second term, with Republican majorities in the US Senate and swing state legislatures, CNN has learned.\n\nIn the text, which has not been previously reported, Donald Trump Jr. lays out ideas for keeping his father in power by subverting the Electoral College process, according to the message reviewed by CNN. The text is among records obtained by the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021.\n\n“It’s very simple,” Trump Jr. texted to Meadows on November 5, adding later in the same missive: “We have multiple paths We control them all.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See ex-Trump official's reaction to Trump Jr.'s 'revealing' texts 04:16 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Trump Jr.’s lawyer Alan S. Futerfas said, “After the election, Don received numerous messages from supporters and others. Given the date, this message likely originated from someone else and was forwarded.”\n\nImmediately before his text to Meadows describing multiple paths for challenging the election, Trump Jr. texted Meadows the following: “This is what we need to do please read it and please get it to everyone that needs to see it because I’m not sure we’re doing it.”\n\nThe November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake “Trump electors.”\n\nIf all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6.\n\n“We have operational control Total leverage,” the message reads. “Moral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.”\n\nThe text from Trump Jr. is revealing on a number of levels. It shows how those closest to the former President were already exchanging ideas for how to overturn the election months before the January 6 insurrection – and before all the votes were even counted. It would be another two days before major news outlets declared Joe Biden the winner on November 7.\n\nThe text also adds to a growing body of evidence of how Trump’s inner circle was actively engaged in discussing how to challenge the election results.\n\nOn March 28, Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California, said that Trump, along with conservative lawyer John Eastman, launched an “unprecedented” campaign to overturn a democratic election, calling it “a coup in search of a legal theory.”\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, an attorney for Meadows, declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for the House select committee declined to comment.\n\nForeshadowing the Trump campaign strategy\n\nIn the weeks following the 2020 election, Trump and his allies eventually filed more than 60 unsuccessful lawsuits in key states, failing to convince the courts that his claims about a stolen election were justified, or uncover any evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nThey also called for various recounts based on those same unfounded voter fraud claims. A number of states conducted recounts in the months after the election, though none of them revealed any fraud substantial enough to have changed the outcome of the vote in any state.\n\nWhile Trump Jr. was publicly pushing various voter fraud conspiracy theories and generally casting doubt about the results in states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, his text to Meadows reveals there were other ideas being discussed privately.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump-endorsed candidate asked about January 6. Watch what happened next 01:48 - Source: CNN\n\nSpecifically, Trump Jr. previews a strategy to supplant authentic electors with fake Republican electors in a handful of states. That plan was eventually orchestrated and carried out by allies of the former President, and overseen by his then-attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nIn his text to Meadows, Trump Jr. identifies two key dates in December that serve as deadlines for states to certify their electoral results and compel Congress to accept them. Though the dates are largely ceremonial, in his text Trump Jr. appears to point to them as potential weaknesses to be exploited by casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election results.\n\nSeeking Trump electors\n\nTrump Jr.’s November 5 text to Meadows came as similar notions of faithless electors were starting to percolate publicly on conservative social media. Trump Jr. sent the text to Meadows at 12:51 p.m., just minutes after conservative radio host Mark Levin had tweeted a similar idea and suggested state legislatures have final say on electors.\n\nIf secretaries of state were unable to certify the results, Trump Jr. argues in his text to Meadows that they should press their advantage by having Republican-controlled state assemblies “step in” and put forward separate slates of “Trump electors,” he writes.\n\n“Republicans control Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina etc we get Trump electors,” Trump Jr. adds.\n\nTrump Jr.’s text, however, refers to an untested legal theory that state houses are the ultimate authority in elections and can intervene to put forward a different slate of electors than those chosen by the voters, when in reality this is a ceremonial process and the outcome is essentially a foregone conclusion.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump dangles pardons for Jan. 6 rioters while teasing 2024 run 00:58 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Justice Department and the House committee are both investigating the fake electors plot within the context of what unfolded on January 6 and Trump’s broader effort to overturn the election.\n\nThe strategy floated by Trump Jr. is similar to what was outlined by former Texas Governor and Trump Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who texted Meadows on November 4 suggesting three state legislatures ignore the will of their voters and deliver their states’ electors to Trump.\n\n“HERE’s an AGRESSIVE (sic) STRATEGY: Why can t (sic) the states of GA NC PENN and other R controlled state houses declare this is BS (where conflicts and election not called that night) and just send their own electors to vote and have it go to the SCOTUS,” Perry’s text message read.\n\nA spokesman for Perry told CNN at the time that the former Energy secretary denies being the author of the text. However, multiple people who know Rick Perry previously confirmed to CNN that the phone number the committee has associated with that text message is Perry’s number.\n\n‘We control them all’\n\nTrump Jr. also texts Meadows that Congress could intervene on January 6 and overturn the will of voters if, for some reason, they were unable to secure enough electoral votes to tip the outcome in Trump’s favor using the state-based strategy.\n\nThat option, according to Trump Jr.’s text, involves a scenario where neither Biden nor Trump have enough electoral votes to be declared a winner, prompting the House of Representatives to vote by state party delegation, with each state getting one vote.\n\n“Republicans control 28 states Democrats 22 states,” Trump Jr. texts. “Once again Trump wins.”\n\n“We either have a vote WE control and WE win OR it gets kicked to Congress 6 January 2021,” he texts Meadows.\n\nIn a series of memos in early January, conservative lawyer John Eastman proposed a variation of that idea.\n\nEastman’s memo laid out a six-step plan for Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election for Trump, which included throwing out the results in seven states because they allegedly had competing electors. In fact, no state had actually put forward an alternate slate of electors – there were merely Trump allies claiming without any authority to be electors.\n\nEastman, who has been subpoenaed by the House select committee and is fighting to keep some of his records secret from investigators, was accused by Carter of likely engaging in a criminal conspiracy with Trump to overturn the election.\n\n“Dr. Eastman has an unblemished record as an attorney and respectfully disagrees with the judge’s findings,” his attorney Charles Burnham said in response to the judge’s ruling.\n\nTrump Jr. pushes Meadows to fire Wray and install loyalist at FBI\n\nTrump Jr. ends his November 5 text by calling for a litany of personnel moves to solidify his father’s control over the government by putting loyalists in key jobs and initiate investigations into the Biden family.\n\n“Fire Wray; Fire Fauci,” he texts, referring to FBI Director Christopher Wray and White House coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci. Trump Jr. then proposes making former acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell interim head of the FBI and having then-Attorney General Bill Barr “select Special prosecutor on HardDrivefromHell Biden crime family.”\n\nAs Trump refused to concede in the days and weeks after the 2020 election, rumors swirled that he was still considering firing Wray, along with several other top officials with whom he had grown frustrated.\n\nTrump and his allies sharply criticized Wray for failing to produce information that they claimed would be harmful to the President’s political enemies, including Biden. CNN previously reported that the prospect of Trump firing Wray hung over the FBI for weeks, dating to before Election Day.\n\nWhile Wray remains in his post and Barr resigned in mid-December 2020 without naming a special prosecutor to investigate the Bidens, Trump Jr.’s text underscores just how precarious the situation at DOJ was in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\nThe same is true for Trump Jr.’s recommendation that Meadows replace Wray with Grenell, someone who not only lacked the usual qualifications to lead the FBI but also had a proven track record of doing the former President’s bidding.\n\nAfter serving a controversial three-month stint as Trump’s acting intel chief, Grenell hit the campaign trail in late 2020 to help promote Trump’s unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud and support his legal challenges in a key swing state: Nevada.\n\nOn November 5, Biden held a slim lead over Trump in Nevada but appeared poised to win the state’s six electoral votes. That same day, Grenell and Trump campaign officials announced they were filing a new lawsuit to “stop the counting of illegal votes” but provided no evidence to support their claims of rampant fraud.\n\nThis story has been updated with new details of a text message Trump Jr. sent to Meadows.", "authors": ["Ryan Nobles Zachary Cohen Annie Grayer", "Ryan Nobles", "Zachary Cohen", "Annie Grayer"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}]}

Kohl’s is in turmoil today.\n\nThe chain’s sales are lower than before the pandemic, despite strong consumer spending and as its rivals enjoy big gains. Activist investors are circling Kohl’s and demanding leadership changes. A sale of the company could be on the horizon.\n\n“We see a company that’s lost its way,” said Jonathan Duskin, managing partner at Macellum Advisors, an activist investment firm that has become Kohl’s third largest shareholder.\n\nKohl's is under heavy pressure from investors and retail rivals. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMacellum and a group of activist investors took a stake in Kohl’s last year. The group reached a settlement with Kohl’s in April, but Macellum has recently revived its effort to overhaul Kohl’s because of continued stock price weakness and market share losses.\n\nKohl’s “should be doing better than Macy’s, not worse,” Duskin said. “We see a lot of initiatives that sound okay, but never really result in growth.”\n\nIn a statement, a Kohl’s spokesperson blasted Macellum, saying the firm was “using a misinformed, shifting and hollow narrative” to push for changes that would not improve Kohl’s and result in “poorly qualified and inexperienced” board directors.\n\nThe spokesperson said Kohl’s has made “substantial progress in transforming our business and positioning the Company for long-term success.”\n\n“We are already delivering results,” the spokesperson added, pointing to the company’s record earnings in 2021, operating profit margins reached two years ahead of schedule and an increase in the company’s quarterly dividend.\n\nKohl’s is attempting yet another makeover to turn things around, but its success is far from guaranteed.\n\nFighting the tide\n\nWith more than 1,100 US stores and around $19 billion in annual sales, Kohl’s is the largest department store chain in the United States.\n\nThe department store sector has been in structural decline for years against pressure from Amazon, growing big-box chains including Walmart (WMT)and Target (TGT), and discount clothing stores like TJMaxx. Companies such as Sears, JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, Barney’s and others have filed for bankruptcy in recent years.\n\nDepartment stores including Kohl’s have been undercut on prices by discount players from the bottom, and prestige by luxury stores at the top, said John Fisher, a senior lecturer at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management and former CEO of Saucony running shoes.\n\n“It’s hard to be unique,” Fisher said. “I think Kohl’s is caught right now by death in the middle.”\n\nKohl's CEO Michelle Gass has been considered one of the most innovative executives in retail. Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nKohl’s has lost around 17% of its market share since 2011, primarily to off-price retailers such as TJMaxx, as well as Amazon, according to UBS.\n\n“[F]orces like consumers’ migration to online and preference for value have contributed to this erosion,” UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a recent report. “This will likely continue after the pandemic.”\n\nSince Gass, a former top deputy to Howard Schultz at Starbucks (SBUX), took over as Kohl’s CEO in 2018, the company has attempted a handful of approaches to draw customers and stave off competitors.\n\nIn addition to the returns partnership with Amazon, Kohl’s expanded its athleisure clothing business with brands such as Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA). Kohl’s also shrunk the size of a handful of stores and leased out the extra space to Aldi and Planet Fitness, made a bigger play for Millennials with new brands such as PopSugar and, more recently, opened Sephora beauty stores inside Kohl’s.\n\nThese strategies have not led to major improvements. Kohl’s has improved its athleisure business and other areas, but its women’s clothing business has slumped.\n\nIn 2018, sales inched up 0.7% from the prior year. In 2019, they dropped 1.2% before plunging 20% in 2020 due to store closures and Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nLast year, after stores reopened and shoppers refreshed their wardrobes, sales bounced back 23% — but that was still below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nCompetition has become more cutthroat in the four years since Gass took over, and “a lot of Kohl’s stores feel tired,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData. “It has been very easy for customers to switch away from Kohl’s to others offering something better.”\n\nAnd brand partnerships with Amazon and Sephora do not address core issues, he added. “Kohl’s needs to look to improving its own brand rather than relying on others to lift it.”\n\nA sale looming?\n\nOver the last few months, activist investors have been pressing for changes at Kohl’s.\n\nOne firm, Engine Capital, urged Kohl’s to spin off its e-commerce business from its stores or find a buyer to take the company private. “Even the most patient long-term shareholders cannot be expected to endure the punishing underperformance and perpetual value disconnect seen at Kohl’s,” Engine Capital said in December.\n\nA month later, Macellum Advisors said it would nominate a slate of new board members at Kohl’s because Kohl’s board and leadership “spent another year materially mismanaging the business.” Private equity firms also made buyout offers for Kohl’s, which the company rejected.\n\nTo fight off pressure, Kohl’s last week laid out plans for a “complete reinvention of our business model and our brand” at an investor day.\n\nKohl’s said it would add Sephora mini-shops to roughly 75% of its 1,100 US stores, open 100 new locations at half the size of its traditional outlets in the next four years and increase its popular Kohl’s Cash rewards program to 7.5% on purchases, up from 5%. Kohl’s also unveiled new strategies to grow online, including self-service for pickup orders and returns.\n\n“We’re evolving our position from a department store to a more focused lifestyle concept centered around the active and casual lifestyle,” Gass said in a presentation.\n\nBut to Duskin at Macellum Advisors, the plan was “disappointing.”\n\nHe believes the strategy won’t meaningfully change how consumers see Kohl’s — and he says it’s time for a new board and, possibly, a new CEO. Kohl’s has not fully taken advantage of its stores being located away from traditional malls, which are losing foot traffic, he said, and he questions whether the investment in Sephora is worth the cost.\n\nKohl’s said last week that it has engaged with more than 20 potential buyers for the company, a sign of wide interest. Hudson’s Bay Co., the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, also is considering a bid, Axios reported Wednesday.\n\nKohl’s board has an “ongoing dialogue with potential bidders” and will measure any offers against its own “compelling standalone plan,” a spokesperson said.\n\nDuskin expects Kohl’s to accept a buyout offer, he said. “This company can easily be turned around.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-faq/index.html", "title": "Everything you need to know about Biden's student loan forgiveness ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe fate of President Joe Biden’s federal student loan forgiveness program, which promises to deliver up to $20,000 of debt relief for millions of borrowers, lies with the Supreme Court.\n\nThe justices heard arguments on February 28 in two cases concerning the forgiveness program, and a decision is expected by late June or early July.\n\nAbout 26 million people had already applied by the time a federal district court judge struck down the program on November 10, 2022 – prompting the government to stop taking applications. No debt has been canceled thus far.\n\nThe administration officially launched the application on October 17, 2022, following a brief “beta period” during which its team assessed whether tweaks were needed.\n\nIf the Supreme Court ultimately allows the program to move forward, not every student loan borrower is eligible for the debt relief. First, only federally held student loans qualify. Private student loans are excluded.\n\nSecond, high-income borrowers are generally excluded from receiving debt forgiveness. Individual borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 annually could see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.\n\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. Pell grants are awarded to millions of low-income students each year, based on factors including their family’s size and income and the cost charged by their college. These borrowers are also more likely to struggle to repay their student debt and end up in default.\n\nHere’s what else borrowers need to know about the proposed student loan forgiveness plan:\n\nWhat are the legal challenges to Biden’s forgiveness plan?\n\nThe Biden administration faced several lawsuits over the student loan forgiveness program, two of which have made it to the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs argue that the Department of Education is overstepping its authority.\n\nOne of the lawsuits was brought by six Republican-led states, headed by Nebraska, that argue that the student loan forgiveness program violates the separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the process by which federal agencies issue regulations.\n\nA lower court judge dismissed this lawsuit on October 20, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge. In November, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision and blocked the program.\n\nThe other challenge that the Supreme Court heard was brought by two individual borrowers – Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor – who are not qualified for full debt relief forgiveness and who say they were denied an opportunity to comment on the secretary of education’s decision to provided targeted student loan debt relief to some.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed with the backing of a conservative group called the Job Creators Network Foundation. A federal judge in Texas ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, striking down the program on November 10.\n\nLawyers for the government say that Congress gave the secretary of education “expansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies,” like the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a memo from the Department of Justice.\n\nWhen will I receive my debt relief?\n\nIt’s unclear when, or if, borrowers will see debt relief under Biden’s program.\n\nAdministration officials expected to be able to grant relief before January, when payments were set resume after the pandemic-related pause expired. But now debt cancellation won’t occur until at least June when the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling.\n\nOn November 22, 2022, the Biden administration extended the pandemic-related pause on payments and interest a final time. Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, student loan interest will resume on September 1 and payments will be due starting in October.\n\nA law passed in early June that addressees the debt ceiling prohibits another extension of the pause.\n\nThe White House has said that it has already approved 16 million applications for debt relief. The Department of Education will hold on to that information so it can quickly process those borrowers’ relief if the government prevails in court.\n\nIf and when the program moves forward, an estimated 8 million borrowers may receive debt relief automatically because the Department of Education already has their income on file.\n\nIf the government restarts taking applications, borrowers can apply online here: https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application.\n\nApplicants can expect to receive an email confirmation once their application is successfully submitted. Then, borrowers will be notified by their loan servicer when the debt cancellation has been applied to their account.\n\nBorrowers were expected to have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application.\n\nWhat kind of federal loans are eligible?\n\nThere are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief if the program is allowed to proceed. Federal Direct Loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans and graduate PLUS loans, are eligible.\n\nBut federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders are not eligible unless the borrower applied to consolidate those loans into a Direct Loan by September 29, 2022.\n\nThe Department of Education initially said these privately held loans, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action – but reversed course last September when six Republican-led states sued the Biden administration, arguing that forgiving the privately held loans would financially hurt states and student loan servicers.\n\nDefaulted Federal Family Education Loans and defaulted Perkins Loans would be eligible for the debt relief even if they are privately held.\n\nWhat year is the income threshold based on?\n\nIf Biden’s program is allowed to move forward, eligibility is based on a borrower’s adjusted gross income for either tax year 2020 or 2021. Adjusted gross income can be lower than your total wages because it considers tax deductions and adjustments, like contributions made to a 401(k) retirement plan.\n\nA taxpayer’s adjusted gross income can be found on line 11 of IRS Form 1040.\n\nHow will the government know what my income was?\n\nThe Department of Education says it already has income information for nearly 8 million borrowers, likely because of financial aid forms or previously submitted income-driven repayment plan applications. If the program is allowed to move forward, those borrowers will automatically receive the debt relief if they meet the income requirement, unless they choose to opt out. The department has said it will email borrowers who will be considered for debt relief but don’t need to apply.\n\nMillions of other borrowers will need to apply for student loan forgiveness if the Department of Education doesn’t have their income information on file. When they submit the application, borrowers are required to self-attest that their income is under the eligibility threshold. They are required to certify that the information provided is accurate upon penalty of perjury.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that applicants who are “more likely to exceed the income cutoff” will be required to submit additional information, like a tax transcript. Officials expect that just 5% of borrowers with eligible federal student loans would not qualify due to the income threshold.\n\nWill I have to pay taxes on the amount of debt canceled?\n\nBorrowers will not have to pay federal income tax on the student loan debt forgiven, thanks to a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act that Congress passed in 2021.\n\nBut it’s possible that some borrowers may have to pay state income tax on the amount of debt forgiven. Most states will not tax the forgiveness as income.\n\nI’m a current student. Am I eligible for forgiveness?\n\nYes, some current students would be eligible under Biden’s plan if it’s allowed to take effect. Eligibility for borrowers who filed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA, as an independent will be based on the individual’s own household income.\n\nEligibility for borrowers who are enrolled as dependent students, generally those under the age of 24, will be based on parental income for either 2020 or 2021.\n\nI have student debt from graduate school. Am I eligible for forgiveness?\n\nYes, if your income meets the eligibility threshold and the program is allowed to be implemented.\n\nI’m a parent and took out a Parent PLUS loan. Am I eligible?\n\nYes, you could be eligible if your income meets the threshold. A parent borrower with federal Parent PLUS loans for multiple children is still only eligible for up to $20,000 of loan forgiveness.\n\nBut a parent is only eligible for up to $20,000 in debt relief if he or she received a Pell grant for his or her own education. If only the child received a Pell grant, the parent is eligible for up to $10,000 in forgiveness.\n\nHow do I know if I ever received a Pell grant?\n\nMost borrowers can log in to Studentaid.gov to see if they received a Pell grant while enrolled in college. Information about Pell grants received is displayed on the account dashboard and on the My Aid page. This is also where borrowers can find out how much they owe and what kind of loans they have.\n\nBorrowers who received a Pell grant before 1994 won’t see their Pell grant information online, but they are still eligible for the $20,000 in student loan forgiveness.\n\nAs long as borrowers received at least one Pell grant, they are eligible.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that eligible borrowers who have received Pell grants will automatically receive the additional debt relief.\n\nAm I eligible for forgiveness if my loans are in default?\n\nYes, defaulted federal student loans would be eligible for debt relief under Biden’s program.\n\nFor borrowers who have a remaining balance on their defaulted student loans after the cancellation is applied, there will be an opportunity to get out of default once payments resume later this year as part of what the Department of Education is calling its “Fresh Start” initiative.\n\nHow will my payments change going forward?\n\nBorrowers who have debt remaining after either $10,000 or $20,000 is wiped away could see their monthly payment amounts recalculated if they are enrolled in a standard repayment plan. Under a standard repayment plan, borrowers pay a fixed amount that ensures loans are paid off within 10 years.\n\nBorrowers who are already enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan are not likely to see their monthly payment amounts change due to the forgiveness, because their payments are based on household income and family size.\n\nBorrowers have not been required to make payments on their federal student loans since March 2020 because of the government’s pandemic-related pause.\n\nWhat about Biden’s new income-driven repayment plan?\n\nAlong with Biden’s August announcement about canceling some federal student loan debt, he also said he would create a new plan that would make repayment more manageable for borrowers.\n\nThere are currently several repayment plans available for federal student loan borrowers that lower monthly payments by capping them at a portion of their income.\n\nThe new income-driven repayment plan proposal will cap payments at 5% of a borrower’s discretionary income, down from 10% that is offered in most current plans, as well as reduce the amount of income that is considered discretionary. It would also forgive remaining balances after 10 years of repayment, instead of 20 years.\n\nBiden is also proposing that the new plan cover the borrower’s unpaid monthly interest. This could be very helpful for people whose monthly payments are so low that they don’t cover their monthly interest charge and end up seeing their balances explode, growing larger than what was originally borrowed.\n\nThe new plan is currently going through a formal rulemaking process, and the Department of Education has said it expects provisions of the new plan to take effect later this year.\n\nCan I get a refund for what I paid during the pandemic pause?\n\nYes. Borrowers have not been required to make payments on their federal student loans since March 13, 2020, because of the pandemic-related pause. But if borrowers did make payments, they are allowed to contact their loan servicer to request a refund.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/12/26/rare-black-rhino-born-dengue-fever-santa-lady-disputed-lincoln-hat-news-around-states/40887925/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTown Creek: Warning sirens failed to sound before a tornado struck a north Alabama community last week, killing two people, but officials said it probably wouldn’t have mattered even if they had. The area where an EF-2 tornado hit near Town Creek is too far away from warning sirens to have made a difference for the victims even if they went off, said Johnny Cantrell, director of the Lawrence County Emergency Management Agency. The National Weather Service said a tornado touched down Dec. 16 south of Town Creek, went over a mountain and dipped down again before destroying everything in a path that was 370 yards wide at its maximum. A husband and wife died, and their 7-year-old son was among the injured. Town Creek Mayor Mike Parker said neither of the community’s two storm sirens emitted a warning before the killer tornado. Cantrell said the siren system is based on a concept that is decades-old, and he favors having a severe weather application for cellphones so residents in a storm’s path can be notified. He said he will continue to look at more modern notification systems and look for money to fund the application.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Matanuska-Susitna Borough has declared a local emergency from flooding brought on by an ice jam in Willow Creek. Borough Mayor Vern Halter in his declaration Monday night asked Gov. Mike Dunleavy to declare a state disaster for the affected areas. Halter cited severe threats to life and property, lack of access to homes and property damage loss. “The severity and magnitude of the flooding emergency is beyond the timely and effective response capability of the local resources,” he said. The ice jam Saturday night sent floodwater into nearby homes. At least 13 households were forced to evacuate, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Six were damaged by floodwater. Residents who chose to stay behind to tend to animals were cut off from leaving their neighborhood, KTUU-TV reported. Emergency workers on Monday used amphibious all-terrain vehicles and boats to shuttle people in and out so they could buy food, fuel and medications. There had been little change in the ice jam from Sunday to Monday, said borough emergency services director Ken Barkley. Ice jams have occurred during spring breakup but presented an unusual challenge in early winter, Barkley said. The temperature at 7 a.m. Tuesday in Willow was 6 degrees.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials said City Hall had been bugged for several months – with bedbugs, that is. The Arizona Daily Star reported officials said it took nearly three months to remove the small insects from the municipal building. The first report of bed bugs came in late September, with an employee reporting finding a dead bedbug in a file folder on the third floor. A week later, the second report surfaced with the sighting of a bedbug on the fourth floor. As a precaution, exterminators sprayed every floor of City Hall to get rid of the little bloodsuckers. Officials believe the bedbugs were brought in accidentally from an outside source. Tucson spokesman Andy Squire said after the three-month removal, the city also had to hire a Phoenix company earlier this month to bring in a specially trained dog to sniff the remaining bugs out. City officials estimated it cost about $7,853 to get rid of the infestation, with nearly half paying for the bedbug-sniffing dog.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An Arkansas fire chief has donated a kidney to a teenager he didn’t know. Maumelle Fire Chief Gerald Ezell told KATV that the surgery took place Dec. 13, two days after he met 18-year-old Sidney Burnett of Granby, Missouri. Ezell said he discovered Burnett was in need when he saw a Facebook post from her mother, an old school friend. He realized they had the same blood type. “I just felt like God was saying, ‘Hey, this is you,’” Ezell said. “Step across that line.” The transplant was performed at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Burnett is still in Minnesota recovering from the surgery. “I was just so shocked that my donor was someone that had never even met me, but I’m so grateful for him,” she said. “He literally gave me my life back.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A study released this week has found that a law aimed at boosting vaccination rates across California had the greatest effect in high-risk areas where the vaccination rates were the lowest. The peer-reviewed study published in the journal PLOS Medicine on Monday showed that the 2016 legislation contributed to a 3.3% increase statewide for measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and a 2.4% decrease in the number of requests for nonmedical or personal belief exemptions to childhood vaccination requirements. California adopted the strictest childhood vaccination laws in the nation after public health officials connected more than 100 measles cases to an outbreak at Disneyland that began in December 2014. The law requires children to be vaccinated to attend public or private schools. It allows for medical exemptions if there is a clear medical reason that children should not be vaccinated.\n\nColorado\n\nSilverton: A fire that destroyed a historic building in a small mountain town in southwestern Colorado over the weekend led to power, internet and cellphone outages and took more than half of the town’s stored water to fight, officials said. The fire, which was reported about 10 p.m. Saturday, took nearly 17 hours to extinguish in subfreezing temperatures and used so much water that city officials asked residents of the small mountain town to voluntarily conserve water for a couple of days until storage tanks could refill, the Durango Herald reported Monday. Initially, “there was no way to get the word out,” to the town’s 400 residents, said John Sites, Silverton’s director of Public Works. Patrons at a brewery who spotted the fire were unable to use their cellphones to call 911 because of the outage. Fortunately, the brewery had a landline. The fire damaged a power line and CenturyLink line that run through the alley behind the gift and souvenir store that was destroyed, said San Juan County spokeswoman DeAnne Gallegos. Power was out for about six hours as outside temperatures dipped as low minus-10 degrees. Other wireless providers rely on CenturyLink’s line, so they were out of service as well. The fire was under control at 6 a.m., but Silverton’s fire crews continued to put out hot spots until 4 p.m. Sunday, said Gilbert Archuleta, chief of the Silverton-San Juan County Fire and Rescue Authority. The cause of the fire is unknown. Foul play is not suspected, Archuleta said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state has been awarded a nearly $27 million federal grant to help further enhance early childhood development programs, the administration of Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday. The Preschool Development Birth through Five grant will help the state Office of Early Childhood design and launch better, more cost-effective systems to support family resilience and early childhood development. In addition to giving parents a greater voice, it focuses on developing and retaining the early childhood workforce. Connecticut was positioned to win the grant because the office is a national model integrating programs for young children and families, Commissioner Beth Bye said in a statement. Through a family-centered approach, the office serves thousands of children each year through child care, preschool, home visiting, health and safety assurance, early intervention, and parenting support. The three-year grant award starts Jan. 1.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Partially treated wastewater is being released from a treatment plant because of an equipment malfunction that state officials said cannot be immediately fixed. The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control learned of the equipment malfunction at the Lewes wastewater treatment plant on Dec. 18, according to a press release Monday. Residents in the Lewes area are being asked to take water conservation measures until a resolution is announced, news outlets reported. Those measures include reducing shower time, avoiding multiple partial loads of laundry or dishwashing and minimizing “unnecessary flushing of toilets,” according to the release. DNREC said the plant has been bypassing stages of wastewater treatment since Dec. 19. Crews are screening the partially-treated wastewater effluent to remove visible solids, and a hydrogen peroxide feed is being used to reduce bacteria, state officials said. An emergency shellfish closure order has been issued by DNREC Secretary Shawn Garvin for harvest areas downstream from the plant. The closure will continue for 21 days after the malfunction is fixed per U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines, according to the release.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two people were injured in a fire at a home for people recovering from drug and alcohol abuse. D.C. Fire and first responders arrived at the scene early Monday and found three people were trapped inside, news outlets reported. Once rescued, two of those people were taken to a hospital to be treated for injuries not considered to be life-threatening. The third person declined medical treatment. Fire department spokesman Vito Maggiolo said most residents were alerted to the blaze by working fire alarms and were able to escape on their own. The fire’s cause still is under investigation. The D.C. mayor’s Office of Community Relations and Services and Red Cross are helping displaced residents, of which there are about 16. The home is part of the Oxford House network, which seeks to help residents with sobriety.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Two more cases of dengue fever have been discovered in Miami-Dade County, bringing the total for the year to 14. The Miami Herald reported that it represents an uptick in reported cases of the mosquito-borne tropical disease. It continues to spread rapidly through Latin America, raising concerns that the number of cases in Miami will continue to rise. The Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County said the latest two cases are geographically linked to a travel-related case, but the department didn’t release additional details. Common symptoms of dengue virus include fever and one or more of the following: headache; eye pain; muscle, joint or bone pain; rash; nausea and vomiting; or unusual bleeding such as nose and gum bleeds. The disease is spread through the bite of an Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same insect that also spreads the chikungunya and Zika viruses. According to the Florida Department of Health, Miami-Dade has had the most cases of locally transmitted dengue in the state this year, with only Broward and Hillsborough reporting other cases – one in each county.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp submitted twin plans requesting that President Donald Trump’s administration allow changes to federal government subsidies for health insurance. Kemp said proposed changes to former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act would give individuals and families less expensive coverage options, a particular benefit for those who don’t qualify for federal subsidies to cover premiums. Critics said it would drive up insurance costs for older and sicker people. Kemp also wants to offer subsidized coverage to a fraction of Georgia’s uninsured poor if they worked or went to school for 80 or more hours a month. Kemp’s administration projects the expansion would cover 50,000 people, far less than the 400,000 uninsured Georgians who might be covered by the Medicaid expansion originally envisioned by the overhaul. This second proposal, aimed at people earning incomes of up to 100% of the federal poverty level, echoes those made by other states. Federal officials have rejected some similar partial expansions.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Department of Education won a federal grant of nearly $50 million for a long-term effort to enhance literacy among children, officials said. Education officials said the grant will be used to foster skills from infancy through high school, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy Grant spans five years and will focus on disadvantaged students, officials said. The state education department will begin seeking applicants in January for the effort that will use techniques grounded in data. The funds will supplement current instruction combined with other approaches known to be effective, from family education and engagement to ensuring educators at all levels have necessary tools and training, officials said. The $49.8 million grant will be divided among grade levels, with 40% to elementary schools, 40% to secondary schools and 15% to early education from birth to age 5. The remaining 5% at the state level will cover grant administration and program monitoring, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Environmental groups have written a letter to the U.S. Forest Service requesting more time for public comment on plans for Idaho’s Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest. The coalition of a dozen environmental advocacy organizations sent a letter to the agency Monday asking for a 90-day extension because of interruptions caused by the holiday season, The Lewiston Tribune reported. The letter to Nez Perce-Clearwater Supervisor Cheryl Probert said the Dec. 20 release of the draft forest plan revision and environmental impact statement effectively removes about two weeks from the 90-day comment period. Even those with time to examine the document are not likely to be able to reach forest service employees during holiday break periods, the groups said. The Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest did not immediately return a call from the Associated Press on Tuesday. The two draft documents released by the forest service broadly describe the management of Nez Perce-Clearwater for the next 15 to 20 years. The documents are revisions of the individual Nez Perce and Clearwater forest plans that were last updated in 1987.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new study has found no evidence to corroborate that a beaver-skin stovepipe hat – for years a centerpiece of Illinois’ Abraham Lincoln museum – ever belonged to the 16th U.S. president, according to a published report. Among the findings spelled out in a 54-page report was that the hat, once appraised at $6.5 million, didn’t appear to be Lincoln’s size and that descendants of the original collectors weren’t aware of the claim Lincoln had owned it, WBEZ reported Tuesday, citing a copy of the study. The 16-month study also criticized a lack of due diligence to verify any link between the hat and Lincoln before it was purchased in 2007 and went on display at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield. The hat was later purchased in 2007 by the private Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation from collector Louise Taper for display at the Springfield museum. It was the headliner in a wider Taper collection, for which the foundation paid around $25 million. The collection also included the bloodied gloves Lincoln wore to the theater the night he was shot. With secret doubts of their own, the private foundation sought to authenticate the hat over recent years, including a failed attempt to match DNA on the hat to Lincoln.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: A group working to create a monument to the lead character in “Star Trek: Voyager,” Capt. Kathryn Janeway, has met its crowdfunding campaign goal of $12,500. The Captain Janeway Bloomington Collective will receive matching funds from the Indiana Housing & Community Development. That gives them enough to build it. Peter Kaczmarcyk and his wife, Mary Beth, have headed up efforts to create the monument this year. On May 23 – three days after Bloomington-native Janeway’s fictional birthday in the 24th century – a bust bearing the likeness of actress Kate Mulgrew will be unveiled in downtown Bloomington. Included in the design is a limestone base in the shape of the Starfleet insignia; and an informational table with information about the USS Voyager captain, series writer and producer Jeri Taylor and their local connections. Taylor is also a Bloomington native and earned her bachelor’s degree from Indiana University in 1959. Initially, the unveiling was planned for May 20, the character’s birthday, but Kaczmarczyk said so many people expressed interest in attending that they decided to move it to the weekend.\n\nIowa\n\nWashington: A former bricklayer made a deal with a retirement home that when he became a resident, it would to allow him to put up a display of model trains. Jim Bennett of Washington said the holiday season is his favorite time for the past 10 years because he gets to practice and display his enthusiasm for being a train engineer, KCRG-TV reported. His train display is in the lobby of the United Presbyterian Home in the town of 7,400 people about 50 miles south of Cedar Rapids. He has posted hours of operation so that visitors can see it for more than three hours on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and Bennett said he will likely leave the display up through February. Bennett said he has always loved building toy trains, repairing them and watching them cruise around the tracks. But as he got older and moved into the retirement home, he worried he would not have a chance to ever bring out the sets again.\n\nKansas\n\nOsawatomie: Fire officials said a driver for the U.S. Postal Service “saved Christmas” after his delivery truck caught fire. The Wichita Eagle reported that firefighters in Osawatomie on Sunday posted photos on the volunteer department’s Facebook page of the smoldering and badly damaged engine compartment of the mail truck. The area of the driver’s seat also appeared to be damaged. But several packages, including Amazon Prime shipping boxes, were removed by the driver and placed in a ditch a safe distance from the burning vehicle. The driver’s name was not released. “Your Prime delivery may have just lost its Prime,” The Osawatomie Volunteer Fire Department said in the Facebook post. “The good news is, the driver saved Christmas!” Osawatomie is a town of 4,500 residents about 60 miles southwest of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:The Marian Group said Monday it has withdrawn from a development agreement to transform a site in Paristown that was home to the old Urban Government Center. Louisville chose The Marian Group in 2017 to develop the roughly 2-acre lot in Paristown Pointe at 814 Vine St. as the first part of a larger mixed-use development. The developer planned to build 22 modern shotgun homes on the vacant lot, angering some neighbors because it marked an increase from the 12 shotgun homes originally proposed. In a letter Monday to Louisville Forward, the city’s development branch, legal counsel for the developers wrote that the reason for withdrawing was the city’s failure to obtain rezoning, demolition permits and other waivers for the project, which it had to complete by Dec. 31. The development agreement called for the city, not the developer, to be responsible for those tasks. Caitlin Bowling, a spokeswoman for Louisville Forward, said the termination had been received and “we respect their decision.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nAbbeville:A Roman Catholic church decided to disperse some blessings to a local town via crop dusters. According to a Facebook post from the Diocese of Lafayette on Sunday, members of St. Anne Church on Cow Island called upon crop duster pilots to help spread their blessing to the community. The Rev. Matthew Barzare and parishioners of the church loaded 100 gallons of holy water into the planes, and the pilots sprayed the water onto the town and the nearby farms, KATC-TV reported. Parishioners also bought water from their homes to the airstrip to be blessed by Barzare. The idea came from L’Eryn Detraz, a Cow Island native who is a missionary stationed in Ohio. Cow Island is an unincorporated community in Vermilion Parish approximately 38 miles south of Lafayette.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: A University of Maine Cooperative Extension program that provides fresh produce for people in need has reached 3 million pounds of donations. Maine Harvest for the Hunger has existed since 2000 and donated more than 193,000 pounds of produce from more than 120 farms in the state this year. The donations went to more than 200 hunger-relief distribution sites, the university said. In nearly two decades in existence, Harvest for the Hunger has “mobilized Master Gardener Volunteers, home gardeners, farmers, businesses, schools, and civic groups to grow, glean, and donate quality produce to distribution sites (pantries, shelters, community meals) and directly to neighbors in need,” the university said in a statement. The value of the produce harvested this year was estimated at more than $300,000, the university said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:Advanced Industrial Solutions, the United Kingdom’s largest provider of offshore wind industry training, will open a Salisbury facility in early 2020. The new training hub, created in partnership with Salisbury-based welding company ARCON, will begin hiring instructors in February or March, said ARCON President and CEO Katarina Ennerfelt. In total, the number of permanent new jobs at the training center in Northwood Industrial Park will likely be in the dozens, said Salisbury Mayor Jake Day. The safety training – which includes fire, first aid, material handling and working at heights – is required for technicians working on offshore wind projects and is regulated by an international standard under the Global Wind Organisation. As a whole, the renewable energy sector is expected to add 40,000 new jobs nationwide by 2030. Although the first trainees sent to the new facility will likely be training to work on offshore wind projects elsewhere across the U.S., the center will be available to train workers for wind projects set for the waters off Ocean City, Day said. ARCON has operated a welding services training center at its Northwood location since 2015.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Public health officials are seeking organizations to set up centers where people can be monitored after using illicit drugs. These planned “medical observation and monitoring services” would be staffed by nurses and other clinicians, who would monitor the clients’ vital signs, administer oxygen, intravenous fluids and the overdose-reversing drug naloxone if necessary, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday. The clients will be able to remain anonymous and receive counseling, treatment for infections and wounds, and help with obtaining primary health care and addiction treatment. People will not be allowed to use drugs inside these centers, a marked difference from the concept of “safe consumption sites.” The state’s Department of Public Health is seeking bids to create three to five monitoring sites. Each would serve five to 10 people who have taken too much of a sedative, such as heroin or fentanyl, or a stimulant, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. The site locations have not yet been determined. The observation centers were part of a $5 million item in the state budget, which charges the public health department with promoting “harm reduction” to reduce the bad consequences of drug use.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing:A black rhino that is part of a critically endangered species delivered her first calf at a Lansing zoo, officials announced on Christmas Eve. The unnamed calf was born at Potter Park Zoo on Tuesday before 6 a.m. The 12-year-old mother, Doppsee, nuzzled her baby within minutes and the calf was standing up about 90 minutes later, according to the zoo. The calf, which is bonding with its mother, won’t be seen by the public until the spring of next year. Both animals will be monitored closely for the next few weeks. “This is a monumental moment for Potter Park Zoo that has taken our staff years of planning and hard work,” director Cynthia Wagner said. “We are dedicated to conserving rhinos and couldn’t be more excited about this successful black rhino birth.” Zoo officials said that the species is at risk of extinction because of illegal poaching and habitat loss. Dozens of sites are making conservation efforts, zoo officials said. The newborn’s father, Phineus, came to the zoo from Texas in 2017.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: A light breeze and blue skies greeted a 30-by-60-foot American flag as it was unfurled for the first time Friday during a ceremony at Minnesota Truck Headquarters. The flag will fly atop a 150-foot flagpole, the largest dedicated flagpole in the state, according to general manager Rick Wildtraut. A tower at Millerbernd Manufacturing in Winsted is taller, but that light tower is used for other purposes for most of the year. A flag is flown on holidays and during the town’s festival and is not on daily display. In June, Ryan Electric built a 100-foot-tall flagpole at their offices in St. Cloud. The tallest flagpole in the U.S. is 400 at the Acuity Insurance company between Green Bay and Milwaukee.\n\nMississippi\n\nMcComb: A scraggly metal Christmas tree planted in a pothole has inspired a minister to pen a holiday song. The Rev. Leon Hitchens of Webb Chapel Church in Liberty wrote “Pothole Christmas Tree” after local radio host Fern Crossley showed him the makeshift holiday scene, the Enterprise-Journal of McComb reported. The song celebrates John Drummond, who stuck the base of a wire Christmas tree into the traffic cone sticking out of the pothole. Neighbors decorated it with tinsel, ornaments and a large star on the top. An Associated Press account went worldwide, leading to additional coverage by Fox News. Drivers are now going out of their way to check out the pothole and its decoration. The city board said at last week’s meeting that crews are repairing poles as tight finances allow, and a $3.2 million bond issue dedicated to street paving might let the city fill others. Although many people take down their Christmas trees by New Year’s Day, it’s uncertain whether the city will have the pothole fixed by then.\n\nMissouri\n\nCalifornia: A mid-Missouri couple is donating more than 3,000 pairs of socks to homeless people as part of a program to honor their late son. The Columbia Missourian reported that Janet and Edward Miller of California started Gentle Ben’s Socks for the Homeless in memory of their son, Ben, who died of a brain aneurysm in 2017 at age 34. Janet Miller said socks are the most needed and least donated items for homeless people. The couple collected 900 pairs of socks in their first year. This year, the goal was 2,000 pairs, but they ended up with 3,100 pairs. The socks were donated at collection bins in California and Jefferson City. The socks will be donated to three Columbia organizations that help the homeless.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Warm temperatures and a lack of snow in the Kalispell area has led to the cancellation of a planned skijoring competition this weekend. Skijoring is a winter sport where skiers are pulled by horses through a course and over jumps. Organizers of Skijoring at Rebecca Farm said the events scheduled for Saturday and Sunday have been canceled and would not be rescheduled. Last year’s planned event was postponed to March 2019, also because of a lack of snow. Then, the first day of the competition was canceled because of severe cold. Skijoring America lists eight other competitions this season, including five more in Montana and one each in Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming.\n\nNebraska\n\nEustis: A western Nebraska woman is known in her town as “The Santa Lady” because she has collected more than 9,000 items related to jolly old Saint Nick over 50-plus years. The North Platte Telegraph reported that Santa items fill both floors and every room, including the bathrooms, of Nancy Laier’s home in Eustis, a village of about 370 people about 165 miles west of Lincoln. She gives tours of her home – but asks that visitors call in advance to make sure she’s home. Laier said she began her collection sometime in the 1960s, when the first Pizza Hut restaurant came to North Platte, about 50 miles to the northwest. She said it had a drawing for a Santa doll; she entered her infant son, and he won. She said she found a lot of items when others threw them away.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Tire chains or vehicles with FWD/AWD with snow tires were required if people were trying to drive over Donner Summit on Interstate 80 or the Mt. Rose Highway on Wednesday morning, according to the Nevada Department of Transportation. Chains were also required at Lake Tahoe on SR-28 from the Nevada/California state line in Crystal Bay to U.S. 50 near South Lake. Snowfall over Donner Summit on Tuesday night closed Interstate 80 because of several spinouts over the summit, but the road has reopened. The chain controls were later dropped for travel on Interstate 80.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State police helped to deliver a baby on Interstate 93 early Christmas morning. State police posted the news and a photo with the baby and parents at the hospital on social media Wednesday morning. State police Sgt. Vincent Grieco, Trooper Ryan St. Cyr and Boscawen Police Officer Ryan Nolan helped welcome baby Dominic into the world in Concord shortly after midnight, WMUR-TV reported. “All are happy, healthy and overjoyed to be spending Christmas together,” the state police post said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Thirteen bears were killed last week as the state concluded the second phase of its black bear hunt, according to wildlife officials. The hunt initially was scheduled for six days and ended Dec. 14, with 37 bears being culled overall. But it was extended for four more days because the harvest objectives for the year had not been met, and the hunt resumed Dec. 18. The state’s bear management policy mandates that the hunting season will be extended by four days if less than 20% of tagged bears are killed. The harvest rate for the season stood at 14.7% when the decision to extend the hunt was made, marking the third straight year that the hunt has been prolonged. That harvest rate is deemed necessary to provide better ecological balance to the bear population and reduce the potential for bear-human encounters. Officials have said 265 bears were harvested during the first phase of the hunt, which took in place in October. Overall, 315 bruins were killed during this year’s hunts.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials are urging residents and visitors to spend some time outside on the first day of the year. The State Parks Division is holding a series of hikes at nine state parks on New Year’s Day as part of the annual First Day Hikes initiative. In addition to the hikes, visitors can also participate in Polar Bear Plunges at Storrie Lake State Park in Las Vegas and Eagle Nest Lake State Park in Eagle Nest. The participating parks range from Navajo Lake State Park in the northwest corner to Cerrillos Hills near Santa Fe and Pancho Villa and Leasburg Dam parks in southern New Mexico. At Elephant Butte, the dam is only open to pedestrian traffic one day a year for First Day Hikes. The New Year’s Day tradition happens nationwide. Last year, the National Association of State Park Directors reported that nearly 55,000 people rang in the New Year, collectively hiking more than 133,000 miles throughout the country on the guided hikes.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city is expanding a program to use mobile units to reach hundreds of people who are mentally ill, the city announced Monday. The city said in a release that it will spend $9.4 million to boost its mobile mental health treatment teams, which were launched in 2016. The city said the new money will be part of a $21 million investment that will lead to the hiring of more social workers, housing specialists and legal assistance employees. The additional workers will be needed to process the 20% increase in mental health referrals the effort is expected to generate, the city said, adding that it will likely reach 900 more people annually. In addition, the city said it plans to spend $11 million to create hospital-based outreach teams to coordinate care for people who frequent emergency rooms and acute care facilities.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A college student hailed by police as a hero for preventing more injuries and deaths after a gunman opened fire in a classroom has been immortalized as a Jedi by the production company for the Star Wars franchise. News outlets reported the family of Riley Howell, a University of North Carolina at Charlotte student who is described as a huge Star Wars fan, was tipped off by Lucasfilm in May that it planned to honor him in a forthcoming book, “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - The Visual Dictionary.” Howell, 21, and a classmate died April 30 when a gunman opened fire in a classroom in the Kennedy building on UNCC’s campus. Four other students were injured, but police said Howell’s actions prevented more injuries or loss of life. The book was released by publisher DK to coincide with the release of the film “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” The entry in the book is just 66 words, but credits Jedi master and historian “Ri-Lee Howell” with collecting “many of the earliest accounts of exploration and codifications of The Force.” Howell’s mother, Natalie Henry-Howell, told The Charlotte Observer this marks the second time her son has appeared in a “Star Wars” book: When he was younger, an uncle had a personalized book made for Riley that put him in the starring role of “The Phantom Menace.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Firefighters continued a 30-year tradition of delivering gifts to children at hospitals in Fargo on Christmas Day. KFGO-AM reported the tradition began in 1990 when the 3-year-old son of a Fargo firefighter was hospitalized and worried that Santa Claus would not be able to find him. The gifts this year are given in memory of Keaton Nelson, who made his Make-a-Wish be for gifts to be delivered to other hospitalized children. Nelson died from complications from Cystic Fibrosis.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Bureau of Motor Vehicles plans to begin a vehicle safety recall notification program using the state’s vehicle registration renewal process. Vehicle safety recall information will be printed on registration renewal notices sent through the mail, the bureau said in a news release. Customers will begin receiving open recall notifications beginning in January under the new program. Drivers who are not the original owners of a vehicle might not be aware of an open recall, officials said. An open recall will not interfere with a Ohioans’ ability to renew their vehicle registration, according to the bureau. BMV customers are advised to check their Vehicle Identification Numbers for open recalls by using the VIN look-up tool on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website. They also can contact their authorized dealer.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt’s top adviser on tribal issues announced her resignation on Monday and accused the governor of creating an ‘unnecessary conflict’ with the tribes over casino gambling. Lisa Billy, a former Republican lawmaker and Stitt’s secretary of Native American Affairs, said in her resignation letter that Stitt’s position on the compacts poses a threat to the state’s economy and its relationship with the tribes. Stitt said in a statement he was grateful for Billy’s service and he remains committed to working collaboratively with the tribes. `The governor caught many tribal leaders off guard last summer when he announced in a newspaper editorial that he wanted to renegotiate the compacts. The sides have been locked in a dispute ever since about whether the compacts expire on Jan. 1. Stitt claims they do, but the tribes maintain triggers have been met for the compacts to automatically renew.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The Salem and Brooks vegetable processing plants owned by bankrupt NORPAC Foods could soon reopen after Lineage Logistics filed to purchase the company’s Oregon properties for $49 million, according to court records. The Statesman-Journal reported that a bankruptcy judge is scheduled to hear the petition for the proposed sale Jan. 14 in bankruptcy court in Portland. The sale would include NORPAC’s Willamette Valley processing facilities in Salem, Brooks and Stayton, along with the field shop in Quincy, Washington. NORPAC attorney Al Kennedy said in court that Lineage Logistics will lease the plants in Salem and Brooks from NORPAC until the sale is completed. And Lineage would lease those to Oregon Potato Company to operate until the sale is done, which would allow some of the 1,400 NORPAC workers who had been notified they could be laid off to continue to work. Lineage Logistics, which was formed in 2008, is one of the largest cold storage companies in the world, including operating 169 cold storage warehouses in the United States and more in countries such as China and the United Kingdom.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWashington Crossing: Thousands turned out Wednesday to watch the annual reenactment of George Washington’s daring Christmas Day crossing of the Delaware River in 1776 – the first time the crossing was completed in three years. The event was scrapped because of bad weather the last two years, but historical interpreter Nancy O’Leary said at Washington Crossing Historical Park that the conditions this year “couldn’t be better.” Jennifer Martin, executive director of the Friends of Washington Crossing Park. estimated that 4,500 to 5,000 people were watching the event, the highlight of a historical reenactment that draws people to the banks of the river in Washington Crossing and Titusville, New Jersey. Other activities included Washington’s address to his troops, historical speeches and processions, and staff in period clothing providing public interpretation. In the original crossing, boats ferried 2,400 soldiers, 200 horses and 18 cannons across the river. Washington’s troops marched 8 miles downriver before battling Hessian mercenaries in the streets of Trenton, New Jersey. Thirty Hessians were killed, and two Continental soldiers froze to death on the march.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers returning to the State House after the holidays will notice some subtle changes to the House and Senate chambers. When lawmakers return in January, they will see new shades of paint on the walls, feel thicker carpet under their feet, sit at revarnished desks, brush past brighter drapes and listen to each other’s speeches on new audio speakers, according to The Providence Journal. In addition, the cracked skylight above the House Speaker’s desk has been repaired as has the domed roof above the Senate chamber, which often leaked when it rained. It was the first significant chamber renovation since the General Assembly downsized in 2003 from 150 seats to the current 113. That renovation also brought computers to lawmakers’ desks for the first time.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFolly Beach: A Charleston-area landmark will be lit up for the holidays. The Post and Courier reportsed that Dominion Energy and a group dedicated to saving the Morris Island Lighthouse will illuminate the lighthouse from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. The lighthouse also was illuminated on Christmas Day. Dominion spokesperson Persida Montanez said engineers will use 12-volt batteries, LED lights and a solar panel to provide light. The lighthouse was constructed in 1876, but has faced severe erosion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Area schools and two radio stations raised more than $14,000 to give gift cards to students who don’t have a permanent address this year. In all, the Rapid City Journal reported Tuesday that 573 students will each receive $25 Visa gift cards. The radio stations that helped in the effort were 97.9 the Breeze and KLMP. It was part of a campaign called “Hope for the Homeless.” During the four years the schools and radio stations collaborated on the effort, they haved raised nearly $45,000 for gifts to homeless middle and high school students.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee’s county health department clinics are offering flu vaccines at no charge. Tennessee Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey encouraged anyone who has not received a flu shot this season to get one as soon as possible. The state Health Department suggested contacting local health departments for information. Information about nearby departments is available online. Free flu vaccines are also available at the Shelby County Health Department in Memphis and the Metro Public Health Department in Nashville, in addition to health departments run by the state throughout Tennessee, the state said. Even after being vaccinated, the state Health Department recommends washing hands with soapy water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers and covering coughs and sneezes with a sleeve or tissue to help prevent the spread of illness. People who are sick should stay home so they can recover and avoid infecting others.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A resident who was diagnosed with measles is no longer a health threat, but officials are urging some people to get medical attention if they develop a fever before New Year’s Day. Public health officials made the plea to anyone who visited specific Austin locations that the affected resident was in between Dec. 14 and Dec. 17. The Austin American-Statesman created a map of those locations. The resident is currently not in Texas. Measles is a virus that can cause high fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A rash appears 3 to 5 days after the first symptoms, but other complications include pneumonia and encephalitis. Health officials first alerted people in Austin about the measles case and potential exposure on Sunday, a day after state agencies were informed by Virginia officials, said Dr. Mark Escott, the interim health authority at Austin Public Health. The person traveled to Virginia on Dec. 17. The person, whom officials are not identifying, contracted the disease while traveling in Europe from late November to early December and became sick on Dec. 14, Escott said. He noted that the person developed a rash on Dec. 17, which is the day they boarded United Airlines Flight 790 from Austin to Chicago, with a connecting flight to Virginia. The person’s measles case is the first reported in Travis County since 1999, the Statesman reported. Officials didn’t disclose if the person was vaccinated.\n\nUtah\n\nBrighton: A second ski resort near Salt Lake City is changing its parking policy to favor carpooling amid concerns about traffic congestion in a canyon home to popular ski resorts. Starting Wednesday, Brighton Resort designated prime parking areas for visitors with three people or more in their cars on holidays like Christmas that are often popular days to ski, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Officials said the policy applies to weekends, holidays and powder days. It could encourage more people to share cars or take public transportation on days when cars full of skiers can lead to long lines of traffic snaking through the snow-covered mountains. Single drivers or those with one passenger must park at a further lot, where a shuttle service will ferry them to the lifts. When that lot near the resort store is full, people will be asked to turn around and park along the road, or return to the mouth of the canyon and take public transit. The move comes after neighboring Solitude Mountain Resort, also in Big Cottonwood Canyon, made the unusual move to start charging noncarpooling guests $20 to park. The price drops to $10 if the car has three occupants and $5 for four or more people. Park staffers have said their goal isn’t to make money but rather to ease traffic gridlock. Season pass holders at both Brighton and Solitude can ride free on the canyon bus routes offered by the Utah Transit Authority.\n\nVermont\n\nJericho: The Army Mountain Warfare School in Jericho will get $30 million in federal funding for a new facility, the Vermont National Guard announced this week. The funding is part of the defense budget signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Groundbreaking is likely to happen late next year, the Guard said. Members of the school provided mountain warfare and cold-weather training to U.S. and Afghan conventional operations forces on deployments in 2005 and 2010, the Guard said. Instructors served as experts on mountain warfare in Afghanistan. The $30 million appropriation will support “a critically important but previously unfunded priority of the Army,” said U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy in a written statement on Monday. The design of the 82,600-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility will start as early as January, said Michael Bleau, deputy construction and facilities management officer. Construction is expected to be completed in early 2022, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRaven: A company that owns a coal mine has furloughed 600 workers until the end of the year. The reported reason behind the move is the trade war between the U.S. and China. The Bristol Herald Courier reported Monday that Coronado Coal idled its mining facility in Buchanan County on Dec. 16. Tarah Kesterson, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, said the company cited the trade war between China and the U.S. as a reason for the furlough. But she said the company also plans to bring the mine back into full production by Jan. 1. Coronado did not specify what it was looking for between China and the U.S. But tensions appeared to ease earlier this month with the announcement of a “Phase One” trade deal. China has agreed to buy an additional $200 billion worth of American goods and services. That agreement is expected to be signed in January. The idling of the mine in Buchanan County caps a tumultuous year for southwest Virginia’s coal industry. The region also saw the bankruptcy of Blackjewel LLC. The firm employed more than 480 people in the state.\n\nWashington\n\nNorth Bend: The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Police is asking for the public’s help to find the person or people who killed three cow elks and left them to waste in North Bend. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that police said in a Facebook post that three cow elks were found the weekend of Dec. 14 shot with archery equipment and left to die in the area behind Ken’s Truck Town Diner in North Bend. Two of the elks were found with matching arrows, and the third was found with a different type of arrow and broad head. Police said that those who provide information leading to an arrest might be eligible for a cash reward or bonus points for special permit hunting opportunities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: Eligible employees at Mon Health System will soon be offered 14 straight days of paid parental leave. Mon Health System President and CEO David Goldberg announced in a news release that the new policy will take effect at the start of the new year. WBOY-TV reported that if both spouses or partners are employed by Mon Health, each will be afforded the same benefit. Mon Health also operates Mon Health Preston Memorial Hospital and Mon Health Stonewall Jackson Memorial Hospital. Congress passed a bill earlier this month giving the country’s 2.1 million government employees 12 weeks of paid parental leave as part of a defense bill that President Donald Trump signed into law. But it still leaves about 80% of U.S. workers in the private sector with no access to paid family leave. The U.S. is one of a handful of countries that lacks a federal policy, at least for new mothers, leaving employers to decide whether to offer it.\n\nWisconsin\n\nRib Mountain: The Salvation Army in Wausau said it got to 80% of its $170,000 Red Kettle fundraising goal before the holiday campaign ended on Christmas Eve. The organization told WSAW-TV donations have dropped in recent years and a lack of volunteers is one of the factors. Lt. Donna Thammavongsa with Wausau’s Salvation Army said another reason for falling short is that people don’t carry as much cash anymore. The Red Kettle campaign is more than 100 years old. It’s the Salvation Army’s largest annual fundraiser.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: No evidence links hydraulic fracturing to contaminated groundwater in central Wyoming, according to a state Department of Environmental Quality report. The contamination near Pavillion likely occurred naturally because of permeable geology in the gas-drilling area, the report released Monday found. However, absence of data from before drilling began in the mid-1900s limits scientists trying to determine the exact source of the contamination, the report stated. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency investigation began in 2008 and led to draft findings in 2011 that theorized a link between the contamination and nearby hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The process uses pressurized water, mixed with sand and chemicals, to split open underground deposits and boost oil and gas production. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry cautioned residents not to drink the water. The EPA, however, didn’t complete its report and handed the investigation over to state officials. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality announced in 2013 it would conduct a thorough study of the 12-square-mile Pavillion gas field with help from $1. million from Encana Oil and Gas USA, Inc., the Canadian-based company operating the site, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Several environmental groups and landowners expressed skepticism about the additional research.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/05/02/kub-breaks-ground-knoxvilles-first-community-solar-array/9615158002/", "title": "Windy Hill Farm and Preserve launches Summer Concert Series ...", "text": "Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nWindy Hill Farm and Preserve launches Summer Concert Series, opens to public\n\nWindy Hill Farm and Preserve will host a Summer Concert Series to celebrate the season, present music from regional and nationally recognized artists and introduce guests to the newly expanded East Tennessee resort.\n\nLocated in Loudon, Windy Hill Farm and Preserve is an all-inclusive boutique resort with accommodations ranging from nine private cabins to an eight-room guesthouse and a spacious farmhouse for groups and large families.

The system continuously monitors maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, contractions, and labor progression to help clinicians quickly identify any concerning developments for faster intervention.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center delivers more than 750 babies each year. Stacy Wood, RN, director of women’s services, indicates this new technology is an important resource to support maternal/fetal health and safe deliveries.\n\n“Every delivery is unique and the health and well-being of every mom and baby is our priority during childbirth,” says Jeanette Toney, MD. “While most births happen without complication, there are some inherent risks in the delivery of a newborn. This new technology adds another layer of protection throughout the labor process to help our maternity team recognize, prevent and respond to avoidable complications.”\n\nThrough pattern recognition, the technology can also pinpoint opportunities for overall improvement based on consolidated data from multiple births.

(June 20, 2022) – A team of University of Tennessee Health Science Center researchers has been awarded $2.19 million from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for their investigation of the neurotoxic effects of toluene, a common chemical found in many household products.\n\nAlex M. Dopico, MD, Van Vleet Chair of Excellence and professor in the Department of Pharmacology, Addiction Science, and Toxicology (PHAST) in the UTHSC College of Medicine, and Anna N. Bukiya, PhD, professor in the same department, are principal investigators on the award. Jeff Steketee, PhD, also professor in the PHAST Department and chair of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, is a co-investigator.\n\nToluene reaches the brain through inhalation. Intoxication with toluene, whether accidental or following recreational use (e.g., “glue sniffing”), leads to dizziness, blurred vision and even neurological deficits with catastrophic outcomes, including death. A reduction in blood flow to the brain is thought to contribute to these toxic effects, but how and why toluene exposure affects the brain circulation is not known.\n\nThe team hypothesizes that toluene reduces the activity of a protein (the BK channel) located in the cerebral artery muscle cells, causing the brain arteries to constrict upon exposure. Performing tests at the molecular level using computational methods, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of BK channel function in animal models, the team aims to identify the specific mechanism and site of action in BK channels that makes cerebral arteries constrict in the presence of toluene. Their tests will include delivering new selective drug therapies for early intervention in toluene-induced brain ischemia.\n\nThe project, titled “Ionic mechanisms of toluene cerebrovascular actions,” is being funded over five years.\n\nAs Tennessee’s only public, statewide, academic health system, the mission of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center is to bring the benefits of the health sciences to the achievement and maintenance of human health through education, research, clinical care, and public service, with a focus on the citizens of Tennessee and the region. The main campus in Memphis includes six colleges: Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy. UTHSC also educates and trains medicine, pharmacy, and/or health professions students, as well as medical residents and fellows, at major sites in Knoxville, Chattanooga and Nashville.

This show and Women Artists: Highlights from the Hunter Museum of American Art (one floor up) document what two important Tennessee cultural organizations are doing to support and empower women artists.\n\nLike the Hunter, the KMA has actively sought to acquire outstanding works by women, who have long lagged behind their male counterparts when it comes to museum-level recognition. The selection on view reflects the broad technical and aesthetic range found in contemporary art by women. A mixed media painting on wooden sections by Alison Moritsugu conveys a monumental landscape, expansive yet incomplete. Nancy Rubins elevates graphite drawing into a large sculptural construction apparently shaped by violent forces. British artist Marilène Oliver constructs provocative portraits of her family in the form of acrylic sheets imprinted with digital medical scans. Patty Chang uses water and mirrors to transform her own image taken in a Belgian church into a complex photographic work fragmented by harsh angles and provocative reflections. In her video Joan of Arc, Alex McQuilkin responds to Maria Falconetti’s memorable lead role in the legendary 1928 French silent film by Carl Dreyer, and to the film’s themes of adolescent desire, faith, and suffering. These and other selected works call overdue attention to women’s significant role in reshaping the contemporary art landscape.\n\nThe artists featured in this exhibition are Patty Chang, Janet Fish, Marcia Goldenstein, Michelle Grabner, EJ Hauser, Julie Heffernan, Jean Hess, Kate Katomski, Karen LaMonte, Pam Longobardi, Lauren Luloff, Alex McQuilkin, Alison Mortisugu, Althea Murphy-Price, Marilène Oliver, Amy Pleasant, Sumi Putman, Nancy Rubins, Tommie Rush, Denise Stewart-Sanabria, Jemima Stehli, and Toots Zynsky.\n\nOle Red Gatlinburg to celebrate Fourth of July with midnight parade patio party\n\nGatlinburg, Tenn. – Ole Red Gatlinburg will offer one of the best ways to celebrate Fourth of July this year when they host their Midnight Parade Patio Party during the annual Gatlinburg parade.

(Tuesday, June 7, 2022) — Summer must be on the way! School is out, temperatures are quickly climbing, and a popular promotion has returned to Dollywood and Dollywood’s Splash Country. During Sevier County Days, anyone who lives or works in Sevier County can visit their favorite hometown theme park or water park for just $5, while also helping their neighbors at the same time.\n\nSevier County Days takes place June 13-19 at Dollywood theme park and now-June 12 at Dollywood’s Splash Country water park. Residents and workers in the county can visit the award-winning parks for a $5 donation to Sevier County Food Ministries. All proceeds from the visits go to the food ministries, helping the non-profit provide support within the community.\n\n“We are always proud to partner with Jim Davis and his phenomenal staff at Sevier County Food Ministries,” said Carol Agee, Dollywood Community Affairs and Philanthropy Manager. “As kids are now out of school for summer, demand for the food ministries increases because those school lunches aren’t available for families who need them. We encourage families in that situation to visit the food ministry because the team there does an exemplary job of assisting those in the community who need it. We partner with them because their mission of taking care of families is part of who we are as well.”\n\nTo take advantage of Sevier County Days, Sevier County residents must present a state- or federally-issued photo identification with a valid Sevier County zip code at any designated Dollywood (June 13-19) or Dollywood’s Splash Country (now- June 12) ticket booth. Those who work in Sevier County but are not residents must present proof of employment as well as a state- or federally-issued photo identification matching the paycheck stub. Full details and eligible zip codes also are available by visiting Dollywood.com/SevierCountyDays.\n\nAs an added bonus for making the donation to the food ministries, the Sevier County Days ticket receives full upgrade value toward the purchase of a 2022 season pass.\n\nDollywood first started giving to Sevier County Food Ministries in 1998. Since that time, total contributions to the food ministry are more than $1.4 million. In addition to monetary support, Sevier County Food Ministries always accepts passionate volunteers ready to serve others through their efforts.

Ever notice those historical markers along Volunteer Landing? They tell a non-chronological story of soldiers, authors, and sailors who had something to do with Knoxville's waterfront since 1791, connecting Cherokee chiefs to the Civil War to the Tennessee Vols. Jack Neely, historian of the Knoxville History Project, did the research for those markers back in the 1990s, and will help tell the stories, including that of Vagabondia, the long-vanished riverfront home of author Frances Hodgson Burnett that inspired the title of one of her early novels. It was surprisingly near the ramshackle houseboat home of Cornelius Suttree, the stoic protagonist of a very different novel by Cormac McCarthy. This year, Jack will also talk about the role the riverfront played in the 1982 World's Fair.

As one of the most sought-after youth sports complexes in the country, Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge will be able to host teams from around the country on 10 total fields, including access to the newly renovated fields at Pigeon Forge’s Wear Farm City Park.\n\nThe park’s four fields will be completely upgraded and reimagined prior to the start of the 2023 season. Similar to the original six fields at Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge which opened in 2016, each field at Wear Farm City Park will become a youth replica of famous Major League Baseball parks of the past and present.\n\nResidents of Pigeon Forge will benefit from the renovations as Wear Farm City Park will continue to host tournaments throughout the year on state-of-the-art artificial turf that closely replicates real grass.\n\n“Every year, our teams and their families take home countless fond memories of the Pigeon Forge area when they participate in The Ripken Experience™,” said Cal Ripken, Jr., who co-founded Ripken Baseball with his brother Bill Ripken. “The views are unbelievable and the feeling you have when you experience our complex is special. The demand to play here is through the roof. This is an exciting opportunity to expand and welcome even more baseball families to Pigeon Forge.”\n\nWear Farm City Park’s four fields will be transformed into youth replicas of the following big league stadiums: St. Louis’ Busch Stadium, Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium, and Cincinnati’s Riverfront Stadium. The $3 million renovation project will begin this summer.\n\n“Pigeon Forge’s partnership with Ripken Baseball is a successful one, as demonstrated by the annual increase in demand for the ball fields and the direct impact on our city’s tourism industry due to the many families who visit,” said Pigeon Forge City Manager Earlene Teaster. “The upgrades to Wear Farm City Park are a win-win for The Ripken Experience™ and our Pigeon Forge residents as these fields bring vast improvements for everyone to enjoy.”\n\nPigeon Forge residents and local youth teams will enjoy the renovations immediately following completion. The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge’s access to Wear Farm City Park applies primarily to daytime hours during the summer season, allowing the four baseball fields to remain available for Pigeon Forge residents during evenings, weekends, and most Fridays. The addition of artificial turf provides longer days during the winter months (November through early March), earlier year-round start times, and quicker turnaround during the event of rain. Wear Farm City Park is open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The park, which also has soccer and youth football facilities, will continue to host youth baseball leagues.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts more than 1,000 teams annually from over 30 states, traveling from as far away as California, Alaska, and overseas. Players’ families, many of whom are first-time visitors to Pigeon Forge, have a significant impact on the Pigeon Forge economy. A 2018 economic impact study attributed $33.8 million in visitor spending to The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge during the facility’s nine-month season that year.\n\nThe appeal of Pigeon Forge as a family vacation destination was a major reason the city built the $22.5 million complex and contracted with Ripken Baseball to operate it. During seven seasons of operations, the facility has solidified Pigeon Forge as a major sports tourism destination. In addition, research indicates that 99 percent of those who visit the facility reside outside of Sevier County.\n\nTournament participants, coaches, and their families contribute to the local economy through overnight lodging stays ticket purchases to area attractions, restaurant dining, and other purchases.\n\nPigeon Forge is located in Sevier County just six miles from the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nSince opening its doors in March 2016, more than 5,000 youth baseball teams and 250 high school softball teams have taken to the six fields at The Ripken Experience Pigeon Forge. In total, more than 75,000 players and coaches have traveled to play ball on fields that offer unobstructed views of the Great Smoky Mountains, with an additional 1,000 teams expected to travel to the complex for competition in 2022.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge is located on a ridge above Pigeon Forge. Each field borrows its design inspiration from current and former ballparks highlighting the professional player progression from the Minor to Major Leagues, including Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore.\n\nThe others are Calfee Park in Pulaski, Va., the oldest park in the Appalachian League; Fluor Field in Greenville, S.C., known as “Little Fenway”; Engel Stadium in Chattanooga, Tenn., a filming location for the “42” movie about Jackie Robinson; BB&T Ballpark in Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Isotopes Park in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts tournaments nine months out of the year and offers year-round branded events in its 14,000-square-foot clubhouse. Tournaments are free to spectators, and parking is free at the complex.\n\nVisitor information about Pigeon Forge is available online at MyPigeonForge.com and toll-free at 800-251-9100.

(May 24, 2022) – Today, Anakeesta announced a brand-new, nighttime immersive experience with Canadian-based multimedia entertainment studio, Moment Factory. The Lumina Night Walk will be the first of its kind in the United States. The stellar journey of discovery will offer the City of Gatlinburg a new nighttime offering unlike anything else in the country.

We hope this fantastical outdoor adventure sparks a new interest in Tennessee for visitors.”\n\n“Anakeesta’s continued investment with the Lumina Night Walk will give Gatlinburg visitors an exciting and innovative entertainment option in the evening,” said Mayor Mike Werner of Gatlinburg. “This experience will continue to add to the many reasons that visitors will have to choose Gatlinburg as their vacation destination.”\n\nG", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/23/sea-dragons-human-compost-lego-dinosaurs-news-around-states/39507035/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nCullman: Country music star Hank Williams Jr. is offering a $6,000 reward for his grandfather’s missing shotgun. The singer known for hits including “Family Tradition” has posted a letter online saying he spent time growing up in south Alabama with his grandfather. The letter says he can’t locate the man’s old Remington Model 11-48 shotgun, which he wants to pass on. An attorney for Williams, Steve Smith, says the gun is believed to be lost, not stolen. The reward is being offered with no questions asked. Smith says the 16-gauge shotgun was likely last seen at a lake cabin or house near Cullman. He says the reward offer has generated a few tips. Williams sang about the man who owned the shotgun in his 1973 song “Grandpa Shepherd.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s fledgling commercial seaweed industry is growing, with producers excited about this year’s harvest. The Anchorage Daily News reports there were no commercial seaweed farmers in Alaska five years ago. An official with the Commercial Fisheries Division of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game says 16 aquatic farming operations now are permitted to culture species of seaweed. According to the World Aquaculture Society, seaweed worldwide is a $6 billion business. Most is harvested in Korea, Japan and China; dried; and used for seasoning. Blue Evolution, a California-based company, has worked with researchers at the University of Alaska Southeast on ways to commercially farm kelp rather than harvest wild kelp beds. The company sells seed stock to some Alaska kelp farmers and buys back mature kelp.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has banned prisoners from reading a book that discusses the impact of the criminal justice system on black men. The American Civil Liberties Union is calling on the Arizona Department of Corrections to rescind a ban on “Chokehold: Policing Black Men.” The book by former federal prosecutor Paul Butler examines the treatment of African American men by law enforcement and in mass incarceration. Butler says his publisher was notified of the ban in March. But it didn’t specify what led to the decision. The Georgetown University criminal law professor says he explicitly disavows violence in the book. Corrections spokesman Andrew Wilder said the department hadn’t yet received the ACLU’s letter asking for the ban to be reversed. ACLU attorney Emerson Sykes says it’s not uncommon for states to ban certain books.\n\nArkansas\n\nBella Vista: A property owner’s association is warning residents about the unhealthy air near an underground fire that’s been burning for 10 months at a former unlicensed dump in northwest Arkansas. Crews began fighting the fire Saturday at the Trafalgar Road site in Bella Vista, about 170 miles northwest of Little Rock. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that Bella Vista Property Owners Association’s chief operating officer Tom Judson says the goal is to quench the fire within 30 days. The fire that’s burning at least 70 feet underground was first reported in July. Some residents say smoke from the fire has caused respiratory and other health problems. The Legislature passed a bill in March appropriating $20 million to help clean up the fire.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLa Jolla: A Southern California aquarium has built what is believed to be one of the world’s largest habitats for sea dragons, the lesser-known cousin of the seahorse. The Birch Aquarium at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego hopes the exhibit will lead to the leafy sea dragon being bred for the first time in captivity. The sea dragons’ native populations off Australia are threatened by pollution, warming oceans, and the illegal pet and alternative medicine trades. Few aquariums have sea dragons. There are only two types of sea dragons, the leafy and the weedy, and each represents its own genus. Both kinds are found only in a small area of temperate waters off the southern and western coasts of Australia. The California exhibit opened this month.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The City Council narrowly voted Tuesday against asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review its ban on women going topless in public, which lower courts have banned it from enforcing. The 4-3 vote still gives the city the option to seek the high court’s intervention if settlement agreements with Free the Nipple-Fort Collins break down. But the council majority hoped to drop the matter. “There’s some fatigue,” council member Kristin Stephens said. “We pursued this legal recourse, and it didn’t work out for us.” The city has been grappling with its ban on women knowingly exposing their breasts in public since 2015, when activist Brit Hoagland started protesting it. It led the council to update the public indecency ordinance, though it left in place the ban on women going topless in public, with certain exemptions. Hoagland and fellow activist Samantha Six sued the city in 2016.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Restaurants and caterers in the state would no longer be able to provide customers with single-use expanded polystyrene food containers under legislation that has cleared the House of Representatives. The proposed ban, which passed Tuesday on a 121-23 vote, would take effect July 1, 2021. It now awaits Senate action. Proponents say the legislation is needed to discourage the use of the containers and reduce litter, noting expanded polystyrene containers can take 200 years to break down in a landfill. Some noted that many restaurants, such as Dunkin’ Donuts, have already begun to swap out these products with greener options. The bill was narrowed to caterers and restaurants in permanent buildings following some concern it was too broad. There are exceptions for pre-packaged food, raw meat and seafood. Violators would face fines.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state has two of the best cities in the country for summer job opportunities, according to a new study from WalletHub. Dover ranked fourth and Wilmington ranked fifth on the list, which focused on 16- to 24-year-olds searching for part-time work or internship opportunities between school years. To create the ranking, WalletHub developed 21 criteria – ranging from availability of summer jobs and internships to its own lifestyle metrics – and divided them into two main categories, youth job market and social environment and affordability. Each criterion was given its own subjective weight and score on a scale of 0-100. The cumulative score after each criterion was weighted, determined the ranking. Dover and Wilmington rank near the top in both availability of internships and growth in summer employment.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Board of Elections has approved a petition to recall a city councilman who used his position to solicit business from area lobbyists. The Washington Post reports the board unanimously voted Monday to approve the recall effort of Ward 2 Councilman Jack Evans. Volunteers now have roughly three months to collect about 5,200 Ward 2 signatures to unseat Evans, who is under federal investigation over his relationships with private legal and consulting clients. Email records show he pitched himself to lobbyists, arguing they should employ him because of his influence as the city’s longest-serving lawmaker and area transit board chair. The council formally reprimanded Evans in March and voted to remove him from several oversight positions. The transit agency has launched an internal investigation.\n\nFlorida\n\nWesley Chapel: Authorities say a teen has been charged with threatening a school shooting in a postcard to Santa and signing a classmate’s name last fall. The Tampa Bay Times reports that the 15-year-old boy was arrested Monday and charged with making written threats to kill or do bodily harm. The Pasco County Sheriff’s Office says the holiday postcard was dropped off in November at a Wesley Chapel Macy’s. The note threatened at shooting at nearby Wiregrass Ranch High School. Detectives interviewed a female student whose name was signed to the postcard but ruled her out as a suspect. Authorities say fingerprints on the postcard led to the teen boy, who had a previous misdemeanor arrest.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A lawsuit challenging outdated voting machines and seeking statewide use of hand-marked paper ballots can move forward, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. The lawsuit argues that the paperless touchscreen voting machines Georgia has used since 2002 are unsecure, vulnerable to hacking and unable to be audited. The state’s voting system drew national scrutiny during last year’s midterm election in which Brian Kemp, a Republican who was the state’s chief election officer at the time, narrowly defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams to become Georgia’s governor. State lawyers had asked U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg to dismiss the lawsuit. Totenberg wrote in her order rejecting that request that the state’s arguments “completely ignore the reality faced by election officials across the country underscored by Plaintiffs’ allegations that electronic voting systems are under unceasing attack.”\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Honolulu County has closed a bay to prevent disruption of coral spawning that scientists predicted would occur over two days. West Hawaii Today reported Tuesday that county officials closed Kahaluu Bay to allow the spawning event that was expected Monday through Tuesday on the Big Island. Officials from the Kahaluu Bay Education Center’s ReefTeach program set up a tent at the bay entrance to inform visitors of the temporary closure. An official says the spawning is “critical” for the coral to reproduce and survive. A mass bleaching event in 2015 killed 95% of the cauliflower coral on West Hawaii reefs. Kahaluu Bay is the only park Honolulu County has closed to facilitate a spawning event. The area was also off limits for two half-days in 2018.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal administrative law judge has rejected a plan for public land grazing allotments in south-central Idaho that would have destroyed re-emerging sagebrush in favor of non-native plants to increase forage for cattle and sheep. The ruling last week directs the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to set aside its final grazing decisions for about 80 square miles of allotments in Twin Falls County. The administrative law judge in the Interior Department’s Office of Hearings and Appeals concluded that destroying sagebrush and rabbitbrush to increase livestock forage on public lands couldn’t be justified. Wildlands Defense and Prairie Falcon Audubon in 2017 appealed the Bureau of Land Management’s decision involving 18 permittees on 21 allotments that would have destroyed native plants.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Lincoln Park Zoo says an eastern black rhinoceros named Kapuki has given birth to a calf. The zoo says Kapuki was pregnant for 15 months before the calf was born Sunday night. Zoo staff members monitored her labor and are watching the rhino and her calf remotely using cameras to give them privacy but are nearby. The zoo hasn’t named the calf or announced its sex, but officials say details will be announced once available. The animals won’t be visible to the public until further notice, but people can follow along on the zoo’s Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and at #RhinoWatch on Twitter. Zoo officials say the calf stood up at just 53 minutes of age.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: A restored World War II naval vessel will move to a more prominent location along the Ohio River in the city in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of D-Day. The LST 325 troop landing ship will be docked at the former site of the Tropicana Evansville casino boat June 6-9. Free tours of the ship will be offered. The ship took part in the 1944 D-Day landings in France and was brought back to the U.S. from Greece in 2001 to be restored. City officials had hoped to have the ship permanently moved there by the D-Day anniversary, but a number of delays have postponed that from happening until the end of the year. The ship has been docked a few miles upriver since 2005.\n\nIowa\n\nYale: It was built in 1932 as the state’s first roundhouse of rebounds. Today, it’s one of Iowa’s most treasured historic buildings. The Yale High School Gymnasium, with its distinctive round architectural design, is now listed on the the National Register of Historic Places. In its heyday, it was home to the Yale Bulldogs boys and girls basketball teams and hosted band concerts, commencements, plays and banquets – even the Harlem Globetrotters – until 1961. The gymnasium’s historic significance is tied to its use for team sports (1932-1961) and its association with Halver R. Straight, who received a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois in 1907 and spent his career in the ceramics industry. An inventor as well as an engineer, he held 87 patents for tools and instruments used in clay manufacturing.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has signed into law a bill that would allow profoundly ill people who have been unable to find relief with pharmaceutical medications to avoid prosecution for possessing certain blends of oil extracted from cannabis plants. The cannabidiol oils, also known as CBD, shielded by the Kansas bill could contain no more than 5% THC, the compound that gives marijuana its high. Known as “Claire and Lola’s Law,” it was pushed by Gwen and Scott Hartley, whose 12-year-old daughter, Lola, suffers from microcephaly, a medical condition in which a child’s brain doesn’t fully develop. The condition has already claimed the life of Lola’s older sister, Claire, who died in December 2018 at the age of 17. The law goes into effect July 1.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: With temperatures climbing and a holiday weekend coming up, many swimming pools and beaches at state parks are opening. The Parks Department says while lodge pools are reserved for lodge and cottage guests, community pools at several parks are open to the public for a fee – Greenbo Lake, Carter Caves, Levi Jackson, Blue Licks Battlefield, Cumberland Falls, E.P. “Tom” Sawyer, Kincaid Lake, Natural Bridge and Fort Boonesborough. Also, the park system’s 10 beaches are free and open to the public – Pennyrile Forest, Lake Barkley, Kentucky Dam Village, Barren River Lake, Buckhorn Lake, Rough River Dam, Lake Malone, Nolin Lake, Carr Creek and Green River Lake. Pool openings at Barren River Lake, E.P. “Tom” Sawyer, Levi Jackson and Lake Barkley will be delayed.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state is on track to create a new program that would certify veteran-owned businesses and create a database for consumers to search for them. The House-backed bill easily sped through the Senate commerce committee Wednesday, with Gov. John Bel Edwards, a former Army Ranger, testifying in support of the legislation. The governor says census data indicates Louisiana has 42,000 veteran-owned businesses. The proposal creates the Veterans First Business Initiative in the state’s economic development agency. The department will certify veteran-owned businesses, create an insignia for them to use and display a searchable database on its website for customers who want to find veteran vendors. The measure by Baton Rouge Republican Rep. Franklin Foil moves to the full Senate for debate, one step from final passage.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A legislative committee has voted against a bill to tax water bottler Poland Spring. The Portland Press Herald reports the House and Senate will now consider the legislation. The Legislature’s Taxation Committee voted Tuesday to reject a Democrat’s bill that would have charged Poland Spring 12 cents for every gallon of water extracted for bottling. The legislation is part of years-old unsuccessful efforts to tax the hundreds of millions of gallons that Poland Spring bottles in Maine. The bill targets Poland Spring, which would have paid roughly $115 million under the proposal based on the 960 million gallons extracted last year. Revenues from the tax would fund college tuition grants and Maine’s broadband internet network. Opponents include several Democrats and Republicans who say Poland Spring employs over 800 people in Maine.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Scientists say the health of America’s largest estuary declined last year due to the effects of record-breaking precipitation. Researchers at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science gave the Chesapeake Bay an overall grade of 46% for 2018, down from 54% in 2017. All of the indicators factored into the bay’s health index declined or stayed flat last year. Its letter grade of “C” is unchanged. Last year’s heavy downpours increased runoff sediments, and more pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorous washed into the water. The Baltimore area was deluged with 72 inches of rain, roughly 175% above normal rates. Still, the annual report card released Tuesday stresses that overall trends show the Chesapeake improving significantly over years. Scientists say the bay’s long-term health trajectory remains positive.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A local nonprofit is voicing concern about the continued spread of HIV among residents struggling with opioid addiction. The Whittier Street Health Center said Tuesday that its outreach team identified two new cases of HIV in the notorious illegal drug market around Boston Medical Center in the city’s South End. Dr. Cyril Ubiem, director of infectious disease at the center, says he’s concerned the spread of HIV among Boston’s homeless and addicted population is getting worse, rather than better. The state Department of Public Health says it’s reviewing the center’s reported cases. In January, the agency urged Boston health providers to boost efforts to test patients for HIV after six people were newly diagnosed with the virus, which can lead to AIDS. Massachusetts reported 105 new HIV cases in 2017, up from 30 in 2014.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A new exhibit at the Detroit Historical Museum takes visitors through 150 years of life in the city’s Corktown neighborhood. Called “The Journey to Now,” the exhibit opened this month and is scheduled to run through July 7. The exhibit is hosted by the nonprofit organization Corktown Experience in conjunction with Wayne State University’s Anthropology Museum. It tells the story of the people who lived in the Workers’ Row House in Corktown and of the workers who helped build Detroit into an industrial and automotive powerhouse. This exhibit kicks off an effort by Corktown Experience to turn the Workers’ Row House and the surrounding property into a community hub and cultural center.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A major package of protections for the state’s elderly has cleared the Legislature and awaits Gov. Tim Walz’s signature. The House and Senate passed the final version of the bill late Sunday night. The most important component is a framework for licensing assisted living facilities that contains expanded enforcement powers. Minnesota is the last remaining state that doesn’t require licensing them. The bill also has other safeguards to protect older and vulnerable adults, including the right for assisted-living residents and their families to install hidden monitoring cameras for two weeks before being required to notify the facilities, a provision dubbed “granny cams.” It also includes a bill of rights for assisted-living residents and other stronger consumer protections, such as protections against retaliation for residents of care facilities.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: About 1 in 4 third graders in the state failed a toughened reading test on the first try this spring, leaving it unclear if they will advance to fourth grade. The Mississippi Department of Education released results Wednesday. Mississippi is one of 16 states that demand third grade students pass a reading score threshold or flunk. Mississippi raised its threshold this year, mandating students reach the middle of five scoring levels. Students had a second chance last week, although those results aren’t yet available. Students get a third chance later this summer. Officials predicted passing rates would drop from last year’s 93.8%, when students had to reach the second level. The Chickasaw County school district has the top share of passing third graders at 94%. Yazoo City was lowest at 32%.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Washington University will host a summit next year aimed at addressing growing concerns about climate change. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was in St. Louis last week to announce creation of the Midwest Collegiate Climate Summit. It will include representatives from universities, local governments, businesses and nonprofits. The summit will focus on several issues, including promoting solar energy and reducing harmful emissions. Bloomberg’s charitable organization, Bloomberg Philanthropies, donated $2.5 million to St. Louis in October to help fund a carbon pollution-tracking program. The city has set a goal of generating 100% of its electricity from wind, solar and other renewable resources by 2035.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Montana Attorney General Tim Fox has announced his timeline for implementing legislation meant to improve communication and collaboration among the law enforcement agencies as they investigate missing persons cases. Fox said Tuesday that the state Department of Justice has posted the job description for a missing persons specialist. That person will coordinate with local, state, federal and tribal law enforcement agencies to improve reporting and searching for missing people. He hopes to have that person on board by July 1. Fox has also asked the state’s eight tribes for nominations for a new Missing Indigenous Persons Task Force, which is set to meet June 11. The group will be tasked with identifying and overcoming communication barriers to reporting and investigating cases of missing Native Americans.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials say they’re expanding a pilot program that stationed a mental health therapist in a city police precinct. The Omaha World-Herald reports that officials plan to place a therapist in each precinct within the next few years. The primary goal is to decrease the instances of officers taking into custody people struggling with mental health issues. Officials also hope to connect people to the services they require and reduce the number of times officers must respond to people and their mental health crises. The therapists, also known as co-responders, will head to incidents that may involve people suffering from mental illnesses. Once officers deem the situations safe, the co-responders can talk to the people and determine what help they need.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Nevada is now on the cusp of joining the nationwide push to elect the president purely by popular vote. The state Senate on Tuesday passed Assembly Bill 186, which would see the Silver State join a compact with 15 others that have agreed to award their presidential votes to the winner of the national popular vote. The divisive bill now heads to Gov. Steve Sisolak, who did not immediately return requests for comment on the measure. If adopted by enough states, the national popular vote compact would effectively neuter the electoral college, a constitutional creation that awards states one presidential vote for each of its congressional delegates. The roughly 200-year-old system has the effect of giving smaller states greater power to pick the president.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Edward Hopper’s final painting is on view at the Currier Museum of Art. “Two Comedians,” showing the artist and his wife taking a bow onstage, once belonged to singer Frank Sinatra. Hopper painted the work in 1966 at age 83, when he and his wife were seriously ill. He died the following year. Museum curator Kurt Sundstrom said it is a somber reflection of two people alone on a dark stage. “They have a presence, but it’s a presence of people who will soon disappear,” he said. “Two Comedians” will be on display at the Currier Museum until January 2020. It is accompanied by other works by Hopper and his contemporaries, on the theme of theater and life in the American city.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPoint Pleasant Beach: A mild winter and previously completed replenishment projects have left the state’s beloved beaches in great shape for the start of the summer tourism season. Coastal experts say most beaches are nice and wide as a result of years of replenishment by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that kicked into high gear after Superstorm Sandy devastated the coast in 2012. Places like Point Pleasant Beach and Ortley Beach have wider beaches than they’ve had in years. The replenishment projects pump sand ashore to widen beaches to provide space for recreation and help protect property. Jon Miller, a coastal expert with Stevens Institute of Technology, says even in spots where beaches have eroded somewhat, the sand that forms sand bars offshore helps blunt the force of incoming waves.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The New Mexico Military Museum has temporarily closed its indoor space to prepare for new exhibits commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War and women serving in World War I. The museum plans to reopen in July. Until then, the outdoor World War I exhibit, the vehicle and equipment park, and meditation gardens will remain open to the public. Officials say the closure also will allow for renovations. The New Mexico National Guard and the museum recently procured a traveling replica of the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C. It will be part of the new exhibit along with hundreds of photos from veterans’ private collections. The materials for the exhibit honoring women who served during World War I come from the American Medical Women’s Association.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation is launching its annual birdwatching challenge, with versions for beginners and experts alike. The “I Bird NY” beginner’s challenge is open to anyone 16 years old or younger. Participants must identify 10 common bird species listed on the challenge form available online. In the experienced birder challenge, participants must identify at least 10 of 50 species and enter sighting information on the challenge form. All will get a certificate, a bracelet and a chance to win birding accessories. The challenge is open through Sept. 16. Details are posted on DEC’s website.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A repeat effort to regulate popular fantasy sports games in North Carolina has advanced through a House panel two years after a similar effort failed. The House Commerce Committee voted Wednesday for the measure, which would require companies that operate fantasy sports to register with the state and abide by some rules. A 2017 bill failed to get enough support after social conservatives complained it would further legitimize gambling in the state. This year’s measure also contains the creation of a new state Gaming Commission that would consolidate oversight of the lottery, bingo and boxing in addition to the fantasy games. The fantasy sports industry has been seeking the state’s regulation, saying it would improve consumer protections. The bill must clear three more committees before reaching the House floor.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Police Department has launched a new program that aims to better connect officers with the community. The Bismarck Tribune reports that the department announced the Bismarck Community Oriented Policing Program on Monday. The program will divide the city into six community policing districts where officers will improve services and organize local meetings and events. It’ll also revive the Neighborhood Crime Watch and Business Watch programs to help neighbors look out for one another and bring attention to suspicious activity. Officers will conduct outreach through neighborhood canvassing, presentations, and home and business security surveys. Sgt. John Brocker says the program “is about reconnecting with the public” and “finding out what you have to say.” He says he felt there was a need for the department to be more transparent.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A strike in its third week at a hospital is putting a spotlight on concerns about forcing nurses to repeatedly work mandatory overtime. The strike also comes at a time when state lawmakers are debating legislation that would allow nurses to refuse mandatory overtime. About 2,200 workers, including nurses, paramedics and custodians, have been on strike since May 6 at Mercy Health St. Vincent Medical Center in Toledo. Many nurses there say staffing shortages are forcing them to routinely work extra hours and be on-call day after day. Hospital officials have said the way they handle staffing is reasonable and common within the health care industry. They also say it ensures proper patient care. Nurses say forcing them to work long hours isn’t safe for them or their patients.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Legislature has approved a budget that for the first time includes millions of dollars in funding for anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers. The Senate on Tuesday approved the $8.1 billion general appropriations bill for the fiscal year beginning July 1. The budget proposal now heads to Gov. Kevin Stitt, who is expected to sign it. The Oklahoman reports the $2 million for crisis pregnancy centers would be the state’s first anti-abortion funding since lawmakers passed the 2017 Choosing Childbirth Act. Proponent Rep. Jon Echols says the centers help pregnant women purchase maternity clothes, prenatal care and more. Critics say the money being apportioned to dissuade women from abortions could be used for other health care initiatives.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Environmental advocates have criticized a state plan to kill more than 1,000 ravens to help save the greater sage grouse. The Oregonian/OregonLive reported Tuesday that the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife applied for permits in 2018 to kill up to 500 ravens per year over a three-year period to reduce the number preying upon greater sage grouse eggs. Environmentalists say the strategy of putting poisoned chicken eggs in bait boxes in northeastern Oregon is flawed. A director at the Portland Audubon Society says the plan is part of an “unfortunate pattern” of agencies scapegoating a species without addressing primary causes of decline. The plan is opposed by numerous environmental groups including Oregon Wild, The Humane Society and the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nJim Thorpe: Officials say one of the state’s most beloved and scenic hiking trails will remain closed to the public unless lawmakers pass Gov. Tom Wolf’s $4.5 billion infrastructure plan. The Democratic governor hiked to the base of the Glen Onoko Falls Trail on Tuesday to make the case for his plan to impose a severance tax on Marcellus Shale natural gas production to finance billions of dollars in projects. Wolf has called for a severance tax every year he’s been in office, but the GOP-controlled Legislature has so far rejected the idea. The Pennsylvania Game Commission closed the trail May 1, saying it had become too dangerous. The closure outraged hikers and nature lovers. State officials say they aren’t able to reopen it without an infusion of cash.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: An effort is underway to replace the state’s distinctive “wave” license plates and more than double the cost of the new ones. The state Senate on Tuesday approved a measure by a 27-8 margin to start replacing them later this year. The bill would change the price of a license plate from $6, set 20 years ago, to $15. Sen. Louis DiPalma, one of the bill’s supporters, says some plates still on the road are so old and worn that they are difficult to read. The Middletown Democrat also estimates about 25,000 vehicles are using invalid plates, probably because they are unregistered, uninsured or uninspected. Some senators opposed the price hike, saying many people could not afford it, especially if they have multiple vehicles. There is no new design yet.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Legislators are giving the Carolina Panthers up to $120 million in tax breaks to move their practice fields and team headquarters into the state from North Carolina. The Senate voted 23-16 on Monday to approve a compromise smoothing over small differences in the bill. A few hours later, the House passed the bill 88-18. Gov. Henry McMaster was expected to quickly sign it into law. The bill exempts the Panthers from paying state income taxes for players, coaches and other employees for 15 years as long as they use the money to build their new complex near Rock Hill. Opponents say the state shouldn’t help a billionaire NFL owner. The team would continue to play games in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The family of an angler whose catfish held a state record for nearly 70 years is upset that state wildlife officials voided the record. Roy Groves caught the 55-pound fish in 1949. The fish originally was identified as a channel catfish, but South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks voided the record Friday, saying Groves actually caught a blue catfish, not a channel catfish. Groves’ great-grandson, James Labesky, says he had never heard about the record being disputed. Labesky says in a Facebook post that South Dakota wildlife officials are taking away the record because they don’t think it’s a channel catfish by looking at a picture. He says in the post that his great-grandfather “would know the difference.” State Fisheries Program Administrator Geno Adams says fish identification experts agreed the photo was of a blue catfish.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Researchers at the Memphis Zoo have been studying the smooth-sided toad’s reproduction abilities and have found techniques that could aid in the breeding and conservation of endangered toads around the world. Research conducted by the zoo’s conservation department showed that the quality of toad sperm could be increased with hormones, that the sperm could be successfully harvested, and that it could be frozen and thawed and remain viable. The study, recently published in the journal Cryobiology, has real-world applications that will be put into action this fall when the research team travels to Colombia and Ecuador to help amphibian researchers there in their work to preserve the rare and “very charismatic” Colombian giant toad, says Steve Reichling, zoo director of conservation and research.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport plans to build a sixth terminal that would open by 2025 and provide up to 24 new gates for U.S. and international flights. DFW airport CEO Sean Donohue announced plans for Terminal F on Monday. The airport currently has 164 gates spread across five terminals. DFW has been growing, inching closer to busier airports such as Atlanta. Donohue says DFW has more than doubled its passenger-carrying capacity to international destinations since 2010. DFW is American Airlines’ largest hub airport. The airline announced early this month that it opened 15 new gates at DFW. American said the gates that opened May 3 in Terminal E will let it add more than 100 daily flights on its American Eagle affiliate.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah Jazz owner and philanthropist Gail Miller says she never expected to be in the company of celebrities such as singer Mariah Carey and actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. But Miller will join their ranks in June when she receives the same congressional award honoring her work with young people. She says being named for the Horizon Award was an incredible recognition of her giving nature and strong community relationships. The award recognizes humanitarian leaders in the private sector, from the Congressional Award National Board of Directors. Miller has owned the family’s car dealerships, movie theaters and the National Basketball Association’s Utah Jazz franchise since the 2009 death of her husband Larry H. Miller. Forbes magazine estimates her net worth to be $1.5 billion.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s Episcopal church has for the first time chosen an African American woman as its bishop. The Rev. Shannon MacVean-Brown was elected Saturday by representatives of Vermont’s 45 Episcopal congregations. MacVean-Brown will become the first black woman to hold the post in Vermont. She replaces Bishop Thomas Ely, who will be retiring after 18 years as Vermont’s Episcopal bishop. MacVean-Brown currently serves as the interim rector of St. Thomas Episcopal Church, of Franklin, Indiana. She is planning to move to Vermont with her family in August. Current plans call for her ordination as Vermont bishop on Sept. 28.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: A Virginia man who founded the defunct airline People Express has been indicted on fraud and tax evasion charges. The Daily Press reports Michael D. Morisi was arrested Tuesday. He’s accused of defrauding creditors of nearly $448,000, using most of the money to pay himself and other airline executives months after the airline folded. An indictment says the former executive director of Newport News-Williamsburg International Airport, Ken Spirito, arranged for public funds to guarantee that airline a $5 million credit line in July 2014. The airline folded that September and stopped paying the $4.5 million it owed TowneBank under the credit line. The airport was left to foot the bill, which it then paid with those public funds. Spirito was arrested Monday and charged with violating federal finance laws.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee signed legislation Tuesday making the state the first to approve composting as an alternative to burying or cremating human remains. It allows licensed facilities to offer “natural organic reduction,” which turns a body, mixed with substances such as wood chips and straw, into about two wheelbarrows’ worth of soil in a span of several weeks. Loved ones are allowed to keep the soil to spread, just as they might spread the ashes of someone who has been cremated – or even use it to plant vegetables or a tree. Supporters say the method is an environmentally friendly alternative to cremation, which releases carbon dioxide and particulates into the air, and conventional burial, in which people are drained of their blood, pumped full of formaldehyde and other chemicals that can pollute groundwater, and placed in a nearly indestructible coffin, taking up land.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: A bridge will now bear the name of longtime state lawmaker Frank Deem, who died in October at the age of 90. According to The Parkersburg News and Sentinel, about 100 people gathered Friday to see the dedication of the Juliana Street Bridge as the Senator J. Frank Deem Memorial Bridge. Deem served in the Navy before his election to the House in 1954. The retired businessman and oil and gas developer served on and off in the House and Senate over six decades, spending a total of 48 years as a lawmaker.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Lego dinosaurs are headed to the local zoo. This summer, the United Kingdom-based Brick Dinos exhibit is traveling to the United States for the first time and heading straight to the Milwaukee County Zoo. Guy Bagley, senior creative for Warren Elsmore Exhibitions, has made a career out of “playing with Legos” for the past 23 years. He traveled from Scotland to set up the exhibit in the special exhibits building at the zoo. That included shipping four life-size sculptures as well as 26 smaller scenes, then repairing any damage incurred during their voyage across the pond. While the exhibit is fun, it’s also educational. Bagley says his boss, Warren Elsmore, worked with a paleontologist to ensure the accuracy of everything from the color of the dinosaurs to the plants in their habitats.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state recorded the lowest number of births in 15 years in 2018. Wyoming’s population has been falling since the state’s energy industry went bust in 2015. That year, about 7,700 babies were born in Wyoming. The Wyoming Department of Health says last year’s tally was 6,551. Meanwhile, deaths of Wyoming residents are increasing as the state’s population ages. The Casper Star-Tribune reports Emma was the most popular name for baby girls in Wyoming last year, followed by Amelia, Elizabeth, Evelyn and Harper. Oliver topped the list for boys, followed by Jackson and Logan (which were tied), Wyatt and Theodore.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2021/11/17/find-columbus-central-ohio-restaurants-food-near-you-2021-map-directory-guide/6245251001/", "title": "Columbus restaurant guide: Find food near you by cuisine", "text": "Compiled and edited by Erin Edwards, Tom Hanks, David Rees, Lily Roby and Eiliana Wright\n\nColumbus Monthly\n\nLove local restaurants?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nScientists have identified two minerals never before seen on Earth in a meteorite weighing 15.2 metric tons (33,510 pounds).\n\nThe minerals came from a 70-gram (nearly 2.5-ounce) slice of the meteorite, which was discovered in Somalia in 2020 and is the ninth-largest meteorite ever found, according to a news release from the University of Alberta.\n\nChris Herd, curator of the university’s meteorite collection, received samples of the space rock so he could classify it. As he was examining it, something unusual caught his eye — some parts of the sample weren’t identifiable by a microscope. He then sought advice from Andrew Locock, head of the university’s Electron Microprobe Laboratory, since Locock has experience describing new minerals.\n\n“The very first day he did some analyses, he said, ‘You’ve got at least two new minerals in there,’” Herd, a professor in the university’s department of Earth and atmospheric sciences, said in a statement. “That was phenomenal. Most of the time it takes a lot more work than that to say there’s a new mineral.”\n\nOne mineral’s name — elaliite — derives from the space object itself, which is called the “El Ali” meteorite since it was found near the town of El Ali in central Somalia.\n\nHerd named the second one elkinstantonite after Lindy Elkins-Tanton, vice president of Arizona State University’s Interplanetary Initiative. Elkins-Tanton is also a regents professor in that university’s School of Earth and Space Exploration and the principal investigator of NASA’s upcoming Psyche mission — a journey to a metal-rich asteroid orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter, according to the space agency.\n\n“Lindy has done a lot of work on how the cores of planets form, how these iron nickel cores form, and the closest analogue we have are iron meteorites,” Herd said. “It made sense to name a mineral after her and recognize her contributions to science.”\n\nThe International Mineralogical Association’s approval of the two new minerals in November of this year “indicates that the work is robust,” said Oliver Tschauner, a mineralogist and professor of research in the department of geoscience at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\n“Whenever you find a new mineral, it means that the actual geological conditions, the chemistry of the rock, was different than what’s been found before,” Herd said. “That’s what makes this exciting: In this particular meteorite you have two officially described minerals that are new to science.”\n\nThe role of lab-created minerals in discovery\n\nLocock’s quick identification was possible because similar minerals had been synthetically created before, and he was able to match the composition of the newly discovered minerals with their human-made counterparts, according to the University of Alberta release.\n\n“Material scientists do this all the time,” said Alan Rubin, a meteorite researcher and former adjunct professor and research geochemist in the department of earth, planetary and space sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles. “They can create new compounds — one, just to see what’s physically possible just as a research interest, and others … will say, ‘We’re seeking a compound that has certain properties for some practical or commercial application, like conductivity or high strain or high melting temperature.\n\n“It’s just fortuitous that a researcher will find a mineral in a meteorite or a terrestrial rock that hasn’t been known before, and then very often, that same compound will have been created previously by material scientists.”\n\nBoth new minerals are phosphates of iron, Tschauner said. A phosphate is a salt or ester of a phosphoric acid.\n\n“Phosphates in iron meteorites are secondary products: They form through oxidation of phosphides … which are rare primary components of iron meteorites,” he said via email. “Hence, the two new phosphates tell us about oxidation processes that occurred in the meteorite material. It remains to be seen if the oxidation occurred in space or on Earth, after the fall, but as far as I know, many of these meteorite phosphates formed in space. In either case, water is probably the reactant that caused the oxidation.”\n\nThe findings were presented in November at the University of Alberta’s Space Exploration Symposium. The revelations “broaden our perspective on the natural materials that can be found and can be formed in the solar system,” Rubin said.\n\nThe El Ali meteorite the minerals came from appears to have been sent to China in search of a buyer, Herd said.\n\nMeanwhile, the researchers are still analyzing the minerals — and potentially a third one — to find out what the conditions were in the meteorite when the space rock formed. And newly discovered minerals could have exciting implications for the future, he added.\n\n“Whenever there’s a new material that’s known, material scientists are interested too because of the potential uses in a wide range of things in society,” Herd said.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/29/africa/sudan-russia-gold-investigation-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Russia is plundering gold in Sudan to boost Putin's war effort in ...", "text": "Khartoum, Sudan CNN —\n\nDays after Moscow launched its bloody war on Ukraine, a Russian cargo plane stood on a Khartoum runway, a strip of tarmac surrounded by red-orange sand. The aircraft’s manifest stated it was loaded with cookies. Sudan rarely, if ever, exports cookies.\n\nA heated debate transpired between officials in a back office of Khartoum International Airport. They feared that inspecting the plane would vex the country’s increasingly pro-Russian military leadership. Multiple previous attempts to intercept suspicious Russian carriers had been stopped. Ultimately, however, the officials decided to board the plane.\n\nInside the hold, colorful boxes of cookies stretched out before them. Hidden just beneath were wooden crates of Sudan’s most precious resource. Gold. Roughly one ton of it.\n\nThis incident in February – recounted by multiple official Sudanese sources to CNN – is one of at least 16 known Russian gold smuggling flights out of Sudan, Africa’s third largest producer of the precious metal, over the last year and a half.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter confronts staff at alleged Russian operation in Sudan 08:55 - Source: CNN\n\nMultiple interviews with high-level Sudanese and US officials and troves of documents reviewed by CNN paint a picture of an elaborate Russian scheme to plunder Sudan’s riches in a bid to fortify Russia against increasingly robust Western sanctions and to buttress Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.\n\nThe evidence also suggests that Russia has colluded with Sudan’s beleaguered military leadership, enabling billions of dollars in gold to bypass the Sudanese state and to deprive the poverty-stricken country of hundreds of millions in state revenue.\n\nIn exchange, Russia has lent powerful political and military backing to Sudan’s increasingly unpopular military leadership as it violently quashes the country’s pro-democracy movement.\n\nFormer and current US officials told CNN that Russia actively supported Sudan’s 2021 military coup which overthrew a transitional civilian government, dealing a devastating blow to the Sudanese pro-democracy movement that had toppled President Omar al-Bashir two years earlier.\n\n“We’ve long known Russia is exploiting Sudan’s natural resources,” one former US official familiar with the matter told CNN. “In order to maintain access to those resources Russia encouraged the military coup.”\n\n“As the rest of the world closed in on [Russia], they have a lot to gain from this relationship with Sudan’s generals and from helping the generals remain in power,” the former official added. “That ‘help’ runs the gamut from training and intelligence support to jointly benefiting from Sudan’s stolen gold.”\n\nAt the heart of this quid pro quo between Moscow and Sudan’s military junta is Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch and key ally of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe heavily sanctioned 61-year-old controls a shadowy network of companies that includes Wagner, a paramilitary group linked to alleged torture, mass killings and looting in several war-torn countries including Syria and the Central African Republic (CAR). Prigozhin denies links to Wagner.\n\nIn Sudan, Prigozhin’s main vehicle is a US-sanctioned company called Meroe Gold – a subsidiary of Prigozhin owned M-invest – which extracts gold while providing weapons and training to the country’s army and paramilitaries, according to invoices seen by CNN.\n\n“Through Meroe Gold, or other companies associated with Prigozhin employees, he has developed a strategy to loot the economic resources of the African countries where he intervenes, as a counterpart to his support to the governments in place,” said Denis Korotkov, investigator at the London-based Dossier Center, which tracks the criminal activity of various people associated with the Kremlin. The center was started by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once the richest man in Russia, now living in exile in London.\n\nCNN, in collaboration with the Dossier Center, can also reveal that at least one high-level Wagner operative – Alexander Sergeyevich Kuznetsov – has overseen operations in Sudan’s key gold mining, processing and transit sites in recent years.\n\nKuznetsov – also known by his call signs “Ratibor” and “Radimir” – is a convicted kidnapper who fought in neighboring Libya and commanded Wagner’s first attack and reconnaissance company in 2014. He is a four-time recipient of Russia’s Order of Courage award and was pictured alongside Putin and Dmitri Utkin – Wagner’s founder – in 2017. The European Union sanctioned Kuznetsov in 2021.\n\nThe growing bond between Sudan’s military rulers and Moscow has spawned an intricate gold smuggling network. According to Sudanese official sources as well as flight data reviewed by CNN in collaboration with flight tracker Twitter account Gerjon, at least 16 of the flights intercepted by Sudanese officials last year were operated by military plane that came to and from the Syrian port city of Latakia where Russia has a major airbase.\n\nGold shipments also follow a land route to the CAR, where Wagner has propped up a repressive regime and is reported to have meted out some of its cruelest tactics on the country’s population, according to multiple Sudanese official sources and the Dossier Center.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Russian foreign ministry, the Russian defense ministry and the parent organization for the group of companies run by Prigozhin for comment. None has responded.\n\nResponding to the findings of CNN’s investigation, a US State Department spokesperson said: “We are monitoring this issue closely, including the reported activities of Meroe Gold, the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, and other sanctioned actors in Sudan, the region, and throughout the gold trade.\n\n“We support the Sudanese people in their pursuit of a democratic and prosperous Sudan that respects human rights,” the spokesperson added. “We will continue to make clear our concerns to Sudanese military officials about the malign impact of Wagner, Meroe Gold, and other actors.”\n\nReceding into the shadows\n\nRussia’s meddling in Sudan’s gold began in earnest in 2014 after its invasion of Crimea prompted a slew of Western sanctions. Gold shipments proved an effective way of accumulating and transferring wealth, bolstering Russia’s state coffers while sidestepping international financial monitoring systems.\n\n“The downside of gold is that it’s physical and a lot more cumbersome to use than international wire transfers but the flip side is that it’s much harder if not impossible to freeze or seize,” said Daniel McDowell, sanctions specialist and associate professor of Political Science at Syracuse University.\n\nThe hub of Russia’s gold extraction operation lies deep in the desert of northeast Sudan, a bleached landscape peppered with gaping chasms where miners toil in searing heat, with only tents fashioned from scraps of tarpaulin and sandbags providing any respite.\n\nAlex Platt, CNN\n\nMiners from those remote artisanal mines converge on al-Ibaidiya – known as ‘gold town’ – every morning, lugging sacks of gold in carts hauled by donkeys along the town’s unpaved roads. The highest bidders for their goods, many of them say, are almost invariably merchants dispatched from a nearby processing plant known by locals as ‘the Russian company.’\n\nIt’s a helter-skelter selling process that sources tell CNN is the nerve center of Russia’s gold siphoning. Some 85% of the gold in Sudan is sold this way, according to official statistics seen by CNN. The transactions are mostly off-the-books, and Russia dominates this market, according to multiple sources, including mining whistleblowers and security sources.\n\nFor at least a decade, Russia has hidden its Sudanese gold dealings from the official record. Sudan’s official Foreign Trade Statistics since 2011 consistently list Russia’s total gold exports from the country at zero, despite copious evidence of Moscow’s extensive dealings in this sector.\n\nBecause Russia has benefited from considerable government blind spots, it is difficult to ascertain the exact amount of gold it has removed from Sudan. But at least seven sources familiar with events accuse Russia of driving the lion’s share of Sudan’s gold smuggling operations – which is where most of Sudan’s gold has ended up in recent years, according to official statistics.\n\nMilling machines grind gold ore in the al-Ibaidiya milling plant.

Alex Platt, CNN Al-Ibaidiya, Sudan Prev Next\n\nA whistleblower from inside the Sudanese Central Bank showed CNN a photo of a spreadsheet showing that 32.7 tons was unaccounted for in 2021. Using current prices, this amounts to $1.9 billion worth of missing gold, at $60 million a ton.\n\nBut multiple former and current officials say that the amount of missing gold is even larger, arguing that the Sudanese government vastly underestimates the gold produced at informal artisanal mines, distorting the real number.\n\nMost of CNN’s insider sources claim that around 90% of Sudan’s gold production is being smuggled out. If true, that would amount to roughly $13.4 billion worth of gold that has circumvented customs and regulations, with potentially hundreds of millions of dollars lost in government revenue. CNN cannot independently verify those figures.\n\nAn anti-corruption Sudanese investigator who has tracked Russia’s gold dealings in Sudan for years provided CNN with the coordinates of a key Russian processing plant. When CNN arrived at the site, some five miles from al-Ibaidiya, a Soviet flag fluttered above the compound. A Russian fuel truck was parked outside.\n\nA casual encounter with the guard – who confirmed that the facility belonged to the so-called “Russian company” – quickly turned into a tense confrontation.\n\nThe guard spoke through a walkie talkie, conveying CNN’s request to speak to “the Russian manager.” A group of Sudanese men then rushed to the scene and ordered the CNN crew to leave, before the CNN car was tailed by the security detail.\n\n“You need to go,” another Sudanese employee at the plant told CNN. “This isn’t a Russian company. It is a Sudanese company called al-Solag.”\n\nA Soviet flag flies over the processing plant deep in the Sudanese desert, a facility known to locals as the \"Russian company.\" Alex Platt, CNN\n\nAl-Solag is a Sudanese front company for Meroe Gold, the US-sanctioned Russian mining business, according to five official Sudanese sources and company registration documents reviewed by CNN.\n\nAl-Solag’s formation over the last year has marked a key turning point for Russia’s presence in Sudan. Under the new model, Russia’s dealings have receded into the shadows, making the arrangements more reliant on Sudan’s military leadership and further enabling Russian actors to circumvent state institutions, including regulations pertaining to foreign companies, under the guise of a local business. CNN has reached out to Sudan’s military leadership for comment, and received no reply.\n\n‘Too much US scrutiny’\n\nIn 2021, Russia’s Sudan envoy, Vladimir Zheltov, called for an impromptu meeting with Sudanese mining officials.\n\nAppearing visibly nervous, Zheltov demanded that Meroe Gold be “obscured” after becoming subject to “too much US scrutiny,” according to a whistleblower from Sudan’s Ministry of Mining who had first-hand knowledge of the meeting.\n\nBy June of this year, Zheltov’s demands had materialized. The transfer of Meroe Gold’s assets to the Sudanese-owned al-Solag appeared to have been completed. An analysis of the registration documents of the two companies revealed striking similarities, including two identical lists of legal penalties.\n\nUnder Sudanese law, a company wishing to transfer their holdings must also transfer judgments against it. It is illegal to have an undeclared foreign partner.\n\nSudan’s anti-corruption committee, a watchdog set up to assist Sudan’s transition to democracy, then blocked the attempted subterfuge, according to a former civilian official with direct knowledge of the events. The anti-corruption committee sent a detailed report to the armed forces in September 2021 with evidence of the Meroe Gold transfer to al-Solag, urging them to stop what they dubbed a “crime against the state.”\n\nThe watchdog also accused the military of complicity in Russia’s dealings, drawing the ire of the military leadership who lambasted the committee for “harming the armed forces,” according to the former civilian official.\n\n“The Russians and Sudanese officers saw the civilians in the government as an obstacle to their plans,” the former official added.\n\nIn October 2021, a month after the anti-corruption committee stopped the transfer of holdings from Meroe Gold to al-Solag, Sudan’s military staged a coup – which US official and former official sources accuse Russia of backing – and the junta immediately dismantled the committee.\n\n“Russia is a parasite,” the former official told CNN. “It pillaged Sudan. And it has exacted a very large political penalty by terminating a democratic project that could have turned Sudan into a great nation.”\n\nGen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary unit, is a key beneficiary from Russian support, as the primary recipient of Moscow’s weapons and training. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan – the country’s military ruler – is also believed by CNN’s Sudanese sources to be backed by Russia.\n\nHuman rights groups have implicated both Burhan and Dagalo (known as Hemedti) in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during Sudan’s Darfur conflict that started in 2003.\n\nOn the same day that Russia launched its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Hemedti was heading a Sudanese delegation in Moscow to “advance relations” between the two countries.\n\nWagner boots on the ground\n\nOn a dusty border-crossing between the CAR and Sudan in March 2019, a bespectacled 34-year-old Russian frantically sent his boss – Meroe Gold owner Mikhail Potepkin – a plea for help.\n\n“Radimir is pissed that no one was warned,” wrote Aleksei Pankov in a Telegram conversation which the Dossier Center shared with CNN. He was referring to Kuznetsov, the menacing high-level Wagner operative, depicted as manning the border alongside Sudanese intelligence operatives.\n\n“Tell Radimir that it was a ‘closed’ operation. That’s why we didn’t warn him about it,” came Potepkin’s reply.\n\n“F**k, Radimir is scary. I almost s**t my pants,” Pankov wrote back.\n\nThis exchange is part of a string of evidence collected by CNN that establishes Kuznetsov as a key Wagner enforcer across key locations in Sudan.\n\nCNN has also seen official Sudanese communiques referencing Kuznetsov as a “problematic” armed Russian who was overseeing security at the Russian gold processing plant near al-Ibaidiya. A source familiar with Meroe Gold’s activities in Sudan told CNN that Kuznetsov also frequented the company’s offices in Khartoum.\n\nWagner operatives deploy to Sudan on a rotational basis, the Dossier Center told CNN, and Kuznetsov may be one of several Wagner men in the country. These are strategically dispatched to protect Russia’s smuggling scheme that has grown in importance since Russia launched its war on Ukraine.\n\nThose Wagner operatives appear to be part of a growing climate of fear as Moscow tightens its grip on Sudan’s gold pipeline, sources say.\n\nSeveral local journalism networks whose work CNN has drawn on for this report – such as Mujo Press, al-Bahshoum and activist journalist Hisham Ali’s Facebook page – have been targeted in recent months, driven into exile under the threat of assassination. Ten protesters were gunned down in demonstrations in June alone, three of whom were prominent pro-democracy activists. CNN security sources believe they were deliberately targeted.\n\nHigh-level Sudanese officials repeatedly urged CNN’s Nima Elbagir to steer clear of protest sites. Since CNN began this investigation, Elbagir has been put on the military junta’s hit list, according to multiple Sudanese security sources.\n\nAs images of Russian tanks encircling Kyiv were flashing on TV screens at Khartoum International Airport, employees watched as the plane laden with cookies and gold took off last February. Senior army brass had intervened and a sense of foreboding set in.\n\nSome of the officials who uncovered the haul were reassigned, some to regional duty stations, and others were sent to army reserves, according to a source with direct knowledge of the incident.\n\n“They paid for doing their jobs,” the source told CNN.", "authors": ["Nima Elbagir Barbara Arvanitidis Tamara Qiblawi Gianluca Mezzofiore Mohammed Abo Al Gheit Marco Chacón Natalie Croker Henrik Pettersson", "Cnn Exclusive", "Nima Elbagir", "Barbara Arvanitidis", "Tamara Qiblawi", "Gianluca Mezzofiore", "Mohammed Abo Al Gheit", "Marco Chacón", "Natalie Croker", "Henrik Pettersson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/08/04/tanzanian-miner-another-discovers-tanzanite-gem/3288790001/", "title": "Miner who discovered the largest tanzanite gems ever has now ...", "text": "A Tanzanian miner made another discovery of one of the rarest gemstones on Earth, possibly earning the small-scale miner millions of dollars — again.\n\nSaniniu Laizer, 52, recently discovered the rare, dark violet-blue tanzanite gem, weighing 14 pounds.

Nuclear fusion happens when two or more atoms are fused into one larger one, a process that generates a massive amount of energy as heat.\n\nScientists around the world have been studying nuclear fusion for decades, hoping to recreate it with a new source that provides limitless, carbon-free energy – without the nuclear waste created by current nuclear reactors. Fusion projects mainly use the elements deuterium and tritium – both of which are isotopes of hydrogen.\n\nThe deuterium from a glass of water, with a little tritium added, could power a house for a year. Tritium is rarer and more challenging to obtain, although it can be synthetically made.\n\n“Unlike coal, you only need a small amount of hydrogen, and it is the most abundant thing found in the universe,” Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct and a former chief energy technologist at Lawrence Livermore, told CNN. “Hydrogen is found in water so the stuff that generates this energy is wildly unlimited and it is clean.”\n\nHow is fusion different from nuclear fission?\n\nWhen people think about nuclear energy, cooling towers and mushroom clouds may come to mind. But fusion is entirely different.\n\nWhereas fusion fuses two or more atoms together, fission is the opposite; it is the process of splitting a larger atom into two or more smaller ones. Nuclear fission is the kind of energy that powers nuclear reactors around the world today. Like fusion, the heat created from splitting atoms is also used to generate energy.\n\nNuclear is a zero-emission energy source, according to the Department of Energy. But it produces volatile radioactive waste that must be stored safely and carries safety risks. Nuclear meltdowns, although rare, have occurred throughout history with wide-ranging and deadly results such as at the Fukushima and Chernobyl reactors.\n\nNuclear fusion does not carry the same safety risks, and the materials used to power it have a much shorter half-life than fission.\n\nHow could nuclear fusion power eventually turn the lights on in your house?\n\nThere are two main ways to generate nuclear fusion, but both have the same result. Fusing two atoms creates a tremendous amount of heat, which holds the key to producing energy. That heat can be used to warm water, create steam and turn turbines to generate power – much like how nuclear fission generates energy.\n\nThe big challenge of harnessing fusion energy is sustaining it long enough so that it can power electric grids and heating systems around the globe. The successful US breakthrough is a big deal, but it’s still on a far smaller scale than what’s needed to generate enough energy to run one power plant, never mind tens of thousands of power plants.\n\nThis illustration provided by the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory depicts a target pellet inside a hohlraum capsule with laser beams entering through openings on either end. The beams compress and heat the target to the necessary conditions for nuclear fusion to occur. (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory via AP) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory via AP\n\n“It’s about what it takes to boil 10 kettles of water,” said Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College in London. “In order to turn that into a power station, we need to make a larger gain in energy – we need it to be substantially more.”\n\nWhy is DOE’s forthcoming announcement about a fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain important?\n\nThis is the first time scientists have ever successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain, instead of breaking even as past experiments have done.\n\nWhile there’s many more steps until this can be commercially viable, it’s essential for scientists to show that they can create more energy than they started with. Otherwise, it doesn’t make much sense for it to be developed.\n\n“This is very important because from an energy perspective, it can’t be an energy source if you’re not getting out more energy than you’re putting in,” Friedmann told CNN. “Prior breakthroughs have been important but it’s not the same thing as generating energy that could one day be used on a larger scale.”\n\nWhere does the fusion take place?\n\nSeveral fusion projects are in the US, United Kingdom and Europe. France is home to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, on which thirty-five countries are collaborating – including main members China, the United States, the European Union, Russia, India, Japan and South Korea.\n\nIn the US, much of the work is happening at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, in a building that spans the size of three football fields.\n\nThe west gate entrance to the US Department of Energys Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 12, 2022.

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe National Ignition Facility project creates energy from nuclear fusion by what’s known as “thermonuclear inertial fusion.” In practice, US scientists fire pellets that contain hydrogen fuel into an array of nearly 200 lasers, essentially creating a series of extremely fast, repeated explosions at the rate of 50 times per second. The energy collected from the neutrons and alpha particles is extracted as heat.\n\nIn the UK and the ITER project in France, scientists are working with huge donut-shaped machines outfitted with giant magnets called a tokamak to try to generate the same result. After fuel is put into the tokamak, its magnets are turned on and temperatures inside are raised exponentially to create plasma.\n\nPlasma needs to reach at least 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. The neutrons then escape the plasma, hitting a “blanket” lining the walls of the tokamak, and transferring their kinetic energy as heat.\n\nWhat are the next steps?\n\nScientists and experts now need to figure out how to produce much more energy from nuclear fusion on a much larger scale.\n\nAt the same time, they need to figure out how to eventually reduce the cost of nuclear fusion so that it can be used commercially.\n\n“At the moment we’re spending a huge amount of time and money for every experiment we do,” said Chittenden. “We need to bring the cost down by a huge factor.”\n\nScientists will also need harvest the energy produced by fusion and transfer it to the power grid as electricity. It will take years – and possibly decades – before fusion can be able to produce unlimited amounts of clean energy, and scientists are on a race against the clock to fight climate change.\n\n“This will not contribute meaningfully to climate abatement in the next 20-30 years,” Friedmann said. “This the difference between lighting a match and building a gas turbine.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen René Marsh", "Ella Nilsen", "René Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/asia/tooth-laos-denisovans-human-evolution-scn/index.html", "title": "A tooth found in a cave in Laos is revealing more about the ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA tooth unearthed from a remote cave in Laos is helping to sketch an unknown chapter in the human story.\n\nResearchers believe the tooth belonged to a young female who lived at least 130,000 years ago and was likely a Denisovan – an enigmatic group of early humans first identified in 2010.\n\nThe lower molar is the first fossil evidence placing Denisovans in Southeast Asia and may help untangle a puzzle that had long vexed experts in human evolution.\n\nThe only definitive Denisovan fossils have been found in North Asia – in the eponymous Denisova cave in Siberia’s Altai Mountains in Russia. Genetic evidence, however, has tied the archaic humans most closely to places much further south – in what’s now the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and Australia.\n\n“This demonstrates that the Denisovans were likely present also in southern Asia. And it supports the results of geneticists who say that modern humans and the Denisovans might have met in Southeast Asia,” said study author Clément Zanolli, a researcher in paleoanthropology at CNRS, the French National Center for Scientific Research and the University of Bordeaux.\n\nArchaeologists uncovered the tooth in a place known as Cobra Cave, 160 miles (260 kilometers) north of Laos’ capital, Vientiane, where excavations began in 2018. The study, which published in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday, estimated the molar was between 131,000 and 164,000 years old, based on analysis of cave sediment, the dating of three animal bones found in the same layer, and the age of rock overlying the fossil.\n\nThe tooth was unearthered from a cave in Laos and belonged to a woman who lived at least 131,000 year ago. Fabrice Demeter\n\n“Teeth are like the black box of an individual. They preserve a lot of information on their life and biology. They have been always used by paleoanthropologists, you know, to describe species or to distinguish between species. So for us paleoanthropologists (teeth) are very useful fossils,” Zanolli said.\n\nComparison with archaic human teeth\n\nThe researchers compared the ridges and dips on the tooth with other fossilized teeth belonging to archaic humans and found it didn’t resemble teeth belonging to Homo sapiens or Homo erectus – an archaic human that was the first to walk with an upright gait whose remains have been found across Asia. The cave find most closely resembled a tooth found in a Denisovan jawbone found on the Tibetan plateau in Xiahe county, in Gansu province, China. The authors said it was possible, though less likely, it could belong to a Neanderthal.\n\n“Think about about it (the tooth) as if you are traveling into (a) valley between mountains. And the organization of these mountains and valleys is very typical of a species,” Zanolli explained.\n\nAnalysis of some protein in enamel from the tooth suggested that it belonged to a female.\n\nDenisovan DNA lives on in some humans today because, once our Homo sapiens ancestors encountered the Denisovans, they had sex with them and gave birth to babies – something geneticists call admixture. This means we can look back into human history by analyzing current-day genetic data.\n\nThe “admixing” happened was thought to have happened more than 50,000 years ago, as modern humans moved out of Africa and likely crossed paths with both Neanderthals and Denisovans. But pinning down exactly where it happened has proven difficult – particularly in the case of Denisovans.\n\nDefinitively Denisovan?\n\nAny addition to the meager hominin fossil record of Asia is exciting news, said Katerina Douka, an assistant professor of archaeological science at the department of evolutionary anthropology at the University of Vienna. She wasn’t involved in the research.\n\nShe said she would have liked to see “more and extensive evidence” that the tooth was definitively Denisovan.\n\n“There is a chain of assumptions the authors accept in order to confirm that this is a Denisovan fossil,” she said.\n\n“The reality is that we cannot know whether this single and badly preserved molar belonged indeed to a Denisovan, a hybrid or even an unknown hominin group. It might well be a Denisovan, and I would love it to be a Denisovan, because how cool would that be? But more confident evidence is needed,” she said.\n\nIn deeming the Laos tooth Denisovan, the researchers in this study relied heavily on a comparison with the Xiahe jawbone, Douka said. However, the jawbone, while thought by many to be Denisovan, was not an open-and-shut case. No DNA had been retrieved from the fossilized jawbone, only “thin” protein evidence, she added.\n\n“Anyone working on this hominin group, where many major questions still remain, wants to add new dots on the map. The difficulty is in reliably identifying any fossils as that of a Denisovan,” she said. “This lack of robust biomolecular data, however, reduces significantly the impact of this new find and it is a reminder of how difficult it is to work in the tropics.”\n\nThe study authors said they planned to try and extract ancient DNA from the tooth, which, if possible, would provide a more definitive answer but the warm climate means that could be a long shot. The research team also plans to continue excavating the site after a pandemic-induced hiatus in the hope of more discoveries of ancient humans that lived in area.\n\n“In this kind of environment, DNA doesn’t preserve well at all but we’ll do our best,” said study coauthor Fabrice Demeter, an assistant professor at the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre in Denmark.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/us/lake-mead-body-barrel-water-level-drought-climate/index.html", "title": "Body in barrel discovered at Lake Mead is likely a gunshot murder ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe plunging water level in Lake Mead – the country’s largest reservoir, besieged by drought – unveiled another disturbing discovery over the weekend, police say: a body in a barrel.\n\nA person who was spending time at the lake Sunday afternoon found the barrel, according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Homicide Lieutenant Ray Spencer.

Researchers for decades have attempted to recreate nuclear fusion – replicating the fusion that powers the sun.\n\nUS Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm will make an announcement Tuesday on a “major scientific breakthrough,” the department announced Sunday. The breakthrough was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nNuclear fusion happens when two or more atoms are fused into one larger one, a process that generates a massive amount of energy as heat. Unlike nuclear fission that powers electricity all over the world, it doesn’t generate long-lived radioactive waste.\n\nScientists across the globe have been inching toward the breakthrough, using different methods to try to achieve the same goal.\n\nThe National Ignition Facility project creates energy from nuclear fusion by what’s known as “thermonuclear inertial fusion.” In practice, US scientists fire pellets that contain a hydrogen fuel into an array of nearly 200 lasers, essentially creating a series of extremely fast, repeated explosions at the rate of 50 times per second.\n\nThe energy collected from the neutrons and alpha particles is extracted as heat, and that heat holds the key to producing energy.\n\n“They contain the fusion reaction by bombarding the outside with lasers,” Tony Roulstone, a fusion expert from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Engineering, told CNN. “They heat up the outside; that creates a shockwave.”\n\nEven though getting a net energy gain from nuclear fusion is a big deal, it’s happening on a much smaller scale than what’s needed to power electric grids and heat buildings.\n\n“It’s about what it takes to boil 10 kettles of water,” said Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College in London. “In order to turn that into a power station, we need to make a larger gain in energy – we need it to be substantially more.”\n\nIn the UK, scientists are working with a huge donut-shaped machine outfitted with giant magnets called a tokamak to try to generate the same result.\n\nAfter a small amount of fuel is injected into the tokamak, giant magnets are activated to create a plasma. The plasma needs to reach at least 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. This forces the particles from the fuel to fuse into one. With nuclear fusion, the fused product has less mass than the original atoms. The missing mass converts to an enormous amount of energy.\n\nNeutrons, which are able to escape the plasma, then hit a “blanket” lining the walls of the tokamak, and their kinetic energy transfers as heat. This heat can then be used to warm water, create steam and power turbines to generate power.\n\nLast year, scientists working near Oxford were able to generate a record-breaking amount of sustained energy. Even so, it only lasted 5 seconds.\n\nWhether it’s using magnets or shooting pellets with lasers, the result is ultimately the same: Heat sustained by the process of fusing the atoms together holds the key to helping produce energy.\n\nNIF's target chamber is where the magic happens -- temperatures of 100 million degrees and pressures extreme enough to compress the target to densities up to 100 times the density of lead are created there. Damien Jemison/LLNL\n\nThe big challenge of harnessing fusion energy is sustaining it long enough so that it can power electric grids and heating systems around the globe.\n\nChittenden and Roulstone told CNN that scientists around the globe now must work toward dramatically scaling up their fusion projects, and also bring the cost down. Getting it commercially viable will take years of more research.\n\n“At the moment we’re spending a huge amount of time and money for every experiment we do,” Chittenden said. “We need to bring the cost down by a huge factor.”\n\nHowever, Chittenden called this new chapter in nuclear fusion “a true breakthrough moment which is tremendously exciting.”\n\nRoulstone said there’s much shows more work needs to happen to make fusion able to generate electricity on a commercial scale.\n\n“The opposing argument is that this result is miles away from actual energy gain required for the production of electricity,” he said. “Therefore, we can say (it) is a success of the science but a long way from providing useful energy.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen René Marsh", "Ella Nilsen", "René Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "title": "Why lab-grown diamond sales are surging | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNNBusiness —\n\nIt’s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales.\n\nNot that you’d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag.\n\n“The result is really stunning,” said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst.\n\nHe said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period.\n\nCharles and Colvard's 1 1/3 ctw round Caydia lab grown diamond Halo engagement ring in 14K yellow gold (Price: $2,919.20) Courtesy of Charles & Colvard\n\nGoing back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.\n\n“The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,” he said. Too late. “It’s actually happening.”\n\nTide is shifting\n\nWhy are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.\n\n“This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.\n\n“A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.”\n\nThis makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds.\n\nKay Jewelers THE LEO Legacy lab-created diamond three-stone engagement ring 1 ct tw in 14K white gold (price$2,999.99) Courtesy of Kay Jewelers\n\nThe sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world’s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output.\n\nMan-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious.\n\nMined diamonds have a controversial history that’s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded “conflict diamonds” that fund conflict in war-torn areas.\n\nAmong Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot.\n\nSmall but growing share of the diamond market\n\nAlthough its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small.\n\nCurrently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.\n\nSome major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world’s largest jewelry company, Pandora (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.\n\nPandora said it’s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it.\n\nSignet, (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts.\n\nThis engagement ring from Concierge diamonds has a 1ct lab grown diamond with 2 pink sapphires in a14K yellow gold band. (Prices start at $3,500 depending on the center diamond) Courtesy Concierge Diamonds\n\nCalling it a “fast-growing category” in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.\n\nThe company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.\n\nFine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don’t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it.\n\n“As the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn’t surprising,” said Don O’Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. “[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they’re conflict-free. They’re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.”\n\nLab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting.\n\nThere is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.\n\nSo while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won’t get much for it.\n\nBut the value of a ring isn’t just monetary.\n\n“As a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,” said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. “I always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.”", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}]}

They say Americans are frustrated with the Democratic Party establishment, and they'll still be out to protest in large numbers.\n\n“It’s ‘We the People’ who are going to continue to lead this revolution,” said Billy Taylor, a pro-Sanders activist who was issued permits to hold rallies on each day of the convention. “We are not going to vote for the demon named Hillary just because you are threatening us with the devil named Trump.”\n\nThe city of Philadelphia is projecting 35,000 to 50,000 demonstrators will gather at a half dozen sanctioned protest sites near the Wells Fargo Center each day of the convention, which opens Monday. A bulk of the permits issued by the city are to groups that indicated they are inspired by the Vermont senator.\n\nThe showing for the pro-Sanders demonstrations — whose organizers have received nine of the 28 permits issuedand are expected to draw the largest crowds, according to city officials estimates — could perhaps provide a sense of the road Clinton has in front of her as she tries to win over some of the Sander’s most rabid backers.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nExpect heavy security at DNC in Philadelphia\n\nA Pew Research Center Poll published earlier this month found that 85% of respondents who voted for Sanders during the primaries and caucuses say they will back Clinton in the general election, while nine percent said they’d vote for Trump. Six percent say they'll vote for a third party candidate or did not know how they’ll vote.\n\nIn interviews, some pro-Sanders protest organizers said they're still holding on to a thread of hope that a big showing will persuade super delegates committed to Clinton to vote for Sanders.\n\nShort of a super delegate uprising for Sanders, organizers say they will use their protests to push for major reforms in the Democratic Party—including calling for abolishing super delegates in future elections, ousting Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and pressing party leaders to push for laws that would trigger automatic voter registration for Americans when they turn 18.\n\nWithout major reforms, Taylor and other protest organizers said they'll begin an effort to get voters to “deregister” from both major political parties to send a message that Americans are fed up.\n\n“It doesn’t matter if you’re going to hold your nose and vote for Hillary,” said Taylor, who owns a Philadelphia landscape business. “We want people to know that you can still join us to denounce the party and join us and make an example out of the party. The Democratic Party has to earn back our respect.”\n\nNon-Sanders groups that were approved for permits by the city include Green Party candidate Jill Stein, the anti-gun violence group Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC, and the Poor People’s Economic Human Rights Campaign (PPEHRC).\n\nCheri Honkala, the organizer for the Philadelphia-based PPEHRC, said her group’s demonstration is meant to put a spotlight on the plague of homelessness and poverty in the city. She also is planning a bean supper for Sanders delegates ahead of Clinton’s acceptance speech on Thursday, hoping that the bean-filled Sanders supporters will return to the Wells Fargo Center and greet Clinton with flatulence.\n\n“The idea is to send the message to the Democratic Party establishment that the whole system smells, and it must be changed,” she said.\n\nCleveland police to protesters: don't hide your faces\n\nLaurie Cestnick, a Sanders supporter who has been organizing protesters to come to Philadelphia through her Occupy DNC Convention July 2016 Facebook page, said she was disappointed by Sanders' endorsement of Clinton. But she said too much is at stake to keep activists like her from speaking out at the convention.\n\nHer group plans to gather on Monday in Camden, NJ—just across the Delaware River from Philadelphia—and march with several other groups to Philadelphia’s city hall and then on to the main protest site near the convention hall.\n\nCestnick, who volunteered at phone banks for Sanders in the Boston area, said the Facebook page she started to promote the Occupy DNC group’s protests has garnered more than 31,000 followers. Hundreds of activists associated with her group have reserved space at camping grounds in nearby south New Jersey for the days of the convention, she said.\n\n“I won’t say that I’d rather see Trump get in, but I want (the Clinton campaign) to squirm for the rest of the election season, wondering what’s going to happen,” Cestnick said. “I just want them to know that our votes matter and you can’t do that to the American people again.”\n\nNo-shows and reduced numbers temper RNC protests\n\nEric Kestner, a Sanders-backer from Seattle, is using his one week of vacation from his job at an auto repair business to travel to Philadelphia for the protests. He said Sanders’ endorsement did not dissuade him from making the cross-country trek.\n\nKestner said he believes that if the pro-Sanders crowd attracts enough people to push the “Bernie or Bust” message, the super delegates will be forced to change their minds and deliver the nomination to Sanders.\n\nBut even if they fail in their longshot effort, Kestner said the protests will have value in activists' longer term push to overhaul American politics.\n\n“Rome wasn’t built in a day, and we may not get this at this time,” said Kestner, who will make a nearly three-day drive with a fellow “Berner” from Spokane, Washington, to take part in the protests. “You never know what’s going to happen after the convention.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2016/04/11/thousands-flock-downtown-binghamton-see-sanders/82866264/", "title": "Bernie believers unite in Binghamton", "text": "For the first time in more than 16 years, a presidential candidate stopped by Binghamton on Monday to court the votes of its residents.\n\nAnd when Sen.

I'm not sure we're there yet, but I wish we were and I hope that we are.\"\n\nMuscatello, a social entrepreneur, said Monday's rally would be a good experience for her to hear from Sanders firsthand, and she called it \"amazing\" that the presidential contender was stopping in Binghamton.\n\n\"To me it's a mark of what we're becoming, of what Binghamton is becoming,\" Muscatello said. \"It's really becoming an epicenter of culture in upstate New York. I mean, Obama was here, now Bernie. I think that we're starting to get our name on the map for really positive things, politically and culturally.\"\n\nKaren-Elizabeth Moroski, a doctoral candidate at Binghamton University and an instructor there, said she canceled her class on Monday so she and her students could attend the Sanders rally.\n\n\"It's incredible to have a candidate who's not the lesser of two evils, but is actually someone who I wholeheartedly support,\" Karen-Elizabeth Moroski, 26, of Binghamton, said. \"Every single word out of his mouth, I agree with.\"\n\nThe Sanders event event drew more than 5,000 people into the Arena on Monday, with another approximately 150 people turned away due to space limits, officials said.\n\nMany of the people in attendance were young, a demographic Sanders has performed well with. But there was no shortage of middle-aged and older people in the crowd.\n\nBinghamton University student Alec Resurreccion, 18, was one of the people turned away.\n\nResurreccion, of Rockland County, said he arrived too late, around 9:30 a.m., but was impressed so many people turned out to see Sanders.\n\n“I’m upset I couldn’t get in, but I’m optimistic more than anything, because there’s a lot of (Sanders) supporters out here,\" he said.\n\nThere were no interruptions by protesters inside during the event. Outside, two protesters stood with signs.\n\nVic Furman, 60, of Chenango Forks, held a sign that accused Sanders of being “king of the pan handlers.”\n\n“I’m just voicing my opinion,” he said, as he described Sanders’ policies as being akin to himself selling a cup of coffee for $5, then giving four cups away for free.\n\nInside, a group of high school seniors, some of the earliest to get into the event, said they liked Sanders because he was honest and sincere.\n\n“He’s also held the same beliefs for the last 30 years,\" said Brian Tyneway, 18, a senior at Vestal High School. \"If you go back and watch the speeches that he gave in Congress in like the ‘90s, he’s been saying the same stuff.\"\n\nAnthony Borrelli and John Roby contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Megan Brockett on Twitter @PSBMegan.\n\nMegan Brockett", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/07/25/bernie-sanders-turmoil-kick-off-democrats-fest/87523292/", "title": "Hillary's convention opens with pro-Sanders protests"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/08/02/milwaukee-among-cities-invited-bid-2024-democratic-convention/5456562001/", "title": "Milwaukee among cities invited to bid for 2024 Democratic ...", "text": "For Milwaukee, the 2020 Democratic National Convention was the big miss, the city's political dreams coming up against the reality of the pandemic that forced the event to be mostly virtual with the big speeches in Wilmington, Del.\n\nWould the city want to try again in 2024?\n\nThat's the question now floating in the wake of a letter sent late last week by the Democratic National Committee Chair Jamie Harrison to 20 cities, including Milwaukee, opening the bid process for the 2024 convention.\n\nCities interested in submitting a bid were asked to contact Harrison in writing by October 1.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett expressed interest in making another pitch for a convention, but had few specifics.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n\"Based on its designation of Milwaukee as the 2020 convention host, the Democratic National Committee certainly has a positive impression of our city,\" Barrett said. \"I appreciate the invitation they’ve extended, and I will answer that Milwaukee remains interested in being a national political convention site.\n\nThe formal process of assembling a bid for the 2024 Democratic National Convention requires quite a number of partners here in Milwaukee, and I will be consulting with those partners as we make decisions about moving forward.\"\n\nRepublicans haven't yet begun their process of picking a convention city.\n\nIt might be tough to get the gang back together to make a push for a convention in Milwaukee, so soon after the last one.\n\nFor one thing, Alex Lasry, who helped spearhead the effort, is now running in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate. But he urged the city to make a push.\n\n\"Milwaukee should absolutely bid for the 2024 DNC Convention,\" he said in a statement. \"As everyone just saw during the NBA Finals, Wisconsin is more than capable of hosting a world-class event in a way no one ever has before.\"\n\nFor another, there's a pretty big hangover from 2020. The pandemic played havoc with the convention. The hope that tens of thousands people would converge on the city, filling hotels and restaurants, fell by the wayside as the pandemic forced change after change.\n\nIn the end, the convention's physical footprint in Milwaukee shrank, and nominees Joe Biden and Kamala Harris gave the main speeches in Biden's home state of Delaware.\n\nDespite the setbacks, the Milwaukee Host Committee performed a big lift, raising $42.7 million for the event.\n\n\"Things have changed since the effort was put forward to put Milwaukee's name in the hat for 2020,\" said John W. Miller, who chaired the board for the local host committee.\n\nThe previous DNC chair, Tom Perez, had ties to Wisconsin. His wife was from Wauwatosa.\n\nOn the plus side, Miller said, the Bucks run to the NBA title and the crowds that flocked in and around Fiserv Forum, \"proved that Milwaukee can handle a big event with thousands of people on the street.\"\n\nBut the reality of the process beginning so soon is sobering.\n\n\"I do think there is a bit of a hangover from the letdown,\" from last year's event, Miller said. \"It's unfortunate we have to blame a pandemic for that.\"\n\nMiller said if a successful bid could be put together, \"it would be so great for Milwaukee.\" But a group of people would have to come together to push for a bid, and Miller said he has not heard of that happening.\n\nIn his letter to prospective convention cities, Harrison wrote that the site selection process is beginning earlier this cycle.\n\n\"This will be a historic event that can help shape the future of your city for decades to come,\" he wrote. \"Hosting a national convention can be a great economic boon for any city. Past convention host cities have enjoyed an economic impact of approximately $150 million to $200 million. With over 35,000 delegates, honored guests, and members of the press in attendance, the Democratic National Convention can be an enormous opportunity to showcase your city as a world-class destination.\n\n\"Also, given the success of our 'unconventional,' largely virtual convention in 2020, we are open to exploring new approaches and are continuing to rethink the best way to hold our next convention as well,\" Harrison wrote.\n\nHe added: \"In your correspondence, it is not necessary to submit any substantive response at this time — only to indicate that your city wishes to participate in the RFP (Request for Proposals) process, which will begin in earnest later this year.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/25/clinton-supporters-ready-hillary-wilmington-delaware/83489594/", "title": "Hillary Clinton rallies Delaware crowd ahead of primary", "text": "Matthew Albright, and Karl Baker\n\nThe News Journal\n\nHillary Clinton campaign event draws 700 to Market Street rally.\n\nPolls open 7 a.m.-8 p.m. for Delaware primary Tuesday.\n\nClinton is seeking clinch the nomination, with five primary contests in play.\n\nHillary Clinton took her case directly to Delawareans on Monday.\n\nThe former secretary of state rallied a crowd of at least 700 at World Café Live at the Queen in downtown Wilmington, a day ahead of the Delaware primary, which for the first time in recent memory could play a pivotal role in who advances to the general election. The appearance, announced late Friday, was one of several visits by candidates and their surrogates in the week leading up to the contest. Candidates are jockeying for support from every delegate in a tight election battle.\n\n\"If you will go out and vote for me tomorrow, I will stand up and fight for you through this campaign and all the way to the White House,\" Clinton told the crowd. She received several ovations throughout her speech.\n\nHer appearance was a show of force among the state's political leadership, with Gov. Jack Markell, U.S. Rep. John Carney, U.S. Sen. Tom Carper and U.S. Sen. Chris Coons appearing on stage. All four, who are influential superdelegates, have pledged to vote for Clinton.\n\n\"There is nothing that faces our country in this dangerous, difficult and divided world that will surprise her,\" Coons said before Clinton spoke. \"This is a woman fully capable of being one of the greatest American presidents starting from her first day.\"\n\nClinton supporters lined up before 8 a.m. Monday for the event, scheduled for 11:15 a.m.\n\nAnjenette Payne drove from Havre de Grace, Maryland, to be one of the first in line. By 9 a.m., the line had grown from a few diehards to almost a block long.\n\nPayne said she regrets the divisions that have arisen in the U.S. during recent years and believes Clinton can bring together a broad coalition of people in her administration if she becomes president. She said Clinton challenger U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is wrong for the country.\n\n\"You can attack Wall Street, but is that going to hurt our 401(k) and retirement?\" she said. \"I just don't think you should come out and be strong about one point.\"\n\nSanders has been critical of Clinton being paid to give speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms.\n\nSTORY: In Wilmington, Bernie Sanders takes on financial sector\n\nSTORY: Thousands flock to Trump's Delaware rally\n\nBefore Clinton's entrance at about 12:30 p.m., chants of \"Hillary, Hillary\" erupted sporadically among the roughly 700 attendees who filled the mostly standing-room hall.\n\nClinton rattled off a lengthy list of domestic policies she would pursue as president: equal pay for women, raising the federal minimum wage, preserving the Affordable Care Act, expanding job training programs, \"becoming the green energy superpower,\" defending Planned Parenthood and same-sex marriages, reforming immigration laws, tightening gun laws and reversing the Citizens United decision allowing corporate donations to political causes.\n\nShe also expressed sadness over the death of Howard High School of Technology student Amy Inita Joyner-Francis, who died during a fight in the Wilmington's school restroom Thursday.\n\n\"We can't let this go on,\" she said, referencing violence among youth.\n\nClinton seldom referenced Sanders, instead focusing her attention on Republicans, particularly front-runner Donald Trump.\n\n\"Come out of those towers named for yourself and actually talk to people,\" Clinton said of Trump. \"If you want to be president of the United States, you've actually got to be familiar with the United States.\"\n\nClinton said her foreign policy experience dwarfs that of the GOP candidates and was critical of plans by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for tighter policing of Muslim neighborhoods and by Trump to ban Muslims from entering the country.\n\n\"I listen to what Trump and Cruz say, and a lot of what they say is not just offensive, it's dangerous,\" she said.\n\nTrump also attracted thousands of supporters to a rally at the Delaware State Fairgrounds in Harrington on Friday. On the GOP side, the winner of the Tuesday primary will get Delaware's 16 delegates on the first ballot at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.\n\nIn previous years, candidates largely skipped Delaware in favor of larger states. An exception was eight years ago, when then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama held a rally in Rodney Square in Wilmington attended by an estimated 10,000 people for his presidential campaign.\n\nLast week, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, co-founders of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, campaigned in Wilmington on behalf of Sanders, who held a rally attended by an estimated 3,000 at the Chase Center on the Riverfront on Saturday. Actress Rosario Dawson addressed Sanders' rally and spoke to supporters in the local campaign office on Sunday.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton also was in New Castle County on Sunday, stumping for his wife in a surprise visit to the Hollywood Grill on Concord Pike in Fairfax.\n\nA poll released last week by Gravis Marketing showed Clinton with 45 percent support, with Sanders getting 38 percent. With no presumptive nominee in the race, Clinton is seeking to clinch the nomination over Sanders on Tuesday, when Delaware is one of five states holding primaries.\n\nA total of 384 delegates are up for grabs in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.\n\nNationally, Hillary Clinton's delegate and superdelegate lead stands at 1,941 to 1,191, according to a count by the Associated Press. That puts her at 81 percent of the 2,383 delegates needed to win the nomination.\n\nDelawareans embrace Hillary's girl power\n\nDelaware will award 21 pledged delegates proportionally to Democratic candidates. Delaware also has 10 superdelegates, and half have already committed to Clinton for their party convention in Philadelphia. Vice President Joe Biden is one of the superdelegates who has not publicly declared who he supports.\n\nPolls are open 7 a.m.-8 p.m. at the state's 313 precincts Tuesday, and only registered voters from participating parties may vote.\n\nSTORY: Delaware a force this primary season\n\nHillary Clinton on Monday said the president needs to be able to \"find common ground\" and cited her work building the Children's Health Insurance Program and diplomatic efforts as secretary of state as evidence she can build coalitions.\n\n\"I've worked across the aisle in every position I've ever had,\" Clinton said. \"I will go anywhere, anytime to meet with anyone to find common ground.\"\n\nMarkell called her \"the most qualified candidate for president in my lifetime.\"\n\n\"Big ideas are important ... but big ideas aren't enough,\" Carney said. \"We need a president who knows how to take big ideas and make them a reality.\"\n\nCarol Townsend, a retiree from Wilmington, on Monday said she is a \"1,000 percent\" supporter of Clinton. She went to high school in suburban Chicago at the same time as Clinton, she said.\n\nTownsend said Clinton will be a great president.\n\n\"She's always been a strong woman, and I've always followed her because of that,\" she said. \"I strive to be like her.\"\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/07/13/cleveland-protests-trump-police-republican-convention/86996112/", "title": "Police brace for days of protests in Cleveland", "text": "Tens of thousands of protesters from across the political spectrum will pack Cleveland next week, with everyone from \"Bikers for Trump\" to the Westboro Baptist Church and the \"Coalition to Stop Trump” slated to appear.\n\nPolice are bracing for days of protests as the conflicting groups cram into downtown and surround the Q — the Quicken Loans Arena, where Donald Trump next Thursday night is set to accept the Republican presidential nomination. Authorities are restricting public movements around much of downtown as they prepare for the influx, barring backpacks and coolers from the closest designated \"public viewing areas.”\n\nSome groups are hoping to get coverage from the thousands of journalists there for the convention and any disturbances. Others appointed themselves protectors of the city.\n\n\"We do intend to show a force. We don’t want these out-of-towners coming to our city and causing trouble.

At the very least, he said, his group can serve as a buffer between delegates and protesters.\n\n“These people are going to try to make our city look bad. We don’t want that to happen,” he added.\n\nCleveland officials say they’re prepared to handle the competing protest groups, even though some police departments have decided against sending officers to help over concerns the city isn’t as prepared as they’d like.\n\nDozens of protest groups have signed up for permits for marches, demonstrations and speaking opportunities, but there’s one glaring absence: the local franchise of Black Lives Matter. The Cleveland group, whose affiliates throughout the country have been thrust into the national spotlight for a demonstration that preceded last week’s deadly ambush of five Dallas-area police officers, has elected not to participate in the formal permitting process.\n\nKareem Henton, an organizer for the Cleveland franchise, said the decision has nothing to do with growing national criticism of the movement for police accountability from the political right, which has asserted that the groups are fomenting violence against law enforcement. Rather, Henton — whose local franchise has regularly rallied against police actions, including the 2014 shooting of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was holding a toy gun, by a Cleveland police officer — said the group objected to “an approval process for a constitutional right.”\n\nBlack Lives Matter in Cleveland refuses RNC protest regulations\n\nPolice in Cleveland must strike a balance between public safety and those constitutional rights. The First Amendment, which guarantees the right to a free press and freedom of religion, also bars the government from blocking \"the right of the people peaceably to assemble.” Violating the Constitution can bring significant consequences: After the 2008 Democratic National Convention, the city of Denver was fined $200,000 after improperly arresting about 100 people during a protest march.\n\nAmong groups that have others on edge: the Westboro Baptist Church, which plans to bring just five people to protest. The Kansas-based church is known for its anti-gay rhetoric, and its members often protest soldiers’ funerals and then sue or seek criminal charges against anyone who crosses the line to confront them.\n\n\"The ‘Christians' and ‘conservatives' that will flock to Cleveland are full of idolatry, adultery, fornication and sodomy; led by deeply corrupted preachers, teachers, parents, politicians, media and entertainers,” church officials said in announcing their protest plans. “No one gives a single thought to his or her duty to submit to, fear and obey God.\"\n\nJustice Dept. looks to assist Cleveland with RNC security amid concerns\n\nSecret Service director: Agency accounting for Dallas in RNC security prep\n\nThe Coalition to Stop Trump, which plans a major protest march on Monday at noon through downtown, is welcoming children and the elderly to attend because organizers are confident in their safety. Coalition organizers have previously arranged marches drawing more than 10,000 people each time, but spokesman Tom Burke said he expects this march to draw about 1,000 people.\n\n“We’re just asking that the Trump people be aware of who we are and when we’re going to march, so they can choose to keep a distance. And we’re asking the police to respect our right to express our opposition to hate and intolerance,” Burke said. “We think Cleveland is an ideal place for a clash of ideas to happen, and we think the first day of the convention is the time when we can get our message across, so that many of the Republicans will realize how isolated and backward their thinking is.”\n\nOver at the anti-war protest group Code Pink, local organizer Toni Rozsahegyi said she thinks safety concerns are being blown out of proportion, although she acknowledged that a single gunman killed five police officers in Dallas.\n\n“It’s just the world we live in. Nobody knows what’s going to happen moment to moment,” she said. “We’re just hoping and hoping that things will go smoothly.”\n\nNext week's protests and speeches include:\n\nAmerica First Unity Rally\n\nMonday, 2 p.m. parade, followed by speaking program in Willard Park\n\nEstimated attendance: 500\n\nPeace in the Park, by Cleveland Peace Action\n\nWednesday, 11:45 a.m., speakers platform\n\nEstimated attendance: 17\n\nBlack on Black Cleveland: Police Brutality and Women’s Issues\n\nTuesday, 11:15 a.m., speakers platform\n\nEstimated attendance: 25\n\nPeople Fight Back\n\nThursday, all day, various locations\n\nEstimated attendance: 250\n\nEnd Corporate Rule/Create Real Democracy\n\nThursday, 5 p.m., speakers platform\n\nEstimated attendance: 1,000\n\nNote: All times, locations and events are subject to change.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/01/08/oregon-history-31-women-who-blazed-trails-state/2832209001/", "title": "Oregon history: 31 women who blazed trails in the state", "text": "Editors note: This series was originally published in March of 2007.\n\nAn unknown author once said: \"History is herstory, too.\"\n\nThe Statesman Journal will tell Oregon's herstory by profiling notable women from the state's past.

She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery.\n\nFacts: Brown was a social reformer and educator who traveled the Oregon Trail and assisted in the founding of Tualatin Academy, which became Pacific University in Forest Grove. She turned to teaching to support four children after her husband, a minister, died. She was 66 when she crossed the plains in 1846 with her son and suffered much hardship. At one point on the journey, she was left alone on the trail in the bitter cold with her ailing 77-year-old brother-in-law. She pulled them through, despite being near starvation. Once in Oregon, she traveled between Oregon City and her daughter's home in Salem, and eventually settled in Forest Grove. Her first job was sewing gloves to sell. She later helped start a home and school for orphan children and became affectionately known as \"Grandma Brown.\" The log church she used for the school was officially established as Tualatin Academy in 1848, and the following year became what is now Pacific University.\n\nNotable: Honored in 1987 by the Oregon Legislature as the \"Mother of Oregon.\"\n\nQuotable: \"I rode through (the Umpqua Mountains) in three days at the risk of my life, on horseback, having lost my wagon and all that I had but the horse I was on.\"\n\nSOURCES: Pacific University, Salem Online History, RootsWeb.com, The Brown Family History II\n\nAbigail Scott Duniway\n\nBorn: Oct. 22, 1834, near Groveland, Ill.\n\nDied: Oct. 11, 1915. She is buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: Duniway was a novelist, newspaper publisher, teacher, pioneer, milliner and suffragist. She came to Oregon in 1852 and wrote a novel based on the overland experience. Her mother and brother died during the grueling trek. Her family settled near Lafayette, where she began a career as a schoolteacher. She married Benjamin Duniway, and they had four children spaced less than two years apart. She endured the loss of their Yamhill County farm because of her husband's faulty business decisions. Later, he became an invalid. In order to support the family, she returned to teaching as well as running a hat shop in Albany. Her experiences convinced her that women needed the right to vote. She campaigned for suffrage throughout the Northwest, and in 1871, started a newspaper in Portland called The New Northwest. She masterminded the suffrage campaigns in Idaho and Washington, but her efforts to win the right to vote in her home state proved more demanding. From 1884 to 1910, Oregon's male voters defeated suffrage five times at the polls. Finally, in 1912, the initiative passed. She was the first woman to register to vote in Multnomah County.\n\nNotable: Duniway was the first woman to speak before the Oregon Legislature and the state's first woman publisher.\n\nQuotable: \"The young women of today, free to study, to speak, to write, to choose their occupation, should remember that every inch of this freedom was bought for them at a great price.

She is buried at Ocean View Cemetery in Warrenton.\n\nFacts: A physician, teacher, feminist and social reformer, she was the first woman west of the Mississippi to hold a medical degree. Her family crossed the Oregon Trail in 1843, and she did not begin her formal education until she was 12. She was married at 14 to one of her father's farm hands but divorced her abusive husband by 16. She turned to millinery to earn her living and raise her son, George, who also became a doctor. Her business was successful, but after six years she decided to pursue a career in medicine. She attended an eclectic school in Philadelphia and then University of Michigan Medical School, finishing her degree in 1880, at age 40. She returned to Portland the following year and became the first woman to practice in Oregon. She married Col. John Adair in 1884, and the couple moved to Astoria, where she continued to practice medicine and help with the family farm.\n\nNotable: She thought insanity and criminal action were hereditary and argued for mandatory sterilization of the criminally insane. Her famous work on the subject, \"Human Sterilization: Its Social and Legislative Aspects,\" was published in 1922. Three years later, the sterilization statute was adopted as state law in Oregon.\n\nQuotable: She was not afraid to drive great distances alone in her carriage to reach a patient. \"At no time did I ever refuse a call, day or night, rain or shine.\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Findagrave.com, Dameron-Damron family newsletter\n\nLola Greene Baldwin\n\nBorn: 1860\n\nDied: June 22, 1957. Buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: On April 1, 1908, she was sworn in as the first female police officer in the United States. Her primary mission was to protect young women from prostitution. She began this type of work in 1905 as an employee of Portland's branch of the Traveler's Aid organization during the Lewis and Clark Exposition. The goal of the organization was to encourage women who flocked to the city to avoid the pitfalls of prostitution. Her unit with the Portland Police Bureau, the Women's Protection Division, made a priority of protecting women from the effects of vice, rather than punishing them for it. She reportedly maintained an office away from the police department and declined to work in uniform. She also was involved in organizing a juvenile court in Portland. On May 1, 1922, she resigned her commission after influencing local, regional and national women's policing activities for 17 years, 14 of them as a paid municipal officer.\n\nNotable: To learn about Baldwin, read \"A Municipal Mother,\" by Gloria E. Myers. A Portland-based foundation that helps women who are recovering from prostitution is named in her honor.\n\nQuotable: Baldwin's goal was \"to make the path safe for the feet of the girl who desired to lead a clean, honest, useful life.\"\n\nSources: Lola Greene Baldwin Foundation, \"A Municipal Mother\"\n\nMercedes Deiz\n\nBorn: 1917\n\nDied: Oct. 5, 2005, in Portland\n\nFacts: She became the first black female lawyer in Oregon when she was admitted to the bar in 1960. She attended Northwestern School of Law at night while married and raising three children and working as a legal assistant. She finished fourth in her class and years later credited her husband with taking a large part in raising their children. \"I am not a dependent woman,\" she said. \"But I could not have done the things I did without Carl.\" In November 1969, then-Gov. Tom McCall appointed her as a district court judge, making her the first woman of color to become a judge in Oregon. The following May, in the primary, Multnomah County voters elected her to the post outright and she became the first black woman to be elected to the bench in Oregon. Oregon Women Lawyers give an annual award in her name to someone who makes an outstanding contribution to promoting women and minorities in the legal profession and in the community.\n\nNotable: In 2000, on the 40th anniversary of her admission to the bar, she was recognized with the Award of Merit, the Oregon State Bar's highest honor.\n\nQuotable: \"Black has nothing to do with the color of the skin; it's a question of ethnicity.

Buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Duerksen was one of the founders of Deaconess Hospital, a predecessor of Salem Hospital. A group of Mennonites came to Salem in 1916 and opened a 12-bed hospital in an old hotel on Winter Street. Sister Anna, a graduate of Evangelical Deaconess Hospital School of Nursing in St. Louis, Mo., was one of four Mennonite sisters on the Board of Trustees. The sisters worked 20-hour days and received no salary until Social Security was launched in 1935. To them, it was a calling, not a job. Duerksen served as the hospital's only anesthetist. She lived in the basement and not only cared for patients, but cooked and did housekeeping. She married the hospital's gardener and worked at the hospital into the 1950s. In 1947, the Mennonites turned the hospital over to a board of Salem citizens, and the name was changed to Salem Memorial Hospital. It merged in 1969 with Salem General Hospital to create the hospital that exists today.\n\nNotable: In 1957, Duerksen was recognized by the Oregon Nurses Association with a life membership for her long leadership in providing health care.\n\nQuotable: Her legacy is well-documented in the annals of Salem Hospital. Ted Stang, a longtime local hospital administrator, met Duerksen after he came to Salem in 1968. She was in her 80s. He also heard many stories from the grandson of Deaconess Hospital's first administrator. \"She was diminutive, quiet, unassuming,\" Stang said. \"But boy, was she a powerhouse. People listened to what Sister Anna had to say, even though she was not the administrator. Sister Anna carried a lot of weight at that institution.\"\n\nSources: Salem History Online, Oregon Statesman, Salem Hospital\n\nSarah Winnemucca\n\nBorn: About 1844\n\nDied: Oct. 17, 1891\n\nFacts: Historians have referred to Winnemucca as the most famous Native American woman on the Pacific Coast. She used her language skills to try to be a peacemaker and was the first Native American woman to publish in English. Her book, \"Life Among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims,\" is an autobiographical account of her people and their contact with explorers and settlers. She was born and raised in Nevada but spent much of her life in southeastern Oregon as an interpreter for an agent at Malheur Reservation and as a scout and mediator for the Army during the Bannock War. She learned to read and write when her grandfather placed her in the home of a white family in Nevada. By the time she was 14, she could speak three Indian dialects, English and Spanish. She married at least twice, to an Army lieutenant and then an Indian Department employee. After the Bannock War, she received national attention by campaigning for Native American education programs and reservation reform — making more than 400 speeches. She even pleaded her cause to President Rutherford B. Hayes in Washington, D.C., where she reportedly received promises that were later broken. Winnemucca also opened and ran the first school in the West where Native American children could remain with their families and were not forced to stop speaking their native language.\n\nNotable: On March 9, 2005, a bronze statue of her representing Nevada was unveiled in the National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. A town in Nevada carries her family name.\n\nQuotable: \"I would place all the Indians of Nevada on ships in our harbor, take them to New York and land them there as immigrants, that they might be received with open arms ...\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Wikipedia, \"Native Peoples\"\n\nChloe Clarke Willson\n\nBorn: April 16, 1818, in Connecticut.\n\nDied: July 2, 1874. She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Willson was the first teacher at the Oregon Institute, which was founded by Methodist missionaries and later became Willamette University. She devoted her life to bringing religion and education to Oregon, and particularly to educating the young women of Salem. She traveled with about 50 new missionary recruits to the Oregon Territory in 1839. The following year, at a new mission outpost in the Puget Sound, she met her husband, William H. Willson. In 1844, the couple was asked to move to the settlement called Chemeketa Plains, which would become Salem. Chloe had been chosen to open the Oregon Institute.\n\nShe was both teacher and housemother for five primary-grade students and remained the only teacher the first two years. The board of the institute chartered \"Wallamet University\" in 1853 and began offering higher education. Chloe left Salem for a time after her husband died, but she returned in 1863 to serve as Governess of the Ladies Department at Willamette University, the equivalent of Dean of Women.\n\nNotable: Her husband is remembered as the founder of Salem because he filed the first plat of the city and held the original title to the land that now comprises Willamette University, the state Capitol and downtown Salem. Their name lives on today in Willson Park, directly west of the Capitol.\n\nQuotable: \"I feel the weight of responsibility which rests upon me in giving character to this infant institution,\" she wrote on Aug. 13, 1844, the first day of classes at the Oregon Institute. \"O my Father ... thou seest the desire of my heart for the prosperity of this institution, but without thy blessing it can never prosper.\"\n\nSources: Salem Online History, \"Journals of Brewer and Clarke\"\n\nHallie Parrish Hinges\n\nBorn: Jan. 30, 1868.\n\nDied: Jan. 25, 1950. She is buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Hinges was a vocal performer in Oregon for nearly 60 years, most famous for her performance during President Theodore Roosevelt's visit to Salem on May 21, 1903. Roosevelt called her the \"Oregon Nightingale\" when he heard her sing, and the nickname stuck. She studied music at Willamette University, graduating from the Willamette Conservatory when she was 18. She also studied in New York for a year. Music always was a big part of her life. She performed at her first public concert when she was 6, in the basement of First Methodist Church. Her audiences later expanded to political dignitaries. In 1891, she sang for President Benjamin Harrison, and in 1900, she performed for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. But her biggest moment came when Roosevelt visited Salem. Thousands gathered at Willson Park to see the president. Before he spoke, the 35-year-old soprano sang the national anthem. Roosevelt told Gov. George Chamberlain that Hinges had one of the most beautiful voices he had ever heard and asked if she would sing again. Hinges responded with a favorite of the time, \"The Flag Without a Stain,\" and witnesses claimed that the president wiped tears from his eyes.\n\nQuotable: \"Truly, she is the Oregon Nightingale,\" Roosevelt said.\n\nNotable: Hinges' grandfather was Methodist missionary Josiah L. Parrish, whom Parrish Middle School is named after.\n\nSource: The Statesman Journal, Salem Online History, \"Marion County History,\" Volume XV\n\nThelma Payne Sanborn\n\nBorn: July 18, 1896, in Silverton\n\nDied: Sept. 7, 1988, in Los Angeles\n\nFacts: She was the first Oregon woman to compete in the Olympics and the first to win a medal. She won the bronze in the 3-meter springboard diving competition at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium. The U.S. swept the medals in that event, with Payne missing silver by seven-tenths of a point. She was the U.S. women's springboard champion in 1918, 1919 and 1920, and trained at Multnomah Athletic Club in Portland. She reportedly incorporated ballet into her training regimen. After competing in the Olympics, she was a longtime swimming and diving coach at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. She taught the children of several famous people to swim, including John Wayne and Bing Crosby. Payne was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of fame in 1983, among one of the early classes that included Bobby Doerr, Mel Renfro and Steve Prefontaine.\n\nNotable: Sanborn said in a 1987 interview that she was one of the models for the red-suited diving girl introduced by Jantzen in 1920 and later plastered on billboards.\n\nQuotable: \"In those days, we had nothing to go by. We had to actually see someone perform a dive and then try to do it ourselves.

She came to Oregon in 1905 for the position of secretary of the Oregon Library Commission, which later became the State Library. She instituted many innovative programs, including the first books-by-mail service in the country. In a day when many Oregonians lived isolated lives without telephones, newspapers and other regular sources of information, her innovation was a lifeline for thousands of rural Oregonians, particularly women. She resigned as State Librarian in 1928 to marry Gov. Walter M. Pierce. He was elected in 1932 to Congress, and she became his secretary, researcher and speech writer. Their political partnership was one he readily recognized, often reminding his constituents that they had two representatives for the price of one.\n\nQuotable: \"The only thing I have ever done to make the world a better place to live is to promote libraries.\"\n\nNotable: At the end of her life, she bequeathed most of her estate to Reed College, a private Portland liberal-arts school. The $300,000 gift still supports a Cornelia Marvin Pierce chairmanship in American history at Reed.\n\nSources: \"Cornelia Marvin Pierce: Pioneer in Library Extension,\" \"Library Trends,\" Oregon State Library\n\nMaurine Brown Neuberger\n\nBorn: Jan. 9, 1907, in Cloverdale, Tillamook County.\n\nDied: Feb. 22, 2000, in Portland.\n\nFacts: She remains the first and only woman from Oregon to serve in the U.S. Senate. She and her husband, Richard, were known as a political team. They gained notice in 1951 as the first married couple in the nation to serve together in a legislature — he in the Oregon Senate and she in the House. He won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1954, and she served as his aide. When he died from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1960, she won a special election to fill the vacancy and then the general election to serve the next term. She focused on environmental and health issues, including sponsorship of one of the first bills to require warning labels on cigarette packaging. Back home, she took on Oregon's then-powerful dairy industry about a law forbidding the sale of yellow margarine. She donned a striped apron, pulled out a mixing bowl and showed her colleagues in the House — all men — just how much work it took to mix food coloring into the lard-white butter substitute. The ban was lifted, and her demonstration became part of the state's political lore.\n\nQuotable: \"Before she puts her name on the ballot, she encounters prejudice and people saying, 'A women's place is in the home.' She has to walk a very tight wire in conducting her campaign. She can't be too pussyfooting or mousy. Also, she can't go to the other extreme — belligerent, coarse, nasty.\"\n\nNotable: After serving in the U.S. Senate, she taught at Boston University and Radcliffe and was part of the social and academic circle surrounding the Kennedy family.\n\nSources: Oregon History Project, Harvard Square Library\n\nMercedes Bates\n\nBorn: 1916\n\nDied: Aug. 16, 1997, in Minneapolis\n\nFacts: Bates is one of the most important women to graduate from Oregon State University. She is credited with helping make Betty Crocker a household name. She was a vice president of the General Mills food company, in charge of the Betty Crocker division. The fictional character was created in 1921 and evolved into an American cultural icon under Bates' direction. After graduating from Oregon State in 1936 with a degree in food and nutrition, Bates began working at the Southern California Gas Co. and became supervisor of home service. She then moved to the Globe Mills food company before opening her own business in Hollywood as an advertising food consultant. She later joined the staff of McCall's magazine as food editor before moving to General Mills in 1964 as director of the Betty Crocker kitchens. Two years later, she rose through the ranks to become vice president and the first female corporate officer of General Mills. She held that title until retiring in 1983.\n\nNotable: She donated $3 million to Oregon State in the early 1990s, helping establish a nationally renowned Bates Family Study Center on campus. At that time, it was the largest one-time donation ever made to OSU. The facility opened in 1992 and was the first of its kind in the United States. It houses programs of research, instruction and outreach designed to benefit individuals and families.\n\nSources: Oregon State University, OSU Alumni Association\n\nNan Wood Honeyman\n\nBorn: July 15, 1881.\n\nDied: Dec. 10, 1970.

She married David Honeyman in 1908, raised three children and was active in civic and humanitarian organizations before becoming involved in politics. She served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1933, which ratified the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution, repealing prohibition. She was a state representative from 1935 to 1937 before being elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Congress. Her bids for re-election in 1938 and election in 1940 failed. While working in the Pacific Coast office of the U.S. Price Administration, the Multnomah County commissioners appointed Honeyman to the Oregon Senate in 1941 to fill a vacancy, and she served until her resignation in 1942. She was U.S. collector of customs in Portland from 1942 to 1953.\n\nNotable: After graduating in 1898 from St. Helens Hall (later incorporated in the Oregon Episcopal School), she continued her education at the Finch School in New York City, where she began a lifelong friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nSources: Oregon Blue Book, Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\n\nCarolyn Shelton\n\nBorn: Around 1877.\n\nDied: Unknown.\n\nFacts: Shelton was governor for a day in 1909, according to the Capital Journal. The newspaper ran a banner headline proclaiming her head of state Feb. 27, 1909, following the resignation of Gov. George E. Chamberlain and the delay in swearing in Secretary of State Frank W. Benson, the next in line. Chamberlain resigned his seat after being elected to the U.S. Senate. In a hurry to get to Washington, D.C., he left his resignation with his private secretary, Shelton, about 9 a.m. that Saturday. The papers weren't to be filed until 4 p.m. Monday, and Benson couldn't be sworn in right away, so there effectively was no governor except Shelton. The Capital Journal pronounced her \"the first woman to govern any state.\" The newspaper reported Sunday that Benson assumed control at 10:10 a.m. Nowhere in state records is Shelton mentioned as governor. Barbara Roberts officially would become the first female governor of Oregon when she was elected and served from 1991 to 1995.\n\nQuotable: \"I want to fill the governor's shoes, and he really has a small foot,\" Shelton was quoted as saying in the Capital Journal. \"I fear the principal trouble will be in trying to fill his hat.\"\n\nNotable: \"Time\" magazine reported July 26, 1926, that Chamberlain, 72, married Carolyn B. Shelton, 49, in Norfolk, Va. Shelton was clerk to the Senate Military Affairs Committee when Chamberlain was chairman during World War I. Chamberlain's first wife had died the previous year.\n\nSource: The Capital Journal\n\nMary Purvine\n\nBorn: Feb. 26, 1881.\n\nDied: June 10, 1965.

She left Salem after graduating at age 22, and launched her practice in the small Eastern Oregon town of Condon, where her brother and future governor of Oregon, Jay Bowerman, practiced law. Purvine returned to Salem after four years and began a medical practice specializing in obstetrics. She and her husband, Ellis, had three children. Her son, Ralph, followed in her footsteps and became a doctor. Mary Purvine was a member of the staffs at Salem General and Salem Memorial hospitals. She maintained a practice in Salem for more than half a century, working for many years out of her home on University Street SE. She practiced medicine until she was well into her 70s.\n\nNotable: Her book, \"Pioneer Doctor,\" was published in 1958.\n\nQuotable: \"Woman doctors were few in the early days of my practice.

The Native American woman, who married a white settler named Frank Riddle, was rewarded a government pension of $25 per month for helping save lives during the Modoc War of 1872-73. She and her husband acted as interpreters, messengers and mediators between her people and the U.S. Army. She is perhaps best known for having warned Gen. Edward Canby about the Modoc plot to kill him during peace negotiations. The general ignored the advice and was killed April 11, 1873. On the same day, Winema was credited for saving the life of Alfred Meacham, a Methodist minister and the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon. Meacham was wounded and about to be scalped when Winema yelled that the soldiers were coming, sending the Modoc warriors running. Meacham was the one who pressed Congress to give her a pension, which she received until she died.\n\nNotable: The Winema National Forest in Southern Oregon was established in 1961 and named after her.\n\nSources: Trover Studio collection, courtesy of the Oregon State Library\n\nElizabeth Lord and Edith Schryver\n\nElizabeth Lord\n\nBorn: Nov. 12, 1887, in Salem.\n\nDied: Oct. 9, 1976.

She is buried in her family plot in Kingston, N.Y.\n\nFacts: Lord and Schryver became the first female professionals to open a landscape-architecture firm in the Northwest in 1929. They designed more than 250 gardens from Eugene to Seattle. Schryver was considered the design genius and Lord the plant expert and businesswoman with connections. Lord grew up in Salem and was the daughter of a former Oregon governor, William Lord. Schryver grew up in New York and attended the Lowthrope School of Landscape Architecture in Massachusetts, where Lord also studied. A few years after Schryver graduated, she set sail for a garden tour of Europe, where she met Lord. The friends traveled and studied together for several months and then Lord brought Schryver to Salem. Two of their most notable imprints on Salem are the gardens at Historic Deepwood Estate and Bush's Pasture Park.\n\nQuotable: \"We were free-swinging career girls, and nobody ever questioned us,\" Schryver told the Statesman Journal in 1980.\n\nNotable: The Lord & Schryver Conservancy works to preserve and interpret the legacy of the two women.\n\nSources: Statesman Journal, Lord & Schryver Conservancy\n\nMinnie Hill\n\nBorn: 1863 in Albany.\n\nDied: January 1946 in San Francisco.\n\nFacts: Hill was the first female steamboat captain west of the Mississippi. On Dec. 1, 1886, at age 23, she was granted a master's and pilot's license. She had been working with her husband, Charles O. Hill, on various boats for several years and became \"thoroughly conversant with the steamboat business,\" according to \"Lewis & Dryden's Marine History of the Pacific Northwest.\" When Charles and Minnie bought the 112-foot Governor Newell in 1889, Charles went down into the engine room while Minnie took the pilothouse wheel. They specialized in moving scows laden with jetty stone from a quarry east of Vancouver, Wash., downstream to meet a U.S. Army Engineer tow boat, which took the loads to Astoria. The stone was used to build the south jetty at the mouth of the Columbia River. Minnie was a captain for 14 years. At least two movie producers supposedly tried to get her to consent to filming her life story, but she refused.\n\nNotable: She reportedly was the only woman on the Pacific Coast licensed to command a steamer until 1907, when a second-class master's and pilot's license was granted to a woman in the Puget Sound area.\n\nQuotable: Her son, Herbert W.

She was editor of The Advocate, an African-American newspaper published in Portland between 1903 and 1936, regularly challenging racial discrimination and becoming the unofficial spokeswoman for the city's small black community. She helped found the Portland chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, known as the NAACP, and craft the state's first civil-rights legislation, which would have mandated full access to public accommodations without regard to race. Although that piece of legislation failed, in 1925 she worked on the successful campaign to repeal Oregon's notorious exclusion laws, which prohibited African Americans from settling in the state.\n\nQuotable: \"Not even the pulpit has been as effective for the advancement of our group, and for justice, as the press.\"\n\nNotable: She ran for state representative in May 1932 but was not elected.

She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Corbett.\n\nFacts: Green was a Democrat in the United States Congress who helped push through legislation that led to Title IX. A former school teacher, radio commentator and lobbyist, she became an important figure in Oregon politics when she was elected to Congress in 1955. She served 10 terms and focused on women's issues, education and social reforms. In her first term, she proposed the Equal Pay Act to ensure that men and women were paid equally for equal work. The bill was signed into law eight years later. She is most noted for her work developing the legislation that was to become Title IX, which prohibited sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions. She introduced a higher-education bill that contained provisions regarding gender equity in education. The hearings on that bill, together with significant input from Rep. Patsy Mink and Sen. Birch Bayh, eventually resulted in the passage of Title IX in 1972.\n\nQuotable: Sen. Mark Hatfield called Green \"the most powerful woman ever to serve in the Congress.\"\n\nNotable: Linfield College annually presents the Edith Green Distinguished Professor award to a faculty member who has demonstrated outstanding performance in teaching and related faculty roles.

Among the 6,000 or so students who sat in her classes were current teachers and politicians, including retired U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield. She was a strong role model for a generation of up-and-coming women including Norma Paulus, who praised Eyre's work for equal rights for women, open government meetings and the preservation of historic buildings. Eyre came to Salem in 1904, when she was 6. She graduated from Willamette University in 1918 and began her teaching career in Salem in 1922. She taught history and government, economics and sociology, retiring in 1962. In addition to her contributions as an educator, she was involved in local government. She was a precinct committee member and president of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters, and ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic candidate for the state Senate in 1962.\n\nQuotable: She said she ran for the legislative office because she \"wanted to try out some of the things I had been teaching over the years.\"\n\nNotable: The Salem-Keizer School District named an elementary school in her honor in 1977.

Oswald West in January 1914 to declare martial law in Copperfield, perhaps Oregon's most notorious \"bad\" town. Copperfield was established in 1908 to house the mining and railroad crews working at Snake River. It had three saloons, including one owned by the mayor and another by a city councilman, and a population of 84 when Hobbs was dispatched. West had vowed personally to clean up the vice-ridden town but was warned that he would be shot if he tried, so he sent his private secretary. Described as a diminutive woman — 5-foot-3 and less than 100 pounds — Hobbs arrived with a small National Guard contingent and read the governor's orders to close the saloons and resign from city council. The orders were refused, Hobbs left town that afternoon and the National Guard placed the town under martial law. More troops eventually arrived and confiscated liquor and gambling devices. The town, about 75 miles northeast of Baker City, later was destroyed by fire and today is known as Oxbow.\n\nSources: Oregon State Archives, The Oregon Journal, The Oregon Statesman\n\nMarie Dorion\n\nBorn: Unknown\n\nDied: Sept. 5, 1850. She was reportedly buried at St. Louis Catholic Church in Gervais.\n\nFacts: She was the only woman among the overland expedition financed by John Jacob Astor in 1811-12 to establish a fur-trading post at the mouth of the Columbia River. The courageous Native American accompanied her husband and two small children on the journey. Like her predecessor on the Lewis and Clark expedition, Sacagawea, Dorion earned respect from the men. She never complained about the hardships along the journey and kept pace despite caring for two children and giving birth to a third. The epitome of Dorion's courage was noted after the expedition had reached what would later be named Astoria. She and her family returned with a trapping party to the Snake River, where Indians attacked and killed all but her and her two sons. They escaped by hiding in the brush. In the wake of the tragedy, including the death of her husband, she and the boys survived more than 50 days in the bitter cold of the Blue Mountains.\n\nQuotable: Roger Howard, who lives near the church in Gervais, on the legend of Marie Dorion: \"She should be as famous as Sacagawea.\"\n\nSource: Statesman Journal\n\nBetty Roberts\n\nBorn: Feb. 5, 1923.\n\nNow: June 25, 2011.\n\nFacts: Roberts was the first woman appointed to the Oregon Court of Appeals (1977) and the first woman appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court (1982). She was married and raising four children in the 1950s, when she signed up for college courses and graduated from Portland State University in 1958. She taught high school and by 1962 had a master's degree in political science from the University of Oregon. She then enrolled in the night program at Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College, continued to teach and was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives. She graduated from law school in 1966, the same year one daughter graduated from Stanford University and a son from high school. She married a lawyer and legislative colleague two years later, and they established a successful legal practice. She then became the lone woman in the Oregon Senate and in 1974, ran a strong statewide campaign for governor but was narrowly defeated in the primary. The Democratic Party named her to fill a vacancy on the ballot for the general election against U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood, and again she was narrowly defeated. The Oregon Women's Political Caucus named her the 1975 \"Woman of the Year\" for setting a precedent for other women to run for statewide office.\n\nNotable: She helped found Women's Investment Network-PAC to recruit and support women to run for the Legislature and Oregon Women Lawyers to promote women and minorities in the profession.

She was active in her neighborhood association and the local transit district board before running for office. She defeated two sitting city councilors (one man and one woman) in the primary and then went on to serve three terms. Being the first female mayor didn't seem like a big deal at the time, perhaps because Norma Paulus had laid the groundwork for women to become political leaders in Salem. Paulus served in the Oregon Legislature before becoming the first woman in Oregon history to win a state office in 1976, when she was elected Secretary of State. \"If Norma hadn't been so successful,\" Miller said, \"it would have been a lot harder. She had kind of tilled that ground for others to follow, and I've always thanked her for that.\" As mayor, Miller was most noted for her work in helping the city purchase 22 acres of waterfront property on the Willamette River, which today is Riverfront Park.\n\nQuotable: \"It was an amazing privilege to be mayor of Salem.

A native Oregonian, she was among the first women to enlist in the military in 1942, in what was called the Women's Army Corps (WAC). She started as an Army truck driver but soon became an officer. She spent most of World War II training thousands of WACs. She left active duty after the war and went to Lewis & Clark College in her hometown of Portland. She then returned to active duty and joined the Air Force. She was the war plans officer at one of the major bases in Europe during the Berlin Airlift and began her rise through the ranks. She was Director of Women in the Air Force from 1965 to 1973. She was promoted to brigadier general in 1971, the first woman to be appointed to that grade in the Air Force. Two years later, she became the first woman in any branch of service to reach the rank of major general, or two-star general. She retired in 1975 after a 33-year career in the Air Force and went on to serve as Special Assistant on women's issues for President Gerald Ford. She also held positions during the Carter and Reagan administrations and is recognized as a driving force behind women achieving opportunities and equal rights in the military.\n\nNotable: Holm authored three books.\n\nQuotable: \"There was an enormous desire to be part of the war effort.

She sponsored environmental legislation, civil rights and ethical changes. She was the Republican candidate for governor in 1986, but lost in a closely-contested race to Neil Goldschmidt. Four years later, Paulus was elected Superintendent of Public Instruction and led a comprehensive restructuring of the state's public school system. She spearheaded work to set rigorous academic standards for all students and to increase accountability with state testing standards. In 1996, U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley named her to the National Assessment Governing Board. A New York Times profile described Paulus' work in Oregon as the most cutting-edge school reform in the country.\n\nQuotable: \"I know I have made government more accountable. It's been a really rewarding experience to be involved in Oregon's state government because in our state, one person can still make a difference.\"\n\nNotable: Paulus never went to college.

The descendant of Oregon Trail pioneers and a fourth-generation Oregonian, she began her career in public service as an advocate for the educational rights of her autistic son. Her efforts resulted in one of the nation's first special-education laws and propelled her rise in politics to the governorship. She served on the Parkrose School Board, the Mt. Hood Community College Board and the Multnomah County Commission before her election to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1981. During her second term, she became Oregon's first woman House majority leader. In 1984, she was elected secretary of state, the first Democrat elected to that post in more than 100 years. She was re-elected in 1988. She ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for governor in 1990, and was elected to succeed Gov. Neil Goldschmidt. During her four-year term, Roberts was recognized as an advocate for public education, human rights and services, environmental management and streamlining state government.\n\nQuotable: \"You are looking at a woman who raised two children - one of them autistic - by herself.

Her first climbing lesson was on a 50-foot Douglas fir on the Corvallis campus, and she was hooked. She tackled rocks first, then mountains. She was part of the first successful women's ascent of Ama Dablam in 1983. From the summit, she could see the rising crest of Everest and set her sights on the world's tallest mountain. Her first attempt was unsuccessful because of a snowstorm that left the climbing party trapped in a snow cave for five days. But the following year, in 1988, she was triumphant. On Sept. 29, at the age of 29, after 29 days on the mountain, she made history by becoming the first American woman to stand on top of the 29,035-foot mountain. She went on to lead a successful expedition in 1993 at K2, the world's second tallest mountain.\n\nQuotable: \"Climbing has inspired me, shaped my life, and changed it.

Prior to entering politics, she enjoyed a career as a broadcast journalist. She graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in communications and worked for Oregon Public Radio and later for KVAL-TV in Eugene. Her political career began in 1996, when she was appointed by the Lane County commissioners to fill a vacancy in the Oregon Senate, then won re-election in 1998. She became vice-chairwoman of the Education Committee, dealing with such issues as charter schools, teacher tenure and school reform. She served in the Senate through 2002, and then was elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction. She held that office from 2003 to 2012, overseeing a department serving more than a half-million students in more than 1,200 schools. She was an advocate for students of color and those from low-income households, supporting increased Head Start coverage, full-day kindergarten, and English for second-language learners.

Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, evoked a spiritual battle with former President Donald Trump at its center.\n\n“Our God still saves. He still delivers, and he still sets free. Because on Saturday, the devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle. But an American lion got back up on his feet, and he roared,\" Scott said, sparking gathered delegates to respond with a roar of their own. \"Oh yea, he roared.\"\n\nThere was a wide array of religious symbolism on the floor of the Fiserv Forum the first night of the convention, where a panoply of screens beamed images of the American flag and Christian cross onto an eager crowd between speeches. But the through line firmly centered on Trump, whose emergence from Saturday's assassination attempt with a minor injury has been framed in Milwaukee as a miraculous, divine intervention.\n\nReligion and politics have long been intertwined in America, regardless of political ideology. This year's Republican National Convention is certainly not the first to feature speakers that use Scripture and faith to bolster their chosen candidate. Some of the same Biblical verses have been used by both major political parties throughout the years to advertise their nominee.\n\nIn the Republican Party of 2024, however, Trump has emerged as an unlikely spiritual figurehead as a political leader, experts said, fusing faith and politics at a level never seen before.\n\nArizona State University religious studies professor Terry Shoemaker said feelings of fear in the wake of the Pennsylvania shooting, relief at Trump’s recovery and excitement for his reelection chances could be a perfect storm for \"a more profound kind of civil religious experience\" in Milwaukee this week.\n\nIndeed, signs of it were already present.\n\nInside the RNC, civil leadership and Christianity merged on top of one merchandise table, where images of Trump sat atop stacks of Bibles for sale to the GOP party faithful next to cutting boards shaped in Trump's likeness.\n\nSellers framed one photo of Trump pumping his fist, blood streaming down his face as he emerged from under his Secret Service detail moments after the Pennsylvania assassination attempt. For $75, RNC attendees could purchase the \"God Bless the USA\" Bible, officially endorsed by Trump, which includes the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, Pledge of Allegiance, and the lyrics to the chorus to Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless The USA.”\n\nTrump as a civil religion\n\nThe Republican National Convention could be a hotbed for civil religion, a term popularized in the 1960s that refers to a “devotion and dedication to (one’s) nation-state that mirrors a kind of traditional religious devotion,” Shoemaker said.\n\nRepublican National Committee co-chair Michael Whatley asked attendees to observe a moment of silence and prayer for those affected by the July 13 shooting, there was a performance of Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA,” and an invocation by Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America Archbishop Elpidophoros.\n\n“Grant unto the delegates the powerful recognition of purpose, to bear witness to divine providence which has shielded this great land through the centuries and drives us to a more perfect union with one another, ever building on the labors of those pioneers of patriotism who went before us,” Elpidophoros said at one point during his nearly two-minute long prayer.\n\nCatholic Archbishop of Milwaukee, the Most Rev. Jerome Listecki, also referenced the Declaration of Independence in his prayer.\n\nShoemaker described the invocations as a “civil religious blessing.”\n\n“This is taking away from traditional Judeo-Christian ideas and linking them directly with the special foundation of the United States with its founders,” Shoemaker said.\n\nThough the number of Americans who are religiously unaffiliated has increased over time – sitting at 26% in 2023, according to the Public Religion Research Institute – Americans’ strong belief in God endures.\n\nThat’s why Shoemaker said it wasn’t surprising to see people flock to a prayer vigil in Milwaukee the day after the assassination attempt. Similar gatherings were organized after events such as the 9/11 terror attacks and a 2020 helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant and nine others, he said.\n\n\"This is a religious rally, and I’m not even sure I’d call it a civil religion. Civil religion has always been there in generic appeals to God,\" said John Fea, a religious historian from Messiah University who said the religious rhetoric surrounding Trump seems unique.\n\n\"There’s something different here.\"\n\n\"Now what we’re beginning to see is Christian nationalism, if you want to call it that, a fusion of politics and theological Christianity.\"\n\nDoes RNC religious rhetoric veer into Christian nationalism?\n\n\"There is a spiritual battle underway,\" right wing commentator Tucker Carlson told a Milwaukee crowd on Monday afternoon.\n\nCarlson was speaking at a \"policy fest\" held by The Heritage Foundation, one of the country's preeminent conservative think tanks. Heritage's profile has risen in recent weeks due to its Project 2025, a sweeping, 900-page playbook intended for the next conservative administration to follow to implement right-wing social and political priorities.\n\nTrump has sought to distance himself from the plan, which would expand presidential powers and enshrine some conservative social ideals into law, though numerous people who worked in Trump's administration were involved in drafting the Heritage proposal.\n\nFor four decades, researcher Frederick Clarkson has tracked a rise in the \"theocratic vision for American government,\" or Christian nationalism.\n\n“The Christian nationalists, as we've come to understand them, believe … an idea that God and the Founding Fathers intended America to be a Christian nation, but somewhere that vision got derailed along the way and somehow has to be restored,” said Clarkson, a senior research analyst at Political Research Associates, a think thank studying anti-democratic and anti-human rights political and social groups.\n\nThe movement for years had sat on the political sidelines, but it has gained traction, especially within conservative Catholic and evangelical circles. Many in the movement have become prominent influencers in the Republican Party and even advising Trump directly.\n\nEd Stetzer, author and dean of the Talbot School of Theology at Biola University, in La Mirada, California, said that the term “Christian nationalism” has become frequently misused.\n\n“People are motivated by their faith, and they're often mobilized by their faith. So, I don't think we would be surprised to see religious people in the political sphere,” Stetzer said. “Ultimately, though, we do live in a pluralistic society, and we can, should and must respect the religious liberty of people of different faiths and no faith.”\n\nStill, Stetzer said, there are “real dangers” to think about in religion and politics, but an overreaction to any mention of God and country in the same sentence doesn’t do anyone any favors.\n\nPraying for God to bless America wouldn’t be an example of Christian nationalism, but saying that America is “God’s special nation” would be, to Stetzer, “an inappropriate use of Christianity.”\n\nFaith outreach isn't being made just to Christians\n\nThough evangelical Christian themes undergird much of the RNC's programming this week, the Milwaukee stage also featured speakers from other faith traditions.\n\nClosing out Monday night's program, Harmeet Dhillon, a prominent Republican lawyer and close Trump ally, recited the Ardas, a Sikh prayer, in front of Trump and other convention attendees.\n\n“We thank you, dear God, for protecting his life,\" Ardas said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican Jewish Federation CEO Matthew Brooks spoke from the RNC stage, calling the 2024 election a \"critical moment for the American Jewish community and for Israel.\"\n\n\"This is our chance to continue the pro-Israel legacy of the most pro-Israel president in history, Donald J. Trump,\" Brooks said.\n\nVP pick 'strategic' move for Christian vote\n\nThat politics and religion, namely conservative Christianity, have fused so completely under the Republican leadership of Trump, a two-time divorcee beset by moral scandals who did not have a history of publicly talking about his church or his faith, is somewhat unusual in the American political tradition. Trump was raised Presbyterian and attended occasional Episcopal services during his first presidential term. In 2020 he announced he now identifies as non-denominational Christian.\n\n\"He rarely uses the kind of language many of his Christian supporters use — a personal relationship with God, seeking God’s voice or following his will, being moved by the Holy Spirit,” Emily Crews, the executive director of the Marty Center at the University of Chicago Divinity School, said.\n\nStill, Trump's surrogates and supporters often invoke that language for him. On Tuesday, Lara Trump compared her father-in-law to \"the righteous\" Proverbs 28 states are \"as bold as a lion.\"\n\n\"Two days ago, evil came for the man we admire and love so much,\" U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, said at a Monday night speech. \"I thank God that His hand was on President Trump.”\n\nOn Tuesday, former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Dr. Ben Carson referenced the book of Romans, telling delegates, \"When God is with us, nobody can stand against us.\"\n\n\"With this assurance from the Almighty, even the face of evil itself cannot shake our resolve,\" Carson said. \"We will keep fighting, we will keep praying, and by the grace of God we will save our country and reelect President Trump.\"\n\nAnd Fea said Trump has fulfilled decades-long goals of the Religious Right that even Ronald Reagan and other GOP presidents didn't fully realize, particularly on social issues such as abortion.\n\n\"Donald Trump is advancing the idea that America is a Christian nation they have been praying for since the 1970s. They see Donald Trump as the result of decades of praying and lobbying and fighting and trying to make America Christian, or reclaim a Christian consensus,\" Fea said. \"Within the evangelical worldview, God uses flawed people to accomplish God’s ends. I think the assassination attempt only strengthened their idea that clearly the hand of God is on this man.\"\n\nNow Trump has tapped his next surrogate in JD Vance, which Crews called a \"wise strategic move\" given the political conservative hasn't embroiled himself in scandals or criminal trials.\n\n“Christians who are looking to vote for someone who regularly invokes his religious identity, but who has a more polite veneer and more pragmatic perspective on politics than Trump, could find Vance really compelling,” she said.\n\nVance is also in line with other Christian conservative values. He’s “openly adoring of his wife and children while maintaining a ‘family values’ perspective,\" Crews said.\n\n“And his background in Appalachia and small-town Ohio make him appealing to Americans who live in rural states or those who buy into Trump’s critiques of political ‘elites,’” she said. “In short, Vance covers a lot of ground for Trump, especially in contested states like Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.”\n\nVance is a convert to Catholicism who was baptized into the faith in August 2019, as reported by The American Conservative. In an exclusive interview with the outlet that month, Vance said he was raised a Christian but “never had a super-strong attachment to any denomination, and was never baptized.”\n\nVance, once sharply skeptical of Trump, is working this week to distance himself of past critical comments.\n\nIn a 2016 column he penned for USA TODAY, he differentiated the religiosity of Trump’s voters and those of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, saying the former candidate’s voters had largely “abandoned the faith of their forefathers and myriad social benefits that come with it.”\n\nProgressive faith leaders push back\n\nOutside the RNC's security perimeter, local progressive faith leaders have pushed back on what they characterized as rhetoric of white, Christian nationalism arising from conservative circles.\n\nThe Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope, an interfaith social activism group, drew hundreds on Sunday at an event to criticize the rise of Christian nationalism.\n\nOn Monday, the Rev. Jennifer Nordstrom stood with protesters under the searing midday sun as hundreds marched for progressive causes. Nordstrom ministers the First Unitarian Society of Milwaukee, though she said she was at the protest in a personal capacity.\n\nNordstrom said she shares a \"deep concern about the fusion of white Christian nationalism and politics\" with members of her congregations.\n\n\"Separation of church and state is fundamental to who we are as a country in order for everyone to be free,\" Nordstrom said. \"Those two things have to be separate. We believe deeply in the practice of freedom, free religion. Everybody gets to practice their faith, everybody is welcome, no matter what religion.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/03/15/phoenix-bernie-sanders-rally/81827018/", "title": "Bernie Sanders to 7,000 in Phoenix: 'Ready for a political revolution?'", "text": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders rallied more than 7,000 people Tuesday at the Phoenix Convention Center even as he faced big losses to rival contender Hillary Clinton in crucial primaries across the country.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Sanders energetically addressed the crowd, his voice hoarse, drawing roaring cheers.

Are you tired of a handful of billionaires running our economy?\" he asked. \"Well, if you are, you’ve come to the right place!\"\n\nThe independent U.S. senator from Vermont was holding the event as media outlets projected Clinton, a former secretary of state, to win Florida, North Carolina and Ohio. The outcomes in Missouri and Illinois, by the end of his nearly hourlong speech, were not yet determined.\n\nSanders had been hoping to cut into the significant delegate lead Clinton holds.

What the Latino community is telling me is they are tired of living in the shadows. They are tired of living in fear and being exploited,\" Sanders said. \"They want — I want — comprehensive immigration reform.\"\n\nSanders said Congress should give the country's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship. And if it did not act, he as president would take executive action on immigration.\n\nHe said children like 15-year-old Katherine Figueroa, who introduced Sanders before the rally, should not endure family deportations.\n\nFigueroa, one of several Latino, African-American and gay supporters who spoke at the rally, said her parents had been detained by immigration officials for months, leaving her under the care of her aunt.\n\n\"I am one of millions of kids that are left behind... We want deportations to stop completely,\" she said. \"I truly believe that Bernie is going to bring the change and that he is going to make our future even better. ... He is our future president.\"\n\nAt Bernie Sanders rally, teenage foe of Sheriff Joe Arpaio speaks\n\nSanders said immigration reform would \"unite families not divide them.\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign has criticized Sanders for opposing a 2007 bipartisan compromise on immigration reform, but he subsequently voted for a 2013 bill.\n\nOne of the most deafening cheers came next, when Sanders criticized Republican front-runner Donald Trump for insulting groups, including immigrants.\n\n\"In our country, not everybody agrees. ... What is not acceptable ... is to throw racist attacks against Mexicans,\" Sanders said. \"The reason that Donald Trump will never be elected president is the American people will not accept insults to Mexicans and women. The American people will not accept a president who insults our veterans.\"\n\nSanders said voters should not \"settle.\"\n\n\"You do not have to accept the status quo. We can do better,\" he said.\n\nAttacking Clinton as part of a \"corrupt\" campaign-finance system and \"rigged economy,\" Sanders pointed out she was supported by a well-funded super PAC, had accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches on Wall Street and had voted for the Iraq war.\n\nLillian James, 18, of Gilbert, said Sanders’ campaign rally solidified her belief in him as an “authentic” presidential candidate.\n\n“He is consistent with his policies,” she said. “And he’s always working for the little guy.”\n\nIn her view, Sanders has shined the light on important issues: “Look at the room! It’s alive with diverse people, not just the normal demographic you see. Regardless, if Bernie doesn’t get on that ballot, we’re not going to stop. When he says, 'Start a revolution,' stuff doesn’t happen overnight. He’s telling us the truth. He’s showing us what we need to see and we’re becoming a bit more educated.”\n\nSamantha Shank, 49, a disabled veteran from Tempe, thought Sanders’ message was “fabulous,” and she credited him for his consistent stance on issues at a time when politicians frequently flip-flop.\n\nDespite his losses Tuesday, she remains convinced Sanders could still secure the Democratic nomination for president.\n\n“More people are listening and they’re hearing and they’re seeing what his opponent is doing – which is being untruthful,” she said, speaking of Clinton.\n\nTerrell Tarver, 52, said he loves what Sanders stands for.\n\n“But the way things are now, Hillary is going to win,” the Tempe resident said.\n\nHe said Sanders’ messages on Social Security, health care and the minimum wage have earned his vote on March 22.\n\n“Nobody can make it on 7, 8 dollars an hour – even 12 dollars an hour is hard,” Tarver said. “And we’ve got too much greed with corporations that are running everything.”\n\nEven if Sanders doesn’t secure the nomination, he said, the Vermont senator has raised awareness about important issues: “He’s making people see things in a new way.”\n\nHe said he hoped Clinton would pick Sanders as her vice-presidential candidate.\n\nBrandon Mason, 31, a software engineer from Scottsdale, was familiar with Sanders’ message.\n\n“It’s pretty much on point with what I want to hear and what I think a lot of Americans want to hear,” he said, adding that in his opinion, Sanders is the only presidential candidate doing so.\n\nMason said Sanders’ messages on climate change, social issues and immigration should not be ignored.\n\n“I agree categorically with everything he said, and I’m not a person that would just say that,” he said.\n\nJose Silva, 28, a software sales executive, left work early to see Sanders. He waited five hours to hear him and afterward said he’s the most qualified person in the presidential field.\n\n“You have liars on one end and a circus on the other,” Silva said.\n\nHe agreed with Sanders that health care and education are natural human rights.\n\nIf Sanders doesn’t get the necessary delegates to win the nomination, Silva said, “at this point, I would probably vote Hillary Clinton – I’d rather see her in office than Donald Trump -- not that she’s the perfect candidate, but that’s who I would settle for.”\n\nErika Andiola, a Sanders campaign spokeswoman, said Sanders had proven wrong the pundits who said he didn't have a chance.\n\n\"They cannot tell us any longer that we have to continue to go with the flow, to go with the establishment,\" she said.\n\nHow to vote in Arizona's presidential-preference election\n\nThe crowd was dominated by young people, a generation that has flocked to Sanders, but it included parents toting children and baby-boomers. Many were wearing “Feel the Bern! 2016” T-shirts and pins featuring illustrations of his signature white hair and glasses.\n\nSongs like Bob Marley’s “Revolution” and Muse’s “Uprising” blared before the rally.\n\nLizete Garnica, 27, said she was so inspired by Sanders’ campaign that she brought her 9-year-old son, who was on spring break, to hear Sanders speak.\n\n“I’m here because I want to hear my next president speak,” she said. “There’s so many of us that couldn’t make it today. He has people everywhere, young people, old people, he has all kinds of people behind him and he’s going to make it.”\n\n“He speaks the truth, he tells it like it is, (but he does it) without hate.\"\n\nHailey Vincent, 24, said she hoped Sanders addressed the violence that has marred recent rallies for Trump.\n\n\"I've seen videos of what's been going on — people getting hit, people getting pepper-sprayed,\" she said. \"Everything that's been going on goes against everything that America's supposed to stand for.\"\n\nVincent said she also hoped Sanders would spend some time talking about illegal immigration.\n\n\"I just want him to express the plan he has, as opposed to just putting a giant wall up. I want him to refute everything Donald Trump has to say about it,\" she said.\n\nRobert Barton, a real-estate developer, said he couldn’t pass up an opportunity to hear Sanders speak on his home turf.\n\n\"I’m hoping to get hold of a microphone and ask him a couple of questions,” said Barton, 61, adding that he particularly liked Sanders’ message on the minimum wage and health care. \"I love his stance and the way he has had the same goals and aspirations for forever.”\n\nIs Arizona still Hillary Clinton country?\n\nClinton still leads Sanders in the few Arizona polls that have been released.\n\nHer campaign has ramped up its efforts in the state in recent weeks, holding events with women supporters, the LGBT community and celebrities like Olympic medalist Michelle Kwan.\n\nShe also released a Spanish-language television ad ahead of Sanders' rally, touting her support for immigration reform, children’s health care and affordable college.

Mike Lynch's body was discovered on Thursday, while the bodies of Jonathan Bloomer, a non-executive chair of Morgan Stanley International, his wife, Judy Bloomer, Clifford Chance attorney Chris Morvillo, who was a U.S. citizen, and his wife, Neda Morvillo, were discovered on Wednesday. The five bodies were all located inside the sunken ship.\n\nRecaldo Thomas, the ship's cook and a citizen of Antigua, was pronounced dead on Monday after his body was found near the ship. Thomas also went by Ricardo, according to media reports.\n\nThe bodies will be officially identified and autopsies will be performed in Palermo.\n\nThe fire brigade said on Friday the rescue operation was \"long and delicate\" – the ship sits more than 160 feet underwater, and its inner passageways are narrow, posing a challenge to divers. More than 400 rescuers were involved, including 28 specialist divers, officials said.\n\nLynch's family said in a statement on Friday the family \"is devastated, in shock and is being comforted and supported by family and friends.\"\n\n\"Their thoughts are with everyone affected by the tragedy. They would like to sincerely thank the Italian coastguard, emergency services and all those who helped in the rescue,\" they wrote.\n\n\"Their one request now is that their privacy be respected at this time of unspeakable grief.\"\n\nBreaking news, in your pocket. Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\n\nA judicial investigation has been opened into the sinking, which has baffled naval marine experts, who say a boat like the Bayesian, built by Italian high-end yacht manufacturer Perini, should have withstood the storm.\n\nProsecutors in the nearby town of Termini Imerese have opened an investigation into whether human errors were a factor. Coast Guard officials already have questioned the captain, James Cutfield, and surviving crew members and passengers as part of the investigation.\n\nA maritime legal expert told USA TODAY the disaster could lead to lawsuits and possible criminal charges against Cutfield.\n\n\"As far as the charges, it appears that the captain will be investigated for not having due diligence in command of his vessel,\" said Mitchell Stoller, a maritime expert witness and captain. \"He cannot discharge his duties.\"\n\nStoller said a captain's general duties include watching local weather reports and preparing for incoming storms. He said ships usually don't remain anchored during a storm so that they can maneuver in turbulent waters − Italian authorities have said the Bayesian was likely anchored before the disaster.\n\n\"The general standard of care in this situation is to monitor the weather, exercise caution, have a night watch, have the engine going, ready to maneuver,\" he said.\n\nGiovanni Costantino, CEO of The Italian Sea Group, which owns Perini, told Reuters the crew made a string of \"indescribable, unreasonable errors\" in the leadup to the disaster. Design or construction errors did not play a role, he said.\n\nNo charges have so far been announced. Prosecutors will hold a news conference on Saturday.\n\nCutfield did not immediately return a request for comment from USA TODAY sent on Friday to a Facebook profile that appeared to belong to him. It is unclear if Cutfield has retained an attorney.\n\nComplex Salvage Operation\n\nFurther inspections of the ship, which officials say is intact and lying on its right side, could give investigators more clues. Authorities may pull it out of the water, but the operation would be expensive and complicated.\n\nNick Sloane, a South African engineer who led the operation to recover the Costa Concordia, a cruise liner that sank 12 years ago, estimated such an operation could cost up to $16.7 million, in interviews with Italian media on Friday.\n\nPulling the yacht to the surface could take several days, and would need to be done \"very, very slowly,\" he told daily La Repubblica. The entire operation could take up to eight weeks and would need to be completed by mid-October, he said.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/20/bayesian-super-yacht-sinking-experts-puzzled/74873618007/", "title": "Why Bayesian super yacht sank, leaving 1 dead, 6 missing", "text": "The Bayesian set off on a leisurely cruise around Italy's southern coast on a sunny day in late July.\n\nThe luxurious super yacht − which boasted one of the largest masts in the world and carried a crew of business moguls, including British tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his family and a chair of Morgan Stanley − set sail from the Amalfi Coast, bound for Sicily.\n\nLess than a month later, the ship had sunk 160 feet under the water, leaving its cook dead and six of its passengers, including at least two Americans, missing and prompting a massive search that has drawn international attention.\n\nNow, experts are trying to piece together why in the early hours Monday the Bayesian was quickly pulled under the waves amid a storm that saw at least one tornado spin up over the water.\n\nBreaking news to start your day smart. Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\n\nA perfect storm led to Bayesian sinking, experts say\n\nThe combination of unlikely factors that could have contributed to the ship's fate constituted a \"black swan event,\" Matthew Schanck, chairman of the Maritime Search and Rescue Council, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe Bayesian was well-built: A 2008 product of Italian ship maker Perini, it was constructed in accordance with international maritime standards and commercially certified by the U.K.'s Maritime and Coastguard Agency, according to Schanck.\n\nThe bout of bad weather that swept the area when the ship went down was also out of the ordinary in the northern Mediterranean, \"which isn't renowned for prolonged, significant stormy weather,\" he said.\n\n\"The fact that those two elements have then resulted in the foundering of a super yacht is pretty extraordinary,\" Schanck said. \"These things don't happen every day.\"\n\nAfter the ship sank just before 5 a.m. local time, 15 people, including a 1-year-old, were pulled from the water. Some were rescued from a life raft by the crew of a ship docked nearby.\n\nRicardo Thomas, the ship's cook and a native of Antigua, was found dead, according to authorities.\n\nAs of Tuesday, six people were missing, including Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter. Several missing passengers were involved in Lynch's trial on fraud charges, including Jonathan Bloomer, a Morgan Stanley chair who served as his character witness, and one of Lynch's attorneys. Lynch, accused of fraud after he sold his company to electronics giant Hewlett-Packard, was acquitted of all charges weeks ago.\n\nWho is Mike Lynch?UK entrepreneur among those missing after superyacht sinks off Sicily\n\nTornado formed over unusually hot water\n\nStorms in the area that night may have whipped up a water spout, a tornado over the water, according to local meteorologists.\n\nIt was likely triggered by the water's unusual warmth, said Rick Shema, a certified consulting meteorologist who served in the Navy.\n\n\"The water spout was an uncommon occurrence,\" he said. \"But again, these things happen, especially in warmer water.\"\n\nAt 83.7 degrees, water in the area was more than 3 degrees hotter than average on the day the Bayesian sank, likely the result of climate change, Shema said.\n\n\"Hurricanes can form at 80 degrees. This was almost four degrees higher than that,\" he said.\n\nThe water spout may have spun up when cooler air dropped from mountainous places nearby onto the hot water, he said. \"A water spout is a vortex, basically like a tornado, spinning real fast, sucking up water and moisture as the column rises,\" he said.\n\nAlthough water spouts only reach around 120 mph, as compared with tornadoes on land, which can reach up to 300 mph, \"you don't need 200 mph to sink a ship,\" he said.\n\n\"Even an average tornado, 120 miles an hour, that's a lot of wind,\" he said, \"which would heel the boat over for sure.\"\n\nWater spouts spring up suddenly, Shema said. Before they strike, winds can be slow, but \"once the water spout comes over, bam, it's on,\" he said.\n\nBefore sunrise, the ship's crew may not have seen the water spout coming. \"The visibility was probably a big factor,\" he said.\n\nWith the windows of the yacht opened, as they likely were in the hot weather, the water spout could have triggered water that flooded through the portholes, Shema said, causing the ship to sink.\n\nTragedy strikes:Scramble to find survivors after Bayesian yacht sinks off Sicily coast\n\nSearch continues, but shift to recovery phase approaches\n\nItalian authorities said the Bayesian was probably at anchor when the storm struck, meaning it couldn't maneuver and ride the waves, according to Mitchell Stoller, a captain and maritime expert witness. Other ships in the area that turned on their engines rode out the storm, he said.\n\n\"When you're at anchor and you see weather, you start your engine and you put the wind on the bow. You don't let it get on the side,\" he said.\n\nSchanck said another key question concerns the position of the keel, a heavy weight underneath the boat that acts as a counterbalance to keep it upright, when the ship sank. When lifted, \"that's going to affect the stability of the vessel, because, obviously, you've now raised the center of gravity of that vessel,\" he said.\n\nThe Bayesian was floating over 160 feet of water at the time, deep enough that the keel would likely be deployed. But the fact that \"the vessel heeled over so heavily makes me question that,\" Schanck said.\n\nThe cause of the disaster may not be known until the ship can be examined in more detail, experts say. Prosecutors in a nearby town have already opened an investigation.\n\nSchanck said investigators will have plenty to work with once the operation moves into a recovery phase.\n\n\"The vessel is intact and in good condition on the seabed,\" he said. \"There's a lot of eyewitness accounts from other vessels in the area and the shore.\"\n\nAs the search entered its second day on Tuesday, the rescue effort may shift in that direction soon. \"I suspect, later on, today or tomorrow, we'll probably see some mention of a recovery operation being stated,\" Schanck said.\n\nThe decision to would depend on whether rescuers find signs of life in the ship and air pockets or survivable spaces, Schanck said. At this point, survivors on the water's surface looks unlikely. \"My professional opinion is that the casualties will be located within the vessel,\" he said.\n\n\"There is a risk versus benefit in all maritime search and rescue incidents,\" he said. \"Where we start transitioning to a recovery phase, that line shifts.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nCybele Mayes-Osterman is a breaking news reporter for USA Today.

The total eclipse of the sun then traced a path from southern Texas to northern Maine, where it exited into Canada and the ocean beyond.\n\nThe rare event was an astronomical experience like no other. Monday's eclipse was unusually accessible to millions of people. It was widely anticipated not only for its remarkable period of darkness, but for its rare timing: No total solar eclipse would be visible from the contiguous United States again until 2044. While millions of Americans may have seen today’s eclipse, a small group in Texas was among the very first.\n\nEdge of eclipse shadow began in south Texas\n\nAlejandra Martinez, a seventh-grade science teacher from the south Texas border city of Eagle Pass, peered up at the gray, gauzy sky, anxiously awaiting the solar eclipse’s entrance into the USA.\n\nSitting with a telescope under a camping canopy in a corner of the county airport, Martinez, 42, and two other science enthusiasts had been recruited by NASA to participate in an effort called Citizen CATE 2024, where more than 30 teams perched in the eclipse’s path will record the shadowy trek across the country.\n\nIn this spot, less than five miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, she and her team would be among the first people in the U.S. to witness the phenomenon. Eagle Pass sits near the very beginning of the eclipse’s track from southwest to northeast across the country. It also sits very near dead-center of it, where the period of “totality” will be the longest. That total shadow was still more than an hour away when the edge of the shadow began to darken the sky.\n\nMartinez, dressed in a “This Totality Rocks” T-shirt and eclipse-themed skirt, watched as the penumbra crept across the airfield, about 10 minutes past noon local time. She put on her eclipse glasses and peered up at the sky. The gauzy clouds parted. “There it is! There it is!” she yelled. “First contact. It’s begun!”\n\nClouds came and went as the shadow grew for the next hour. As totality approached Eagle Pass, the sky shaded a dull gray then a heavy brown and the temperature dropped a few degrees. Only a sliver of the sun remained.\n\nA few seconds before 1:27 p.m. CT, the crowd counted down, “3..2..1…” The sun was gone, completely covered by the moon. Darkness spread over the small airport grounds. “Oh my god,” Martinez said, a hand covering her heart. “This is so cool!”\n\nHow to tell if you have eye damage from looking at a partial eclipse?\n\nFor those who took a chance and looked at the sun without protective eyewear during the eclipse, concerns may arise if their vision starts to seem impaired. Have they suffered eclipse blindness?\n\nLooking directly at the sun even briefly without the proper safety glasses can result in eye damage, either temporary or permanent. The body's natural squinting reaction in normal circumstances prevents people from staring directly at the sun, but that reflex may not be activated during partial eclipses, even though a partly shielded sun can still burn the retina.\n\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology says pain won't be an indication of damaged eyes because the retina lacks pain nerves. Worrisome signs are instead blurry vision, headaches, light sensitivity, blind spots in the central vision, distorted vision and changes in color perception. Anyone experiencing those symptoms should see an ophthalmologist, the AAO says.\n\nWhat was the timeline of the 2024 solar eclipse?\n\nThe total eclipse began in Mexico at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, Monday before crossing into Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT. It ended in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT. Even those who weren't in the path of totality could see a percentage of the eclipse.\n\nTo find out exactly when the eclipse occurred in your area, you can search by USA TODAY's database by ZIP code for a viewing guide.\n\nStudents in Washington get hands-on learning\n\nDozens of students spilled out of Ida B. Wells Middle School in Washington, D.C., gripping cardboard solar eclipse glasses and chatting with excitement. “Why is the sun shaped as a moon?” one student asked after looking toward the sun. “Why is it not getting dark?’’ asked another.\n\nTeacher Troy Mangum, who the students called “Mr. Mango,’’ slowly explained the science behind the experience as he cautioned others to put on their glasses. Students at the school in northwest D.C. had had lessons about the eclipse leading up the day’s teaching outside the classroom.\n\n“Anytime we can get hands on or dynamic learning … it’s invaluable,’’ said Mangum, a social emotional learning coach. “We talked about it so much. It’s nice to see them get excited about qeeky Mr. Mango type of stuff.”\n\nSkylar Cruel, 12, had come outside with her science class. “I just really wanted to see it,’’ she said. “You get to see it turn from light to dark.”\n\nSteps away at Whittier Elementary School, which focuses on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), younger students put on their glasses and tilted their heads up toward the sun behind their school.\n\nMichael Haile joined his daughter, Markan Worku, 9, a student at Whittier, and brought along his 5-year-old son, Keab. He called it a memorable experience for his children. Markan, who had been learning about solar eclipses in her third-grade class, simply said, “This is cool!’’\n\n− Deborah Berry\n\nIn Michigan, a bonding experience for a mother and her three kids\n\nIn Michigan, eclipse enthusiasts packed a watch party along the Detroit Riverwalk near Cullen Plaza. They sat on the grass, on benches and berms. For Janelle Ikonen of Waterford, it was a chance to bond with her three children − Hannah, 9; Elim, 12; and Isaac, 14 − whom she took out of school for the day.\n\n“I wanted to experience a unique event with them,” said Ikonen, 47. “It’s one of my big deals to me, to experience things with my kids. … I hope they’ll remember spending time with me.”\n\nIn Grand Rapids, where 94% coverage of the sun was expected, viewers gathered on the city's “Blue Bridge,” which offered a view of the eclipse over the Grand River. With no cloud cover over the city, visitors had an unobstructed scene. The Grand Rapids Public Museum set up a series of solar telescopes.\n\nJill and Wes Johnson, 50 and 14, were among those awaiting max coverage. They’d considered traveling from Grand Rapids to a place with total coverage, but decided 94% coverage was worthwhile enough to stay home.\n\n“I think people are excited to see something unique,” Jill Johnson said.\n\n− Georgea Kovanis and Arpan Lobo, Detroit Free Press\n\nUS women's soccer team takes in eclipse ahead of title game\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio − The U.S. women’s national soccer team took a break from SheBelieves Cup preparation to watch the eclipse.\n\nSeveral team members, including World Cup veterans Crystal Dunn, Alyssa Naeher, Naomi Girma and Trinity Rodman, coaches and staff members donned eclipse glasses and went outside their hotel to see the rare event.\n\nAs the sky darkened and the moon moved in front of the sun, someone yelled, “Come on, keep going!” Columbus is just outside the path of totality, so all but a sliver of the sun wound up being covered.\n\nThe USWNT is in Columbus for the final of the SheBelieves Cup on Tuesday night against Canada.\n\n− Nancy Armour\n\nWitnessing the first total eclipse from a cruise ship\n\nPassengers aboard Holland America's Koningsdam cruise ship eagerly gathered on the top decks at 10 a.m. local time to watch the spectacle of a solar eclipse.\n\nPositioned off the coast of Mazatlan, Mexico − the first city in North America to witness the total eclipse − the ship provided an ideal vantage point for viewing the celestial event. Accompanied by an astronomer, the captain meticulously adjusted the ship's position to ensure the best possible view.\n\nDan Fueller, an experienced eclipse observer who had previously seen similar phenomena from ships in 1991 and 1998, emphasized the advantages of viewing the eclipse from a cruise ship. He noted the flexibility of the ship's mobility allowed for optimal positioning along the eclipse's path, ensuring unobstructed views.\n\n\"You're on a cruise ship and (the best view) is a little bit farther to the west or a little bit farther to the east − along the path, there's a clear sky − the ship can move. If you're on land and there's not a road there, you better have a tank.\"\n\n− Joshuan Rivera\n\nPartial eclipse 'like a little Pac-Man taking a bite out of the sun'\n\nIn Parthenon, Arkansas, the eclipse began near the Buffalo National River. Five friends traveled from Florida to be on a rock outcropping to witness the celestial event.\n\n“Yes! I see it!” Angie Printiss exclaimed.\n\n“Oh ya! You can see it,” said Kate Estes. “It’s like a little Pac-Man taking a bite out of the sun.”\n\nAt 20 minutes before totality, the sky got noticeably darker. The shadow of crescent sun shapes played off the limestone rocks.\n\n“It looks like water − like fish scales,” Estes said. “That is so weird, when the trees move you can really see it.”\n\n− Jennifer Portman\n\nNew Englanders travel for better view of the eclipse\n\nCrowds ballooned into the thousands midday Monday in the center of St. Johnsbury, Vermont, as the nearly cloudless sky and warm sun boosted temperatures to an unseasonably 60 degrees.\n\nJim and Kim Cooper drove over from New Hampton, New Hampshire, their first time doing more than just passing through the town locals call St. Jays. Their son had proposed to his girlfriend in Tennessee during the 2017 eclipse and then had an eclipse-themed wedding, but the Coopers had never seen a total eclipse for themselves, so they decided to come to the closest place where they could be assured of a good view.\n\nJeffrey Breau had seen that 2017 eclipse for himself and was so impressed that he convinced family members to join him this time. Breau’s girlfriend, Nell Hawley, came up with him from Cambridge, Massachusetts, while his brother Alex and his girlfriend Diana Ventura drove up from New York City. The Breau brothers' father, Walter, joined them in taking in their first eclipse.\n\n“I would have been OK watching it in the yard,” Walter said, though he would only have seen a partial eclipse from there. “That’s what you think now,” Jeffrey said quickly. “Talk to me in two hours.”\n\n− Karen Weintraub\n\nKids bring homemade eclipse viewers to National Mall\n\nLucas and Lucy Porto Banco didn’t need to buy fancy eclipse glasses – the 7- and 10-year-old siblings made their own eclipse viewers from two cardboard shoe boxes left over from a couple of their mom’s recent shoe purchases.With the help of a YouTube tutorial video, they made two holes in each box with a whittling knife and taped tin foil over. Then they used dry spaghetti to poke holes in the tin foil for the sun’s light to pass through and project onto the dark inside of the box.The kids put together the viewer in little more than five minutes, Lucy said. “Maybe 15, with covering all the gaps in the shoe box,” she said.Even with his own eclipse-viewing creation, Lucas said he may still take advantage of his eclipse glasses. “I’m going to do both,” he said.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat is an 'umbra?' − and other eclipse words\n\nAstronomers and eclipse enthusiasts used a bunch of specialized words Monday as the nation experienced its first solar eclipse since 2017 and the last one for until 2044. Here are a few of those terms and what they mean, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nBaily's Beads – This refers to the beaded appearance of the moon's edge as the eclipse nears totality. Shafts of sunlight shine through deep valleys on the moon's surface, which causes the effect known to observers as Bailey's Beads.\n\nUmbra – The darkest part of the moon’s shadow, within which the entirety of the sun's bright face is blocked. An observer standing in the umbra sees a total solar eclipse.\n\nPenumbra: The lighter part of the moon's shadow, making up its outer portion, where light can reach.\n\nCorona – The sun’s upper atmosphere, visible as a pearly glow around the eclipsed sun during totality.\n\nTotality – The maximum phase of a total solar eclipse, during which the moon’s disk completely covers the sun's bright face. It can last from a fraction of a second to a maximum of 7 minutes, 31 seconds, depending on viewing location and other factors.\n\n− Dale Denwalt, The Oklahoman\n\nA last-minute search for glasses for 'a perfect spot'\n\nPatsy Faoro walked toward a half dozen people gathered at the gate of Turner Farm Park in Great Falls, Virginia. The people were awaiting the opening of an eclipse viewing event complete with telescopes and educational presentations.\n\nFaoro, who lives near the park in this upscale Northern Virginia neighborhood, just wanted glasses to safely view the eclipse.\n\nShe visited CVS, Safeway and a 7/11 convenience store, all of which had advertised the availability of glasses to view the eclipse. None of the retailers had any glasses remaining when Faoro checked this morning.\n\n“We have this great big open space that’s a perfect spot,” said Faoro, who viewed her first eclipse in the 1970s. “We just need some glasses.”\n\n− Ken Alltucker\n\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway event draws tens of thousands\n\nTory Patrick, 41, is hoping to give her four children a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity. Patrick and her family traveled 160 miles to Indianapolis Motor Speedway from their home in Granger, Indiana. They were expected to have 97% totality at home, but it’s not the same as total coverage, she said.\n\n“They will be getting the full experience that they can’t read about in textbooks,” Patrick said.\n\nPatrick and her sister Cally Gannon, 39, from Cincinnati, met in Indianapolis to view the eclipse from the speedway. They camped outside IMS over the weekend ahead of the event and on Sunday afternoon saw a double rainbow over the speedway’s iconic pagoda. An estimated 50,000 tickets were sold for the day’s festivities, presented in partnership with NASA and Purdue University.\n\nElsewhere in the stands, Ryan Harper, 30, knows today is special.\n\n“We’re right in totality,” he said. “This sometimes doesn’t happen in people’s lifetimes.\n\n— Sarah Bowman and Jade Thomas\n\nFamily travels from Baltimore to Rochester, N.Y., to view the eclipse\n\nWhen Maze Pelham of Baltimore was a fifth-grader, he watched news of the 2017 solar eclipse and vowed to witness the next notable solar eclipse. That eclipse, and that day, has come. And this is why he and his parents, Janice and Sonney Pelham, left Maryland around 1 a.m. on Monday and drove nearly seven hours to Rochester, New York.\n\n“I said to myself I would go to the next one,” Maze Pelham said while seated with his parents on lawn chairs at downtown Rochester’s Parcel 5 park, where he and hundreds of others are awaiting a view of the full eclipse. “It’s a promise I made to myself.”\n\n– Democrat and Chronicle, part of the USA TODAY Network\n\nIn Brooklyn: Eclipses glasses, check. Lawn chair, check.\n\nRalph Emerson held a pair of paper sunglasses in his hands while riding the subway to Brooklyn's sprawling Prospect Park on Monday. He exited the train with a folded lawn chair strapped across his shoulder, and said he felt energized and full of anticipation.\n\n\"This is special,\" Emerson, 61, said. \"I haven't woken up with this much excitement since the Super Bowl.\"\n\nWalking to the park's botanic garden, Emerson said appreciating natural phenomena makes it easier to manage the stresses that come with living in a big city. Also like a big sports game, the eclipse will draw lots of people together to experience something much larger than themselves, in community, he said.\n\n\"A lot of times it's tragedies that bring us together, but sometimes things like this do,\" he said.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nTexas Eclipse Festival cut short by weather\n\nThe Texas Eclipse Festival was canceled Monday in Burnet County, 50 miles northwest of Austin, because of weather concerns. The festival, which included bands and other events, began Sunday and was supposed to wrap up Tuesday.\n\n\"We regret to inform you of the severe weather forecast, including risks of high winds, tornadic activity, large hail, and thunderstorms for later today, including during the eclipse, Tuesday, and Wednesday,\" festival organizers said on their website. \"Your safety is our top priority.\"\n\nFestivalgoers were urged to leave early for safety and to beat traffic. Guests, however, were allowed to stay \"provided they pack and are prepared to depart after totality.\"\n\nTraffic jams, collisions mar eclipse watchers' travel\n\nTraffic crashes and road delays were reported across the nation as Americans flocked to prime locations to gaze up at the rare solar eclipse. Local roads and highways in states including Texas, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Vermont and New Hampshire were overwhelmed with eclipse chasers, many of whom were from out of state. The most intense bottlenecks appeared to be in the path of totality, where spectators will be able to view the full eclipse.\n\nIn Oklahoma, a crash around 7:30 a.m. local time narrowed eastbound lanes on I-40, a major transcontinental highway that runs from California to North Carolina. The crash occurred not far from several state parks that were hosting eclipse events, and it's also within driving distance of the full eclipse path, which includes parts of southeastern Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nMultiple crashes were reported on an interstate in Waco, Texas, a city in the path of totality, where several festivities and eclipse viewing events were scheduled. The crashes all occurred on I-35, which runs from southern Texas to Minnesota.\n\n\"Expect major traffic delays in this area,\" the Texas Department of Transportation said in a statement.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nAirport draws a crowd of jets for eclipse\n\nEAGLE PASS, Texas − Maverick County International Airport in Eagle Pass, Texas, usually sees maybe three private planes a day. By 10 a.m. CT on Monday, more than 10 planes crowded the tarmac, including Cessnas, Pipers and at least one corporate jet − all there to catch an early glimpse of the total solar eclipse. Eagle Pass will be one of the first American cities to witness the phenomenon. Some watchers, like Brandon Beck, 43, flew in Sunday night from San Diego and spent the night in a sleeping bag on the tarmac next to his friend’s Mooney single-prop piston four-seater.“We’re so lucky to be on a planet where the sun is the perfect size and perfect distance to create that effect,” he said. “It’s obligatory. We have to see it.”\n\nFirst the Cherry Blossoms, then the eclipse\n\nWASHINGTON − The Cherry Blossoms brought Ali and Aurore Youssouf to the city all the way from Paris, but the pair were delighted to learn that their trip would overlap with the eclipse. The day is extra special for Aurore Youssouf, 43, who has never seen an eclipse before. On Monday morning, the couple arrived by chance at the National Mall early enough to snag a few pairs of free eclipse glasses distributed by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum for the occasion.“We didn’t even know. We just ended up here and found out that they were giving away some glasses,” said Ali Youssouf, 46.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nAwaiting eclipse − and hail − in Texas\n\nKERRVILLE, Texas − Forecasts called for considerable cloudiness, rain and possible hail, but retired NASA engineer Jeff Stone stayed positive as he and his wife prepared to host more than a dozen people for a watch party at their hilltop home in Texas Hill Country. Stone, an eclipse enthusiast who had met family in Missouri to watch the solar eclipse of 2017, said he recently reviewed video footage of that event and said current conditions weren’t that much different than they were back then.\n\n“I’m outside and seeing patches of blue among scattered clouds, so we’re remaining hopeful,” he said.\n\nAbout 150 miles to the northeast in Gatesville, lead pastor Eric Moffett of Coryell Community Church said a similar forecast did little to deter an expected gathering of about 800 visitors for the church’s family-oriented “Eclipse at the Crosses” event. Many, if not most, were from out of town or even out of country − Canada, Wales, France, Italy. Many locals were staying home to avoid the crowd, he said.\n\n“It’s partly cloudy, but the sun is shining on me right now,” he said. “We are praying that it stays that way.”\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nWhat is the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the moon comes in between the Earth and the sun, blocking its light from reaching our planet, leading to a period of darkness lasting several minutes. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon and the sun are on exact opposite sides of Earth. The Earth blocks the sunlight that normally reaches the moon. Instead of that sunlight hitting the moon’s surface, Earth's shadow falls on it.\n\nA lunar eclipse can last for a few hours, while a solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes. Solar eclipses also rarely occur, while lunar eclipses are comparatively more frequent. While at least two partial lunar eclipses happen every year, total lunar eclipses are still rare, NASA says. Another major difference: No special glasses or gizmos are needed to view the a lunar eclipse, and people can directly stare at the moon.\n\n− Saman Shafiq\n\nSolar eclipse, lunar eclipse:What is the difference?\n\nCan you drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nThe 2024 solar eclipse will shroud much of the United States in darkness on Monday, leaving many people to wonder: Is it safe to drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nIt is safe to drive during an eclipse as long as you don't look up at the sky. AAA is telling drivers to be focused on the road if they are operating a car during the total solar eclipse. But the automobile insurance company is advising Americans who want to safely view the total eclipse to \"find a safe place to park (not on the side of a road or highway) away from other traffic and then wear your eclipse glasses,\" said Aixa Diaz, a spokeswoman from AAA.\n\n\"Pack your patience, whether traveling a great distance or locally,\" Diaz said. \"People will be out and about to catch a glimpse of the eclipse.\"\n\nA similar scenario played out in 2017 during the nation's last total solar eclipse: Congestion in some areas lasted for up to 13 hours after totality, according to Transportation Research News, a National Research Council publication. An analysis of traffic patterns from that year suggests the worst of the traffic – on interstates and rural back roads alike – will kick off after the eclipse ends and everyone tries to leave all at once.\n\n− Kayla Jimenez\n\nWhen will the next solar eclipse happen?\n\nIt will be 20 years before there's a chance to witness a total solar eclipse in the United States again. According to NASA, after Monday's total solar eclipse, the next one viewable from the contiguous U.S. will be on Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nUnfortunately, the 2044 total solar eclipse won't have the broad reach across the U.S. as the 2024 eclipse. The path of totality during the 2044 eclipse will only touch three states, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. The eclipse will begin in Greenland, sweep through Canada and end around sunset in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nBut another eclipse scheduledfor Saturday, Aug. 12, 2045, will trace a path of totality over California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Georgia.\n\n− Mary Walrath-Holdridge, Gabe Hauari and Eric Lagatta\n\nEclipse and pets: It's not the sky that's the problem\n\nAn eclipse itself isn't dangerous for domestic animals such as dogs and cats, but experts say it's probably best to not bring pets to experience the April 2024 total solar eclipse. Experts' biggest concern is not what’s happening in the sky but on the ground as crowds of excited and eager people gather, said Dr. Rena Carlson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Dogs especially will take their cues from their owners rather than the celestial event.\n\n“Rather than the effects of the eclipse, I would be more worried about the excitement and all of the people,” Carlson said.\n\n− Elizabeth Weise\n\nA guide to the solar eclipse for kids\n\nHere's an easy-to read, illustrated guide to help kids understand what the April 8 total solar eclipse means, where it will be visible and how you can watch it safely. It also shows them how an ordinary kitchen colander can easily be used to view a solar eclipse − the colander's holes can project crescent images of the sun onto the ground. There are even pages that can be downloaded and colored.\n\nTrump's eclipse experience lit up internet in 2017\n\nSeven years ago, when the last total solar eclipse crossed over North America, a photo of then-President Donald Trump seemingly gazing at the sun with his naked eyes set the internet ablaze. During the afternoon of Aug. 21, 2017, Trump, who was president at the time, was joined by then first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron to watch the rare phenomenon from the Truman Balcony at the White House. Photos taken by members of the media captured all three donning eclipse glasses while looking at the eclipse.\n\nBut at one point during the viewing, the former president was captured in photos and videos without proper eye protection, seemingly gazing directly at the sun. Looking at an eclipse before or after the brief phase of totality without proper eyewear can lead to eye damage.\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse?What to know about the next eclipse's path, timing\n\nHow to make a solar eclipse viewer\n\nPeople who didn't manage to get their hands on glasses are not completely down and out. There are other safe ways to view the eclipse, say experts, and a lot of them only require a little bit of craftiness and items you can find lying around the house.\n\nSteps to make the cereal box eclipse viewer (And here is a video aid):\n\nGet an empty, clean cereal box.\n\nCut a white piece of cardboard that will fit snuggly in the bottom of the box, or secure it permanently by gluing it in place.\n\nCut the top of the cereal box, removing both ends and leaving the center intact.\n\nPut a piece of tape across the center of the top to securely hold it closed.\n\nTape a piece of heavy-duty foil or double a single layer for additional strength, covering one of the openings at the top of the cereal box. The other opening will remain open for viewing.\n\nUsing a small nail (approximately 3mm in diameter) push a hole in the foil.\n\nCover the entire box with construction paper, leaving the single-viewing opening and the foil uncovered.\n\nThe finished box should be held with the pin-hole side facing the sun. It may take a little practice pointing the box. With your back facing the sun, look through the viewing opening. A small image of the sun, about ½ cm in diameter, can be seen projected on the white paper inside the box.\n\n− Mary Walrath-Holdrid\n\nWhat is the path of the solar eclipse called?\n\nThose in the direct line of the eclipse will be treated to an incredible sight as the moon completely blots out the sun's disk, ushering in uncharacteristic darkness and revealing the sun's elusive outermost layer called the corona. That moment is called \"totality\" and this year the path of totality crosses through 13 U.S. states.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse to cut through North America was in August 2017.\n\nHow to look at eclipse without glasses\n\nA total solar eclipse offers skygazers the rare opportunity to witness the eclipse with the naked eye. However, solar eclipse glasses are still needed until totality is reached.\n\nCertified solar eclipse glasses are crucial for spectators to avoid the sun's retina-damaging rays. But when the moon moves completely in front of the sun and blocks its light, you'll know it's safe to remove the glasses for a short period of time.\n\nHow fast does an eclipse shadow travel?\n\nAccording to a post from the National Weather Service in Indianapolis on X, an eclipse shadow travels at speeds from 1,100 to 5,000 mph. Near the equator, it travels at around 1,100 mph and increases in speed as it approaches the poles.\n\nThe eclipse party is over? Time to recycle those glasses!\n\nAstronomers Without Borders, or AWB, a non-profit organization running its second nationwide eclipse glasses recycling drive. Her business will join over 300 schools, museums, city governments, commercial businesses, community organizations and local libraries that will collect and ship an estimated millions of glasses to be repurposed for use by underserved communities around the world in future solar eclipses.\n\nAWB launched its first run of the program after the last solar eclipse in 2017 when volunteer centers across the country collected millions of the glass. After vetting them for reuse, more than half a million glasses were distributed to Africa, Asia and South America.\n\nPeople can visit AWB's website to find their nearest participating collection center and learn more about recycling the glasses, said Andrew Fazekas, the organization's communication manager.\n\n\"We figure there's probably going to be tens of millions of glasses out there at the very least,\" he said. \"And most of them are probably very gently used.\"\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/03/28/get-free-solar-eclipse-glasses-for-april-8/73119322007/", "title": "How to get free solar eclipse glasses ahead of April 8", "text": "You can’t very well watch one of the most anticipated celestial phenomena of the year without a pair of proper eclipse glasses now, can you?\n\nIt's time to figure out where you might procure a pair of ISO-certified glasses, especially with the total solar eclipse just days away – but beware of companies that claim their products are approved by NASA.\n\nMillions of Americans are set to witness this once-in-a-lifetime event on April 8, with hundreds of cities and smaller towns in 13 states across the country catching “a glimpse of a spectacular sight not often seen,” Michael Zeiler, an eclipse cartographer, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nThe eclipse is predicted to chart along a 115-mile-wide path of totality, shrouding portions of Mexico, the United States and Canada in unnatural darkness and unveiling the sun's elusive outermost layer for a brief moment, USA TODAY reported.\n\nThat being said, there are a couple places you might be able to obtain a pair of solar eclipse glasses that are sure to keep your eyes safe.\n\nThe retailers included in this story are giving them out to members of the public, free of charge and while supplies last – though some require the purchase of a product to get the glasses.\n\nYou might also be able to find these glasses at your local public library or hardware store in your area.

Take a look.\n\nCheck back throughout the day for live updates from Austin and statewide:\n\n3:40 p.m. The eclipse has left the building\n\nThe eclipse ended in the Austin area around 3 p.m., but it will live in our hearts, fond memories and photos that you can purchase forever. If you did happen to glance at the sun and you're worried about eclipse blindness, you can check out the symptoms here. If you're wondering what to with your eclipse glasses, we have suggestions here.\n\nAmazingly, traffic in the Texas capital remains manageable. According to Google, a trip from Zilker Park to the departures gate at Austin Bergstrom is currently only 26 minutes. If you're on your way out of Austin, we hope you've enjoyed your stay. If you're a local, thanks for joining us on this celestial journey and we hope to connect again soon!\n\n2:08 p.m.: Early post-eclipse traffic snarls are not as bad as anticipated\n\nFor weeks, we've been preparing for a crush of visitors that would overwhelm Austin roads and turn I-35 into a parking lot. 30 minutes after totality, the roads are looking surprisingly clear. According to Google maps, a trip from the Texas State Capitol to the airport was only 18 minutes. That same trip from Zilker Park is 22 minutes. Travel from the Long Center's eclipse event to Pflugerville was 29 minutes and the same trip up to Cedar Park was 27 minutes.\n\n1:54 p.m. Students and adults at Reilly Elementary danced under the moon-darkened sky\n\nAs the day became dark at Reilly Elementary, children and adults alike ran around in glee, cheering the once-in-a-lifetime event.\n\nAs the sun again began poking out from behind the moon’s showdown, Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse of the Heart” rang out from a speaker as students broke into a dance party.\n\n1:47 p.m. Zilker Park erupted in cheers during a brief glance of the ring of fire\n\nPersistent cloud cover didn't deter a crowd of eclipse watchers at Zilker Park who camped on the great lawn and cheered each time the sun peeked out from behind the clouds (and the moon). As the city moved into totality there was a momentary appearance of the full ring as the moon passed over the sun. It was very brief but the full park saw it and erupted into cheers They cheered several times while the ring was visible, when it appeared absolutely darkest and then as orange hues started to illuminate the otherwise very gray sky at the end.\n\n1:35 p.m. Austin, we have hit.....TOTALITY!\n\nOh snap! It's dark. It's suddenly chilly. Stop reading this right now and look up at the sky! Take a deep breath. Listen for crickets. Think celestial thoughts. Experience the magic.

Addison Schuster turned 21 on the trip to Texas, and the family came to Austin because he had wanted to visit the city for years. They've done some shopping, sampled some Texas BBQ, and made a stop at Dirty Sixth one night.\n\nThey are hopeful the eclipse is visible in the next hour, but feel confident there will be noticeable effects no matter what.\n\n12:17 p.m. It's starting! There's sun (sort of)! Go look at the sky!\n\nIt's go time, Austin!

Here's more eclipse time information.\n\n11:52 a.m.: Eclipse watchers gather at the Long Center for the city's best skyline view\n\nTwelve thousand people registered to watch the spectacular solar eclipse from the Long Center, but only the first 5,000 will make it onto the Hartman Lawn. Thousands more will spill out along Ladybird Lake and bridges connecting the downtown area. The sun keeps peeking in and out of the light cloud cover as everyone hopes for a clear view of the moon overtaking the sun.\n\n“We keep saying it’s like dramatic effect,” says Cory Baker, the CEO of the Long Center. “I’m hoping it’s gonna burn off and we’re going to have clear skies.”\n\nTote bags, glasses, pens and journals are given to everyone who enters, not a blade of grass is expected to be seen with wall-to-wall onlookers hoping to catch the natural event.\n\n“(Eclipses) happen every 18 months so it’s not that they’re rare on the planet,” says Ivvet Modinou, the Senior Vice President for Science Society and Culture for the Simons Foundation, “but for it to intersect with the place you call home is very rare.”\n\nLibby Amos, 6, and Emma, 4, posed with their friend Lydia Witherspoon in the frame picture spot overlooking the city.\n\n“It’s very, very, super duper cool,” says Libby who came with her Louisiana family.\n\n“I used to teach eighth grade earth and space science and it was so fun to teach to my students and it’s just so cool to share with my kids now,” says Libby and Emma’s mom Madeline Brown.\n\nThe doors opened at 11 a.m. with the Mother Nature spectacular expected at 1:35 p.m.\n\n11:17 a.m.: An estimated 40% of camp sites at Pace Bend Park in Spicewood are unoccupied\n\nOut at Pace Bend Park in Spicewood, there are clouds and campers and also several unoccupied camping sites. Every site that's unoccupied has a Reserved tag on it. It was the same story on Sunday. Where are the campers? Where are the eclipsers?\n\nThe primitive corner of Pace Bend's campground is between half- and three-fourths filled. Perhaps it is the threat of clouds, and possibly even rain, during today's eclipse that's keeping the campers away: Pace Bend's sites are all reserved, a camp employee said, but she estimated that 40% of the reserved sites are currently unoccupied.\n\n\"Let's manifest sunlight,\" said one camper earlier this morning.\n\n11:09 a.m.: Texas Eclipse Festival in Burnet canceled due to potential severe weather\n\nThe Texas Eclipse Festival in Burnet is ending a day early on Monday due to possible severe weather, including risks of tornadic activity, thunderstorms and large hail, the festival said in online posts.\n\nFestival organizers urged attendees to leave early for safety and to beat traffic. Organizers agreed to end the festival in coordination with Burnet County officials, local safety agencies and the National Weather Service, according to the festival’s website.\n\nAll programming and performances for Monday and Tuesday are canceled.

This time, the moon will reach its closest point to Earth in April the day before the eclipse, meaning the totality of the eclipse, or the period when the moon fully covers up the sun, will last longer.\n\n\"The eclipse takes a while for the moon to slide onto the sun, cover it and then slide off. It's usually 2.5 to three hours for the whole eclipse to happen,\" said Shauna Edson, an astronomy educator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.\n\nThe phenomenon won't happen again until 2044, according to NASA.\n\nThe totality part of the eclipse will pass over part of northern Mexico before crossing into the U.S. Its path will stretch across Texas and traverse parts of the Midwest and East Coast before touching southeastern Canada and heading out to sea, according to a map from NASA. Dallas, Indianapolis, Little Rock, Arkansas, Cleveland, and Buffalo, New York, are all directly in the line of darkness.\n\nAround 44 million people living in the 115-mile-wide path will experience the total darkness.\n\n\"We're really lucky here on earth that our moon is approximately 400 times smaller than our sun, but it's also approximately 400 times closer,\" said Edson. \"So when they perfectly line up, the moon will cover the bright part of the sun.\"\n\nThe rest of the U.S. will experience a partial eclipse – the farther away from the path of totality, the more of the sun will be visible as the moon passes across it.\n\nMore:Your guide to full moons for 2024: Supermoons, solstices, equinoxes and more\n\nHow to view the eclipse safely\n\nMany people have heard the warnings against looking directly at an eclipse. Astronomers advise viewers to always look through a pair of specially designed glasses.\n\n\"They block out 99.99% of the sun's light, and the sun will be the only thing you can see through them,\" Edson said.\n\nAmateur astronomers should also remember not to look through a regular telescope without a special filter, Edson said. \"If anybody is using a solar telescope, you just want to make sure it's somebody who knows what they're doing,\" Edson said.\n\nFor those in the path of totality, however, it's safe to look at the phenomenon without special glasses for just the nearly four and a half minutes when the moon fully covers the sun's light.\n\n\"At that point, the bright part of the sun is completely covered,\" Edson said. \"The dangerous part of the sun is blocked and you can look right at it with your eyes.\"\n\nIn those few moments, observers might be able to see the edges of the sun's atmosphere, Edson said. \"You could maybe see a couple of loops of gas near the edges,\" she added.\n\nMore:Monthly skywatcher's guide to 2024: Eclipses, full moons, comets and meteor showers\n\nEclipse enthusiasts make big plans\n\nEclipse viewers across the country are gearing up for the big day with a wide variety of events planned to celebrate the four-and-a-half-minute show.\n\nThe Air and Space Museum will partner with other Smithsonian Museums to bring a Solar Eclipse Festival to the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on April 8 at noon local time. \"There will be solar telescopes,\" Edson said, along with \"lots of different ways to view the sun and the eclipse safely.\"\n\nOther activities will encourage visitors to \"explore the relationship between the earth, sun and moon\" through scales and models of the astronomical bodies, Edson said.\n\nAstronomers and stargazers in the path of the totality already have plans in the works to make the most of the rare event.\n\nBryan Tobias, manager of the Curtis Vaughan Jr. Observatory at the University of Texas at San Antonio, said he plans to take a group of student observers to look for the perfect place to catch the totality of the eclipse.\n\nThe festivities at the university will begin the night before, with the \"pre-eclipse\" parties, one of which was booked nearly a year before. \"We're actually doing a stargazing event at a neighborhood who was smart enough to contact us almost a year in advance, and we're going to be doing some stargazing for them the night before,\" provided the skies are clear, Tobias said.\n\nThe city of Carbondale, Illinois, home of Southern Illinois University, is lucky enough to be in the path of totality for the second time in a row after the solar eclipse of 2017. The university will bring back its Southern Illinois Crossroads Eclipse Festival, featuring music, a 5k run, and an arts and crafts fair.\n\nSome music lovers in Texas will get a double feature of festivals on April 8. Ground Zero music fest, which lasts five nights from April 5-9, lies directly in the path of the totality in Bandera, Texas, around 50 miles northwest of San Antonio.\n\nThe Texas Eclipse Festival, located in rural Reveille Peak Ranch by Buchanan Lake on the Colorado River, has a star-studded lineup of musicians, DJs, and speakers planned over four days. According to the festival's website, 13 organizers from around the world will pitch in to transform the campgrounds into \"Global Eclipse Village.\"\n\nSome plan to take to the air to get a closer view of the effect.

The resulting \"totality,\" when observers can see the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere, known as the corona, confuses animals – nocturnal creatures stir and bird and insects fall silent.\n\nThe day before the eclipse, the moon will come closest to Earth this month. On eclipse day, that means the moon is only 223,000 miles away. That proximity will make the moon appear larger in the sky, resulting in an exceptionally extended duration of sun-blocked darkness.

Alejandra Martinez, a seventh-grade science teacher from this city in south Texas, peered up at the gauzy gray sky.\n\nShe was sitting at the corner of the county airport just outside Eagle Pass, just a couple of miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. Beside her stood a special telescope for a citizen-driven NASA science project to capture views of the sun during the eclipse – if they could see it.\n\n“We’re going to stay positive,” Martinez said, turning to the team gathered around the scope. “The sun will come out, eventually.”\n\nIn just a few moments, the orb of the moon was set to cross the face of the sun – the rare phenomenon that has captivated human observers since the dawn of time: a total solar eclipse.\n\nThat celestial alignment would be both precisely predictable and undeniably mysterious.\n\nOver the course of several hours, millions of people would fall beneath the moon’s shadow as it swept across the continent at some 1,500 mph. At the center of that path, however briefly, the midday sun would vanish entirely – the period of an eclipse known as “totality.”\n\nThe arc of the event was plotted by astronomers years in advance. It would begin over the blue depths of the tropical Pacific and end on the gray swells of the North Atlantic. The longest moments of totality would arrive in western Mexico.\n\nFar more of the route, though, stretched from the flats of the Rio Grande Valley to the woods of northern Maine. Gauged by shared experience, this solar eclipse would be almost singularly American.\n\nAnd that American eclipse would begin right here, for a small crowd at a small airport in a small town in south Texas, at 10 minutes past noon local time. If only the clouds would part.\n\nThen, as if guided by some cosmic schedule, they did.\n\nMartinez – dressed in a T-shirt that proclaimed “This Totality Rocks” – donned her dark eclipse glasses and peered upward. The haze in Eagle Pass had cleared and now, degree by imperceptible degree, the disc of the sun began to shift to a crescent.\n\n“There it is! There it is!” she yelled. “First contact. It’s begun!”\n\nGraphics:How the solar eclipse crossed the US\n\nChasing mysteries of science\n\nAt age 41, Martinez already has pursued research around the world. She has been aboard a deep-sea drilling ship in the Indian Ocean as it tried to poke into the earth’s mantle. She studied climate change’s impact on plants in the Arctic. She photographed the night sky aboard a ship in the Atlantic with the man who found the wreckage of the Titanic.\n\nBut few of those things compared to the hushed darkness that fell across Maverick County International Airport.\n\nLast year, when Martinez heard NASA was looking for volunteers to help with the effort known as Citizen CATE 2024 (the Continental-America Telescope Eclipse), she jumped at the chance. Her team was one of more than 30 recruited by NASA to capture and record the eclipse.\n\nShe had been eagerly awaiting the eclipse that would pass directly over her hometown. Eagle Pass, the backdrop for months of a standoff between state and federal officials over the treatment of asylum seekers, could use the positive headlines, she said.\n\n“We’ve been in the news for so much bad stuff lately,” Martinez said. “It’s super cool I get to share this with my students and get them excited about science.”\n\nShe and other scientists practiced for months leading up to the event, learning how to focus the three-foot refractor telescope and bracing for challenges, such as a malfunctioning lens, or cumulus clouds blocking their view.\n\nAs word spread that the airport was near the middle of the path of totality, other people began to plan their own arrivals.\n\nThey came from across the U.S. and as far away as Canada, Germany and Norway. Some chartered buses or drove rental cars halfway across the country. Others flew in on small planes, camping overnight on the airport’s tarmac.\n\nBrandon Beck, 43, arrived from San Diego aboard his friend’s single-prop four-seater.\n\n“We’re so lucky to be on a planet where the sun is the perfect size and perfect distance to create that effect,” he said. “It’s obligatory. We have to see it.” He spent the night in a sleeping bag next to the plane – built by the aircraft manufacturer Mooney.\n\nMatt Lucas, 59, drove a rented car from San Diego to the Eagle Pass airport, hoping to replicate the solar eclipse experience he had in Cabo San Lucas in 1991. Eclipses, he said, remind us of our place in a larger world.\n\n“In the scale of the universe, we’re here for milliseconds,” said Lucas, wearing a “United Federation of Planets” T-shirt, a nod to the Star Trek television series. “There’s more that binds us together than divides us.”\n\nAs the partial eclipse grew darker, Martinez pointed the telescope with a solar filter toward the sky.\n\n“Amazing,” she said. “We’re all going to have this in common for the rest of our lives.”\n\nAbout 1:27 p.m., the sky shifted from gray to brown. Then darkness draped the airport grounds. The sun was blotted out by the moon.\n\nMartinez peered up through paper glasses, a hand over her heart. Tears welled in her eyes.\n\nLife's moments of joy:Babies born and couples tie the knot during total eclipse of 2024\n\nInto the path of totality\n\nAs the two orbs – one light, one shadow – passed each other in time and space, the shapes and colors shifted along the path below.\n\nEyes turned upward both inside and outside the path of totality, from ranches in the Texas hill country and blankets spread out in Washington on the National Mall.\n\nDozens of students spilled out of Ida B. Wells Middle School in Washington, D.C., gripping cardboard solar eclipse glasses and chatting with excitement. “Why is the sun shaped as a moon?” one student asked after looking toward the sun. “Why is it not getting dark?’’ asked another.\n\nTeacher Troy Mangum, who the students called “Mr. Mango,’’ slowly explained the science behind the experience as he cautioned others to put on their glasses. Steps away at Whittier Elementary School, younger students put on their glasses and tilted their heads up toward the sun behind their school.\n\nOff the coast of Mazatlan, Mexico, chartered ships of various sizes carried eclipse-chasers along the seas. Whereas landlocked observers could only travel where roads would take them, ship captains faced no such constraints.\n\nPassengers aboard Holland America's Koningsdam cruise gathered on the top decks at 10 a.m. local time. The crew, guided by an astronomer onboard, was set to adjust the ship's position meticulously to ensure the best possible view.\n\nMexico had become the go-to spot for the eclipse’s most dedicated chasers, some of whom have witnessed dozens of events around the globe. Each moment of totality was a notch in a lifetime scorecard, another moment in that otherworldly shadow that provokes strong reactions among so many who see it.\n\n“I've seen people cry,” said Paul Maley, a few weeks before the moment – at 76 years old and 30 total eclipses viewed, he is one of America’s most accomplished umbraphiles. “I’ve seen them scream. I’ve seen them run around and just make wild exclamations.” Maley organized two trips to Mexico so more viewers could do the same.\n\nThroughout history, those strange reactions have built both myths and memories among humanity. Various cultures imagined the sun was being devoured by a celestial animal, or that the darkness was an omen of doom. But not always. Historians say one recorded eclipse prompted an end to combat during an ancient Greek war. Some aboriginal cultures saw the eclipse as an amorous encounter between the sun and the moon.\n\nModern times brought modern scenes. Outside Little Rock and Cincinnati, couples gathered Monday to marry in mass ceremonies as the eclipse turned wedding day to wedding night.\n\nIn Indianapolis, crowds filled the famous motor speedway for a viewing event, and the freeways outside as well. State police warned that interstate rest stops were at or near capacity, and would be shut down once full, for the duration of the eclipse.\n\nIn Carbondale, Illinois, officials at Southern Illinois University were joined by teams from NASA and Chicago's Adler Planetarium for an event that would host thousands. NASA would send up a pair of balloons to study the sun’s corona. Below, on the field of the university’s Saluki Stadium, a dance troupe performed between end zones painted deep maroon. The music: The 5th Dimension’s “Let the Sunshine In.”\n\nIn Evansville, Indiana, Amber and Cody Stallings had driven all the way from Atlanta with their infant daughter, Sadie. Amber said she had seen the 2017 eclipse, but nothing compared to what they saw on the banks of the Ohio River.\n\n“It’s breathtaking and moving,” she said. “It brought tears to my eyes.”\n\nSadie was strapped in a stroller as her parents shielded her eyes from the spectacle. She won’t remember it, they said, but at least she can say she was here.\n\nThe young family had already prepared themselves for the 400-mile drive home. Were they worried about the traffic? “Come on,” Amber scoffed. “We’re from Atlanta.”\n\nJust after 3 p.m. local time, the total eclipse crossed a hayfield about 10 miles north of the small town of Spencer, Indiana, where dozens camped overnight near a tiny fishing lake ringed by hills.\n\nSome had driven from Wisconsin, Michigan or Minnesota, looking to be near the center of the path and away from big cities. Still more arrived after changing plans, swapping out destinations in cloudy Texas for what turned out to be largely clear blue skies in Indiana.\n\nThey set up cameras and telescopes in the shade of lifted tailgates. They waited in folding chairs. Fishermen, retirees and college students from nearby Bloomington made fast friends, sharing special binoculars and passing out popsicles.\n\nAs the sun became a crescent, the temperatures dropped from more than 80 degrees to just over 70. An American flag that had been fluttering across the rural road hung limp as the wind died down. “Thirty seconds!” someone yelled.\n\nAmong the redbuds and silver maples that fringed the hillsides, the light turned the color of ash. Circling turkey vultures took to the trees. Crickets and frogs began to chirp.\n\nPeople whooped, gasped and yelled as they took off their eclipse glasses to see a black sun ringed with gold. Along the hills around the lake, the sky turned the orange-yellow of sunset in every direction at the same time.\n\n“Oh my God. Oh my God. This is so cool,” said Tim Watson, 60, a retired IT worker who drove from Madison, Wisconsin, with his brother, Chris, 64, for their first total eclipse.\n\nWhen the sun came back out nearly four minutes later, another gasp went up.\n\nA moment of complexity\n\nA wired world that could place the word “totality” into the collective vocabulary could just as easily track its darker reverberations.\n\nHotel rooms and vacation rentals along the path were sold out or listed at astronomical prices – good news perhaps for owners, challenges for travelers. Cities and counties declared states of emergency as they braced for floods of visitors, and for weather conditions that might or might not harmonize.\n\nThe Texas Eclipse Festival in Burnet County, 50 miles northwest of Austin, included bands and other events to begin Sunday and wrap up Tuesday. Instead, it was canceled Monday over weather concerns including high winds, tornadic activity, large hail and thunderstorms. “Your safety is our top priority,” festival organizers said on their website.\n\nIn Oklahoma, a crash around 7:30 a.m. local time squeezed eastbound lanes on I-40, the major transcontinental highway, not far from several state parks that were hosting eclipse events. Multiple crashes were reported along I-35 around Waco, Texas, too, in the path of totality.\n\nAcross the country, last-minute watchers scrambled to drug-store counters in hopes of finding a pair of protective eclipse glasses, and the American Academy of Ophthalmology issued warnings about the signs of retina damage in those who viewed without precautions.\n\nAnd even as the shadow could create a shared experience in fractious times, it could not blunt the many struggles of a nation.\n\nIn Las Vegas (where the shadow reached 51% of totality), a gunman in a high rise shot two people to death before taking his own life. In Kansas City (89% shadow), a collegiate athletics body grappled with the politics of who, exactly, may play men’s and women’s sports. In the nation’s capital (87%), lawmakers wrestled with the patchwork of rules for social media, struggling with the privacy rights of Americans in an online world where their eclipse photos and divisive disinformation live side-by-side.\n\nDespite such national shadows, for many on Monday, American divides could not cleave one common, powerful experience.\n\nThe end of the path\n\nIn Maine, in the eclipse’s last moments in the U.S., Fred Grant watched the moon’s shadow darken his hometown of Houlton.\n\nIn the historic logging town near the Canadian border, 6,000 residents had braced for cloudy weather. Instead, they awoke Monday to the thrill of flawless blue skies.\n\nGrant, who owns a local radio station, a pizza place and a movie theater, had been helping plan for this eclipse since 2017, when he watched the last total eclipse in the U.S. on his computer and discovered the next one would pass right through Houlton.\n\n“You’ve got to be kidding,” he recalled thinking.\n\nOn Monday, visitors came from as far away as Hawaii and Europe. The town’s hotels were booked, and some visitors parked RVs at a decommissioned Air Force base. The town square filled with music and food trucks. NASA officials set up to broadcast live from Houlton during a three-hour video stream of the eclipse across the country.\n\nGrant said that watching it from the square, surrounded by family and feeling blessed by rare good weather, made the experience as powerful as he could have imagined.\n\n“I had pictured this moment for a long time, and I didn’t really know how I’d feel,” he said. “It was very emotional. I really got choked up. It was overwhelming.”\n\nFor a moment, far outside any human control, two celestial lines had intersected. All the experiences beneath them had been part of a shared path.\n\nThen the two orbs in the sky parted ways, each again tracing its own separate arc through space. The darkness ended, leaving each person below to contemplate what remained in the light.\n\nContributing: Josh Rivera, Deborah Berry and Chris Cann of USA TODAY; Dave Eminian of the Peoria Journal Star, Jon Webb of the (Evansville) Courier & Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2023/10/11/find-solar-eclipse-glasses/71140189007/", "title": "Where to get solar eclipse glasses to watch 'ring of fire' Saturday", "text": "The upcoming annular solar eclipse may be described as a \"ring of fire\" for the circular halo that will appear, but the moniker is apt for another unintended reason.\n\nIf spectators don't wear proper eyewear to watch as the moon passes in front of the sun to create the dazzling effect, the powerful rays could quite literally burn their eyes and damage their retinas. Come Saturday, potentially millions of people across the United States will be drawn to look to the skies to glimpse the rare annular solar eclipse, which astronomers warn will be the last opportunity to see the phenomenon until 2039.\n\nBut gazing at the sun with the naked eye is never wise. That's why astronomers also caution that celestial enthusiasts be prepared with the proper eyewear to view the ring of fire as NASA said it will travel in the U.S. from the coast of Oregon to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nHow to safely watch the solar eclipse:Rare 'ring of fire' has the potential to damage your eyes if you don't take precautions\n\nWhere to find solar eclipse glasses\n\nAccording to NASA, the only safe way to watch an eclipse is through a pair of approved solar eclipse glasses or a handheld solar viewer.\n\nFortunately for stargazers, solar eclipse glasses are readily available for purchase and even for free ahead of the ring of fire, which should be viewable in some form in all lower 48 states.\n\nBut don't confuse the specialized eyewear with your run-of-the-mill sunglasses: certified solar eclipse glasses are held to an international safety standard and are 100,000 times darker to block nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light.\n\nFree solar eclipse glasses available at libraries nationwide\n\nIn Buffalo, New York, for instance, Erie County officials provided funding to hand out hundreds of thousands of the eyewear at its local libraries, according to the Buffalo Museum of Science.\n\nMany libraries around the country, in fact, will be giving away free pairs of approved eclipse glasses through Saturday. The Space Science Institute distributed 5 million solar-viewing glasses to 10,000 libraries and maintains a map of participating libraries on its website.\n\nGet solar eclipse glasses through American Paper Optics\n\nResidents in Memphis, Tennessee have several options available to acquire solar eclipse glasses, according to the Commercial Appeal, a USA TODAY Network publication. In addition to the city's libraries giving away the eye protection, a popup shop will also be open every day through Saturday where glasses produced by American Paper Optics costing up to $20 are for sale.\n\nAmerican Paper Optics, the nation's largest supplier of eclipse glasses, also offers express shipping across the country.\n\nPlenty of other online sellers have eclipse glasses for sale that are compliant with ISO 12312-2, a long number that simply specifies the properties that a solar viewer should have in order to protect eyes from injury.\n\nFind solar eclipse glasses through approved vendor\n\nFor more manufacturers and retailers who sell certified glasses, the American Astronomical Society maintains a curated list of approved vendors.\n\nOf course, Prime Day may be over, but consumers can also turn to Amazon for their eclipse-watching needs. The online retailer has a variety of certified solar eclipse glasses, many of which can be bought in bulk (including a 50-pack for $49.99.)\n\nBut be wary of counterfeit or unsafe eclipse glasses when shopping Amazon. If the seller's name is not one of the verified suppliers on the American Astronomical Society's list, look elsewhere.\n\nWill 2024 solar eclipse be better?Real showstopper comes in April when large portions of the country see an even more impressive total eclipse\n\nWhy solar eclipse glasses are necessary protection\n\nAt least some of the sun’s powerful light will be visible Saturday even in places without a view of the spectacular partial solar eclipse.\n\nDirectly staring at the sun at any time can cause blindness or disrupted vision, but the concentrated solar rays of the partial eclipse are especially acute. Looking at it through a camera lens, telescope or binoculars is also dangerous, as the rays can burn through even those filters, according to NASA.\n\nAn annular eclipse is different from the nighttime darkness of a total eclipse in which the Moon completely blocks the face of the Sun from Earth's view, the next of which is expected to occur in April.\n\nRather, an annular solar eclipse occurs when the moon is at the farthest point of its orbit from Earth and passes in front of the sun. Because it is incapable of completely blocking the sun, the moon instead appears as a smaller dark disc in front of the larger and brighter star, creating what looks like a ring of fire.\n\nWeather permitting, the eclipse will first become visible in Oregon around 9:13 a.m. PDT and end in Texas around 12:03 p.m. CDT, according to NASA. It will then move beyond the U.S. and over Mexico, Central America and finally South America before ending around sunset off of Natal, Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Until the moon completely blocks the sun's disc on the path of totality and ushers in darkness, the sun's rays will pose a danger to unprotected retinas gazing skyward.\n\nAt this point, proper eyewear may be hard to come by and some may be tempted to turn to alternative methods such as welding goggles. But if you know where to look, you may just luck out and find a vendor or even a local library with some still in stock.\n\nHere's what to know about where to find last-minute solar eclipse glasses.\n\nAmerican Paper Optics, Warby Parker, among those offering glasses\n\nCompared to regular sunglasses, proper eclipse glasses are 100,000 times darker to block nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light and protect our sensitive retinas when looking upward near the sun.\n\nThat's why experts widely recommend them for those who will be watching as the upcoming solar eclipse charts a 115-mile-wide path of totality across North America.\n\nReputable vendors can be found on any eclipse websites like NationalEclipse.com, which sells a variety of eyewear products, along with plenty of other gadgets one may need to see the eclipse. Additionally, American Paper Optics, the nation's largest supplier of eclipse glasses, offers express shipping and includes a a countdown at the top of its website to let you know the deadline to make a purchase to get your glasses in time for the big day.\n\nWarby Parker, which actually plans to give out free solar eclipse glasses beginning Monday, may also be a good place to check.\n\nHere are some other companies offering specials and deals timed for the big deal, including offers on eclipse glasses.\n\nFinally, you may want to check your local library or other public institutions in your area, as many of these places have been offering free eclipse glasses to residents. Just don't count on supplies still being available.\n\nFind a store near you:How to get your Warby Parker eclipse glasses\n\nHow to make sure your solar eclipse glasses aren't fakes\n\nThe responsibility of guiding American consumers to the safest eclipse glasses is largely left to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nThe organization maintains a curated list of approved vendors of solar eclipse glasses and its been updated to give priority to North American manufacturers for the upcoming astral event. Products you purchase that are listed on that site are guaranteed to be in compliance with the highest international safety standards.\n\nThose standards are set by the International Organization for Standardization, which only vouches for solar eclipse glasses that are dark and strong enough to filter out a certain amount of the sun's harmful light.\n\nOf course, plenty of fakes and cheap imitators are proliferating the online marketplace in the leadup to the eclipse.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to avoid any vendors making the grand (and entirely made-up) claim that their products are endorsed by NASA. As the space agency reiterated to USA TODAY, it only advises that people get a pair of glasses, but does not recommend or certify any particular product.\n\nThe astronomical society also provides some helpful tips for other useful ways to spot scams and counterfeit glasses.\n\nSolar eclipse forecast:Looking cloudy for some in path of totality\n\nWhat else to know about the April 8 total solar eclipse\n\nA total solar eclipse offers the unique opportunity for skygazers to witness the spectacular astral display with the naked eye – but only when the time is right.\n\nEclipse glasses are still very much needed for most of the show, so make sure to come prepared, according to NASA.\n\nBut when the moon moves completely in front of the sun and blocks its light, you'll know it's safe to fully take in the dazzling display. That moment is what is called \"totality,\" whereby uncharacteristic darkness falls and all but the sun's outermost layer known as its corona makes a rare appearance to us here on Earth.\n\nHundreds of cities in 13 states are on the path of totality for this year's total solar eclipse, which will pass from southwest to northeast across North America. You won't want to miss it, as this is the last such eclipse in North American until 2044.\n\nAnd as you make your eclipse-viewing plans, these interactive maps should help you chart the time and duration for when totality would occur in cities along the path.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nAn April solar eclipse will bring a fantastic sky spectacle over the homes of tens of millions of Americans — but time is running out to make plans to join them.\n\nTravelers will want to find an area with clear weather within the 115-mile-wide path of totality, \"Standing anywhere else is useless, you have to be in that zone,\" said eclipse chaser David Makepeace, also known as the Eclipse Guy. \"That's what makes it special.\"\n\nThe eclipse's path will cross 13 states from Texas to Maine, and experts say the southern end of the path has the best chances for good viewing. Texas' typically sunny weather, major cities ready for tourists and location under the path all combine to make it an easy recommendation for people willing to travel.\n\nBut not everyone will want to travel to Texas. And there's other factors to consider when picking a viewing spot, including traffic, which some experts warn could rival or surpass that of the 2017 solar eclipse.\n\n\"It will likely be the most-viewed astronomical event in American history,\" eclipse chaser Michael Zeiler, who runs the Great American Eclipse website, said. While 31 million people live in the path of totality, millions more are expected to flock to the narrow band of land that will be temporarily be plunged into darkness on the afternoon of April 8.\n\nTravel agencies across the country continue to be busy booking weddings, honeymoons, \"buddymoons,\" and other eclipse-focused events as the big day approaches. Accommodations were still available at several major cities in the eclipse path as of Friday, including in Dallas, Indianapolis and Cleveland. A sampling of small towns in the path also had space available.\n\nWhat's the big deal?Why the April 2024 total solar eclipse is so interesting.\n\nBut don't worry, there's still time to decide where to go to get the best view, and USA TODAY has some ideas for you.\n\nWhy is this eclipse so noteworthy?\n\nTotal solar eclipses are very rare events to begin with, as they only occur every 18 months around the world, Dave Clark, operator of National Eclipse.com, said. Many of them occur over the ocean or very remote parts of the world.\n\nAnd the one in April will come right through three countries in North America: Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. \"This is a very rare, tremendous opportunity ... a once-in-a-lifetime event for most people,\" Makepeace said.\n\nIn the U.S. alone, hundreds of cities and smaller towns in 13 states lie along the path. Others will see a partial eclipse.\n\nAnd compared to the total eclipse in 2017, this one is longer in duration, has a wider path of totality, and occurs over or close to many major cities, according to Space.com.\n\nAmong solar eclipses, experts say a total solar eclipse stands out, and is far more impressive than the annular \"ring of fire\" eclipse the U.S. witnessed in October.\n\nUSA TODAY 10Best:10 solar eclipse fun facts to share with your friends\n\nThis will also be our last chance to see one for a while: In North America, the next total solar eclipse won't be until 2044, according to NASA.\n\nThe best eclipse viewing is expected to be in Texas\n\nWeather remains the biggest wildcard when it comes to seeing eclipses. With this eclipse, the general thinking is that the farther south you are the better, due to decreased cloud chances. That means Texas is a natural destination for many eclipse chasers.\n\nSpecifically, Zeiler says the Hill Country of Texas – which includes San Antonio – \"has the best weather prospects in the U.S.\" for eclipse viewing. Also, the eclipse will last longer in Texas than in any other state in the U.S., according to the National Eclipse website.\n\nBut anything is possible weatherwise on eclipse day itself: It could be cloudy in Texas and clear in Maine, Clark said.\n\nAnd if you are socked in with clouds, prepare to be disappointed. The skies will darken quite a bit, but that's about all you will see. \"For those few moments, it will feel dark and stormy,\" Makepeace said.\n\nApril's eclipse can be viewed from cities, towns or rural areas\n\nEclipse experts emphasize that where you go is really a personal preference, if you want to experience it in a city, small town or a rural area.\n\nOne upside to seeing it in a rural area is that there won't be tall buildings around to obstruct the view, Makepeace said.\n\nA downside to small towns and rural areas is the onslaught of traffic that could overwhelm their road infrastructure. Lorain County, in Northeast Ohio west of Cleveland, for example, is telling its residents to have three days worth of food, fuel and water on hand, due to the traffic that's expected.\n\nAstrophysicist Antonella Fruscione, who lives in the Boston area, will be traveling all the way to San Antonio with 18 family and friends – some from as far away as Europe – to see the total eclipse. \"It's very close to the center of totality and the high probability of no clouds in April,\" Fruscione said.\n\nWhat's important besides weather?\n\nZeiler, a veteran of 11 total solar eclipses on six continents around the world, says to look at two factors in addition to weather: mobility and accessibility.\n\n\"There's no single 'best' place, it depends on a couple of factors,\" Zeiler told USA TODAY.\n\nMap:Clouds would ruin the April 2024 total eclipse. This map shows how likely that is by city.\n\nBy mobility, he means ease of travel both before and especially after the eclipse. Before the eclipse, if you're in a car, \"have a road network available where you can evade clouds,\" he said. And after the eclipse, traffic jams will be a real problem, so having multiple routes away from the eclipse will be crucial.\n\nBy accessibility, he's referring to available accommodations. He said cities like Dallas would be a good choice due to the plentiful places for tourists to stay.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/08/solar-vs-lunar-eclipses-types-explained/73241427007/", "title": "Solar vs. lunar eclipse: The different types of eclipses, explained", "text": "It almost time! Millions of Americans across the country Monday are preparing to witness the once-in-a-lifetime total solar eclipse as it passes over portions of Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\nIt's a sight to behold and people have now long been eagerly awaiting what will be their only chance until 2044 to witness totality, whereby the moon will completely block the sun's disc, ushering in uncharacteristic darkness.\n\nThat being said, many are curious on what makes the solar eclipse special and how is it different from a lunar eclipse.\n\nThe total solar eclipse is today:Get the latest forecast and everything you need to know\n\nWhat is an eclipse?\n\nAn eclipse occurs when any celestial object like a moon or a planet passes between two other bodies, obscuring the view of objects like the sun, according to NASA.\n\nWhat is a solar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the moon comes in between the Earth and the sun, blocking its light from reaching our planet, leading to a period of darkness lasting several minutes. The resulting \"totality,\" whereby observers can see the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere, known as the corona, presents a spectacular sight for viewers and confuses animals – causing nocturnal creatures to stir and bird and insects to fall silent.\n\nPartial eclipses, when some part of the sun remains visible, are the most common, making total eclipses a rare sight.\n\nWhat is a lunar eclipse?\n\nA total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon and the sun are on exact opposite sides of Earth. When this happens, Earth blocks the sunlight that normally reaches the moon. Instead of that sunlight hitting the moon’s surface, Earth's shadow falls on it.\n\nLunar eclipses are often also referred to the \"blood moon\" because when the Earth's shadow covers the moon, it often produces a red color. The coloration happens because a bit of reddish sunlight still reaches the moon's surface, even though it's in Earth's shadow.\n\nDifference between lunar eclipse and solar eclipse\n\nThe major difference between the two eclipses is in the positioning of the sun, the moon and the Earth and the longevity of the phenomenon, according to NASA.\n\nA lunar eclipse can last for a few hours, while a solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes. Solar eclipses also rarely occur, while lunar eclipses are comparatively more frequent. While at least two partial lunar eclipses happen every year, total lunar eclipses are still rare, says NASA.\n\nAnother major difference between the two is that for lunar eclipses, no special glasses or gizmos are needed to view the spectacle and one can directly stare at the moon. However, for solar eclipses, it is pertinent to wear proper viewing glasses and take the necessary safety precautions because the powerful rays of the sun can burn and damage your retinas.\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}]}

As of Friday around noon, a bar of that size sells for a little over $1.3 million, with 1 oz valued at over $2,500.\n\nThe record highs reported this week reflect a price that has skyrocketed in recent years and even within months.

How this gold rush impacts the market\n\nWhat is the price of gold?\n\nThe price for spot gold currently stands at $2,515.83 as of early Friday afternoon.\n\nThe units of measurement generally used in this valuation are Troy ounces, a unit of measure for precious metals that is heavier than a regular ounce, according to the American Precious Metals Exchange (APMEX). One Troy ounce equals 1.097 \"normal\" ounces or 31.10 grams.\n\nThe unit of measurement was first used in the Middle Ages, originating in Troyes, France.\n\nThe term \"spot\" gold refers to the current market price at which gold can be bought and sold for instant delivery, also according to APMEX.

That’s what gold and silver provide.\"\n\nOwning a piece of the real stuff is appealing to people looking to build a sense of self-sufficiency that they believe will withstand a turbulent cash market.\n\nIs your gold bar from Costco worth $1 million?\n\nWholesale grocer Costco made headlines when it began selling gold bars in Oct. 2023, resulting in over $100 million in sales of the precious metal in the first fiscal quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Costco gold bars weigh in at one Troy ounce, a far cry from the 400 Troy ounce bars currently being valued at $1 million.\n\nAs of early Friday afternoon, one Troy ounce of gold is valued at $2,515.83 If you happen to have about 400 of the Costco bars on hand, then you might be looking at a stash that could sell for roughly $1,006,332.\n\nConsidering the retailer has a purchase limit of two bars per customer, however, it's unlikely that investment will make you the next bonified millionaire.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/09/22/how-much-is-1-kilo-of-gold-worth/70931477007/", "title": "How much is 1 kilo of gold worth?

Others see it as a store of value during economic downturns. At the same time, some may find diversifying a portfolio of stocks and bonds useful, given its low correlation to both assets.\n\n“If you look at gold’s performance historically, it’s the kind of asset that should perform well through uncertainty, as it has done in five out of the last seven recessions,” said Joseph Cavatoni, chief market strategist for North America at the World Gold Council. “For people looking for a store of value and a portfolio diversifier, gold has a strong track record of delivering those qualities.”\n\nContributing: Tony Dong and Farran Powel USA TODAY Blueprint", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/new-jersey/2023/12/06/menendez-gold-bars-stolen-investigation-charges-nj/71811607007/", "title": "Menendez charges: Stolen gold bars resurface in investigation", "text": "A decade after real estate developer Fred Daibes was beaten and robbed in his Bergen County penthouse, the $3 million in gold bars that were stolen in what was called \"an inside job\" are gaining new life in Sen. Bob Menendez's federal indictment.\n\nDaibes and Mariano Castillo, the night doorman at the St. Moritz, the Edgewater high-rise that Daibes built and owned at the time of the 2013 robbery, were tied up and blindfolded with pillowcases and had guns pressed to their heads. Daibes' shoulder and ribs were broken.\n\nDuring the robbery, which lasted hours, $3 million worth of gold bars, diamonds, gems and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were stolen and eventually found in another apartment.\n\nDaibes and Menendez linked with gold and cash\n\nDaibes is one of five people who were federally indicted in September in an alleged corruption scheme involving Menendez and his wife Nadine Arslanian Menendez.\n\nDaibes and businessmen Wael Hana and Jose Uribe were charged with conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to commit honest services fraud in relation to Menendez's second indictment in eight years.\n\nMenendez was indicted on corruption charges for allegedly accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from Daibes, Hana and Uribe for helping them enrich themselves and trying to get them out of trouble, according to the indictment, unsealed in the Southern District of New York.\n\nA superseding indictment filed by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York says New Jersey’s senior senator, his wife and Hana allegedly conspired for the senator to act as a foreign agent for the Egyptian government and Egyptian officials from January 2018 through at least June 2022, even as he sat as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nMore than $480,000 in cash was found stuffed into envelopes and hidden in clothing, closets and a safe at Menendez's home during a search by investigators in June 2022, according to the indictment. Investigators also found more than $70,000 in Nadine Menendez’s safe deposit box, the indictment shows, along with photos of cash that was stuffed into clothes, including a windbreaker with Menendez's name stitched on it.\n\nSome of the envelopes contained the fingerprints or DNA of Daibes — an Edgewater developer and longtime political donor to Menendez — or Daibes' driver, the indictment says. Investigators also discovered more than $100,000 worth of gold bars in the home, which were provided by Hana or Daibes, according to the indictment.\n\nMore:In bribery case, Sen. Menendez switches to a defense lawyer quite familiar with gold bars\n\nTwo gold bars that were stolen from Daibes in 2013 were found during an FBI search of Menendez's Englewood Cliffs home and photos of two other gold bars from the 2013 robbery were also found, while Nadine Menendez gave the other two gold bars to a jeweler to sell. The four bars had serial numbers linked to the robbery at the Daibes penthouse, NBC News first reported.\n\nWhat happened 10 years ago?\n\nIt was just after 4 a.m. on Nov. 26, 2013, when three men and a woman masked and armed with guns entered Daibes' two-story penthouse apartment in the St. Moritz building, now known as the Riello.\n\nThe robbers pulled Daibes out of his bed, tied him up and put a pillowcase over his head and rummaged through his apartment for hours. They had Daibes call the doorman to his apartment, who was then also tied up and threatened, to access the surveillance equipment.\n\nThe upscale 25-story high-rise that overlooks the Hudson River with a Manhattan skyline view at 100 Daibes Court was only seven years old at the time of the robbery.\n\nThe “classic inside job” was planned by Jorge Valencia, a trusted Daibes employee who worked as superintendent of the St. Moritz condominium building in Edgewater, according to court documents. Valencia worked for Daibes for 17 years and lived rent-free in St. Moritz with his family.\n\nValencia admitted that he schemed to steal diamonds, gems and gold and silver bars, cash and jewelry valued at nearly $3 million from Daibes' safe that was inside his closet. The robbery was carried out with his three codefendants and a fifth suspect who has not been identified.\n\n\"They convinced me they wanted to kill me,\" Daibes told a judge at the time. \"On more than one occasion, they put a gun to my head. They acted like real tough guys.\"\n\nDuring the robbery, Daibes' shoulder and ribs were broken.\n\nAfter pleading guilty, Valencia was sentenced to 15 years for armed robbery and concurrent terms of eight years for conspiring to kidnap and 18 months for hindering apprehension.\n\nRamona Mercado-Vasquez, and her boyfriend, Adonis Sepulveda, who also lived in the St. Moritz, were also arrested and charged in the robbery with Sepulveda's brother, Alexander Suarez.\n\nPolice were able to connect Mercado-Vasquez and Sepulveda to the robbery within 12 hours using one of the surveillance recorders that was in an adjoining room and not removed with the others. All of the proceeds from Daibes' safe were later recovered in their apartment.\n\nThe robbery was planned for two months after Valencia noticed the open safe in a closet during a maintenance call to the apartment. Besides the gold and cash, there were also watches and guns.\n\nDaibes’ shoulder needed multiple surgeries and he was left with the inability to fully raise his arm. During the sentencing in 2015, the prosecutor said Daibes remains in “indescribable” pain and is contemplating a shoulder replacement operation. Daibes also moved out of his home because he said his children couldn’t live with the fear of being there.\n\nBergen County Assistant Prosecutor David Calviello called the robbery “highly unique” in that the defendants “targeted a multimillionaire who kept large sums of expensive property and cash on hand.”\n\nMore:'Bobby from Jersey': Sen. John Fetterman trolls Sen. Bob Menendez with George Santos Cameo\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nValencia is serving his time in Northern State Prison and is eligible for parole on Oct. 21, 2026.\n\nMercado-Vasquez was sentenced to 14 years for armed robbery and an eight-year concurrent term for conspiracy to kidnap. She is serving her time in Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women and is eligible for parole on Oct. 19, 2025.\n\nSepulveda, was sentenced to 18 years for kidnapping Castillo and a concurrent term of 16 years for armed robbery. He is serving his sentence at Eastern Jersey State Prison and is eligible for parole on March 15, 2029.\n\nHis brother, Alexander Suarez, 22, was sentenced to 12 years for armed robbery and a concurrent term of six years for conspiracy to kidnap. He is serving his sentence at Bayside State Prison and is eligible for parole on Feb. 21, 2024.\n\nAt the time, Daibes said he didn’t believe their apologies and said they were only sorry they were caught. “If they didn’t get caught, they’d be out spending the money and partying,” he said.\n\nWithin a year after the attack, Daibes sold the building for $120.3 million\n\n“They think 18 or 14 years is too long. I got a life sentence, and I didn’t commit any crime,” Daibes said in 2015. “No one should have to feel that he’s not safe in his bed.”\n\nDaibes has had some legal troubles since.\n\nHe was indicted on multiple counts in 2018 for an alleged conspiracy to circumvent lending limits set by Mariner's Bank, which he founded in 2001.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to a single count of the original 14-count indictment, which included a 2008 memo for a $1.8 million nominee loan that falsely stated the borrower and the source of repayment. The line of credit was actually for Daibes, who funded the repayment.\n\nThe judge has since rejected his plea deal after the Menendez indictment and his next court hearing is scheduled for later this month.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/03/09/costco-silver-coins-gold-bars/72910338007/", "title": "Costco silver coins selling fast, just as retailer's gold bars did", "text": "First, Costco sold gold bars to its members looking to invest in more than bulk household purchases.

Disability, job losses and an eviction all struck at the same time, sending them on a downward spiral into poverty. His mother lost her feet to frostbite and now uses prosthetics to walk. And a 2022 work injury left Roberts unsteady on his legs and in a wheelchair.\n\nAfter being kicked out of their apartment, the family lived in an RV camper, moving from trailhead to trailhead on public lands for the past three years. They were living in a national forest in May when the U.S. Forest Service and a barrage of law enforcement tried to arrest the family for camping on public land longer than allowed. Roberts was shot and the injury left him paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nAs cities and states across the country pass ordinances cracking down on camping and homelessness, the Robertses' eviction from the forest has become a high-profile example of an unhoused American facing harm at the hands of law enforcement while being poor and having no place else to go.\n\nIn response to the shooting, lawyers filed a personal injury tort claim on behalf of Roberts against the federal government for $50 million, representing a lifetime's worth of lost earnings due to his condition.\n\n\"Forest Service officers needlessly and recklessly shot Mr. Roberts repeatedly, causing him extreme suffering and permanent disability,\" said Ritchie Eppink, one of Roberts' lawyers.\n\nThe shooting occurred after Roberts, who had a .22 revolver with him, pointed his weapon at the two plainclothes officers after they confronted his brother. He did not fire, police body camera footage shows. After seeing Brooks Roberts' gun, officers unleashed a storm of gunfire on him, the footage shows. Since Idaho is an open carry state, Roberts was within his rights to be holding the weapon.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which includes the U.S. Forest Service, declined to respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY, citing the ongoing litigation.\n\nRelated:Ticketed for being homeless? Supreme Court asked to weigh if punishment is 'cruel and unusual'\n\nOfficials shoot homeless man multiple times, including in the back\n\nU.S. Forest Service officers allegedly fired at Roberts more than 10 times, shooting him in the back while he lay immobile on the ground on May 19, according to body camera footage viewed by USA TODAY and the tort claim.\n\nThe Roberts family is part of Idaho's unhoused population. Around 2,000 people experienced homelessness there in 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Overall, homelessness in the state increased by 14.2% in the past 15 years, according to the department. The state has one of the higher unsheltered homelessness rates in the nation, HUD data shows, with nearly half (44%) of unhoused Idahoans living outdoors or in vehicles in 2022.\n\nIn Idaho's Payette National Forest, and across the country, the U.S. Forest Service has historically managed public lands, conserved natural resources and provided \"quality water and timber for the nation’s benefit,\" the agency's website says. The agency's law enforcement division is \"charged with protecting the public, employees, and natural resources,\" according to its website.\n\n\"After I got shot, my main feeling was, 'am I going to survive this?'\" Roberts said. \"Because I knew that if it killed me, my mom and my brother would basically commit suicide because of the grief of losing me.\"\n\nRoberts spent months recovering in the hospital and has lived in a small budget hotel room with his mother for the past five weeks. It's very hard to still not have a \"stable roof over\" their heads, he said, and he's worried they'll be back \"out on the sidewalk\" when what little money they have runs out.\n\nThe extreme use of force used against Roberts by federal officers sends a clear message from the federal government that unhoused people are less deserving of their right to life, said Eric Tars, legal director of the National Homelessness Law Center.\n\n\"This is the message from the top,\" Tars said.\n\nArrested for being homeless on public land\n\nThe shooting happened as part of a sting operation in which plainclothes officers tried to serve an arrest warrant for the family's unsanctioned camping in Payette National Forest, north of Boise. Officers tried to serve arrest warrants for Roberts and his mother and brother, accusing all three of the low-level misdemeanor of camping on public lands longer than allowed, said Craig Durham one of Roberts' lawyers. His brother, 35-year-old Timber Roberts, also had an arrest warrant for disorderly conduct, according to Durham. He was jailed for the misdemeanors and has been behind bars since then.\n\nThe attempt to arrest the Roberts family in May escalated because authorities snuck up on the family and pretended to be members of the public, the tort claim says.\n\nPlainclothes officers from the U.S. Forest Service arrived at the family's camper in an unmarked pickup and knocked on the RV's front door, saying they needed help jumpstarting their vehicle, body camera footage shows.\n\nThe tort claim states the violence that ensued stemmed from a \"wildly dangerous ruse operation that needlessly jeopardized the lives and safety of the public.\"\n\nAfter Timber Roberts came outside to help the two men jumpstart their truck, the officers took him to the ground and said they were arresting him.\n\nTimber Roberts yelled toward the camper saying he needed help, and Brooks Roberts wheeled out of the RV, thinking, \"I got to get out there and help him,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought he was being carjacked and that they either could have stabbed or shot him. I thought they were carjackers,\" he said.\n\n'I didn't know you guys were cops'\n\nIn addition to the U.S. Forest Service, more than a dozen law enforcement officials from the Bureau of Land Management, McCall Police Department, and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game were involved in the operation, Durham said. They had the RV surrounded but didn't make their presence known to either Brooks or Timber Roberts until it was too late, lawyers said.\n\nAll the agencies declined to comment to USA TODAY on the case.\n\nDuring the shooting, Robert's gun was flung from his hand and he fell to the ground. Officers identified themselves to Roberts after firing at him more than 10 times, telling him to put his hands where they could see them.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I thought my brother was being attacked,\" Brooks Roberts said after he realized the people were police. \"I didn't know you guys were cops.\"\n\nLooking back on the shooting months later, Brooks Roberts said he's \"royally pissed\" that federal officers didn't properly announce themselves before opening fire. With the planned lawsuit, he said the money he's seeking will make up for the lost income he'll suffer as a result of his disability.\n\n\"It needs to be a federal law that any cop caught harassing a homeless person gets arrested and put in jail for at least a month,\" Brooks Roberts said.\n\n'We had done nothing wrong except being homeless'\n\nWhen Brooks Roberts was shot multiple times by federal law enforcement, the family was just trying to survive and save enough money to get into an apartment, he said. The government made that task more difficult by garnishing his mom's social security disability checks for nonpayment of camping tickets, which they incurred because of living in an RV, she said in a news release.\n\n\"We had done nothing wrong except being homeless and being stuck where we were,\" Brooks Roberts said. \"It wasn't like we chose to be there. We got snowed in and got stuck and had nowhere to go.\"\n\n\"All I could think of was how much it hurt,\" he said of the day of the shooting. The shooting left him with \"searing pain,\" 11 bullet holes in his body and lead lodged in his spine.\n\nHe said he feels angry that he's \"a burden\" to his family members because he needs help doing basic tasks.\n\nWhat the federal government labeled \"camping\" was \"very much not an existence that they wanted,\" Durham said, who added that the family could not find space to live in homeless shelters.\n\n\"It was harsh, difficult, destabilizing and lacking in necessities,\" he said.\n\nMany homeless people live in fear of police across US\n\nAcross the country this year, city police departments have been enforcing a growing number of camping bans, leading to arrests and fines for unhoused people living on the streets. Sweeps of tent encampments in cities like Los Angeles have felt like a whack-a-mole game in recent months, homeless advocates say, forcing people to constantly live in fear of crackdowns.\n\nIn Idaho, the Roberts family was forced to move their camper roughly every two weeks to comply with ordinances on camping, their lawyers said. Still, Forest Service authorities and officers from the Bureau of Land Management spent a considerable amount of resources trying to arrest them, Brooks Roberts' lawyers argue.\n\nUsually, authorities issue tickets and fines, and would only coordinate with other agencies for larger encampment evictions, Tar said.\n\n\"I’ve been doing this work for almost two decades, and I’ve never heard of federal law enforcement using all these resources from multiple agencies just to target a single family for arrest for unsanctioned camping,” Tars said.\n\nThe extreme force used against the Roberts family sets a bad example for other police departments across the country struggling to deal with the homelessness crises in their own backyards, Tars said.\n\n\"This is the message that is being received by police departments across the country, that this is an appropriate way to address homelessness,\" he said.\n\nAside from trained law enforcement, Tars said he's worried about members of the general public who might try to apprehend unhoused people as vigilantes.\n\n\"When people see federal police, and state and local police treat people experiencing homelessness as though they're less deserving of their right to life, then this is the kind of thing that we can expect to see more of,\" Tars said.\n\nCamping bans led to misdemeanor charges\n\nAt the time of the shooting, the Roberts family had already secured lawyers to argue on their behalf so they could stay in their camper, according to the tort claim. The family also had a social worker who was helping with their search for more stable housing.\n\nLawyers claim federal agents \"collaborated to trick the family,\" instead of informing the Robertses' court-appointed attorneys of their most recent warrants, the tort claim reads.\n\nBrooks Roberts and his mom still have camping misdemeanor charges pending against them and are raising money on GoFundMe to afford a rental home. They are scheduled for a court hearing in October.\n\nIn December, the White House Interagency Council on Homelessness criticized the rise in camping bans in some U.S. cities, arguing they criminalize homelessness without getting people into shelters or housing. The council also said it would \"combat\" local \"laws which criminalize homelessness\" as part of its long-term plan to solve the homelessness crisis.\n\nThe group's stated goals for reducing homelessness stand in stark contrast to instances where federal officers have used force against unhoused people or sent them to jail, Tars said.\n\nIn February, federal law enforcement also cleared longtime unhoused residents from Washington, D.C.'s McPherson Square, which falls within federal jurisdiction. The sweep resulted in two people being sent to jail, and most of the residents remained unhoused as of June,The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn a statement, the White House Interagency Council on Homelessness said they defer questions about Roberts' tort claim to the agencies directly involved.\n\n\"On paper, the federal government has put out great guidance saying we should do exactly the opposite, that criminalization of homelessness is bad policy,\" Tars said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/05/22/amys-bakery-owner-deportation/2349975/", "title": "Co-owner of 'Nightmares' eatery might be deported", "text": "Robert Anglen and Peter Corbett\n\nThe Arizona Republic\n\nSalomon and Amy Bouzaglo appeared on %22Kitchen Nightmares%22 May 10\n\nCouple abruptly canceled a news conference Monday to give their side of the story about the episode\n\nBouzaglos said Samy had served time in prison before immigrating to the United States 13 years ago%3B he has no criminal convictions in this country\n\nThe co-owner of Amy's Baking Company — a Scottsdale, Ariz., restaurant that has been the center of controversy since appearing on the culinary reality TV show \"Kitchen Nightmares\" 11 days ago — is facing deportation.\n\nSalomon \"Samy\" Bouzaglo, who owns Amy's Baking Company along with his wife, Amy, is involved in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement case to revoke his residency status, his lawyer said Tuesday. Scottsdale immigration lawyer David Asser said the case against his client started two years ago and was the subject of a removal hearing Monday.\n\nAsser, speaking just hours before the Bouzaglos reopened their embattled restaurant, said he could not comment on the case. He also said Samy's immigration case has nothing to do with the television show. In fact, Asser said, he has not even watched the episode that has earned his client celebrity status.\n\n\"I didn't know they were going to go on (the show),\" he said.\n\nAmy's closed in the wake of the \"Kitchen Nightmares\" episode, which aired on Fox on May 10 and showed the owners yelling and pushing customers, taking servers' tips and firing one waitress on the spot, calling her a \"poisonous, little viper.\" People across the country took to Yelp, Facebook, Reddit and other websites to express their disgust with the Bouzaglos' actions after the show.\n\nThe Bouzaglos hope to turn around their business with a weeklong grand reopening that began uneventfully Tuesday. The restaurateurs said that they had more than 1,500 reservations for Amy's this week and announced plans to donate 10 percent of the grand-opening proceeds to the Megan Meier Foundation, which raises awareness of cyberbullying.\n\nOn Tuesday, Amy's opened to a thin crowd and began serving those holding reservations at 5 p.m., using security guards to prevent gawkers, media and others without reservations from entering. The restaurant had a sign saying its patio was closed for security reasons. The reopening appeared to be running without incident for the first wave of diners. Some onlookers showed up hoping to snag a reservation, but most were turned away. The nearby Pita Jungle restaurant appeared to be drawing more business than Amy's.\n\nLaurie Ferrere Vermillion, a Scottsdale blogger, was among the handful of people turned away in the restaurant's first hour because she had no reservation. Vermillion had hoped to dine at the restaurant Tuesday despite discouraging reviews from her friends.\n\n\"My friends who have been (to Amy's) said, 'Don't waste your money,' \" said Vermillion, who has seen every episode of \"Kitchen Nightmares\" and was shocked by the show featuring the Scottsdale restaurant.\n\nLeon Lucero, 19, said he was curious about Amy's and was hoping to get a reservation at the restaurant Tuesday night.\n\n\"Maybe this is a new start for them, a new beginning,\" said Lucero, a music major at Glendale Community College who said he expects food at the restaurant to have improved.\n\nAnnie Dutoit, 42, who was at a nearby coffee shop, said she had dined at Amy's with her family five or six times in the past 18 months and generally had good experiences.\n\nShe said she was surprised at the way Amy and Samy were portrayed on \"Kitchen Nightmares.\"\n\n\"I don't know if the editing was done to show horrible things,\" Dutoit said.\n\nA native of Switzerland, she said she has dined all over the world and considered Amy's a decent restaurant. Amy did special orders for her children, making crepes for them, Dutoit said.\n\nShe said she was surprised to hear on the show that the servers did not get their tips and would not want to support a restaurant that did that.\n\n\"I would go back, but I want to know what the truth is\" about Amy's, said Dutoit, adding that she is not sure what to believe about what was shown on a reality TV show.\n\nTuesday's reopening capped a tumultuous week for the owners of Amy's.\n\nThe couple was supposed to hold a news conference Tuesday at the restaurant to give their side of the story about what happened on the \"Kitchen Nightmares,\" suggesting the broadcast was not an accurate depiction of their restaurant. The news conference was abruptly canceled on Monday.\n\nA Scottsdale public-relations firm headed by Jason Rose explained in a news release that a law firm representing the producers of \"Kitchen Nightmares\" warned the Bouzaglos against making disparaging remarks about the show or its star, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay.\n\nOn Tuesday, Samy and Amy talked about their past records and indicated Samy had served time in prison before immigrating to the United States 13 years ago. Reached by phone as they drove to their restaurant Tuesday morning, Amy and Samy each tried to talk over the other -- interrupting, yelling and even cursing one another as the conversation continued.\n\n\"We both made mistakes in the past. We have done our time,\" Amy said. \"We can't comment. We know God is with us.\"\n\nSamy said he could not talk about any past records but added he has not had any problems since immigrating to the U.S.\n\n\"The FBI knows all about me. ... The IRS knows,\" he said.\n\nSamy said issues surrounding his immigration status were \"a sensitive subject\" that he did not want to talk about Tuesday.\n\nBut he indicated that he wanted people to know that he had nothing to hide.\n\n\"I want people to know about me,\" he said. \"But not today, not tomorrow. I have nothing to hide.\"\n\nAsser, the lawyer, said Samy is an Israeli citizen and was born in Morocco.\n\nAmy, 40, and Samy, 63, live in Gold Canyon. Before coming to Arizona, they lived in Las Vegas. Amy also lived in Colorado and California.\n\nRecords show Amy has served time in federal prison and has a history of liens and judgments.\n\nIn 2003, Amy Bouzaglo pleaded guilty to misuse of a Social Security number when she applied for a $15,000 bank loan. At the time, her name was Amanda Bossingham. She spent about a year in prison beginning in 2008.\n\nRecords show that prior to her conviction, Amy faced four judgments in Colorado in 1998 and 1999 totaling about $14,000. She was also sued in Arizona in 2000 for $3,229. The judgments appear to have arisen from unpaid debts that were turned over to collection agencies.\n\nShe married Samy in 2004. Records show he is from Los Angeles, where he lived upon arriving in the United States. Records indicate he has no criminal convictions or civil judgments in the United States.\n\n\"I am perfectly clean,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2018/02/27/chinese-espionage-huawei-zte-congress/356095002/", "title": "Spy games: Is buying a Chinese smartphone like Huawei and ZTE ...", "text": "BARCELONA — Does buying a smartphone from certain Chinese brands expose you to spying?\n\nOrdinarily you’d judge the Mate 10 Pro from China's Huawei on its its lovely 6-inch OLED display and exceptional battery life.\n\nBut there’s a bigger issue beyond the specs of the flagship handset from the No. 3 phone maker in the world, which has been banking on the $799.99 smartphone to challenge Samsung Galaxy and iPhone in North America.\n\nLawmakers in the United States have placed Huawei and another Chinese manufacturer, ZTE, in the crosshairs over their reputed ties to the Chinese intelligence and military establishment.\n\nU.S. officials' concern is that their products could be conduits for Chinese espionage, both on a targeted and a grand scale. Both handset makers have denied any such complicity.\n\nAt this week's Mobile World Congress, where both companies have a large presence, Huawei CEO Ken Hu told reporters such concerns are \"groundless suspicions,\" according to Reuters.\n\nMore:Huawei CEO: U.S. consumer loses from failure to ink phone deal with wireless carrier\n\nMore:The smartphone maker to rival Samsung and Apple gets throttled in U.S.\n\nMore:Q&A: China has 'no interest in global domination'\n\nSpy claims\n\nHu is countering increasingly vocal opposition to Chinese technology companies from some parts of the U.S. government.\n\nThis month, when Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) asked the heads of the CIA, FBI and four other intelligence chiefs to their raise hands if they would recommend that private American citizens use Huawei or ZTE products or services, none did.\n\nRep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, introduced a bill to prohibit the U.S. government from purchasing or leasing telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE.\n\nAnd last month, just before Huawei was set to promote the Mate 10 Pro during the CES trade show in Las Vegas, a deal with a U.S. carrier believed to be AT&T for the phone was scuttled, apparently because of pressure from U.S. government officials. Verizon had also reportedly been in talks with Huawei.\n\nAt Mobile World Congress, Verizon Wireless senior vice president and chief network officer Nicola Palmer declined to elaborate on the carrier's relationship except to say that \"we don't have Huawei equipment in our network and don't have plans to.\"\n\nWhile no evidence of cyberspying from either Huawei or ZTE has been presented to the public, the idea of cybersnooping involving the Chinese is not without precedent.\n\nBlu phones spyware\n\nIn 2016, security firm Kryptowire said tens of thousands of mostly inexpensive Android phones, including the BLU R1 HD sold at Amazon from a Miami-based company that was selling rebranded Chinese phones, were secretly transmitting text messages, contact lists and call logs to servers in China. Such phones came preloaded with firmware managed by a company named Shanghai Adups Technology Co.\n\nAt the time, a lawyer representing Adups told The New York Times, “This is a private company that made a mistake.”\n\nBlu subsequently removed the offending software. Along the way, the Blu phones were removed, then eventually reinstated on Amazon. The issue surfaced again in July when Amazon pulled the phones over spyware. After apparently determining that it was a false alarm, Amazon again put the phones on sale.\n\nLast year, ZTE agreed to pay $892 million to the U.S. government as part of a settlement of claims that it violated sanctions on Iran. While it wasn't a cybersecurity issue per se, attorney general Jeff Sessions said at the time the export controls that were violated aim \"to keep sensitive American technology out of the hands of hostile regimes like Iran’s.\"\n\n“The only thing that gives me any pause is that lawmakers have access to classified information,\" says Jamie Winterton, Director of Strategy for Arizona State University’s Global Security Initiative. \"They may have a reason for picking out these two particular companies and saying we don’t want these particular phones released in the United States.”\n\nBut while Winterton believes there is a general concern with hardware security, she added, “I don’t think that that concern is solved by banning phones from companies in China.”\n\n'Committed to openness'\n\nHuawei insists it follows the rule book in the countries in which it operates. In a statement to USA TODAY, the company indicated that it “is aware of a range of U.S. government activities seemingly aimed at inhibiting Huawei's business in the U.S. market.\"\n\n\"Huawei is trusted by governments and customers in 170 countries worldwide and poses no greater cybersecurity risk than any (communications) vendor, sharing as we do common global supply chains and production capabilities. We are committed to openness and transparency in everything we do.”\n\nIn its own emailed statement, ZTE says it stands behind the security of its products in the U.S. market and includes U.S. made chips and other components in its phones.\n\n\"As a publicly traded company, we are committed to adhering to all applicable laws and regulations of the United States, work with carriers to pass strict testing protocols, and adhere to the highest business standards,\" the ZTE statement said.\n\nHuawei and ZTE are by no means the only Chinese phones sold in the U.S. Even a venerable U.S. brand name such as Motorola is now owned by China’s Lenovo, which in September settled with the Federal Trade Commission over charges it shipped some of its laptops preloaded with software that compromised security, related to delivering ads to consumers.\n\nWhen it comes to phones, popular handsets including Apple’s iPhones and Samsung’s Galaxy’s include parts sourced from China. China is also where some of the phones are assembled.\n\nIs that an important distinction? Dean Cheng, senior research fellow for Chinese political and security affairs at the Heritage Foundation, says the mere fact that companies (such as Huawei and ZTE) are Chinese means they will \"respond to recommendations and advice\" — read pressure — from the central Chinese government.\n\nEven with the recent concern from Congress over Chinese technology, it's still very easy to buy a Chinese cellphone in the U.S. to use here. Without a carrier deal, you can buy an unlocked version of the Huawei Mate 10 Pro at Amazon, Best Buy and other electronics retailers, then insert your own SIM card to use the device.\n\nZTE sells its own phones in the U.S., several budget models, as well as the foldable dual-screen Axon M smartphone.\n\nTolerating risk\n\nPart of whether to buy one boils down to your own tolerance of risk and belief that your personal information will end up in the hands of a state actor, Cheng says.\n\n“We have pretty good evidence that the Chinese take a Hoover vacuum approach towards information collection,” he says.\n\nAs a typical consumer you may not think you need to be on guard, especially if you're not employed, say, by a defense contractor or aerospace company or work for a firm that does business in China.\n\nStill, Galina Datskovsky, CEO of Vaporstream, a secure messaging company in Chicago, says you ought to think about “who you know, what you know, where do you work, where does your family work, where do your friends and contacts work, (and) with whom are you corresponding.”\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/07/biden-state-of-the-union-pivot/11195224002/", "title": "Biden's State of the Union and the changed world he faces", "text": "President Biden's combative State of the Union address Tuesday night signaled more than a new year.\n\nIt welcomed a different presidency.\n\nAfter taking office amid political turmoil and a global pandemic, Biden's first two years in office were marked by passage of legislation as far-reaching as any since the New Deal, from a massive infrastructure bill to the biggest investment in climate legislation in history.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/17/stormy-daniels-donald-trump-view-porn-star-michael-cohen-sketch-reward/523836002/", "title": "Stormy Daniels offers $100k reward to ID man she says threatened her", "text": "WASHINGTON — Adult film actress Stormy Daniels and her lawyer on Tuesday unveiled a sketch of the man she said threatened her seven years ago to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Donald Trump.\n\nDuring a live appearance on ABC's The View, Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti said the duo is offering a $100,000 reward for information about the man.\n\nDaniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, has said the unidentified man threatened her in 2011, a few weeks after she agreed to tell the story of her alleged tryst to In Touch Weekly magazine.\n\nIn an interview last month with 60 Minutes, Daniels said she was in a Las Vegas parking lot, going to a fitness class with her infant daughter when \"a guy walked up on me and said to me, ‘Leave Trump alone.

Here's what you need to know:\n\n1. Who are the Bandidos?\n\nThe gang was started in San Leon, Texas, in 1966. It's one of the largest outlaw motorcycle gangs in the United States, with about 900 members and 93 chapters, according to the FBI. The Bandidos has a membership of 2,000 to 2,500 people in the U.S. and in 13 other countries, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\n2. How dangerous are they?\n\nA state gang threat assessment released last year by the Texas Department of Public Safety ranked the Bandidos as a \"Tier 2\" gang — or the second-most dangerous classification — alongside the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas and the Partido Revolucionario Mexicano (PRM). The most dangerous outlaw motorcycle gang in the U.S. is considered the Hells Angels from California.\n\n3. What criminal activities are the gang involved in?\n\nThe Bandidos are involved in transporting and distributing cocaine and marijuana, and are involved in the production, transportation and distribution of methamphetamine, according to the DOJ.\n\n4. Where are they most prominent?\n\nAccording to the DOJ, the Bandidos are most active in the Pacific, Southeastern, Southwestern and the West Central regions of the U.S. The Bandidos are growing in each of these regions.\n\n5. Who founded the gang?\n\nAccording to gang legend, Donald Chambers, then 36, started the Bandidos. . He was working on the ship docks in Houston, according to a 2007 profile of the Bandidos by Skip Hollandsworth. The Bandidos MC Sweden website says Chambers was a war vet from Vietnam. Chambers felt disenfranchised by the treatment of troops back from the war.\n\n\"The members of the Brotherhood wanted respect, recognition and freedom for their actions. The laws of society had denied exactly these points. As club colors, the colors of the U.S. Marine Corps were selected: Red & Gold,\" the website says.\n\nFollow @JessicaDurando on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/03/politics/trump-constitution-truth-social/index.html", "title": "Trump calls for the termination of the Constitution in Truth Social ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump called for the termination of the Constitution to overturn the 2020 election and reinstate him to power Saturday in a continuation of his election denialism and pushing of fringe conspiracy theories.\n\n“Do you throw the Presidential Election Results of 2020 OUT and declare the RIGHTFUL WINNER, or do you have a NEW ELECTION? A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution,” Trump wrote in a post on the social network Truth Social and accused “Big Tech” of working closely with Democrats. “Our great ‘Founders’ did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!”\n\nTrump’s post came after the release of internal Twitter emails showing deliberation in 2020 over a New York Post story about material found on Hunter Biden’s laptop.\n\nWhite House spokesman Andrew Bates said Saturday that Trump’s remarks are “anathema to the soul of our nation, and should be universally condemned.”\n\n“You cannot only love America when you win,” Bates said in a statement. “The American Constitution is a sacrosanct document that for over 200 years has guaranteed that freedom and the rule of law prevail in our great country. The Constitution brings the American people together – regardless of party – and elected leaders swear to uphold it. It’s the ultimate monument to all of the Americans who have given their lives to defeat self-serving despots that abused their power and trampled on fundamental rights.”\n\nRepublican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, an outspoken Trump critic, denounced the former president’s Truth Social statement on Sunday. Cheney, who serves as vice chair of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, tweeted that Trump’s statement “was his view on 1/6 and remains his view today.”\n\n“No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution,” she said.\n\nDonald Trump believes we should terminate “all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution” to overturn the 2020 election.

No honest person can now deny that Trump is an enemy of the Constitution. — Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) December 4, 2022\n\nCheney, who is leaving the House next month, has attempted to steer the GOP away from the former president’s influence. Her public stance against Trump and her role on the January 6 committee likely led to her defeat in an August primary, though the Republican maverick has picked up a strong national following among moderate Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nEmployees on Twitter’s legal, policy and communications teams debated – and at times disagreed – over whether to restrict the article under the company’s hacked materials policy. The debate took place weeks before the 2020 election, when Joe Biden, Hunter Biden’s father, was running against then-President Trump.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump's Constitution statement makes Georgia election official chuckle 01:06 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump announced his third presidential bid last month and is still widely considered the leader of the Republican Party. Party leaders had hoped that the former president would drop his election denialism rhetoric after lackluster results in the midterms.\n\nEarlier this week Trump expressed support for the rioters behind the deadly January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, saying in a video played during a fundraiser that “People have been treated unconstitutionally in my opinion and very, very unfairly, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it.”\n\nIn a September interview, Trump said he was “financially supporting” some January 6 defendants and promised he would issue pardons and a government apology to those being prosecuted if he were reelected.\n\nHe has also come under fire for having dinner at his Mar-a-lago resort with known White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and rapper Kanye West, who has recently made a slew of antisemitic remarks.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.", "authors": ["Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/politics/douglas-frank-big-lie/index.html", "title": "The 2020 election wasn't stolen. But Douglas Frank and his bogus ...", "text": "Austin CNN —\n\nDouglas Frank, an Ohio math teacher, affixed his Texas flag print bow tie, led a booming rendition of the National Anthem and then walked a crowd through an absurd mathematical equation that he claimed proves the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n“Just about every county in the country was hacked,” Frank told the dozens of Texans huddled in a ballroom at a local country club on Sunday. When he finished speaking more than 90 minutes later, they gave him a standing ovation.\n\nThis is how the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen grows even bigger. More than a year later, there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. But Frank is still winning audiences with lawmakers, election officials and voters across the country.\n\nCurrently on leave from his teaching position, Frank has traveled to Texas and dozens of other states, claiming he uncovered an algorithm proving the 2020 election was stolen nationwide, even as his conclusions have been debunked by mathematicians and election experts.\n\n“At the core of how our democracy works is that we have to trust election results,” said Justin Grimmer, a political science professor at Stanford University. “Luckily, the theory is so crazy that I think only the people who really want to believe or really, really want to see some conspiracy in the world would be persuaded. But nevertheless, I think there’s a real danger there.”\n\nFrank is just one in an army of conspiracy theorists, inspired by former President Donald Trump’s election lies, who are dedicated to trying to convince others the 2020 election was corrupt. As of December, it was a belief shared by a third of Americans, who said Joe Biden was an illegitimate president, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, he stood by his flawed conclusions, remaining adamant in his belief that the elections are rigged – regardless of the many experts who have disproven his claims.\n\n“I know the elections are not real. I know the elections are being manipulated,” Frank said in an interview with CNN. “Regardless of who wins. I just want ‘em to be fair.”\n\nConspiracy-minded ‘super moms’\n\nAcross the country, Frank has connected with women he has dubbed “super moms.” They are women who have embraced unfounded election conspiracy theories and are engaged in efforts to expose the nonexistent widespread fraud.\n\nIn New Hampshire, one of the women has pushed for a so-called forensic audit of her state’s 2020 election results and has promoted efforts to ban voting machines and move to hand-count-only elections.\n\nIn Colorado, women have organized door-knocking campaigns to try to uncover phantom voters.\n\nAnd in Pennsylvania, women have launched voter canvasses, pressured state GOP lawmakers to launch a 2020 election review and are now pushing to get rid of electronic voting machines across the state.\n\nWhat elevates Frank above the everyday conspiracy theorist are his financial backing and his intensive travel schedule.\n\nCritically, he has the backing of Mike Lindell. The My Pillow CEO is a deep-pocketed purveyor of election disinformation and told CNBC he has already spent $25 million on his efforts to push election fraud claims.\n\nIn an interview, Frank told CNN that he is an “expert witness” for Lindell’s attorney, and he is paid for specific projects. He said groups that invite him to speak cover the cost of his travel and lodging. Others donate money to support his efforts. Still, Frank insisted he wasn’t motivated by money or his newfound stardom among election deniers.\n\n“My goal is to be able to pay my bills, and it’s working,” Frank said. “I’ve been able to do this a year now and my bank balance isn’t getting smaller.”\n\nDebunking Frank’s fraud claims\n\nBefore Frank arrives at a speaking gig, he creates an elaborate slideshow complete with county-by-county graphs. An animated public speaker, he offers a bit of his bio, flips through the graphs and describes how a “sixth order polynomial” equation demonstrates that the election was stolen.\n\n“I was the perfect person in this world to discover this,” Frank told state lawmakers at a stop in Colorado. “I have exactly the right skills. I love swimming in big data.”\n\nThe equation may be better suited to math wonks, but Frank takes liberties in his presentation with snappy lines that succinctly – and inaccurately – describe his findings.\n\n“America was stolen by an Excel spreadsheet,” he told the crowd at a North Carolina event.\n\nIn Idaho, he explained his theory on phantom voters: “They are inflating our registration rolls, stuffing phantom ballots and then cleaning it up afterwards. It’s that simple.”\n\nHe has even absurdly claimed his discoveries could land Trump back in the Oval Office.\n\n“I’d like the country to stand up and say, ‘Wow, this thing was ripped off. Let’s do a do-over or let’s put Trump back in office,’ ” Frank said in an August interview on the Truth & Liberty livecast.\n\nGrimmer, the Stanford University professor, said Frank has a way of wooing crowds with his professorial demeanor but that ultimately his conclusions are meaningless.\n\n“I think this took my research group an afternoon. You uncover that there’s no basis for this,” said Grimmer, who looked at data for 42 states and found that Frank’s assessments do not provide any evidence of voter fraud. “But if you’re not someone who, like me, spends all day working on statistics and data, six order polynomials and nearly perfect correlations — it sounds like he’s uncovered something really impressive.”\n\nFrank uses the number of registered voters by age group and prior voter trends to predict voter turnout, then claims it is evidence of fraud when it aligns with actual voter turnout. Put another way: Frank’s analysis finds that age groups with more people have more people who vote, which Frank then interprets as fraud, Grimmer said.\n\n“Effectively, what he’s doing is he’s discovered that anything that you go out and measure in the world is closely related to itself,” Grimmer said.\n\nAside from Frank’s flawed interpretation of the math, there are extensive election security protocols in place that would prevent the kind of widespread hacking and phantom vote-stuffing that Frank has described.\n\n“If you even change a period, a period in the election programming, it sends up a red flag that immediately stops the entire process until we can identify what would have triggered that red flag,” said Isabel Longoria, the elections administrator for Harris County – the most populous county in Texas and home to some 2.5 million voters.\n\nIn Harris County alone, election officials inspect thousands of voting machines – repeatedly – in the months leading up to elections.\n\n“Six months out, we start checking all 13,000 pieces of voting equipment in Harris County, opening them up, do they turn on? Have they been tampered with? Can we take them to a voting location? Are all the buttons working?” Longoria said.\n\nElection officials run accuracy tests on the machines under the watchful eyes of bipartisan observers. On Election Day, officials track the number of people showing up to vote and the number of ballots cast – one of the many safeguards that would catch an election inflated by phantom voters, according to Longoria.\n\nLongoria said she is required by law to update the voter rolls daily, and she noted that it would be effectively impossible for even a coordinated group to break in and inflate the voters rolls in each individual county.\n\n“Breaking into multiple buildings, multiple systems in tandem, with not a single red flag going off in this incredibly sensitive system, all in unison, right? As you have all eyes on elections from every election staff,” Longoria said.\n\nLongoria revealed little frustration as she ran through the extensive checks and balances in the election system and debunked a wide range of conspiracy theories.\n\n“I love answering these questions, and I love geeking out and getting all the details,” she said. “My job is to make sure that you can feel, as a voter, good and secure about our system.”\n\nSpreading the big lie nationwide\n\nWhen Lindell and Frank met with Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill on two occasions last year, Merrill said, it also didn’t take much effort for him to discredit their wild election claims.\n\n“Every time they gave us an example, we were able to refute what they showed us without even knowing what they were going to do when they arrived,” said Merrill, who’s a Republican.\n\nAddresses they claimed were stocked with phantom voters turned out to be facilities like apartment complexes or assisted living facilities, where multiple people resided and were registered to vote.\n\n“The information that they had been sharing with us could have been cleared up by doing a simple Google search of addresses,” Merrill said.\n\nFrank acknowledged that the Alabama presentation had been a “complete botch” and blamed it on a newly hired staffer working on his team.\n\nTo others, Frank’s presentation is fuel for their baseless suspicions that President Joe Biden wasn’t fairly elected.\n\n“Some people say we know that other states are wrong, but we think Kentucky must be right,” Kentucky state Sen. Adrienne Southworth said. “And I say, well, how do you know? And they have no idea. They just assume, and so I said, well, that’s kind of the problem.”\n\nSouthworth held an event featuring Frank and, after seeing his work, said she had come away more convinced that 2020 was problem-plagued.\n\n“I think the whole world is on the edge right now of – are we going to continue trusting the system?” Southworth said.\n\nKentucky was just one of the stops on Frank’s nationwide tour.\n\nIn Missouri, a “voter fraud is real bootcamp” featured Frank and a state representative, with a flyer calling on county clerks to attend.\n\nIn Colorado, Frank met with Tina Peters, the Mesa County clerk now under investigation by the FBI and others for her alleged involvement in a security breach of the county’s election system last year. Peters has defended her actions, claiming she conducted a backup of the voting system to preserve records.\n\nIn Montana, the Montana Free Press reported that Frank met with staffers for the state attorney general.\n\n“We’re going into each state – clandestinely – and I meet privately with legislators and secretaries of states and attorney generals,” Frank said at an event in Dallas last year.\n\nThis week, in his return to Texas, Frank appeared with a handful of candidates running for everything from county offices to Congress. He urged the crowd not to buy into the idea that Texas is becoming a battleground state, insisting “they” – Frank never identified who – were stocking the state voter rolls.\n\n“They’re getting ready to switch you purple,” Frank said. “Don’t believe it. You’re red.”\n\nAfter his pitch to Lone Star State voters, he sat down for his interview with CNN and defended his efforts to undermine confidence in America’s elections.\n\n“It’ll be a constitutional crisis. It will be a crisis. It’s going to happen. It’s inevitable. It’s going to happen. And I’m helping that happen. Yes,” Frank said.", "authors": ["Sara Murray Jeff Simon", "Sara Murray", "Jeff Simon"], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/19/politics/donald-trump-jd-vance-ohio-rally/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump humiliated J.D. Vance for fun at Ohio rally | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump needs you to know that Republican candidates don’t just like him, they love him. And they need him. Badly.\n\nAt a rally on Saturday night for Ohio GOP Senate nominee J.D. Vance, Trump made sure the crowd knew that Vance was subservient to him – big time.\n\n“J.D. is kissing my ass he wants my support so bad,” Trump said.\n\nTrump was reacting to a New York Times story that reported Vance had not actually invited Trump to campaign with him in the state. Instead, Trump’s team had simply told Vance that they would be coming to Ohio for a rally.\n\nTrump’s campaign stops have always been, primarily, about Trump. You can tell that by the amount of time he spends talking about himself (a lot) versus how much time he spends talking about the candidate for whom he is ostensibly campaigning (very little).\n\nBut he has rarely thrown a candidate he endorsed so directly under the bus as he did Vance over the weekend. “He made J.D. Vance look like a mouse, not a man,” former Virginia Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock told CNN of the moment. “It was humiliating.”\n\nComstock is right. It’s hard to see Trump’s characterization of Vance as little more than a lackey benefiting him in his surprisingly competitive race against Democrat Tim Ryan this fall. Even for those voters who like Trump, the portrayal of Vance as little more than a lickspittle isn’t terribly appealing.\n\nBut that’s not what Trump cares about. Not really.\n\nSure, he visited Ohio to campaign for Vance – at least on the surface. But what Trump is really doing is burnishing his own brand – and basking in the adulation of his most dogged supporters. To quote Trump from more than three decades ago: “The show is Trump, and it is sold-out performances everywhere.”\n\nThat’s what you always have to remember when you are trying to understand the strategy or motivation behind something Trump does. Trump is all about Trump – first, last and forever.\n\nAnd so, the most important thing Trump wanted to get across to those in attendance in Ohio over the weekend is not why they should vote for Vance. It’s that he remains uber-popular among Republicans and that every GOP candidate – Vance included – is desperate to have his endorsement.\n\nThat such an argument is belittling to Vance and makes him look both small and desperate is of no concern for Trump. The key (and only) concern is how does it make Trump look – strong, powerful and still very much coveted.\n\nThat’s all that matters.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/election-security-midterms-cyber-command/index.html", "title": "Cyber Command says US 'actively defending against foreign ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nUS military and intelligence officials are stepping up their efforts to defend the electoral process from foreign hacking and disinformation as the November midterms approach, officials said Thursday.\n\nOfficials are “actively defending against foreign interference and influence operations in U.S. elections,” US Cyber Command and the National Security Agency said in a statement, “specifically by focusing on how adversaries seek to undermine U.S. interests and prosperity, the will to vote of the populace, as well as their belief in the sanctity and security of their elections.”\n\nUS intelligence officials are warning that Russia, China and Iran may seek to interfere in the US voting process or shape voters’ perceptions, according to the command.\n\nAsked last month whether the war in Ukraine may distract Russia from interfering in the US midterm elections, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he was “quite confident the Russians can walk and chew gum” and that US officials were preparing accordingly.\n\nUS officials also “have to be concerned about hybrid threats,” Wray said at a cybersecurity conference at Fordham University in New York. That includes a situation in which foreign operatives might use an “unremarkable cyber incident” to sow “panic or lack of confidence in our election infrastructure,” Wray said.\n\nIn a separate intelligence bulletin sent to state and local officials this week, the Department of Homeland Security said Russia will likely continue to use its hacking and information operation capabilities to undercut trust in US public institutions and sow discord in the US.\n\nThe DHS analysis, obtained by CNN, focuses on Russia’s broader cyber activity against various sectors and not specifically on elections.\n\n“Moscow will continue to seek new methods of circumventing US social media companies’ anti-disinformation activities to further expand its narratives globally,” the memo says.\n\nFacing a rise in violent threats, election officials are under intense pressure as the midterm vote approaches. In addition to any foreign interference, election officials will have to contend with extensive mis- and disinformation about election integrity spread by Americans, many who falsely claim that President Joe Biden was not legitimately elected.\n\nCyber Command is the US military’s offensive and defense cyber unit that has since 2018 increasingly focused on protecting elections from foreign meddling. The command and the NSA, the US signals intelligence agency, again formed an election-security focused team to be on the hunt for foreign threats, as they did in 2020.\n\nThe Cyber Command-NSA Election Security Group “continues to increase information-sharing of cyber threats and insights with industry and interagency counterparts,” Maj. Katrina Cheesman, a spokesperson for the group, told CNN. “We are complementing efforts of industry through identifying and attributing foreign malicious behavior,”’ and sharing insights on the activity with non-government partners, Cheesman added.\n\nCyber Command did not go into detail in its statement Thursday on recent operations it has conducted to defend US elections, but its past work has included knocking offline a Russian troll farm spouting disinformation during the 2018 election.\n\nUS military and intelligence officials have gotten more involved, along with the Department of Homeland Security, in trying to thwart foreign hacking and influence operations following the 2016 presidential election. That year, Russian military intelligence operatives hacked and leaked emails belonging to the Democratic party in an effort to undermine Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, according to US intelligence reports.\n\nFederal and state and local officials now regularly drill for hacking and information operations that could interfere with the vote. Last week, officials from across the country held one such drill involving an array of hypothetical threats to election operations.\n\n“The nation’s election officials face a range of challenges, including cyber and physical risks to their infrastructure, and false election information that weaken voters’ trust in the process,” US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly and other federal and state officials said in a joint statement after the exercise.", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}]}

The objectives for the crew's five-day stay aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule include:\n\nReach altitudes higher than any human has traveled since NASA’s Apollo lunar program came to an end in the 1970s: The Dragon will tread a path that will take the crew high enough for the vehicle to travel through a treacherous radiation belt 870 miles from Earth's surface – or more than three times higher than the International Space Station.\n\nThe Dragon will tread a path that will take the crew high enough for the vehicle to travel through a treacherous radiation belt 870 miles from Earth's surface – or more than three times higher than the International Space Station.

The mission, which Isaacman self-funded, saw four civilians head to space for three days in orbit, raising more than $250 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n\nWith more than 7,000 flight hours of aviation experience, Isaacman is also an aviation enthusiast who is qualified to fly military fighter jets.\n\nMeet the rest of the Polaris Dawn crew\n\nIsaacman will lead a crew that includes a pilot and two mission specialists.\n\nPilot Scott “Kidd” Poteet ,\n\nMission specialist Sarah Gillis, a Colorado native who is a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX, where she is responsible for overseeing the company’s astronaut training program.

But as had happened so often already with this mission, there was one more delay, as the capsule departed 15 minutes past the original planned departure time of 8:55 pm EST, as the capsule occupants dealt with minor communications issues.\n\nNASA\n\nThey will spend about one day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida around 1 pm ET Monday.\n\nAX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays extended the mission by about a week.\n\nDuring their first 12 days on the space station, the group stuck to a regimented schedule, which included about 14 hours per day of activities, including scientific research that was designed by various research hospitals, universities, tech companies and more. They also spent time doing outreach events by video conferencing with children and students.\n\nThe weather delays then afforded to them “a bit more time to absorb the remarkable views of the blue planet and review the vast amount of work that was successfully completed during the mission,” according to Axiom.\n\nIt’s not clear how much this mission cost. Axiom previously disclosed a price of $55 million per seat for a 10-day trip to the ISS, but the company declined to comment on the financial terms for this specific mission beyond saying in a press conference last year that the price is in the “tens of millions.”\n\nThe mission has been made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated.

Getting provisions to and from the space station for a commercial crew is another $88,000 to $164,000 per person, per day.\n\nBut the extra days the AX-1 crew spent in space due to weather won’t add to their own personal overall price tag, according to a statement from NASA.\n\n“Knowing that International Space Station mission objectives like the recently conducted Russian spacewalk or weather challenges could result in a delayed undock, NASA negotiated the contract with a strategy that does not require reimbursement for additional undock delays,” the statement reads.\n\nIt’s not the first time paying customers or otherwise non-astronauts have visited the ISS, as Russia has sold seats on its Soyuz spacecraft to various wealthy thrill seekers in years past.\n\nThe 11-person crew aboard the International Space Station on April 9, 2022.

She and the Polaris Dawn crew will also sign and auction off the book to support St. Jude.\n\nBack in the days when both Anna Menon and her husband worked at SpaceX, the couple would spend daily commutes regaling their two children with fanciful stories.\n\nThe kids would soon be dropped off at daycare, and mom and dad would then head to SpaceX headquarters, at the time still located in the Los Angeles area. But despite the time the family spent apart, those stories they shared every day before separating became a meaningful way for them to remain connected.\n\nIn recent years, Menon found herself reflecting on those nostalgic memories as she trained for a journey that will in the coming days take her further from her family than she's ever been before. As she prepared to head to outer space as part of the all-civilian Polaris Dawn crew, Menon found yet another way to stay tethered to her kids back on Earth.\n\nEarlier this year, Menon co-authored a children's book, \"Kisses from Space,\" that stemmed from her desire to share her cosmic adventures with her two young children. Menon has shared the book with her son and daughter many times already, but when she launches next week on a SpaceX Dragon capsule, she plans to read the book to them from all the way in orbit.\n\n“It’s a story of how love can overcome any distance,\" Menon said in a phone interview with USA TODAY after arriving this week at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida to prepare for the launch. \"And, it’s a story I wrote for my kids, ultimately.”\n\nPolaris Dawn:SpaceX is about to launch a billionaire and 3 others into orbit on civilian mission\n\nAnna Menon writes children's book based on Polaris Dawn experience\n\n\"Kisses from Space\" tells the story of a mother dragon who returns home to her children after an out-of-this-world adventure. While the dragon characters are familiar to her children from those long-ago commutes, the story itself is a new one – inspired, of course, by Menon's own experience preparing for Polaris Dawn.\n\n“Those stories became wonderful connection points for us as we were apart for most of our days,” Menon recalled of the tales she would make up with her husband Anil Menon, who is now a NASA astronaut (the family has since relocated to Houston.)\n\nWhile training for Polaris Dawn, Menon shared her idea of authoring a children's book with Jared Isaacman, the billionaire entrepreneur funding the mission along with SpaceX. With Isaacman's support, Menon recruited her cousin Keri Vasek to co-author the story with her and award-winning illustrator Andy Harkness to create the visuals.\n\n\"Kisses from Space\" was published June 4 by Random House Books for Young Readers. Written in whimsical rhyme, the story of a mother's unwavering love and devotion to her children is one Menon believes is relatable for any parents who have been away from their kids, even if it wasn't as distant as outer space.\n\n“It was just an entirely special process to get to write this book with Keri,\" Menon said. \"It's a message that I do want to come across to my kids, but it’s a message that lots of people around the world can relate to.”\n\nMenon to read 'Kisses from Space' while in orbit\n\nMenon arrived and entered quarantine with her family Monday at the Kennedy Space Center as she and the other crew members make the final preparations before launch, which is scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nBut when the four-member crew under Isaacman's command rocket into the upper reaches of Earth's orbit, Menon's family will of course stay behind. To remind her children – James, 6, and Grace, 4 – that mom is still thinking of them, Menon plans to read \"Kisses from Space\" to them from the spacecraft on the second day of the mission.\n\nVideo of the book reading will be beamed live to her children, as well as some youngsters at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, before it is presented to the public at a later time, Menon said.\n\nThe copy of the book that Menon is reading in orbit will be signed by all four Polaris Dawn crew members and auctioned off to benefit St. Jude.\n\nWhat to know about the Polaris Dawn mission\n\nThe first of three human spaceflights under the Polaris Program, Polaris Dawn is meant to test SpaceX technology to set the stage for future deep space exploration as NASA and other space agencies set their sights on destinations like Mars.\n\nThe Polaris Dawn crew will spend five days in orbit before reentering Earth's atmosphere on day six and splashing down at one of seven sites off the Florida coast.\n\nWhen the crew launches, they will reach an altitude of 870 miles above Earth's surface – higher than any human has traveled since NASA’s Apollo lunar program in the 1970s – before descending to a new cruising orbit about 435 miles above Earth. The treacherous path will take the crew through the Van Allen radiation belts – or more than three times higher than the International Space Station.\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew will complete some 40 scientific experiments – many of which are to understand the human body's reaction to long spaceflights – and test a new laser-based satellite communication system using Starlink.\n\nThe crew will also attempt to become the first-ever private citizens to conduct a spacewalk, opening the Dragon's hatch to expose themselves to the vacuum of space.\n\nAnna Menon's role on Polaris Dawn crew\n\nThe spacewalk maneuver is an incredibly risky one, but Menon, a mission specialist and medical officer for Polaris Dawn, didn't appear rattled at the prospect of it.\n\nUntil now, spacewalks have only ever been conducted by government astronauts. And because most spacecraft have airlocks, conducting one does not typically require depressurizing the entire capsule.\n\nBut because the Dragon does not have an airlock, the entire spacecraft will have to be depressurized before the hatch is opened, exposing all four crew members to the vacuum of space. For this reason Menon and her crewmates will all be wearing Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) suits designed by SpaceX to receive oxygen through tethers.\n\n\"There's been a tremendous amount of preparation that’s gone into this by the SpaceX team,\" she said.\n\nFor Menon, the upcoming trip to orbit is her first, despite working at SpaceX since 2018 as a lead operations engineer and serving in mission control during multiple crewed missions.\n\nBecause Anil only recently became a graduate of NASA's astronaut program, Menon is also the first in her family to head to space.\n\n“I’m incredibly honored to get to go and really thrilled to have the opportunity,\" Menon said. \"It was a dream from a young age and I never thought it would happen.”\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The group includes American DJ Steve Aoki and popular space YouTuber Tim Dodd, better known as the Everyday Astronaut.\n\nThe mission, called Dear Moon, was first announced in 2018. Maezawa initially aimed to take a group of artists with him on a six-day trip around the moon but later announced he had expanded his definition of an “artist.” Instead, he said he would be open to people from all walks of life as long as they viewed themselves as artists, Maezawa said in a video announcement last year.\n\nJoining Maezawa, Aoki and Dodd will be Czech multidisciplinary artist Yemi A.D., Irish photographer Rhiannon Adam, photographer Karim Iliya, Indian actor Dev Joshi, documentary filmmaker Brendan Hall and South Korean rapper Choi Seung Hyun, who goes by the stage name T.O.P.\n\n“I can’t miss this opportunity,” Aoki said in a video announcement. “My soul is, is begging for this.”\n\nA backup crew of US Olympic snowboarder Kaitlyn Farrington and Japanese dancer Miyu was also selected.\n\nDear Moon still advertises that its mission will take off in 2023, though SpaceX’s new rocket and spacecraft system, known as Starship, has yet to conduct its first orbital test flight.\n\nMaezawa is paying an undisclosed sum for the trip, and he has said he will take his passengers free of charge.\n\nThere were two main criteria for selecting Maezawa’s fellow passengers, the mission’s website noted: Applicants should be seeking to “push the envelope” in their field of work by going to space “to help other people and greater society in some way,” and they should be willing to support their fellow crew members during the journey.\n\nThe Dear Moon mission crew includes (clockwise from top left): Tim Dodd, Yemi A.D., Choi Seung Hyun, Steve Aoki, Rhiannon Adam, Karim Iliya, Miyu (backup), Dev Joshi, Yusaku Maezawa, Brendan Hall and Kaitlyn Farrington (backup). (Courtesy dearMoon) Courtesy dearMoon\n\nAt one point last year, Maezawa had also said he would also use a dating show to search for a “life partner” that would join him on the journey. But he later canceled those plans, saying he had “mixed feelings” about participating in the endeavor.\n\nSince the Dear Moon mission was first announced, Maezawa made his first journey to space, taking a self-funded, 12-day journey to the International Space Station. That December 2021 trip made use of a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.\n\nStarship is a work in progress\n\nSpaceX’s massive Starship rocket is still in development at the company’s testing facilities in South Texas. A few early prototypes have conducted brief “hop tests,” some of which have flown a few miles above Earth, but the company has not yet tested Super Heavy, a gargantuan, 230-foot (69-meter) rocket booster that will be needed to propel the 164-foot (50-meter) Starship spacecraft into Earth’s orbit or beyond. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said for months that it’ll be prepared to conduct the test soon, though the company is still waiting on a launch license from federal regulators.\n\nMusk had previously said he expects Starship will be conducting regular flights by 2023, but it’s not clear if SpaceX will hit that deadline. The aerospace industry is notorious for projects that take far longer — and tally much higher expenses — than first anticipated.\n\nIf early test flights of Starship are successful and the Dear Moon mission gets off the ground, Maezawa’s crew could be the first group of private citizens to venture beyond low-Earth orbit.\n\nThe six-day mission is expected to spend three days reaching its destination and take a slingshot trip around the moon before returning to Earth.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/tech/spacex-ax-1-splashdown-monday-scn/index.html", "title": "All-private SpaceX astronaut mission splashes down successfully ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe first all-private mission to the International Space Station finally made its way home Monday, making a splash down landing off the coast of Florida and concluding a mission that has lasted a week longer than expected.\n\nThis mission was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space.

Inside the spacecraft cabin, the passengers were protected by a heat shield and the temperature should’ve stayed below 85 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe Crew Dragon then deployed sets of parachutes as it plummeted toward the Atlantic Ocean.

They both leaned on the machine for a moment, mesmerized by the biplane teasing the clouds overhead. Only one question could break the spell.\n\n\"You want to go up, Bud?\" his father said. Eight-year-old John Herschel Glenn Jr., said \"yes.\"\n\nThen, it was just one small word from one small boy in one small town in Ohio. One second during one day of a lifetime that lasted more than 34,600 days.\n\nBut that word, \"yes,\" took Glenn and his father to the backseat of that cockpit, down a bumpy strip and into the wild blue above the land he always called home.\n\nIt took him to his first flight. His first adventure. His first of many firsts.\n\nAre you smarter than an astronaut? Take this quiz\n\nBut Glenn's groundbreaking hours in the sky were just the first of more than 22,000 hours – and counting – logged in space by someone from our state. The first of 78 successful missions, too.\n\nOne of the original seven, the Cambridge native is also just one name now on the list of 25 astronauts hailing from the Buckeye State. Ohio boasts a \"statistically significant\" number of astronauts, said Bill Barry, NASA chief historian, whose achievements add up to \"a huge legacy for NASA.\"\n\nGlenn, who died in Columbus Dec. 8, will always be one of our brightest stars. Depending on who you ask, his stature may only be eclipsed by another certain astronaut born nine years later and less than 200 miles away from Glenn's birthplace.\n\nAlmost 33 years after he circled his hometown in a WACO plane on that summer day, Glenn's first 4 hours and 56 minutes in space made him the first American astronaut to orbit Earth. And 36 years after that, the 213 hours and 44 minutes Glenn spent on the shuttle Discovery made him, at 77, the oldest person to fly in space.\n\nOur down-to-Earth explorer's otherworldly feats are just a segment of his lifelong service to the world he never really left behind. Just one of many reasons why the war hero, astronaut and popular U.S. senator will lie in state in the Ohio Statehouse rotunda Friday. Why his memorial service Saturday has to be held at Ohio State University, one of the largest in the country.\n\nThe elite Ohio fraternity Glenn founded, however, can claim more superlatives than what's bold in his biography. There's Neil Armstrong, the boy from Wapakoneta who became the first man who stepped on the moon, of course.\n\nThere's also Mansfield's Michael L. Gernhardt, who performed the first U.S. space walk from the International Space Station in 2001.\n\nSunita Williams also belongs to Ohio. The Euclid native already holds the record for total cumulative spacewalk time by a female astronaut. And she's set to be one of the first astronauts to lead the upcoming U.S. commercial spaceflights, ensuring that Ohio's banner will be carried into the next era of space travel.\n\nBut how was Ohio there from the very beginning, from the moment of our country's space program launch? What is it about this place that made a boy nicknamed Bud the legend we now call Sen. John Glenn?\n\nAnd why was it, when the inventors of human flight looked toward the heavens, they saw the Ohio sky?\n\nMore than can fit on a license plate\n\nGlenn already helped answer one of these questions.\n\nActually, it's inside one of the very first answers he gave the afternoon of April 9, 1959. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration held a press conference that day in Washington, D.C., to introduce the Mercury 7, the almost one-year-old program's starting lineup in the intensifying Space Race against the Soviet Union.\n\nA reporter asked what motivated each of these volunteers, all men with military backgrounds and most of whom hailed from small towns. A certain Lt. Col. Glenn, as the 37-year-old Marine was called then, included.\n\nBorn in Cambridge, Glenn grew up in nearby New Concord, home to just 2,126 others when he spoke into that microphone.\n\nAnd when he answered what motivated him, he traveled back there. He compared his experience to that of two Ohio-based brothers who once stood at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, \"pitching a coin to see who was going to shove the other one off the hill down there.\"\n\n\"I think we stand on the verge of something as big and as expansive as that was 50 years ago,\" he added.\n\nGlenn wasn't the first or the last kid from Ohio who idolized Wilbur and Orville Wright, the inventors of the first successful airplane. He wasn't the first or last who held a tiny version of their innovation out a window of a cruising car and dreamed about being born with the last name Wright.\n\nThe brothers are on all of our cars today, by way of those \"Birthplace of Aviation\" plates. It's still a statewide brand and bragging right.\n\nEven though Wilbur was actually born in Millville, Indiana, four years before Orville was born in Dayton.\n\nBut that Indiana footnote doesn't change the story for Tom Crouch, senior curator of the Aeronautics Department for the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.\n\n\"If the Wrights had been born in Kitty Hawk, they never would have invented the airplane,\" Crouch said, who happens to also be from Ohio. Dayton, of course.\n\nThe architects of aviation, he said, had to hail from a city. Not some isolated coastal community like Kitty Hawk. A place with a hardware store around the corner, a machine shop down the block. A place still occupied by the Industrial Revolution.\n\nA place just like Dayton at the turn of the 20th century. \"Technology was in the air that people breathed,\" he said.\n\nIt was the atmosphere that hovered over much of Ohio, actually.\n\nAlmost 70 years before Orville Wright piloted a 12-second flight on the North Carolina coast, an experimenter named A. Masson displayed his flying machine, something he dubbed an aerial steamboat, on Race Street in Cincinnati. There's no evidence the mysterious aircraft ever left the surface of the Earth, according to Crouch's research.\n\nBut Masson's attempt is still important evidence: It demonstrates that human flight was viewed as a mechanical problem that required a mechanical solution. So it had to be an engineer, a technician, who would be the first to meet the sky, Crouch noted.\n\nSomeone who worked at places like The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company near Akron or the GE Aviation in Evendale. Someone like Wilbur and Orville Wright, whose first company was a printing press that published two newspapers.\n\nChris Burton, executive director of the Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta, traces ancestry of our astronauts back even further, beyond Glenn, beyond the Wrights.\n\n\"It's not just about pilots and aviation,\" he said. \"It's about scientific endeavors.\" Imagination and education powers ingenuity. And Ohio's got plenty of both.\n\nWe claim one of the most prolific minds of the modern age, Thomas Edison. One of the oldest universities in the United States, too. That's Ohio University, founded in 1804, just a year after the western territory became the state.\n\nIn Ohio, \"if you were creative or figured out a better way to do something, you would be rewarded for it,\" Burton said.\n\nBuilding on a strong foundation\n\nThis structure of the mind built the self-sustaining infrastructure of industry here, from the universities and other government assets, to the private companies and entertainment outlets.\n\nIn 1938, that also meant the Cleveland National Air Show. And 17-year-old Glenn was there, with his father. The two of them, again, stared at the sky, entranced by the stunt pilots racing at speeds more than 280 miles per hour, banking dramatically, dangerously, around the course's high pylons.\n\n\"I loved the roar of those engines and sheer speed of the planes ... flying beckoned me as never before,\" Glenn wrote in \"John Glenn: A Memoir,\" published in 1999.\n\nBut these demonstrations were more than adrenaline-fueled fun. These early aviators pushed the limits of human flight, said David DeFelice. Their vital research and development just so happened to be paid for by the price of admission.\n\nDeFelice should know. He now works in the office of communication and external relations at the NASA Glenn Research Center, just outside of Cleveland. The parking lot there was once the air show field. You can still see its outlines from the sky, he said.\n\nThe center, founded in 1942, continues that community's tradition of cutting-edge research, continues to live in the future. Except instead of challenging the limits of physics to win a trophy, scientists there now strive to create technologies that are more economically and environmentally friendly, DeFelice said.\n\nOriginally called the NACA Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory, the organization notably developed the Centaur, a high-energy rocket that burned both liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. It propelled major NASA milestones. We wouldn't have made it to the moon without it, for one.\n\nAnd it may activate future discoveries: The Centaur is still in use.\n\nSome 200 miles south of the research center, the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base exists in a similarly exceptional timeline, one that extends from a prestigious past to the dreams of today.\n\nHuffman Prairie is there, the flat grassy field where the Wright brothers tested plane design and trained hundreds of pilots.\n\nThe base outside of Fairborn also houses the Air Force Research Laboratory. In early 1959, lab tests there were part of the process that pared down 508 astronaut candidates to 110. Then 32. Then 18. And finally, seven.\n\nThe research there also shaped the overall program, said Doug Lantry, curator at the National Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton. The work explored the man in manned space travel. The tests were designed to not only make sure the human fit the machine, but the machine fit the human.\n\nAt Wright-Patterson, scientists violently shook Glenn and his six cohorts, all strapped down in seats and asked to read written instructions.\n\nThey dropped the seven guinea pigs from high elevations. Heated them up and cooled them down. Blasted them with noise. And then listened to their hearts.\n\nThese extremes conditions were all part of the effort to replicate what scientists guessed would be the physical experience of traveling, weightless in a cramped capsule, at 17,000 mph around the Earth.\n\nTo keep them safe out there and to bring them back home.\n\nFor Glenn, that meant here.\n\nThe matters of the mind\n\nThe examinations had other results not measured in the records.\n\nThe program also aimed to enhance their mental well-being, to enhance their confidence in the mechanics and the math. They all shook hands with the scientists who launched them into space. That meant that Glenn not only watched this new science unfolding, he got to tend it himself, influence the specifics of the progress. He earned an engineering degree from Muskingum College in New Concord, after all.\n\nGlenn had developed \"The Right Stuff,\" as Tom Wolfe called it in his 1979 book about the experimental pilots of the U.S. space program, long before his time at the lab in 1959.\n\nFor Lantry, it's \"habits of thought,\" noting that Ohio has a tradition of \"developing the right people with the right outlook\" for this line of work.\n\nThat outlook, well, looks a lot like the attitude and the aptitude associated with America's heartland.\n\nNASA Chief Historian Bill Barry said the space program officials didn't intentionally select the majority of the seven first-generation astronauts from small towns in what we now call flyover country, from Shawnee, Oklahoma, to Sparta, Wisconsin, to New Concord, Ohio. Five hometowns that, even when added together, represented just .03 percent of the United States' 180 million population at the time.\n\nBut a childhood back-dropped by rural America did cultivate the type of skills that kept those fighter pilots alive in combat. Like discipline and dexterity.\n\nIn New Concord, he was that boy named Bud who shot rabbits to feed his family during the Depression. Later, he harvested rhubarb and washed cars, saving each nickel and dime for that new bike. He lettered in every sport he played in high school: tennis, basketball and football.\n\nAnd character counted. On the program's personality test, officials asked candidates if they ever feel like cursing. (No, was the likely correct answer.) Glenn and the rest of the Mercury 7 were introduced as \"family men\" during that 1959 press conference.\n\nIn those first days of NASA, the astronauts were ambassadors, flag-wrapped symbols of hope and the promise of the American ambition.\n\nWe weren't just trying to beat the Soviet Union, then setting the pace with space records. We were trying to guarantee survival, the proliferation of our way of life. The triumph of capitalism over socialism. Because success in space also meant protection from the atomic annihilation of our country. And the fear of the big bomb gripped everyday Americans every day.\n\nWe looked around for heroes and we found the Mercury 7, \"the new, modern knights,\" Barry said.\n\nThey were an unprecedented pop culture phenomenon, an irresistible hybrid of the American cowboy with the matinee idol. And freckle-faced Glenn, with his charming humor and quiet strength, was a leading man.\n\nGlenn, and later Armstrong, \"were two men who were absolute straight arrows, as honest as the day is long,\" the Smithsonian's Crouch said. These two Ohioans represented American virtues that Americans have always had, to \"an extraordinary degree,\" he said.\n\nGlenn belongs to this world and the one beyond it now. But his gravity, that legendary magnetism, feels stronger at home.\n\nBecoming an astronaut doesn't feel so far-fetched here. It's not just a Halloween costume or a fading childhood fantasy.\n\nIt's real people, 25 real people who are like us. At least in one way.\n\nGregory H. Johnson was born in 1962, just months after Glenn orbited the Earth in Friendship 7. In 1980, he graduated from high school in Fairborn, in the shadow of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\n\nToday, he's one of the 25 NASA astronauts who list Ohio in their official biography.\n\nBut on the night of July 20, 1969, he is a seven-year-old watching a black-and-white TV set in his grandmother's living room. After about 11 p.m., he sprints to the backyard with his brother and sister.\n\nThey are all looking at the crescent moon. They are all looking for Neil Armstrong.\n\nJohnson finds something else.\n\nI'm going to be an astronaut, he says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/08/alien-ufo-mothership-none-found-pentagon-report/72897245007/", "title": "Alien, UFO mothership is not being hidden from you: Pentagon report", "text": "WASHINGTON – Nothing to see here. The Pentagon, after an extensive probe, found no evidence of aliens or extraterrestrial technology on Earth.\n\nIn a conclusion sure to rile conspiracy theorists everywhere, the Pentagon review found there is no reason to believe the U.S. government is hiding information about extraterrestrial visits.\n\nThe findings, sent to Congress as part of a mandated review, are the most extensive rebuttal that the Department of Defense has issued in response to claims that it is covering up alien visits to Earth.\n\nAs with practically everything else originating from the U.S. military, the new report has a wonky name and comes from a wonky office. It’s called the “Report on the Historical Record of U.S. Government Involvement with Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) Volume I,” and comes from the Pentagon’s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, dated February 2024.\n\nBut the report is a very serious effort, based on an exhaustive all-source review, to put to rest the notion that the Pentagon − or anyone else in or working for the U.S. government − is hiding anything when it comes to visits from outer space.\n\nNope, aliens were not found in Florida:Extraterrestrial life in Miami? No, police say viral video shows human being | Fact check\n\n“To date, AARO has found no verifiable evidence for claims that the U.S. government and private companies have access to or have been reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology,” Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement accompanying the report. “Also, AARO has found no evidence that any U.S. government investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.”\n\n“All investigative efforts, at all levels of classification, concluded that most sightings were ordinary objects and phenomena and the result of misidentification,” Ryder added, while also emphasizing that military and civilian authorities will continue to investigate all of the many claims about alien visits.\n\n“As AARO has said before,” Ryder said, “they will follow the evidence where it leads, wherever it leads.”\n\nSpy planes, balloons, and other anomalies\n\nThe 63-page report looked into all information available, and was designed to take into account a broad array of potential anomalies generated by new − and old − technologies. That includes spy planes and balloons used by friendly and hostile nations, military and civilian drones and satellites and even more recreational types of airborne vehicles.\n\nThe report, as exhaustive and conclusive as the Pentagon says it is, is unlikely to quell all suspicions that it is hiding something about the existence of UAPs, its authors acknowledged.\n\nThey cited the increasing attention paid to aliens and UFOS, and widespread distrust of the government.\n\nLast July 26, Congress held a hearing on the issue of UAPs, where lawmakers and a large crowd of spectators listened as a former Air Force intelligence officer testified that the U.S. government is concealing a longstanding program that retrieves and reverse engineers unidentified flying objects.\n\nThe Pentagon has denied the claims made by retired Maj. David Grusch. But his testimony before the House Oversight subcommittee made international headlines.\n\nAccording to an AP report on the hearing, Grusch testified that he was asked in 2019 by the head of a government task force on UAPs to identify all highly classified programs relating to UAPs. At the time, Grusch said, he was detailed to the National Reconnaissance Office, the agency that operates U.S. spy satellites.\n\n“I was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program to which I was denied access,” Grusch told lawmakers. He also said the U.S. government likely has been aware of “non-human” extraterrestrial activity since the 1930s.\n\nThe report released Friday did not mention Grusch by name. But it said that in completing it, the AARO “reviewed all official USG (U.S. government) investigatory efforts since 1945, researched classified and unclassified archives, conducted approximately 30 interviews, and partnered with Intelligence Community (IC) and Department of Defense (DoD) officials responsible for controlled and special access program oversight, respectively.”\n\nThe Pentagon also said the AARO will publish a Volume II − also in accordance with its mandate under the National Defense Authorization Act − that will provide analysis of any information acquired by AARO after the date of the publication of Volume I.\n\nReport unlikely to satisfy everyone: Pentagon\n\nThe report’s findings are unlikely to satisfy everyone, especially those in the community of conspiracy theorists and other independent investigators who think any denials are part of the cover-up, the report’s authors acknowledge. Some are insistent, for instance, that the government has a secret site where it is exploiting downed extraterrestrial craft, which it says it investigated and came up empty.\n\n“A consistent theme in popular culture involves a particularly persistent narrative that the USG (U.S. government) – or a secretive organization within it – recovered several off-world spacecraft and extraterrestrial biological remains … and that it has conspired since the 1940s to keep this effort hidden from the United States Congress and the American public,” the report stated.\n\nBut to drive home its findings, it included details of past investigations, beginning with Project Saucer in 1946 and Projects Sign, Grudge, Twinkle, Bear and Blue Book over the decades that followed.\n\nAn 'obsession' with UFOs dating back more than half a century\n\nAmerica’s “obsession” with UFOs began in 1947, “when two headline-making sightings of strange flying objects prompt the U.S. Air Force’s newly formed Department of Defense to create a series of secret programs to determine how unidentified phenomena may pose a threat to national security,” according to a new – and apparently perfectly timed – book on the topic by journalist and historian Garrett Graff.\n\n“Over the next half-century, as the atomic age gives way to the space race and the Cold War, the mission continues, bringing together an unexpected group of astronomers, military officials, civilian contactees, and true believers who bring us closer, then further, then closer again, to answering one of our most enduring questions: What exactly is out there?” Graff writes in the book “UFO: The Inside Story of the US Government's Search for Alien Life Here – and Out There.”\n\nGraff was unavailable for immediate comment. But X, formerly known as Twitter, was already aflame with hot takes from people who questioned the new Pentagon report’s findings.\n\n“So the people doing the cover up of #ufo #uap say they find no cover up classic self-fulfilled prophesy,” said Tim Burchett, who described himself as a former Tennessee state legislator representing the state’s 2nd district.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/08"}]}

The driver drowned, but a woman who was riding in the car managed to climb on top of it and was rescued by a firefighter who waded into the water.\n\n“She came out the window.

The rainfall total at the Columbia Metropolitan Airport was 6.87 inches, the most rain that’s ever fallen there in one day.

Nikki Haley has said the deluge is the kind of storm seen only once in 1,000 years.\n\nOn Monday, she said 381 roads and 127 bridges were closed across the state, and 1,000 law enforcement officers and 1,000 transportation department personnel were working to make them safe.

It doesn’t take long for you to get in your car and realize you’ve got to turn back around,” Haley said in an interview on NBC’s “Today” show.\n\nThree people were killed Sunday, including a transportation worker who died overseeing work near downtown Columbia, a woman who was swept away in her SUV and the man who drove around the barricade Sunday night in the Lugoff community northeast of Columbia, said the coroner said.\n\nMcArthur Woods, 56, drowned after his car was inundated. His passenger was rescued when someone who heard her screams called 911 around 10 p.m. The woman was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nAuthorities weren’t able to recover Woods’ body until Monday morning.\n\nMore than two dozen shelters were open, Haley said. Utility crews, meanwhile, were working to restore power to 30,000 customers, she said.\n\nThe deluge made for otherworldly scenes in Columbia as floodwaters nearly touched the stoplights Sunday at one downtown intersection. Rainwater cascaded like a waterfall over jagged asphalt where a road sheered apart, and many cars were submerged under flooded streets.\n\nThe flooding forced hundreds of weekend rescues and threatened the drinking water supply for Columbia, with officials warning some could be without potable water for days because of water main breaks. The capital city told all 375,000 of its water customers to boil water before drinking.\n\nElsewhere, nearly 75 miles of Interstate 95 — the main link from the Southeast U.S. to the Northeast — was closed.\n\nAmong those rescued were a woman and baby lifted to safety by helicopter, but efforts were far from over.\n\nColumbia Police Chief William Holbrook issued a statement Monday saying search teams would check for any people still needing evacuation, and crews will mark the front doors of homes checked with a fluorescent orange X once searched.\n\nThose in distress should call 911 and they will be taken out on military vehicles and bused to shelters, he said.\n\nMany schools and colleges, including the University of South Carolina, canceled classes Monday and some businesses planned to stay shuttered. State climatologists have said the sun could peek out Tuesday.\n\nOne of the hardest hit areas in Columbia was near Gills Creek, where a weather station recorded more than 20 inches of rain — or nearly half the city’s average yearly rainfall — from Friday through Sunday. Shaw Air Force Base, east of Columbia, has seen more than 19 inches of rain over the last few days.\n\nRescue crews used boats on Sunday to evacuate the family of Jeff Whalen, whose house backs up on Gills Creek.\n\n“I got up around 6:15 and a neighbor called to tell us we should get out as soon as we can,” Whalen said. “About that point it was about a foot below the door and when we left it was a foot in the house. It came quickly obviously.”\n\nThe flooding also prompted acts of kindness in Columbia.\n\nRawlings LaMotte, 38, a residential real estate broker, said he and a friend got into a small motorboat and ended up ferrying several people to safety, including a man who had been out of town and found roads to his home blocked.\n\n“Until you’ve experienced something like this, you have no idea how bad it really is,” LaMotte said.\n\n———\n\nContributing to this report were Associated Press writers Bruce Smith in Charleston, South Carolina; Mitch Weiss in Greenville, South Carolina; Susanne Schafer in Columbia; Jonathan Drew in Raleigh, N.C.; and Meg Kinnard in Blythewood, South Carolina.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/960113/the-worlds-most-extreme-weather-events-in-2023", "title": "The world's most extreme weather events in 2023 | The Week UK", "text": "Wildfires, floods and heatwaves have continued to make headlines as communities across the world have had their homes and lives threatened by deadly weather conditions.\n\nThis year already \"seems destined to be remembered as the year that extreme weather events left the Northern Hemisphere reeling\", said National Geographic.

Action on climate change is no longer “a luxury but a must”, said Professor Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nHere are some of the extreme weather events the world has experienced in 2023.\n\nFreezing in Afghanistan\n\nBoys in Afghanistan shovel snow after wave of freezing temperatures (Image credit: Atif Aryan/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn January, Afghanistan saw temperatures plunge to -28C, well below average for the time of year and resulting in the deaths of 78 people and 77,000 livestock, according to CNN.\n\nThe sudden drop in temperature was attributed to polar vortex disruptions, said Al Jazeera, and \"compounded the misery of Afghans\", who are already \"suffering from an unprecedented humanitarian crisis\".\n\nFloods in California\n\nCalifornia has seen major flooding in the last few months (Image credit: Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nThe US had its third wettest January on record this year, according to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report.\n\nCalifornia was \"battered by an onslaught of 31 atmospheric river storms in a matter of months\", said the Los Angeles Times. The storms \"dumped record-setting snow across the Sierra Nevada and Southern California mountain ranges, breached levees and flooded communities\".\n\nWarm winter in Europe\n\nSki resorts across Europe had to close due to a lack of snow (Image credit: Lukas Kabon/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nEurope experienced its second warmest winter to date this year, according to data gathered by Copernicus Climate Change Service. A strong winter heat dome \"pounced\" on the continent, said The Washington Post, causing many ski resorts to temporarily close due to low snowfall.\n\nThe \"unusually mild\" temperatures \"offered some short-term relief to governments struggling with high gas prices\", said the Evening Standard, but \"posed risks to wildlife and agriculture\".\n\nCyclone Freddy\n\nCyclone Freddy has killed hundreds of people (Image credit: Amos Gumulira/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCyclone Freddy made landfall in southern Africa in February \"before circling back in March\", said Reuters. It \"left a trail of destruction in its wake after ripping through Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar\".\n\nMore than half a million people were displaced and more than two million affected by the storm, Malawi’s President Lazarus Chakwera said in April. The death toll, he said, had surpassed 1,000 by then.\n\nThe cyclone may prove to be \"the most energetic and long-lasting storm ever recorded\", said Space.com.\n\nFloods and landslides in Brazil\n\nParts of São Paul saw more than 680 millimeters of rainfall in one day (Image credit: Michael Dantas / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAt least 65 people were killed by landslides in São Paulo in southeastern Brazil in February that were triggered by torrential rainfall.\n\n\"Parts of the state saw more than 680 millimeters (26 inches) in a single day,\" according to Nasa. The heavy rainfall saturated hillsides, \"destabilising the soils and underlying bedrock\", said Nasa landslide expert Robert Emberson.\n\nThe following month a further mudslide killed eight people in Manaus, after a downpour \"drenched the region\", said La Prensa Latina.\n\nMonsoon in Malaysia\n\nA family wades through the flooded streets of Yong Peng, Malaysia (Image credit: Mohd Rasfan /AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMore than 40,000 residents were forced to flee their homes in southern Malaysia in March due to extreme flooding that claimed four lives.\n\nMonsoon season usually falls between November and March in the region, but this year's rains lingered and flooding continued, said Hawaii Public Radio. Experts blamed deforestation, over-development and climate change for the unprecedented amount of rainfall.\n\nCyclone Mocha in Myanmar\n\nCyclone Mocha made landfall in May (Image credit: Sai Aung Main / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe United Nations appealed for aid to help 1.6 million people in Myanmar after Cyclone Mocha made landfall on 14 May. \"Hundreds of makeshift shelters\" were torn apart and 90% of the western Rakhine state’s capital city Sittwe was \"destroyed\", said the BBC.\n\nCoastal winds of up to 150mph wrought destruction, causing flooding and landslides in \"an area that is home to hundreds of thousands already displaced by the protracted conflict in Myanmar, many of them the Rohingya minority of Rakhine state\", said UN News.\n\nWildfires in Canada\n\nMore than 10 million acres had been scorched in Canada's worst wildfire season ever (Image credit: James MacDonald / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nCanada has suffered its \"worst wildfire season in recorded history\" this year, said The Guardian. More than 5,000 blazes have scorched through 32 million acres of land since the start of the year, \"almost seven times the average for the same period over previous years\".\n\nThe conditions have been \"taxing on wildfire crews\", said The Washington Post.

Arizona's most highly populated county, Maricopa, reported 25 deaths in relation to heat this year to 21 July, \"and hundreds more are under investigation\".\n\nEurope's heatwave\n\nA six-month state of emergency has been declared in Rhodes (Image credit: Spyros Bakalis / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nScorching temperatures have impacted countries across Europe this summer too, with many experiencing wildfires.\n\nThousands of holidaymakers and residents were evacuated from the Greek island of Rhodes in July, which is now in a six-month state of emergency, after blazes \"threatened resorts\", said The Times. Greece has battled its \"most intense wildfires in two decades of modern satellite records\".\n\nFires have also burned across Italy, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Croatia and France. As the UK's weather took \"a turn for the worse\" in August, tourists were \"flocking to Britain to enjoy the cooler, wetter climate\", said Sky News.\n\nFloods in China\n\nTyphoon Doksuri has caused extreme flooding in the Hai River basin in China (Image credit: Kevin Frayer / Getty Images)\n\nTyphoon Doksuri caused \"exceptional rainfall\" in the Hai River basin in northern China, which covers Beijing, Hebei Province and Tianjin port, CNA reported. The region experienced \"the worst floods since 1963 despite massive mitigation efforts\" in August.\n\n\"China's Soviet-era urban drainage systems… leave cities vulnerable to waterlogging during heavy rain,” said CNA. Zhuozhou in Hebei was “unprepared\", with many residents saying \"they were not informed about the severity or the situation or told to evacuate\" before the rains began. Authorities say 33 people have died and tens of thousands have been displaced.\n\nFires in Hawaii\n\nAt least 97 people are known to have died as blazes burnt across Maui in August (Image credit: Patrick T. Fallon / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA \"devastating inferno\" charged across Maui on 8 August, said The Associated Press. A \"wall of flame\" destroyed buildings and homes and killed at least 97 people. Officials have warned it will take years for the island to recover.\n\nThe Hawaiian Electric Co has acknowledged that fallen power lines started the fire. Officials are now investigating whether the utility company had been negligent in its activities, including in keeping its infrastructure clear of flammable, overgrown foliage.\n\nA lack of planning and years of underfunding were reported to have left the island at risk of a fire threat.\n\nCyclone in Brazil\n\nHomes were destroyed by heavy rainfall and flooding across the state of Rio Grande do Sul in September (Image credit: Mateus Bruxel / Agencia RBS / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn what Rio Grande do Sul's governor Eduardo Leite described as the state's worst weather disaster on record, an extratropical cyclone killed at least 27 people in southern Brazil in September.\n\nOfficials said that almost 30cm of rain fell on the state in less than 24 hours, causing flooding and subsequent landslides. Rescue teams used helicopters to reach regions that were no longer reachable by road due to the floods, as the \"storm battered around 60 cities\" in the region, said Sky News.\n\nFloods in Libya\n\nFlooding in Libya has killed more than 11,000 people in the country's north-eastern region (Image credit: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nDerna was \"practically flattened\" in September as \"Storm Daniel unleashed its wrath on a city that was mostly fast asleep\", said Al Jazeera.\n\nHeavy rainfall led to the collapse of two dams, which caused extensive flash flooding and washed away entire homes and neighbourhoods.

New York gets more than 45 inches of rain a year on average while Chicago gets 36 inches.\n\nIn contrast, Los Angeles typically gets about 14 inches of rain a year and San Diego just over 10 inches. These historic storms dumped half of that amount, 7 inches, in just two days, February 4 and 5, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBecause of that, homeless communities in cities like New York and Chicago have more experience – and infrastructure – to combat the deadly effects of storms. In Southern California, it's a different story.\n\nThe Midnight Mission shelter typically sees about 30 people on a normal night, Berkovich said. But the numbers increased more than three-fold as an unprecedented six inches of rain devastated encampments across the city.\n\nThe storm also brought hundreds of landslides and mudslides in California, leaving devastation for some of the more than 181,000 people experiencing homelessness across the state – especially for those living outdoors. Mayors from Los Angeles and San Diego both declared evacuation warnings for people living in low-lying and flood-prone areas.\n\nThe rains turned dry areas wet, trickles into streams and streams into torrents. Many unhoused people in Southern California find places to camp that are hidden away to avoid police sweeps, which can mean along riverbeds that are typically dry or shallow, under bridges and in tunnels – all areas that were swamped during the storms.\n\nService providers told USA TODAY that an influx of people need dry, clean clothes and a warm place for refuge. And even more people are displaced after the floods ruined their homes. Now, they're in desperate need of resources to help people facing life-or-death circumstances – and asking for help.\n\n\"We always need more,\" Berkovich said. \"We need more ponchos, water, shelter, and hygiene kits. We're doing the best with the resources and staff we have.\"\n\nThis record-setting winter is particularly difficult for people who are unhoused in San Diego, said Father Joe's Village Deacon Jim Vargas. The organization helps people experiencing homelessness in San Diego with meals, shelter, ponchos and other resources they need year-round and during the storms.\n\n\"We're fortunate and blessed to be able to provide additional spots for people who need it,\" Vargas said. But even facilities used for sheltering people from the rain during the storm have incurred damage.\n\n\"A couple of weeks ago from today we were hit with extremely heavy rain and flooding,\" he said Monday. \"A couple of our buildings were flooded, including our health center, which was very, very challenging.\"\n\nOfficials statewide also opened up additional resources to help unhoused residents cope with the dangerous conditions, including a winter shelter hosted by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.\n\n\"We know the severe impact that weather can have on our communities, and we are making sure Los Angeles is prepared on behalf of our residents, including the unhoused Angelenos living on our streets, to get through this storm,\" said Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass before the storm system hit Los Angeles.\n\nAtmospheric river slams CaliforniaPrompting mudslide and flooding concerns: 'Do not let your guard down'\n\nEncampments, shelters see devastation\n\nIn Los Angeles, unhoused people huddled under makeshift tarps and overhangs to escape the rain, photos in the Los Angeles Times show. On Wednesday a pregnant woman who had been living in a storm drain was rescued from a storm drain near Anaheim.\n\nMany people lost their belongings, clothes and tents to the rain's damage, Berkovich said. And the sudden cold weather patterns can create fatal health risks for people who live outside.\n\nSoaked clothing and bedding draws heat from the body rather than holding it in, putting those who live outside at risk.\n\n\"It's so strange. In LA we have this great climate, but people die of exposure to weather on our streets all the time,\" Berkovich added.\n\nAt least 14 people died from hypothermia on the streets of Los Angeles in 2021, The Guardian reported. And more unhoused people died from freezing temperatures in Los Angeles than in New York in 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n\"And as it gets rainier, more people can develop hypothermia,\" Vargas said Monday.\n\nVolunteers offer emotional support for flood victims\n\nRob and Amy Reardon saw the emotional toll that the flood took on unhoused people in San Diego firsthand. They've worked with the San Diego Regional Office of the Salvation Army for 26 years On Jan. 22 when torrential rains flooded city streets, Amy Reardon said that she had \"a lot of people come in during the first week who just would sit down and start to cry.\"\n\nRob Reardon said apart from the pressing need for material help, mental health support for victims of the disaster was in huge demand.\n\n“It's kind of like a triage counseling session,” he said of the response at the emergency centers.\n\nThe Jackie Robinson Family YMCA in Southeast San Diego also opened as a community support center in the wake of the flooding. Ariane Porras, the organization's community collaborative director, said the center first started offering hot showers in response to the crisis, but added more services over time, including an on-site mental health counselor.\n\n\"It's a lot of crisis processing,\" Porras said. \"The concerns that they're having, these mental health crises, go anywhere from panic and shock to suicidal ideation.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of concern over safety and shelter and what's next,\" she added. \"Like, what hope is there for their future?\"\n\nBoth Reardons said they feared the flooding over the last few weeks would exacerbate the already dire need for more mental health support for San Diego’s unhoused population.\n\n“We're all trying to do our part, but the resources are very slim, and in some places nonexistent,” Rob Reardon said. The flooding, he said, could “overwhelm the resources that are already in place.”\n\nPorras echoed the pressing need for more resources, especially to treat those experiencing homelessness.\n\n\"We're trying to communicate to city officials, we've been doing this, but this is above our pay grade,\" she said. \"We literally do not have the resources to continue to do these efforts that we've been doing since January 22. So, we need them to step in.\"\n\nThe San Diego Regional Office of the Salvation Army distributed more than $40,000 in financial assistance, clothing items, hygiene kits, and food to the more than 1,600 people who came to seek help, according to the organization.\n\n“The reality is these floods took everything from people,” Reardon said. “There’s going to be a lot of grieving.”\n\nFlood damage leaves more Californians displaced from their homes\n\nThe floods have displaced thousands of people from their homes, including 1,000 from the Jan. 22 storm in San Diego County, according to Voice of San Diego.\n\nNearby Californians from Beverly Crest in Los Angeles County make up some of those displaced by the flood's wreckage, local news outlets reported.\n\nSan Diego residents displaced from their homes rallied on city streets in a cry for help, Voice of San Diego reported.\n\nLos Angeles Homeless Services Authority and the city of Los Angeles opened six additional winter shelters but Mayor Karen Bass said at a news conference Tuesday that the city is evaluating the need for more shelters.\n\nThe San Diego Housing Commission and the city of San Diego have activated the Inclement Weather Shelter Program but advocates say more is needed.\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

Some areas have seen more than 7 inches of rain, with more expected through Friday.

In one area near the Big Cypress National Preserve, more than 15 inches of rain has already fallen.\n\nFlorida Highway Patrol Lt.

Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for five counties after the torrential rainfall this week, with additional rain expected to \"further exacerbate\" ongoing flood conditions over already heavily impacted and vulnerable areas. The declaration includes Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties.\n\nAt 7:30 p.m., the weather service issued a broader flood warning for Broward and Miami-Dade counties, given the 5-13 inches of rain that has already fallen with additional rain expected.\n\nFlooding in rivers, streams, canals and other low-lying areas is occurring or imminent, the warning said. Several structures have flooded, and numerous roads remain closed.\n\n\"It will take several hours for all the water from these storms to work through local drainage systems in urban areas,\" the weather service said.\n\n– Dinah Pulver\n\nFloods hit Fort Lauderdale\n\nFort Lauderdale Mayor Dean J. Trantalis declared a state of emergency and said Florida Fish and Wildlife would send boats and buggies. Eyewitness footage showed a person kayaking down a boulevard of the seaside community between Fort Lauderdale and Miami.\n\nFlooding last year caused officials to pull the plug on its historic City Hall building, and city employees decamped early from their temporary offices Wednesday because of the weather, a spokesperson for the mayor's office said.\n\nThe rain Wednesday comes as the city is in the process of installing $500 million in stormwater infrastructure upgrades, including tidal control valves, drainage pipes, raising seawalls and constructing stormwater reserves, the mayor told USA TODAY via email.\n\n\"We're accelerating plans and trying to keep up with climate change and sea level rise as we're seeing more intense and unprecedented rain events like this,\" Trantalis said.\n\nFloods remind South Florida resident of last year's deluge\n\nMilena A. Amit runs a downtown Fort Lauderdale law firm with her husband. She abandoned plans to work late Wednesday evening when the rising floodwaters outside began giving her flashbacks of last year's deluge.\n\n“It’s becoming like an annual aquatic rodeo,” said Amit, 41. “They called it a once in a generation storm of flooding, but little by little it’s becoming not such a unique event.”\n\nShe, her assistant and her husband piled into his Lexus GX SUV, a towering car she said they bought exactly for such emergencies. Other office workers left their cars in the garage and went to high ground to call an Uber. At least one person decided to camp at the office, something many realized was a possibility after 25 inches of rain fell on the city in 24 hours last year.\n\n“Before last year, if somebody said that to me, I would say you're being sensational for retweets,” she said. Now, “it’s becoming an inside joke, ‘Everybody bring an air mattress.”\n\nThe New York native moved to South Florida in 1996 and said the floods have become more and more disastrous as the city has grown in size. She was concerned about what the rest of the summer could bring.\n\n“We're also in the infancy of our hurricane season,” she warned. “While we made this out OK, we brought my assistant home safely, we’re engaged with our staff about what’s happening tomorrow, a lot of people don’t have that capability and it’s sad to see.”\n\nStorm ensnares cars and shutters restaurants in Sarasota\n\nResidents in Sarasota, about 60 miles south of Tampa, were reeling from Tuesday's downpour, which brought a whopping 5-10 inches of rain to the area. Some downtown restaurants closed Wednesday while others were left deserted as flooding swept through outdoor patios.\n\nMattison’s City Grill general manager Darryl Dillon said water crept into the outdoor patio for the first time in a storm that wasn’t a hurricane.\n\n“Nobody was out,” Dillon said. “I stepped out of my car into a foot-and-a-half of water.”\n\nThe Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office received 18 service calls for cars stuck in water and four calls for abandoned cars. The county's fire department received 43 calls for cars stuck in floodwater, 39 calls for fire alarms and 15 calls for downed wires. Between 8 p.m. Tuesday and 8 a.m. Wednesday, personnel responded to 282 total calls for service – 100 more than their daily average.\n\nAssistant Fire Chief Tim Dorsey said crews were able to safely evacuate people trapped in vehicles, but some residents chose to stay in their cars until the water receded. Crews will continue to be on alert in case residents need assistance throughout the rainy week.\n\n“It’s static water,” Dorsey said. “They’re not in any danger.

On July 11-12, floods in Racine, Kenosha and Walworth counties caused nearly $9 million in damages to roads, dams and bridges. On July 20, the city of Arcadia flooded again, prompting a legislative request to redirect $15 million from the state building fund to reinforce Arcadia's levees and floodwalls. The very next day, communities throughout western Wisconsin were hard hit by flash flooding, adding $10 million in damage to the previous day’s tally.\n\nI’ve visited many of these areas, witnessing the effects of floods firsthand. What I’ve observed is that the places where damage has occurred, and, more important, where it has not occurred, have a lot to do with the extent and condition of wetlands upstream. Wetlands manage the water that flows across our landscapes, reducing the size and flashiness of flood events by soaking up water, storing runoff and slowly releasing it into our creeks, rivers and lakes.\n\nHere’s a story of wetlands at work: In five hours on the night of July 11, 2016, storms dropped a foot of water across a large portion of northern Wisconsin, causing more than $35 million in damage. Highways washed out, homes and businesses were inundated, and two lives were lost. Amidst this devastation, however, is the story of Bibon Swamp, a 14,000-acre wetland in the upper reaches of the White River. The swamp soaked up enough runoff that night to raise its water level nearly 6 feet. This translates to more than 10 billion gallons of water that did not go rushing down the White River and over a hydropower dam located only a few miles downstream from the swamp. Locals speculate that it was Bibon Swamp that saved the dam.\n\nWe need to put wetlands back on the land to help protect our communities from flood events.\n\nUnfortunately, Wisconsin is moving in the wrong direction. Recent state legislation to entice Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn to build a plant in Wisconsin unnecessarily exempts the company from state wetland permitting. Racine and Kenosha counties, where the Foxconn plant may be built, are continually subjected to damaging floods due to the legacy of tens of thousands of wetland acres drained and filled over the last 100 years.\n\nInstead of providing wetland permitting exemptions to companies that don’t need them, we should be developing innovative policies and programs to help solve the difficult water issues facing communities. We need to restore our watersheds in ways that reduce flooding, decrease erosion and soil loss, recharge groundwater, increase water quality, and improve our social and economic well-being. We can do this in a modern context — in ways that improve agricultural productivity, support development and save money.\n\nBut not unless or until we look upstream from flood-prone areas, reckon with the historic and ongoing legacy of wetland loss and collaborate on new approaches to flood risk management and response.\n\nWetlands are not the whole solution to our water-related problems, but we can’t solve our water issues without wetlands. Let’s put wetlands to work.\n\nTracy Hames is executive director of the Wisconsin Wetlands Association.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/10"}]}

Deliveries were way down in January 2021, but improved as the year went on, said Brady Hamilton of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Much of the increase was seen in older moms.\n\n“These are births that were postponed,” said Hamilton, lead author of the new report.\n\nThe report is based on a review of nearly all birth certificates issued last year.\n\nSome of the key findings:\n\nNearly 3.7 million births were reported last year, up from the roughly 3.6 million recorded in 2020.\n\nBirth rates dropped again for teens and for women younger than 25, but rose 3% for women in their early 30s, 5% for women in their late 30s, and 3% for women in their early 40s.\n\nBirth rates rose 1% for Hispanic women and 3% for white women. But they fell 1% for Asian women, 3% for Black women, and 4% Native American and Alaska Native women.

It rose slightly last year, to nearly 1.7.\n\nThe percentage of infants born small and premature — at less than 37 weeks — rose 4%, to about 10.5%. It was the highest it’s been since 2007.\n\nThe premature birth rate had declined slightly in 2020, and health officials aren’t sure why the increase occurred.

Black and Native mothers' preterm birth rates remained highest.\n\nMeanwhile, southeastern states and Puerto Rico saw some of the highest rates of preterm births.\n\nPreterm births last year reached their highest peak since 2007 – with more than 383,000 born before 37 weeks of gestational age in the United States, according to a new report.\n\nIn 2021, roughly 10.5% of U.S. babies were born premature, according to the annual March of Dimes “Report Card,” which rated the United States at D+. The score dropped from its C- rating in 2020, when the preterm birth rate saw its first decline in six years, a slight decrease to 10.1%.\n\nThe report released this week found disparities widened between white mothers and Native and Black mothers, who are already 62% more likely to have a preterm birth and nearly three times as likely as white moms to die of childbirth-related causes. In 2021, Black mothers saw a 3% increase and Native mothers a 6% increase in preterm births, according to the analysis.\n\nOf all groups, Asian and Pacific Islander mothers saw the largest preterm birth increase – an 8% surge – even though births to Asian mothers decreased that year, and they have the lowest preterm birth rate overall.\n\nExperts say the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed significantly to the rising preterm birth rates, and the findings signal a need for more efforts toward ensuring equitable prenatal care access.\n\nSTUDY:COVID contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths from 2020 to 2021\n\nWhat is premature birth? What causes preterm labor?\n\nPreterm births can be caused by various health conditions in the birthing parent, like high blood pressure and diabetes, as well as stress, problems with the uterus or placenta, infection or inflammation.\n\nBeing born premature can lead to significant developmental complications in babies, including undeveloped respiratory systems causing breathing problems, and hearing, vision and behavioral issues.\n\nPregnant people who contract COVID-19 are 40% more likely to go into preterm labor, said Dr. Zsakeba Henderson, an obstetrician and gynecologist who is the March of Dimes’ senior vice president and interim chief medical and health officer.\n\nAdditionally, lockdowns and changes or delays in care during the pandemic may have caused gaps in prenatal care, which Black and Native mothers already suffered disproportionately, noted Henderson, who leads the nonprofit’s Office of Maternal and Child Health Impact.\n\nWhere in the US are preterm births most common?\n\nOnly four states saw a decrease in preterm births, and 45 states and Washington, D.C., saw an increase, according to the analysis by the March of Dimes, a maternal and infant health research and advocacy nonprofit.\n\nSoutheastern states, as well as Puerto Rico, saw some of the highest rates of preterm births. The report also showed states with some of the lowest maternal and infant health scores were in the South, a region plagued by structural racism where more than half of the nation’s Black population lives.\n\n“I don't think that's a coincidence. Consistently, the worst rates have been seen in that region,” Henderson said. “These states have large populations of Black mothers who experienced the highest rates.”\n\n'A national emergency':Black women still 40% more likely to die of breast cancer than white women\n\n'Not doing enough'\n\nInfant mortality rates decreased slightly overall, but disparities remained, with Black babies dying at 10.8 per 1,000 births, Native babies at 8.4 per 1,000 births, and Hispanic babies at 5 per 1,000 births. White babies saw 4.6 deaths per 1,000 births.\n\nThe trends are “disturbing,\" said Dr. Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman, who is chair and professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Diego.\n\n“It shows that we are not doing enough. It suggests we are moving in the wrong direction in terms of solutions,” said the physician, who is a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine and high-risk pregnancies. “Any increase in preterm birth is concerning because of the downstream effects on the infant after a preterm delivery.”\n\nDespite “decades of research” on preterm births, the increase “highlights that fact that we have very few reliable interventions to prevent preterm delivery,” she added.\n\nMore on this topic:\n\nRise in Asian American preterm births\n\nWhile the increase in Asian preterm births was stark, they remained a small percentage of the overall increase, Henderson said. Black and American Indian mothers still had the highest rates, the report found.\n\n“We don't know the cause for that increase (in Asian mothers),\" she said. \"That's something worth looking into for further investigation and paying attention to as we continue to follow these trends.\"\n\nStill, experts say multiple factors could have contributed. Asian American mothers are having their first babies at an older age, which can increase risk of preterm labor.\n\n“Asian American women have the oldest average age of first-time motherhood, and it is also associated with preterm birth,” said Deepa Dongarwar, a data scientist at the University of Texas Health Science Center who studies Asian American maternal and infant health. “That actually puts the infant at a very big risk.”\n\nAdditionally, Dongarwar noted Asian Americans have been found to use infertility treatments at higher rates compared to other groups. These treatments “are also associated with increased risk of multiple pregnancies, which in turn is associated with preterm birth,” she explained.\n\nDr. Yvonne Cheng, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist with Sutter Pacific Medical Foundation in San Francisco, called the rise “disappointing and concerning.” Asian communities suffered specific stressors during the pandemic, she noted.\n\n“At the beginning of the pandemic, the unknown surrounding the COVID-19 virus and its effect on pregnancy created a lot of fear, stress and also anger toward and within the Asian American communities,” she said.\n\nAsian communities are also diverse. Further analyses into different groups can help inform where needs are, experts said. One study by Dongarwar found U.S. Filipina and Vietnamese mothers had increased odds of preterm birth compared with East Asian mothers.\n\nCheng said COVID-19’s social isolation could have decreased access to prenatal care and contributed to preterm delivery.\n\n“Pre-existing medical or obstetric conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and multiple births are significant contributing factors,” she said. “But we cannot ignore other factors ... inadequate prenatal care, psychosocial stress, delayed child-bearing.”\n\nRead more on this topic:\n\nReach Nada Hassanein at nhassanein@usatoday.com or on Twitter @nhassanein_.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/05/04/us-birth-rate-age-group-cdc-report-coronavirus-pandemic/4951858001/", "title": "US birthrate falls to lowest point in more than a century, CDC says", "text": "Mike Stobbe\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNEW YORK –The U.S. birthrate fell 4% last year, the largest single-year decrease in nearly 50 years, according to a government report released Wednesday.\n\nThe rate dropped for moms of every major race and ethnicity, and in nearly every age group, falling to the lowest point since federal health officials started tracking it more than a century ago.\n\nBirths have been declining in younger women for years, as many postponed motherhood and had smaller families.\n\nBirthrates for women in their late 30s and in their 40s have been inching up.

Anxiety about COVID-19 and its impact on the economy likely caused many couples to think that having a baby right then was a bad idea.\n\nBut many of the 2020 pregnancies began well before the U.S. epidemic. CDC researchers are working on a follow-up report to better parse out how the decline unfolded, Hamilton said.\n\nOther highlights from the CDC report:\n\nAbout 3.6 million babies were born in the U.S. last year, down from about 3.75 million in 2019. When births were booming in 2007, the U.S. recorded 4.3 million births.\n\nThe U.S. birthrate dropped to about 56 births per 1,000 women of child-bearing age, the lowest rate on record.

Bill Clinton was running for the White House, “Who’s the Boss?” aired its final episode, and the babies born to Rachel and Philip Ridgeway a couple of weeks ago were frozen as embryos.\n\nBorn on October 31, Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from what may be the longest-frozen embryos to ever result in a live birth, according to the National Embryo Donation Center.\n\nThe previous known record holder was Molly Gibson, born in 2020 from an embryo that had been frozen for nearly 27 years. Molly took the record from her sister Emma, who was born from an embryo that had been frozen for 24 years.\n\nIt’s possible an older frozen embryo may have been used; although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks success rates and data around reproductive technologies, it does not track how long embryos have been frozen. But there’s no evidence of an older embryo resulting in a live birth.\n\n“There is something mind-boggling about it,” Philip Ridgeway said as he and his wife cradled their newborns in their laps at their home outside Portland, Oregon. “I was 5 years old when God gave life to Lydia and Timothy, and he’s been preserving that life ever since.”\n\n“In a sense, they’re our oldest children, even though they’re our smallest children,” Ridgeway added. The Ridgeways have four other children, ages 8, 6, 3 and almost 2, none conceived via IVF or donors.\n\nThe embryos were created for an anonymous married couple using in-vitro fertilization. The husband was in his early 50s, and they used a 34-year-old egg donor.\n\nThe embryos were frozen on April 22, 1992.\n\nFor nearly three decades, they sat in storage on tiny straws kept in liquid nitrogen at nearly 200 degrees below zero, in a device that looks much like a propane tank.\n\nThe embryos were kept at a fertility lab on the West Coast until 2007, when the couple who created them donated the embryos to the National Embryo Donation Center in Knoxville, Tennessee, in hopes another couple might be able to use them. The five embryos were overnighted in specially outfitted tanks to Knoxville, said Dr. John Gordon, the Ridgeways’ doctor.\n\n“We’ve never had in our minds a set number of children we’d like to have,” Philip said. “We’ve always thought we’ll have as many as God wants to give us, and … when we heard about embryo adoption, we thought that’s something we would like to do.”\n\nUnderstanding embryo donation\n\nThe medical name for the process the Ridgeways went through is embryo donation.\n\nWhen people undergo IVF, they may produce more embryos than they use. Extra embryos can be cryopreserved for future use, donated to research or training to advance the science of reproductive medicine, or donated to people who would like to have children.\n\nAs with any other human tissue donation, embryos must meet certain US Food and Drug Administration eligibility guidelines to be donated, including being screened for certain infectious diseases.\n\n“Embryo adoption is not a legal ‘adoption’ at all, at least in the sense of a traditional adoption which occurs after birth,” the National Embryo Donation Center says. “However, the term allows all parties to conceptualize the process and eventual reality of raising a non-genetically related child.”\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine says, “Application of the term ‘adoption’ to embryos is inaccurate, is misleading, and could place burdens upon recipients and should be avoided.”\n\nMany colloquially call the donor process “embryo adoption,” but adoption and donation are not one and the same, said Dr. Sigal Klipstein, a Chicago-based fertility specialist and chair of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine’s ethics committee.\n\n“Adoption refers to living children,” Klipstein said. “It’s a legal process by which a parent-child relationship is created when it did not previously exist.”\n\nEmbryo donation, she said, is a medical procedure. “It’s a way by which we take embryos from one couple or individual and then transfer them into another individual in order to build families.”\n\nThe phrase “adoption” has become wrapped up in a larger cultural debate, used predominantly by those in faith-based communities with conservative leanings. The National Embryo Donation Center is a private, Christian-led organization. It requires recipients to pass a “family assessment” and says “couples must be a genetic male and a genetic female married for a minimum of 3 years.” The center says it has helped with the births of over 1,260 infants from donated embryos.\n\nKlipstein says that using donated embryos can often be cost-effective for people looking for fertility help, as it cuts out the price of looking for and storing donor sperm and eggs. “They don’t get the genetic connection to the children,” she said, “but they do have a much less expensive reproductive option than even with in-vitro fertilization in most cases.”\n\n‘We just wanted the ones that had been waiting the longest’\n\nFor the Ridgeways, building their family was always part of a larger calling.\n\n“We weren’t looking to get the embryos that have been frozen the longest in the world,” Philip Ridgeway said. “We just wanted the ones that had been waiting the longest.”\n\nWhen looking for donors, the Ridgeways specifically asked the donation center about a category called “special consideration,” meaning it had been hard to find recipients for these embryos, for whatever reason.\n\n“Going into this, we knew that we could trust God to do whatever he had sovereignly planned and that their age really had no factor. It was just a matter of whether or not that was in God’s plans,” Rachel Ridgeway said.\n\nTo pick their embryos, they went through a donor database. It did not list the how long embryos have been frozen, but it listed the donors’ characteristics like ethnicity, age, height, weight, genetic and health history, education, occupation, favorite movies and music. With some files, there are photos of the parents and of their children if they have them.\n\nThe Ridgeways assumed those listed with earlier donor numbers had been at the center the longest and tried to narrow their choice to those profiles.\n\nRisks of multiples\n\nSoutheastern Fertility, which partners with National Embryo Donation Center, thawed the embryos February 28. Of the five that were thawed, two were not viable. There’s about an 80% survival rate when thawing frozen embryos, experts say.\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the CDC both recommend transferring one embryo at a time, as transferring more raises the likelihood for multiples, which also potentially increases risk for both mother and child. Twin babies are more likely to be born early, develop cerebral palsy, have autism and result in stillbirth.\n\nRachel remembers Gordon handing her a picture of the three embryos and recommending they transfer only two, telling her, “multiples can cause problems in pregnancy.” But she said there was no question in her mind that they would transfer all three.\n\nShe remembers getting teary-eyed and saying, “You just showed me a picture of my three children. I have to have them all.”\n\nPhilip and Rachel Ridgeway had twins born from embryos that were frozen for about 30 years. Courtesy Philip and Rachel Ridgeway\n\nThe remaining three embryos were transferred into Rachel on March 2, 29 years and 10 months after they were frozen. Two of the transfers were successful. Studies have found that 25% to 40% of frozen embryo transfers result in a live birth.\n\nLike ‘Rip Van Winkle’\n\nEmbryos can be frozen pretty much indefinitely, experts said.\n\n“If you’re frozen at nearly 200 degrees below zero, I mean, the biological processes essentially slow down to almost nothing. And so perhaps the difference between being frozen for a week, a month, a year, a decade, two decades, it doesn’t really matter,” Gordon said.\n\nDr. Jim Toner, a fertility specialist in Atlanta, likens it to an old story: “It doesn’t seem like a sperm or an egg or embryo stored in liquid nitrogen ever experiences time. It’s like that Rip Van Winkle thing. It just wakes up 30 years later, and it never knew it was asleep.”\n\nThe age of the embryo shouldn’t affect the health of the child. What matters more is the age of the woman who donated the egg that went into the embryo.\n\n“If that patient was 25, yes, most likely, her embryos will survive,” said Dr. Zaher Merhi, a fertility expert at the Rejuvenating Fertility Center in New York City. “It’s all about the egg and the embryo and when the egg was taken out.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe Ridgeways say they’ve wanted their kids involved all along the process, so they have been explaining it to them as they went through the steps.\n\n“They were excited and happy with us every step along the way. They love their siblings, and they play together and were looking forward to finding out whether God had given them two boys, two girls or a brother and a sister,” Phillip Ridgeway said.\n\nLydia was born at 5 pounds, 11 ounces, and Timothy was 6 pounds, 7 ounces.\n\n“They were good-size babies,” Rachel Ridgeway said. “It really is God’s grace because he has just sustained us each step of the way.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen Nadia Kounang", "Jen Christensen", "Nadia Kounang"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/pets/2024/07/27/how-long-are-cats-pregnant/74510786007/", "title": "How long are cats pregnant?

Cat pregnancies last between 62 to 70 days, and the average cat gestation is 64 days, says veterinarian Diana Watkins, who owns 143 Veterinary Services in Massachusetts.\n\nHow long after a cat starts showing will she give birth?\n\nPregnant cats start showing about halfway through their pregnancies, around 30 days. Every cat is different, however. Thin cats may start showing early on in their pregnancy. Owners of bigger cats may not even notice they’re pregnant until they're ready to give birth, Watkins says.\n\nIf you suspect your cat is pregnant, take them to see your vet. They can help you care for your cat while she’s expecting. It’s important they know she’s pregnant so they don’t give her the feline distemper vaccine, which protects against several infectious diseases but is unsafe for fetuses, Watkins says. Keep an eye out for these pregnancy symptoms:\n\nDistended, or swollen, belly\n\nProminent nipples\n\nNesting, or creating a cozy, quiet and safe spot to give birth\n\nIf you have an unspayed cat over four months old, it’s a good idea to take her to the vet if she gets outside, even if you’re not sure she’s pregnant. Cats are “really, really good at getting pregnant,” Watkins says, because they can induce ovulation at any time.\n\nOnce you have the confirmation your furry friend is expecting, there are a few things you can do to keep them healthy and happy. To start, keep them indoors. You can also feed your cat kitten food, which has extra nutrients the growing babies need. Your vet can help you calculate the exact amount of calories they’ll need while pregnant, Watkins says.\n\nProvide access to a safe, comfortable area for birthing. This should be somewhere hidden and out of the way, like under a bed or in a closet. Provide blankets, towels and a box for nest-building.\n\nWhen it comes time to giving birth, “they do it best on their own,” Watkins says. Keep your distance so you don’t stress them out but check in now and then to make sure the process is going smoothly. They’ll usually start nesting and disappearing from plain sight the day before they give birth. Labor may take around six hours, and they’ll typically birth one kitten every 30 minutes, Watkins says.\n\nCan you pick up a pregnant cat?\n\nYou can still snuggle a pregnant cat, but take extra care. Try scooping her up from the bottom to avoid touching her sensitive belly, which might cause her discomfort, says Purina, a pet company.\n\nExercise caution around children, who may not understand how to handle animals gently.\n\nHow many kittens can a cat have in her first litter?\n\nCats typically birth between four and six kittens, though a cat who is giving birth to her first litter may have fewer kittens, Watkins says.\n\nIt’s important to be prepared for how many kittens to expect, whether you’re planning on giving them up for adoption or keeping them in your home. Vets can count the fetuses with X-rays over 45 days of gestation.\n\nHow many times can a cat get pregnant in a year?\n\nOn average, cats can have about three litters per year since their gestation period lasts only two months. However, no more than once or twice a year is recommended to give the cat the necessary time to recover, veterinarians at PetCoach say.\n\nHow old is my cat in human years?:We illustrated it for you\n\nJust Curious for more?

For many years, the woman had searched for him, but the father did not know she existed. By the miracle of DNA testing, they found each other.\n\nDuring their reunion on the video call, their tears and their laughter seemed to bridge the physical distance of 8,600 miles between them: The father is a U.S. military veteran who lives in Ohio, and the daughter lives in southern Vietnam.\n\nTheir story has a happy ending, unlike most stories of Amerasians born during the Vietnam War from relationships between American soldiers and Vietnamese women.\n\nThe fathers of the Amerasians called 'bui doi,' the dust of life\n\nFor many years, as I assisted Amerasians and their parents in their search for each other, I saw so much heartbreak and so much hope for healing that I was compelled to write my latest novel, \"Dust Child.\"\n\nOpinions in your inbox:Get exclusive access to our columnists and the best of our columns\n\nMy novel opens with the voice of Phong, a Black Amerasian who was born in 1972. Like many thousands of Amerasians, Phong, who was abandoned when he was a baby, is illiterate and had to spend years of his life on the street, homeless.\n\nEven though his name, Nguyen Tan Phong, means strength from a thousand gusts of wind, people call him “bui doi,” the dust of life, and consider him unworthy. Through this novel, I want to present Phong in his full human complexity, and as a human being who deserves love and respect, because he is not a victim: He is a survivor, a carpenter, a musician.\n\nAbout 100,000 Amerasian children were born during the war from relationships between Vietnamese women and American soldiers. Like many of these Amerasians, Phong does not know his parents and spends his life searching for them, with little hope. Yet he is determined to break the cycles of intergenerational trauma and offers healing not only to himself and his family but also to those around him.\n\nHealing also is much needed for fathers of Amerasians who are willing to reconcile with their past. They were among the nearly 3 million U.S. servicemembers who served in Vietnam from 1965 to 1975. Most were young men, and many remain traumatized today.\n\nPTSD and and survivor's guilt:50 years later, peace treaty that was supposed to end Vietnam War still haunts my family\n\nWhat Vietnam War veteran wants you to know:After a month in Ukraine, this 77-year-old has a message for his fellow Americans\n\nTrauma is a root cause of many veterans rejecting their Amerasian children when they are contacted. Yet some have returned to Vietnam, in the hope of finding the women and children they abandoned.\n\nIn assisting those men in their search, I have seen their regrets and their strong wish to make up for their past mistakes. I feel a special connection with them because I can see into their humanity: Since 2009, I have been translating literary works by American writers who once fought in Vietnam, facilitating literary exchanges between them and Vietnamese writers.\n\nI also have family members who fought on opposite sides of the war. Born in Ninh Binh, in northern Vietnam, I was just 2 years old when the war ended in 1975. However, growing up in both the north and the south, I've learned to embrace stories of people from all sides of the war, and I'm determined to employ literature to foster empathy, healing and reconciliation.\n\nMy conversations with fathers of Amerasians as well as with other American veterans over the years helped me build the world of my book character Daniel Ashland, who was a helicopter pilot during the war – and who is so transformed by the violence he witnessed and participated in that he at first walks away from his unborn child, but then years later comes back to Vietnam, hoping to find his son or daughter.\n\nThe mothers of Amerasians: Their voices matter\n\nIn \"Dust Child,\" Dan’s trauma severely affects his relationship with his former Vietnamese lover – Trang, who represents hundreds of thousands of real Vietnamese women working in bars and brothels that served U.S. soldiers during the war. The voices of these women matter because their stories are little known.\n\nFrom my interviews with these women in real life, I saw the depth of their sorrow, their trauma, as well as the social ostracism they have had to face from a conservative Vietnamese society.\n\n'You're my Kim':How I landed a Hollywood movie and gained a 'Heaven and Earth' family\n\nI was 15 when the first U.S. Marines landed:'On the Ho Chi Minh Trail' takes me back to my days fighting in the Vietnam War\n\nI will never forget my long conversation with a woman who is nearly as old as my mother. She had contacted me after I had written a news article about American veterans who returned to Vietnam to look for the pregnant women whom they abandoned.\n\nI had asked one of the veterans to write a letter to his ex-Vietnamese girlfriend explaining to her why he had abandoned her – and why he is now back looking for her. I had translated the letter and published it in Tuoi Tre, a national newspaper in Vietnam, together with my article featuring the veterans’ desperate searches.\n\nWhen the woman contacted me, she spoke on the phone for 15 minutes, asking many questions about myself before revealing that she was the one in the letter. She had worked in a bar, had been pregnant with the veteran’s child and had to give the child away to an orphanage. She told me that even then, she thought about her child every day, with regret and sorrow. She had done DNA tests and tried to search for her child but without success.\n\n\"Dust Child\" is, in part, my fight against the misrepresentation of Vietnamese women who had to work in bars or brothels during the war. In many Hollywood movies and books in English, they are reduced to the stereotypes of Oriental women, exotic sexual objects, helpless victims, with no trauma, no agency. It is not often that they are given a voice but instead appear as background in stories of Western men who are depicted as their saviors.\n\nThis novel is also my fight against the sexism and racism that still exist within my own Vietnamese community. It is a tribute to the courage of Amerasians and their mothers, and those American veterans, who, despite their long-lasting trauma, have reached out to assist others and offer healing.\n\nI wrote this book – fittingly being published on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal of combat troops from Vietnam – to offer my prayers for a world where there is more compassion, more peace, more forgiveness and healing.\n\nNguyen Phan Que Mai, executive producer of \"Intersections,\" an award-winning documentary series about Amerasians, is the author of the internationally bestselling novel \"The Mountains Sing\" as well as the novel \"Dust Child,\" coming out on Tuesday.

And everything you think you ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor years I believed a lot of what I heard about millennials – those avocado-toast eating, latte-guzzling, selfie-taking narcissists who still live in their parents’ basements and can’t get their lives together.\n\nThen I realized something that surprised me: I’m a millennial, as are many of the people I know and love.\n\nI’d long assumed my friends and classmates were older and wiser than this much-maligned group. But when I started covering demographics for CNN, I learned that 1981 is the birth year many researchers identify as the beginning of the millennial generation.\n\nI was born in 1982. And this year, I turned 40. So did millions of other millennials in the United States.\n\nThat’s right: The generation long portrayed as young and naïve is entering middle age.\n\nIt’s a notable milestone, and a good opportunity to point out something important: the Myth of the Millennial is very different from the reality many of us are living.\n\nMyth 1: We only think about ourselves\n\nBack in May, my husband went out of town on a trip, and I was solo parenting our infant daughter for the first time. “I can do this,” I thought, trying to reassure myself. “It won’t be that hard.” Then one night, my daughter’s first two teeth started to poke through her gums. After watching on the baby monitor as she thrashed in her crib for what probably was only a few minutes, but seemed like an eternity, I ended up holding her in my arms for the rest of the night to comfort her.\n\nMillennials like me are too busy juggling our responsibilities at work and caring for others at home to be as self-obsessed as we’ve been portrayed all these years.\n\nIn the scheme of tough things new parents can go through, this was nothing major. But I was exhausted. And so was she.\n\nAs the sun rose, we sat bleary-eyed on the floor of her room together. Her pajamas were covered with the cherry-flavored Children’s Tylenol she’d spit out when I tried to give it to her the night before. But for a few minutes that morning, we were playing and she was smiling and it seemed like we’d made it through a marathon and finally could relax.\n\nThen my phone rang with devastating, unexpected news.\n\nMy mom had died that morning.\n\nI was shaken, stunned and sobbing. I looked at my daughter playing beside me. There were so many questions I wish I’d asked my mom about how to take care of her. Instead of calling my mom that day to ask for advice, I would race to Michigan to help plan her funeral.\n\nSuddenly, the same year I became a mother had become the year when I lost a mother, too.\n\nIt was less than two months before my 40th birthday.\n\nMillennials famously appeared on the cover of TIME magazine nearly a decade ago beneath the headline, “THE ME ME ME GENERATION,” cementing our self-obsessed image.\n\nThis Time cover from 2013 reinforced stereotypes about millennials as entitled and self-absorbed. From TIME\n\nBut for me and many others, what it really means to be a millennial these days is something quite different. We are the newest sandwich generation, feeling growing pressure between raising young children and caring for aging family members – or at least wanting to care for them, given all they’ve done to care for us, but struggling to know what to do.\n\nMillennials like me are too busy juggling our responsibilities at work and caring for others at home to be as self-obsessed as we’ve been portrayed all these years.\n\nLike every generation before us, we’re growing up. But the Myth of the Millennial has long been off the mark.\n\nFor years, for example, headlines have blared that millennials aren’t having kids. The reality, though, is more complicated, according to Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center.\n\n“Women are having children later. But when we look at completed fertility, we haven’t seen that they’re necessarily having fewer children, just starting later,” Parker says. “It represents a lag, not necessarily a completely different way in approaching family life.”\n\nJason Dorsey, who’s written several books about millennials and made a career out of helping Corporate America better understand them, says the memes about selfish millennials simply don’t match up with reality.\n\n“The oldest millennials tell us they’re being pulled in three different directions,” says Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics. “They’re often taking care of a child or children. They’re frequently taking care of a parent or parents. And they’re trying to navigate their jobs. And so that pull, there’s a lot going on there, and it’s a very stressful time.”\n\nMy husband captured this moment on my 40th birthday this year, as I fed my daughter while we watched July 4 fireworks. Caring for her has changed the way I look at my life. Catherine Shoichet/CNN\n\nPast generations have entered this life stage, too, Dorsey says. But this time around, one thing is different.\n\n“What’s new is to do it at 40 years old,” he says, “with so many people having very young children.”\n\nMany middle-aged millennials like me are feeling this pressure even in our most joyous moments. And Dorsey says there’s plenty of research to be done still about how this shift is changing our society.\n\nHow will this shape the kind of parents we become, or the way we approach our jobs, or the choices we make in other parts of our lives?\n\nMyth 2: We all share the same experiences\n\nIt’s not necessarily surprising that for years I didn’t realize I was one of the more than 72 million millennials in the United States.\n\nSome experts argue that analyzing our society using generation labels is just about as reliable and scientific as using your horoscope.\n\nThey contend that many more factors can shape someone’s life than the year they were born – race and socioeconomic status, for example. And when you label and analyze a whole group of people without digging much into those details, important nuances about social change end up getting lost.\n\n“Drawing arbitrary lines between birth years and slapping names on them isn’t helping,” Philip N. Cohen wrote last year in a Washington Post opinion piece. The professor of sociology at the University of Maryland has been leading a group of academics pushing for the Pew Research Center and others to stop promoting generational labels altogether.\n\nAvocado toast has become an increasingly popular restaurant offering and a symbol of millennial culture. Adobe Stock\n\nI can see their point.\n\nSome of my younger millennial friends, who are in their late 20s, have looked at me wide-eyed when I talk about the videotapes I watched growing up, or what it was like hearing that delightful, high-pitched, staticky tone that meant your home computer was oh-so-slowly connecting to the internet via dial-up. Major events that shaped our world happened at very different points in our lives. I was in college on 9/11; they were in elementary school. I was in grad school and looking for work during the Great Recession; they were still living with their parents.\n\nSome argue that the split between us is so big that older millennials like me should actually get our own category (sometimes combined with younger members of Generation X). Our so-called micro-generation has been dubbed the Xennials, the Oregon Trail Generation, and – most recently, and controversially – Geriatric Millennials.\n\n“It’s important not to label those within a 20-year span as being the same,” says Erica Dhawan, a researcher, author and consultant who coined the “Geriatric Millennial” term in a piece for Medium last year. Like me, she says she just never felt like the millennial label suited her.\n\nAll the criticism of the millennials – we said it about every generation, but it was just amplified by the internet and social media. Lindsey Pollak, author and consultant\n\nTo make things even more confusing, there’s no concrete definition of when the millennial generation begins and ends. The 1991 book credited with introducing the term states that millennials were born in 1982. Widely cited definitions on the Pew Research Center’s website describe millennials as those born between 1981 and 1996. Other researchers have floated theories that millennials were born in the late 1970s and even up to the early 2000s.\n\nThe way we talk about groups of people born in any given period – and the names we use to describe them – can change over time. “Gen Y” used to be a more common way to label our generation, before “millennials” gained momentum.\n\nNo matter what name or definition you use, there’s a sizable age gap between the older and younger members of our generation, and a wide range of life experiences we’ve all had.\n\nCan there still be value in looking at things this way?\n\n“It’s a useful lens, but it’s not the only one,” says Parker of the Pew Research Center, “and it’s important to take into account all the other factors that are causing these differences rather than just being part of a generation.”\n\nNow that I know I’m a millennial, I’m not ready to give up the label just yet. But I do want to help set the record straight and shed these persistent stereotypes about our generation (full disclosure: I do love avocado toast).\n\nMyth 3: We don’t want to own homes\n\nThe question haunts my husband and I – popping up in conversations with friends, loved ones and even strangers.\n\n“Are you thinking of buying a house?”\n\nFor years that milestone didn’t matter much to either of us. We’ve house-sat, and rented, and focused our energy and finances on doing things we enjoy together in our free time.\n\nBut now that we have a daughter, buying a house feels like something we should have done already. It also feels like something that’s increasingly out of reach, as housing costs remain high and mortgage rates skyrocket.\n\nA real estate sign outside a home in Morgan Hill, California, on October 4, 2022. Housing prices in the US soared during the pandemic, making it harder for millennials to buy homes. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWe’re not alone in feeling like we’re behind in taking this big step, according to Kevin Mahoney, a financial advisor in Washington who specializes in helping millennials.\n\n“People are really stressed about not being homeowners,” he says. “One thing I try to communicate to them is, it’s OK to rent. You’re buying yourself flexibility. You’re buying yourself time to figure out what you want your next 20 years or next 10 years to look like.”\n\nDespite frequent handwringing over millennials not buying homes, Mahoney also points out that plenty are. One reason for America’s housing crunch, he says, is that more millennials are now entering the housing market.\n\nIt’s gotten harder to buy a house if you don’t already own one, which makes it really hard to buy a house if you’re in your 20s or 30s and have rented for years. Gray Kimbrough, economist and professor\n\nOlder millennials aged 32-41 made up a quarter of homebuyers this year, according to a National Association of Realtors report, and millennials have been the largest share of homebuyers since 2014.\n\nBut as CNN has reported, many millennials are worse off than their parents.\n\nAnd millennials are less likely to own homes at this point in their lives than previous generations. There’s a good reason for that, says Gray Kimbrough, an economist and adjunct professor at American University who’s repeatedly taken to Twitter to dispel myths about millennials.\n\nHasbro in 2018 issued a cheeky Millennials edition of its classic Monopoly board game. Its game tokens included emojis and a hashtag. Courtesy Hasbro\n\n“It’s gotten harder to buy a house if you don’t already own one,” he says, “which makes it really hard to buy a house if you’re in your 20s or 30s and have rented for years.”\n\nNot to mention that millennials have faced a far bleaker financial picture than older generations, Kimbrough says.\n\n“It’s really hard to think about getting married, having kids, moving out with roommates, and making any of these transitions with the housing market like we have now,” Kimbrough says.\n\nMy husband and I are trying not to be too overwhelmed by this daunting reality.\n\nWe’re visiting open houses on most weekends and planning to meet with mortgage brokers soon.\n\nBy this time next year, we hope we’ll be living in a home that we own.\n\nMyth 4: We don’t take our jobs seriously and don’t stay in them very long\n\nJason Dorsey tells me he often asks a question when he’s invited to visit companies and speak with their employees: “How many of you are millennials?”\n\nGenerally, he says, just a few hands timidly go up.\n\n“They’re expecting it to be negative, because that’s unfortunately what we’ve been framed as for the last 15 years,” Dorsey says.\n\nThat’s around when Dorsey says he saw anti-millennial hype intensifying. Back in 2007, he appeared on a “60 Minutes” segment ominously titled, “The Millennials Are Coming.”\n\nReporter Morley Safer didn’t pull any punches in the piece’s introduction: “A new breed of American worker is about to attack everything you hold sacred: from giving orders, to your starched white shirt and tie.”\n\nHe went on to warn that “the workplace has become a psychological battlefield and the millennials have the upper hand,” describing a generation that can “multitask, talk, walk, listen and type, and text.”\n\n“They talked about us like we were space aliens,” Dorsey recalls.\n\nThis 2007 \"60 Minutes\" segment described millennials as \"a new breed of American worker (that) is about to attack everything you hold sacred.\" CBS\n\nI missed that segment when it came out; I was a newspaper reporter at the time, likely scrambling to cover breaking news on the weekend night shift that started my much-longer-than-40-hour work week.\n\nI think I would have found the premise problematic even then, but now, with the clarity of hindsight, the “60 Minutes” story seems almost cartoonish – another chapter in a tale as old as time. “Anxious Older Generation Worries Naïve Younger Generation Is Destroying Everything” could have been an equally fitting title.\n\nConsultant and author Lindsey Pollak, who advises companies on how to navigate multigenerational workplaces, thinks the rise of social media is partly to blame for millennials’ longstanding bad rap. Pollak says our generation came of age under a microscope unlike any generation before us.\n\n“All the criticism of the millennials – we said it about every generation, but it was just amplified by the internet and social media,” she told me.\n\nMillennials have not been uniquely more likely to job-hop earlier in their careers. Actually, they’re switching jobs less. Gray Kimbrough, economist and professor\n\nDorsey says that during his presentations, details about millennials often surface that surprise many people in the room.\n\n“It turns out they’re the largest generation in that company’s workforce,” he says.\n\nHe finds that many employees had bought into the stereotype and assumed millennials were slackers or flakes. But actually, he says, millennials are often among a company’s most successful workers and managers. And by the end of his presentation, all of them are raising their hands.\n\nKimbrough tells me millennials have been staying in jobs for just as long as previous generations.\n\nYoung professionals navigate Manhattan streets on March 31, 2022, in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n“Obviously people earlier in their careers shift jobs at a higher rate than people later in their careers,” he says. “Millennials have not been uniquely more likely to job-hop earlier in their careers. Actually, they’re switching jobs less. There’s actually been a big decline in job-switching since about 2000.”\n\nIt’s been more than 12 years since I’ve switched jobs. And I’m hoping to stay in this one for many more.\n\nLike me, many of my friends have been working for their employers for more than a decade. Others would have stayed, but found themselves the victims of corporate restructuring.\n\nRepeatedly weathering economic crises is an important piece of millennials’ story, too.\n\n“So many times, millennials tell me they finally feel like they’re on the right track,” Dorsey says, “and then something happens that’s beyond their control.”\n\nMyth 5: We’re forever young\n\nI remember when my dad turned 40. The mere idea of it seemed ANCIENT to me. His coworkers taped black crepe paper around his photo and hung it around the office. I was 9, and gave him a framed poem I’d written about how he shouldn’t feel bad about getting old.\n\n“The gears in your head are still turning around,” I wrote, “and your brain still works, as far as I’ve found.”\n\nSo, yes, the idea that now somehow I’m 40 is something I’m still trying to wrap my head around. On most days, I still see myself as a young adult finding my way in this crazy, confusing world.\n\nBut when I commiserate with my husband about our ever-growing list of weird aches and pains, about how we don’t really like going to loud restaurants anymore, and about The Way Things Used To Be, I realize I’m not quite ancient, but I’m definitely more middle-aged than I’d care to admit.\n\nYes, the youngest millennials are in their mid-20s. But the oldest are approaching middle age. Shutterstock\n\nStill, when I first read last year that the oldest millennials were starting to turn 40, that detail jumped out at me. The concept seemed so surprising. For so long, we’ve seen the same picture painted of millennials over and over.\n\n“People talk about millennials as though it’s this universal term for young people…which it’s not,” Pollak says.\n\nSometimes, when I look at my daughter, this idea really sharpens into focus as I feel my age hurtling toward me like a ton of bricks.\n\nShe’s so much younger than I was at this point in my parents’ lives. Or, put another way, I’m already so much older than my parents were when they were raising me. I was nearly 39 years old when my daughter was born. My husband had just turned 41. When she graduates from high school and heads to college, we’ll both be nearly 60. And if she waits as long as we did to have kids – if she decides that’s right for her – we could be 80 when we become grandparents.\n\nThinking about things this way fills me with anxiety and a tinge of sadness.\n\nWe’ve grown up seeing ourselves … as the young upstarts, as the disruptors, as the people around whom culture, and especially youth culture, are shaped. Of course we’re going to feel fed up about the fact that we’re now middle aged. Amil Niazi, writer\n\nWriter Amil Niazi, who turned 40 this year and has two young children, describes it perfectly – talking about how she finds herself constantly doing this kind of math and “getting hung up on the numbers.”\n\n“Now that I have these tiny, sweet, loving kids, all I want is more time with them, to hit pause, not on their growing and changing, but on me and the version of myself as a parent that I am right now,” she wrote in a recent piece for The Cut, where she’s also explored how hard and confusing it is to be middle-aged. “To pause the back and knee pain that grows a little more sharply every year, to halt the gray hairs and the high cholesterol, skip over the inevitable medical scares and exhaustion that seem to envelop more and more of my days.”\n\nAs I struggle to come to terms with entering my 40s and think lofty thoughts about being an aging millennial, my daughter brings me back to earth by pointing to the woman on the cover of \"Look Great Over 50\" and shouting, \"Mommy!\" Catherine Shoichet/CNN\n\nNiazi, like me and so many other middle-aged millennials, has been coming to terms with what it means not to be young anymore.\n\n“My entire life … the cultural story has always been about our youth. And it’s always been about us as this sort of young disruptive generation that was too spoiled, that had arrested development, that was upending family life, retirement, housing, employment,” Niazi told me. “We’ve grown up seeing ourselves that way, as the young upstarts, as the disruptors, as the people around whom culture, and especially youth culture, are shaped. Of course we’re going to feel fed up about the fact that we’re now middle aged.”\n\nRecently, I stopped by a bookstore with my daughter to pick up a few gifts.\n\nShe’s almost 18 months old and walking now, and as soon as I put her down she bounded over to the magazine section, where there were plenty of things to explore right at her eye level.\n\n“Mommy!” she exclaimed as she gleefully pointed at the cover of a magazine and plucked it off the rack.\n\nA beaming brunette looked out at me from beneath the title, “Look Great Over 50.”\n\n“She does look pretty great,” I thought to myself, “but OVER 50?!”\n\nMaybe my daughter was just sharing her joy at browsing in the bookstore? Surely, she couldn’t think I was more than a decade older than I am already.\n\nBut as she wandered around the magazine section for the next 20 minutes, she kept coming back to that one, saying “Mommy” every time.\n\nI almost corrected her. “Oh, that isn’t Mommy,” was on the tip of my tongue when I realized it doesn’t matter if somehow she does see me on that magazine cover.\n\nThere is so much I’m still trying to figure out, so much all of us – millennials and non-millennials alike – are struggling with as we make our way through life.\n\nAs Niazi notes, the math is truly daunting. And as this year so painfully reminded me, we never know how much time we’ll have with the ones we love.\n\nWith all this uncertainty, there is one thing I know: My daughter and I are so lucky to be together right now, sharing an evening in a bookstore – something I did with my parents, and something I’d always dreamed of doing if I ever had a child of my own.\n\nAs I watch her toddle down the aisles of the store, I feel so proud of how happy and curious she seems to be.\n\nHer generation doesn’t even have a name yet – or at least not one we know will stick.

Wade put her life in danger.\n\nCNN has told the stories of several women – including one from Houston, one from central Texas and one from Cleveland – and what they had to do to obtain medically necessary abortions.\n\nNow, a woman from Austin, Texas, has come forward because she nearly died when she couldn’t get a timely abortion.\n\nThis is her story.\n\nThe loss of a ‘miracle’ baby\n\nAmanda Eid and Josh Zurawski, both now 35, met in 1991 at Aldersgate Academy preschool in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and dated in high school.\n\n“Josh always tells me he’s been in love with me since we were 4 years old,” Amanda said.\n\nThree years ago, they married in Austin, Texas, where they both work in high-tech jobs.\n\nThey tried to have a family but failed. Amanda had fertility treatments for a year and a half and finally became pregnant.\n\nAmanda Zurawski became pregnant after a year and a half of fertility treatments. Courtesy Amanda Zurawski\n\n“Very excited to share that Baby Zurawski is expected in late January,” Amanda shared on Instagram in July. The post included a picture of her and her husband in “Mama” and “Dad” hats, Amanda holding a strip of ultrasound photos of their baby girl.\n\n“The fact that we were pregnant at all was a miracle, and we were beside ourselves with happiness,” she said.\n\nBut then, 18 weeks – just four months – into her pregnancy, Amanda’s water broke.\n\nThe amniotic fluid that her baby depended upon was leaking out. She says her doctor told her the baby would not survive.\n\n“We found out that we were going to lose our baby,” Amanda said. “My cervix was dilating fully 22 weeks prematurely, and I was inevitably going to miscarry.”\n\nShe and Josh begged the doctor to see if there was any way to save the baby.\n\n“I just kept asking, ‘isn’t there anything we can do?’ And the answer was ‘no,’ ” Amanda said.\n\nTexas anti-abortion laws\n\nWhen a woman’s water breaks, she’s at high risk for a life-threatening infection. While Amanda and Josh’s baby – they named her Willow – was sure to die, she still had a heartbeat, and so doctors said that under Texas law, they were unable to terminate the pregnancy.\n\n“My doctor said, ‘Well, right now we just have to wait, because we can’t induce labor, even though you’re 100% for sure going to lose your baby,’ ” Amanda said. “[The doctors] were unable to do their own jobs because of the way that the laws are written in Texas.”\n\nTexas law allows for abortion if the mother “has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.”\n\nBut Texas lawmakers haven’t spelled out exactly what that means, and a doctor found to be in violation of the law can face loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison.\n\n“They’re extremely vague,” said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center. “They don’t spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided.”\n\nIn September, CNN reached out to 28 Texas legislators who sponsored anti-abortion legislation, asking them for their response to CNN stories about the woman in Houston and the woman in central Texas.\n\nOnly one legislator responded.\n\n“Like any other law, there are unintended consequences. We do not want to see any unintended consequences; if we do, it is our responsibility as legislators to fix those flaws,” wrote state Sen. Eddie Lucio, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of the year.\n\nThe Zurawskis participated in an ad for Beto O’Rourke’s unsuccessful Texas gubernatorial campaign.\n\nGoing downhill very fast\n\nAfter her water broke, Amanda’s doctors sent her home and told her to watch for signs of infection, and that only when she was “considered sick enough that my life was at risk” would they terminate the pregnancy, Amanda said.\n\n“My doctor said it could take hours, it could take days, it could take weeks,” she remembers.\n\nOnce they heard “hours,” they decided there was no time to travel to another state for an abortion.\n\n“The nearest ‘sanctuary’ state is at least an eight-hour drive,” Amanda wrote in an online essay on The Meteor. “Developing sepsis – which can kill quickly – in a car in the middle of the West Texas desert, or 30,000 feet above the ground, is a death sentence.”\n\nSo they waited it out in Texas.\n\nOn August 26, three days after her water broke, Amanda found herself shivering in the Texas heat.\n\n“We were having a heat wave, I think it was 105 degrees that day, and I was freezing cold, and I was shaking, my teeth were chattering. I was trying to tell Josh that I didn’t feel good, and my teeth were chattering so hard that I could not even get the sentence out,” she said.\n\nJosh was shocked by his wife’s condition.\n\n“To see in a matter of maybe five minutes, for her to go from a normal temperature to the condition she was in was really, really scary,” he said. “Very quickly, she went downhill very, very fast. She was in a state I’ve never seen her in.”\n\nJosh rushed his wife to the hospital. Her temperature was 102 degrees. She was too weak to walk on her own.\n\nHer temperature went up to 103 degrees. Finally, Amanda was sick enough that the doctors felt legally safe to terminate the pregnancy, she said.\n\n‘I was really scared I was going to lose her’\n\nBut Amanda was so sick that antibiotics wouldn’t stop the bacterial infection raging through her body. A blood transfusion didn’t cure her, either.\n\nAbout 12 hours after her pregnancy was terminated, doctors and nurses flooded her room.\n\n“There’s a lot of commotion, and I said, ‘what’s going on?’ and they said, ‘we’re moving you to the ICU,’ and I said, ‘why?’ and they said, ‘you’re developing symptoms of sepsis,’ ” she said.\n\nSepsis, the body’s extreme response to an infection, is a life-threatening medical emergency.\n\nAmanda’s blood pressure plummeted. Her platelets dropped. She doesn’t remember much from that time.\n\nBut Josh does.\n\n“It was really scary to see Amanda crash,” he said. “I was really scared I was going to lose her.”\n\nFamily members flew in from across the country because they feared it would be the last time they would see Amanda.\n\nDoctors inserted an intravenous line near her heart to deliver antibiotics and medication to stabilize her blood pressure. Finally, Amanda turned the corner and survived.\n\n‘These barbaric laws’\n\nBut her medical ordeal isn’t over.\n\nAmanda’s uterus suffered scarring from the infection, and she may not be able to have more children. She had a surgery recently to fix the scarring, but it’s unclear whether it will be successful.\n\nThat leaves the Zurawskis scared – and furious that they might never have a family because of a Texas law.\n\n“[This] didn’t have to happen,” Amanda said. “That’s what’s so infuriating about all of this, is that we didn’t have to – we shouldn’t have had to – go through all of this trauma.”\n\nThe Zurawskis say the politicians who voted for the anti-abortion law call themselves “pro-life” – but they don’t see it that way.\n\n“Amanda almost died. That’s not pro-life. Amanda will have challenges in the future having more kids. That’s not pro-life,” Josh said.\n\n“Nothing about [this] feels pro-life,” his wife added.\n\nIn many ways, Amanda feels fortunate. She wonders whether she’d be alive today if it weren’t for her husband, who rushed her to the hospital and made sure she got the best care possible. And they have good jobs with good health insurance and they live in a big city with high quality health care.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“All of these things I had going for me, and still, this was the outcome,” she said.\n\nShe and Josh worry about women in rural areas, or poor women, or young, single mothers in states like Texas. What would happen to them, considering what happened to Amanda?\n\n“These barbaric laws prevented her from getting any amount of health care when she needed it, until it was at a life-threatening moment,” Josh said.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Cohen John Bonifield", "Elizabeth Cohen", "John Bonifield"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/12/28/us-population-2023-world-census/72051584007/", "title": "Earth gained 75 million humans in 2023.

By comparison, the world's population will grow by roughly 1% to more than 8 billion on New Year’s Day, an increase of 75 million people this year.\n\nPopulation growth in the U.S. is expected to continue to be fueled by immigrants in the new year, adding one person every 28.3 seconds. The country’s death rate will slightly outpace the birth rate. Projections indicate one person will die every 9.5 seconds, while one will be born only every nine seconds.\n\nWorldwide, 4.3 babies will be born and two people will die each second in January.\n\nMore states saw population gains in 2023 than in any year since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Ultimately, fewer deaths paired with rebounding immigration resulted in the nation experiencing its largest population gain since 2018,” said Kristie Wilder, a demographer with the bureau’s population division.\n\nHow does the US compare to the world?\n\nAs of July, the Census Bureau found the U.S. was the third-most populous country in the world. China had the most people with 1.41 billion. India had slightly fewer – 1.399 billion.\n\nAfter the U.S., Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Brazil, Bangladesh, Russia and Mexico are in line, according to the bureau.\n\nThe United Nations estimated the world’s population will increase by nearly 2 billion over the next 30 years or so, reaching 9.7 billion in 2050 and possibly peaking at nearly 10.4 billion in the 2080s. More than half of the world’s population growth for the next couple of decades is expected to be driven by gains in Africa, according to the agency.\n\nThe U.N. Population Fund said the global population crossed the 7 billion mark in 2011. Historically, it took hundreds of thousands of years to reach a single billion before growing sevenfold in roughly two centuries, the U.N. said. Recent dramatic growth has largely been driven by more people surviving to reproductive age, along with more urbanization and large-scale migration.\n\nCalculating the number of people is not a perfect science with “many sources of uncertainty in estimating the global population,” the Census Bureau said.

The trend has potential consequences for airport businesses, passengers and employees if it lingers, and for big airport projects on the books if it worsens.\n\nRELATED:American Airlines reducing Phoenix pilot base by 500 | Phoenix council approves expansion of Sky Harbor's Terminal 4, Sky Train | First look: Sky Harbor Terminal 3 upgrades\n\nSky Harbor's 2016 passenger count through October is down 1.6 percent from a year ago at a time when most major airports are adding passengers. The decline isn't devastating by any measure but is the worst performance among the nation's 10 busiest airports and one of just two declines among the top 10.\n\nIn contrast, top performers Los Angeles International Airport and Denver International Airport are each up 8 percent. Passenger traffic at Sky Harbor's tiny sister airport, Phoenix-Mesa Gateway in east Mesa, home to discounter Allegiant Air, is up 6.6 percent.\n\nThe lone culprit in Sky Harbor's poor showing: American Airlines, the airport's largest tenant.\n\nAmerican, which accounted for half of the 44 million passengers who flew into and out of Phoenix last year, is shrinking at Sky Harbor, as merger critics feared.\n\nThree years after American and Tempe-based US Airways merged, the airline is cutting flights and shifting to smaller planes on many routes as it carves out Phoenix's role among its nine hubs across the country. It also faces increased competition from low-cost carriers like Frontier and Spirit.\n\nThe upshot: American's passenger count is down 6.5 percent this year, with the pace of the declines accelerating since July.\n\nThrough October, 1.2 million fewer passengers got on or off an American flight at Sky Harbor compared with a year ago. That's the equivalent of losing all the passengers of pre-merger American, which had been a small player at Sky Harbor, or the combined Phoenix passengers of Alaska, Spirit, Hawaiian and JetBlue in the same period.\n\nNo one is sounding alarms that this is the beginning of the end for American's Phoenix hub, a concern since the deal was announced in February 2013 because previous airline mergers had left a trail of closed or downsized hubs in Cleveland, Cincinnati and Memphis. Phoenix is sandwiched between two important American hubs in larger cities, Dallas and Los Angeles, and has significantly less big-dollar business travel than its other hubs because of the lack of corporate headquarters in Arizona.\n\nAmerican still dominates Sky Harbor, with 260 daily non-stop flights and 17.4 million passengers through October. The airline, which says the hub is profitable and here to stay, has added or announced flights to several smaller destinations including Santa Fe, N.M., and Sonoma, Calif., this year, more than any American hub except Los Angeles.\n\nBut it appears the airline will likely shrink more as it shifts its attention to the meat of the merger — creating the most efficient and profitable network of flights — after three years of complicated logistics such as combining the operations and work forces of American and US Airways.\n\nAmerican calls it \"fine-tuning'' and says it is a work in progress.\n\n\"Is (passenger traffic in Phoenix) going to continue to go down? The way we anticipate it right now, we don't anticipate it will go down forever,'' said Vasu Raja, vice president of network planning. \"How it changes still sort of remains to be seen.''\n\nMORE AIRLINE NEWS: American Airlines to close Phoenix flight-training facility | Sky Harbor Airport now posts TSA wait times | Sky Harbor Airport valet parking\n\nAirport officials downplay American's sharp passenger decline this year and don't see the airline's cutbacks as an ominous sign.\n\nPhoenix Aviation Director Jim Bennett called the merger's impact on Sky Harbor \"very minimal.'' He said other airlines, including rapidly growing discounter Frontier, are adding flights and passengers and making for up some of American's passenger losses. The rest of the losses, he said, are connecting passengers who don't park, rent cars, take taxis or stay in hotels, so they create less of an economic ripple effect.\n\n\"Will we have as many passengers this year as we had last year? No. But it will probably be the second-best year in the history of Sky Harbor,'' Bennett said. \"Will it be down next year? Might be. But that does not mean Sky Harbor Airport is going to continue to decline. It will return to growth.''\n\nStill, factoring in increases by smaller airlines, Sky Harbor is down about 580,000 passengers from a year ago and it's unclear where the growth will come from to offset American's declining passenger count. Sky Harbor is already served by all but one U.S. airline (besides Allegiant, which is focused on Mesa). The holdout, Virgin America, was just acquired by Alaska Airlines, which already serves Sky Harbor. The airport is woefully lacking in international flights, an area of growth for other airports.\n\nEconomists and other industry experts say the situation warrants watching.\n\n\"You've got to wonder, is this the start of a trend? Or is there something going on there?'' said Lee McPheters, research professor of economics in the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University and director of the school's JPMorgan Chase Economic Outlook Center.\n\nRELATED: Sky Harbor Then and Now | Arizona Then & Now: Phoenix Sky Harbor Terminal 3\n\nNo one thought Sky Harbor or greater Phoenix would be unscathed by the American-US Airways megamerger, which was announced in February 2013 and closed in December 2013, creating one of the world's largest airlines.\n\nThe US Airways executives in Tempe who engineered the deal and were tapped to run the new American said from the start of the merger talks in 2012 that the combined airline's headquarters would be in Fort Worth, Texas, American's longtime home base. Arizona lost the high-paying jobs and Fortune 500 prestige that came with US Airways' downtown headquarters across from Tempe Beach Park.\n\nExecutives tried to blunt the impact by saying the airline was committed to downtown Tempe even if top executives were leaving, noting that they had signed a new five-year lease on the nine-story building. Last year, they decided to vacate the building earlier than planned, removing the giant US Airways sign atop the building and not replacing it with American's name. The last workers moved out a few months ago. The building is being renovated for its new tenant, payroll giant ADP, but American's logo is still etched into the lobby wall.\n\nFlights and fares were a big concern, too, because airlines routinely streamline their networks after mergers, eliminating route overlap and pruning unprofitable flights, pushing up fares in the process. Despite American and US Airways assurances that there was very little route overlap, federal and state antitrust regulators sued to block the deal on the grounds that it would reduce competition and wasn't good for travelers.\n\nThe airlines made concessions in a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and a promise in a settlement with attorneys general in Arizona and several other states: Flight levels at the airlines' nine hubs including Phoenix would remain the same for three years. US Airways CEO Doug Parker, who became American CEO upon the merger, repeatedly said no one should interpret the three-year timetable as a sign the airline planned to make big cuts anywhere after that.\n\n\"We were willing to agree to three years because we fully intend to keep the hub-and-spoke structure we have in place forever,'' he said at the time.\n\nThe three-year period ended Dec. 13.\n\nAmerican is smaller at Sky Harbor today than the combined US Airways/American was three years ago by every flight measure, though not dramatically enough for casual travelers to notice.\n\nAmerican's departures from Phoenix in December are down 8.1 percent from the merged airline's level in December 2013, to an average of 260 per day from 283, according to FlightGlobal, an international aviation data, analytics and media company. Seats and available seat miles, two measures of capacity, are down, too, but by smaller amounts — 2.9 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.\n\nIn the same period, Southwest Airlines, American's roommate at Sky Harbor's Terminal 4 and the airport's second largest carrier with 30 percent of passengers last year, boosted its number of flights by 8.4 percent, its number of seats by 12.8 percent and its available seat miles by nearly 20 percent. Delta Air Lines posted double-digit gains in each category. Frontier's gains were off the charts because it has grown rapidly in Phoenix the past three years.\n\nAmerican's flight cutbacks have been concentrated in 2016, according to FlightGlobal data. The airline's flights this month are down 6.5 percent from December 2015.\n\nAmerican has eliminated daily non-stop flights to cities including Fort Lauderdale, Cleveland and Calgary, Alberta, this year. It also has reduced the frequency of flights between Phoenix and dozens of cities. Among the routes with the biggest percentage cuts in the number of flights and seats, according to FlightGlobal: Vancouver; Spokane, Wash.; Atlanta; Oakland, Calif.; and Houston, each down 30 percent or more from a year ago.\n\nAirfares in Phoenix haven't risen as a result of the merger but they haven't fallen as fast as fares in the rest of the country. Phoenix fares in the second quarter of this year, the most recent period available, were down 6.8 percent from the same period in 2013, according to the federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Nationally, fares were down 9.7 percent in the same period.\n\nMORE AIRLINE NEWS:Letter: US Airways merger hurts passengers | American Airlines passing first big merger test - so far | US Airways passengers, employees bid airline adieu\n\nAmerican says the biggest changes it has made this year are behind-the-scenes moves involving the best use of its planes. With the airlines combined, Raja says American can move its \"factory\" — the aircraft — to wherever there is demand. Pre-merger US Airways didn't have such flexibility because of a prolonged pilot unions squabble after its merger with America West in 2005.\n\nIn Phoenix, the tweaking has translated into American swapping out the Airbus A321s so prevalent in US Airways' fleet to smaller Boeing 737-800s from American's fleet on many routes. The latter have 25 to 27 fewer seats. Fewer seats means fewer passengers.\n\nRaja said American is making the switch because Phoenix is no longer the hot spot for layovers that it was for US Airways three years ago when the merger occurred. US Airways and predecessor America West built up an oversize hub here in part by enticing bargain-hunting travelers from east and west of Phoenix to save money by connecting at Sky Harbor. The fare savings could be as much as 40 percent over non-stop flights, Raja said.\n\n\"Not surprisingly, a lot of customers would go and take that option,'' Raja said.\n\nDemand for connecting flights in Phoenix and many other cities has diminished, he said, with the growth of low-cost carriers like Frontier and Spirit. They have expanded into major cities, pushing non-stop fares down for all carriers on popular routes like Dallas to Los Angeles. Southwest has also expanded dramatically in Dallas with the lifting of federal flight restrictions from Love Field in 2014.\n\nPassengers are choosing the non-stop flights, so American doesn't need as many seats in Phoenix for connecting passengers. Charlotte, N.C., another big former US Airways hub with even more connecting traffic, has also seen a decline. American's boardings there are down 4 percent this fiscal year versus last.\n\nAmerican has beefed up its flights in Los Angeles, so travelers there have more non-stop options and less need to connect in Phoenix.\n\nBrett Snyder, who worked for America West for a few years and now runs the popular Cranky Flier blog and Cranky Concierge flight-planning and assistance service, said he used to take US Airways from Los Angeles or Long Beach, with a stop in Phoenix, to visit his in-laws in Indianapolis. Now, American offers non-stop service from Los Angeles so he opts for that. That is just one example, he said, of new non-stops from Los Angeles on American.\n\n\"These are people who used to go over Phoenix and now they're skipping Phoenix entirely,'' he said.\n\nAltogether, one-fourth of the decline in passengers boarding American flights in Phoenix through October this year was attributed to fewer connecting passengers, according to an Arizona Republic/azcentral analysis of Sky Harbor's monthly traffic statistics.\n\nThe biggest piece, though, was a decline in locals and visitors heading out of Phoenix on American.\n\nAmerican also is significantly reducing the number of late-night flights out of Sky Harbor, another hallmark of US Airways' operations here. US Airways operated a bank of late-night flights, including red-eye flights, to boost revenue at a time when the planes would otherwise just be sitting there.\n\nThe airline offered so-called flex flying -- flights departing between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. -- on 132 days a year in Phoenix, more than any US Airways hub. It now offers it 49 days a year, such as during the current holiday-travel rush.\n\nInstead, the planes will get maintenance at night and be used for other, more profitable daytime flights. That's an extra 20 to 32 flights per night gone from Phoenix, not to mention a source of cheap fares for travelers willing to travel at odd hours.\n\nLooking ahead to the busy summer-vacation season, American's passenger numbers will likely decrease in Phoenix. The airline will have 8 percent fewer flights out of Sky Harbor next July, traditionally the airport's second busiest month after March, and there will be 7 percent fewer seats, according to FlightGlobal. Delta, in contrast, will have 19 percent more seats in Phoenix next July than it did three years ago.\n\n\"They're going to do what makes economic sense,'' said Robert Mittelstaedt, who retired as dean of ASU's business school just after the merger was announced. \"Part of the problem with Phoenix has always been that it's not as big a place as people think. It's still only the 12th or 13th (biggest) metropolitan area.''\n\nMORE AIRLINE NEWS:Flight-attendant training moving to Texas from Phoenix\n\nAmerican and Sky Harbor officials note that American isn't just subtracting in Phoenix. The airline has added service to nine destinations this year and has announced two new destinations for 2017 — Sonoma, Calif., in northern California's wine country and Bullhead City, Ariz., across the Colorado River from the low-key gambling haven Laughlin, Nev.\n\nRaja admits most aren't \"sexy'' destinations — the cities added this year include Lubbock and Midland/Odessa, Texas, and Roswell, N.M. — but says they are a perfect fit for local and connecting Phoenix passengers. All are commuter flights operated as American Eagle flights by American's regional partners.\n\nDuring the merger build-up, American dangled talk of a Phoenix-London route as a possibility. That has not happened. But the airline has added new international routes out of Dallas and Los Angeles since the merger.\n\n\"We're actually trying to add more unique markets into Phoenix,'' Raja said.\n\nBlogger Snyder said the addition of those flights in Phoenix is encouraging. He said that didn't occur in Memphis and Cincinnati before those cities losing their hubs after airline mergers.\n\n\"There is still an important place for Phoenix and you can see that by some of the routes they've added,'' he said. \"Even though they're not the biggest new destinations, it still shows that they're important for American to serve and Phoenix is the way to serve them.''\n\nBecause American's steepest passenger declines at Sky Harbor began in July, it's too early to gauge the long-term impact. The airport's overall passenger traffic is down 5.1 percent from July through October. American's traffic during that period is down nearly 13 percent.\n\nThere are indications that the drop-off is slightly affecting food and beverage sales in Terminal 4. From July through October, the first four months of the airport's fiscal year, sales were down a fraction from a year ago — $6.11 million vs. $6.14 million — at a time when overall food and beverage sales at all three terminals were up 3.7 percent.\n\nSales at retail shops in Terminal 4, which are in the midst of a makeover with new stores opening, were up 5.9 percent.\n\nTogether, Terminal 4 concessions revenue is up 1.4 percent from the same period a year ago, to nearly $9.2 million.\n\nThe airport did not break out parking by terminal but said overall parking revenue was up 1.9 percent in the July-October period. Rental-car revenue rose 1.7 percent. Total revenue excluding airline landing fees, rent and related aeronautical categories was up 1.4 percent, to $50.8 million.\n\nThe drop-off in passengers comes as Sky Harbor is in the midst of a $590 makeover of Terminal 3 (the first phase opened in early December) and is about to embark on two new projects totaling $950 million. The Phoenix City Council in late October approved the extension of the Sky Train from Terminal 3 to the Rental Car Center and the addition of an eight-gate concourse at Terminal 4, home to American, Southwest and international carriers. The projects will be funded with passenger fees and other airport revenue and bonds and be completed by 2021.\n\nAt the time, Mayor Stanton brushed off concerns about the timing of the investments given a couple months of passenger declines. He said American \"thus far has made a business decision to keep the hub.''\n\n\"We have no reason to think that's not going to continue,'' he said.\n\nAviation Director Bennett said local traffic demand will propel Sky Harbor in the long term.\n\n\"A few months or even a year or two a trend does not make,'' he said. \"As long as Phoenix is a strong economic market, which it is, Sky Harbor will continue to grow and serve that market.''", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/24/till-statue-lin-manuel-miranda-buried-convertible-news-around-states/50868009/", "title": "Till statue, Lin-Manuel Miranda: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nRussellville: A northern Alabama community with large numbers of Hispanic immigrants is using federal COVID-19 relief money to fund an experiment to better serve students who are still learning English. They are hiring and certifying more local, Spanish-speaking staff. More than half of 2,500 students in the small Russellville city school district identify as Hispanic or Latino, and about a quarter are learning English. But the district at times has struggled to find the people and money necessary to help those students achieve. As part of a recent exercise to help the class learn English, a third grader pulled a block from a Jenga tower and read aloud a question written on one side. “Where,” the boy read, then slowly sounded out the other words: “Where would you like to visit?” “Disneyland,” one student said. “Space,” another chimed in. “Guatemala,” one girl said. Kathy Alfaro, a new English language teacher at Russellville Elementary, exchanged a few words with the girl in Spanish, then turned to the other students. “Do y’all know what she said?” Alfaro asked the class. “She said she has a lot of family in Guatemala because she was born there. And I told her that I was born here, but I also have a lot of family in Guatemala.” Districtwide, the percentage of students who met their language proficiency goals increased from 46% in 2019 to 61% in 2022. At the two elementary schools, proficiency jumped by nearly 30 percentage points.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress, received a hero’s welcome Thursday when the Democrat gave the keynote address at the Alaska Federation of Natives conference in Anchorage. Those attending the largest annual gathering of Natives in Alaska showered her with standing ovations, spontaneous songs and gifts, including a bolo tie worn by her Republican predecessor, the late Don Young. Young’s daughter Joni Nelson presented the tie to Peltola, saying it was a passing of the mantle to her. The surprise presentation came after Young’s adult children joined Peltola on stage as she paid tribute to Young, who held Alaska’s sole seat in the House for 49 years until his death in March. Peltola defeated Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich in an August special election to finish out Young’s term. Those three, along with Libertarian Chris Bye, are competing for a full two-year term in the November election. Another of Young’s daughters, Dawn Vallely, later said on stage that her father would have been happy with the results of the special election, won by Peltola. Nelson wore the white beaded tie – which features the state of Alaska in blue beads – onstage but removed it to place it around Peltola’s neck when she greeted the family.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has sued the federal government to be able to keep more than 100 double-stacked shipping containers that Republican Gov. Doug Ducey had placed to fill in gaps along the U.S.-Mexico border near the southwestern desert community of Yuma. The lawsuit filed in federal court in Arizona on Friday asks that the state be allowed to take the unilateral action it believes necessary to defend its residents from migrants illegally crossing the border. Ducey complains the U.S. government is not doing enough to stop migrants from coming to Arizona, forcing the state to take action. The shipping containers went up in August. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation last week sent a letter telling Arizona to take down the containers, saying they are unauthorized and violate U.S. law. Arizona refused. The Cocopah Indian Tribe in southwestern Arizona also complained that some of the containers were placed on its reservation without permission. The Bureau of Reclamation also demanded that no new containers be placed, saying it hoped to prevent conflicts with federal construction contracts to fill the gaps in the wall near the Morelos Dam in the Yuma area.\n\nArkansas\n\nConway: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended her avoidance of local media in her bid for governor Friday as she appeared in her only debate ahead of next month’s election. Sanders, the Republican nominee who is heavily favored in the November election, has conducted few local interviews during her bid for the state’s top office. Sanders had agreed to only one debate with Democratic nominee Chris Jones and Libertarian Ricky Dale Harrington. Sanders said she’s been speaking directly to voters by campaigning around the state. “Freedom of the press is incredibly important, but with freedom of the press comes a great deal of responsibility,” Sanders said. “When they don’t live up to their end of the bargain, it forces some of us to go outside the box, which I have done every single day for the past two years.” Public polling has shown Sanders leading by double digits, and she’s shattered fundraising records in the predominantly Republican state. Early voting begins Monday in Arkansas. During her two year term as ex-President Donald Trump’s chief spokeswoman, Sanders scaled back televised news briefings after repeatedly sparring with reporters who aggressively questioned her. Sanders often sought to justify the lack of formal briefings by saying they were unnecessary when journalists could hear from Trump directly.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAtherton: Three decades after a car was reported stolen in Northern California, police are digging the missing convertible out of the yard of a $15 million mansion built by a man with a history of arrests for murder, attempted murder and insurance fraud. The convertible Mercedes Benz, filled with bags of unused concrete, was discovered Thursday by landscapers in the affluent town of Atherton in Silicon Valley, Mayor Rick DeGolia said, reading a statement from police. Although cadaver dogs alerted to possible human remains Thursday, none had been found more than 24 hours after technicians with the San Mateo County Crime Lab began excavating the car, DeGolia said. Police believe the car was buried 4 to 5 feet deep in the backyard of the home sometime in the 1990s – before the current owners bought the home. The car was reported stolen in September 1992 in nearby Palo Alto, he said. By Friday, the technicians had been able to excavate the passenger side of the convertible, which was buried with its top down. They also opened the trunk, where they found more bags of unused cement. Cadaver dogs were again brought back to the house and again “made a slight notification of possible human remains,” DeGolia said.\n\nColorado\n\nCastle Rock: Brewing beer, cooking food, and refilling water bottles with recycled wastewater could soon become standard practice in a state that’s synonymous with its pristine-tasting snowmelt and mountain springs. Last week, Colorado’s water quality agency gave unanimous preliminary approval to regulate direct potable reuse – the process of treating sewage and sending it directly to taps without first being dispersed in a larger water body. Pending a final vote in November, the state would become the first to adopt direct potable reuse regulations, according to state and federal officials. “Having well-developed regulations … helps ensure projects are safe and that project proponents know what will be required of them,” said Laura Belanger, water resources engineer with the non-profit Western Resource Advocates. As the state’s population explodes, and regional water supplies dwindle, recycling water for drinking is a significant opportunity for stretching a limited supply, said Kevin Reidy, conservation specialist for the Colorado Water Conservation Board. And he said it’s a game changer in a place like Castle Rock, a city of 75,000 just south of Denver nestled under its prominent namesake butte, that relies primarily on pumping finite groundwater for drinking.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Hartford: The grieving widows of two slain police officers gave tearful tributes to their husbands Friday during a funeral attended by thousands of law enforcement officers from around the country. Others who spoke at the service for Bristol Officers Dustin DeMonte and Alex Hamzy pleaded for an end to hatred and suspicion against the police. “To Alex and Dustin, you were both true heroes, amazing people, and you will be missed beyond words by everyone,” said DeMonte’s wife, Laura, who is pregnant with their third child. “I am so sorry this happened to you. Two of the very best humans. So kind, positive and fun-loving.” DeMonte, Hamzy and Officer Alec Iurato were shot Oct. 12 in what police believe was an ambush set up by a 911 call made by the shooter, Nicholas Brutcher. Iurato, who survived a gunshot wound to his leg, struggled to get behind a police cruiser and fired a single shot that killed Brutcher. Brutcher’s brother, Nathan, also was shot – possibly by his brother – and survived. DeMonte was a sergeant with 10 years’ experience on the force, and Hamzy was an officer for eight years. The funeral included formal, posthumous promotions of DeMonte to lieutenant and Hamzy to sergeant.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state auditor was sentenced Wednesday to one year of probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and complete 500 hours of community service for official misconduct and conflict of interest convictions. Auditor Kathy McGuiness avoided jail time for the misdemeanors, each of which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison, news outlets report. McGuiness maintains her innocence, and prosecutors sought a sentence of 30 days in prison for the Rehoboth Beach Democrat based on her lack of remorse. Her attorney argued that a $1,000 fine was sufficient. In July, a Kent County jury convicted McGuiness on three misdemeanor counts but acquitted her on felony charges of theft and witness intimidation. A judge later threw out a misdemeanor conviction for improperly structuring contract payments to a consulting firm, rejecting her request for a new trial. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of her daughter Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness. Prosecutors alleged that Saylar McGuiness, 20, and a friend were hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: First lady Jill Biden will host a roundtable Monday on breast and cervical cancer, part of the administration’s “moonshot” effort to reduce deaths from cancer, the White House said. The event is one of many being launched by the American Cancer Society. Singer Mary J. Blige, an advocate for cancer screening, will participate in the roundtable with Biden. President Joe Biden announced in February his goal of halving cancer deaths in the next 25 years. The issue is personal for the president, whose son Beau Biden died in 2015 of brain cancer. Biden launched the cancer moonshot the following year when serving as then-President Barack Obama’s vice president.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than 230 pythons were removed from the Everglades as part of an annual competition to eliminate the invasive species from the South Florida wetlands preserve. Florida wildlife officials said Thursday that 1,000 hunters from 32 states and as far away as Canada and Latvia removed 231 Burmese pythons during the 10-day competition known as the Florida Python Challenge. Matthew Concepcion won the $10,000 top prize for removing 28 Burmese pythons. Another hunter, Dustin Crum, won a $1,500 prize for removing the longest python, a snake that measured over 11 feet long. Pythons became invasive in Florida after they were brought into the state as pets and then abandoned in the wild by their owners, wildlife officials say. Since 2000, more than 17,000 wild Burmese pythons have been removed from Florida, where they are a destructive presence for native species, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “Every one of the pythons removed as part of the Challenge is one less preying on our native birds, mammals and reptiles,” said Rodney Barreto, the commission’s chairman.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A beer garden near downtown Atlanta filled for a recent event hosted by Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock aimed at Latino voters. Some said they came to seek Warnock, who is seeking reelection in the midterm elections Nov. 8 against Republican challenger Herschel Walker. But others came to see a particularly high-profile Latino who would be speaking on Warnock’s behalf: composer, actor and filmmaker Lin-Manuel Miranda. “Who I’m really here to see is Lin-Manuel Miranda because I’m a really big fan of his,” said Camilla Estrada, of Atlanta, who described herself as liberal and said she plans to vote for Warnock. Georgia Democrats spent the first week of the state’s 19-day early voting period in frantic activity, as they implore supporters to vote in advance. Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams each held multiple events a day. Miranda also appeared with Abrams at a restaurant in suburban Lawrenceville on Wednesday, while the Abrams campaign later rolled out a recorded chat with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday night. Almost 575,000 people had voted in Georgia by the end of Thursday, roughly on pace with the 2020 presidential election, when 5 million votes were cast in the state, buoying Democratic hopes that a big turnout might help them.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines will operate 10 cargo planes for Amazon.com starting next fall under a deal that could eventually involve more planes and give Amazon a 15% stake in the airline. The airline’s parent company, Hawaiian Holdings Inc., said Friday that it will fly and maintain an “initial fleet” of 10 leased Airbus A330-300 jets for the retail giant. The fleet could grow “depending on Amazon’s future business needs,” the company said. Hawaiian said it issued warrants that Amazon can exercise over the next nine years and acquire up to 15% of Hawaiian stock. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings jumped 13% in afternoon trading Friday. When travel plunged and consumer spending spiked early in the pandemic, airlines began carrying more cargo and demand for freighter planes grew. More recently, the cargo business has cooled off as consumer spending shifted away from goods toward services including travel, and airlines have been stuck with excess cargo capacity. Global demand for cargo fell 8.3% in August compared with a year earlier, the International Air Transport Association reported this month. Hawaiian said it won’t use any of its current planes to serve Amazon. Instead, Amazon’s air division will lease the first 10 planes -- which will be converted from passenger jets to freighters -- from leasing company Altavair.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not uncommon for Idaho wildlife officials to be called for help when a moose, mountain lion, black bear or other wild animals wander into one of the state’s rural communities. But Idaho Fish and Game officials are asking the public for help with a particularly unusual find – a 3.5-foot alligator that was discovered hiding in the brush of a rural neighborhood about 40 miles northwest of Boise. Southwest Region spokesperson Brian Pearson told the Idaho Statesman that a New Plymouth resident was walking their dog Thursday evening when they noticed something moving in the brush. Further investigation revealed the alligator – a creature commonly found in the coastal wetlands of the southeastern U.S., but certainly not native to Idaho. Pearson said the resident put the alligator in a nearby horse trailer until Idaho Fish and Game conservation officer could pick it up Friday morning. The department has the animal in captivity for now, but Pearson said it will be euthanized or given to a licensed facility unless the owner is located. Idaho Fish and Game officials are hoping members of the public will call the department if they have any information about the alligator’s origins.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Three young men were fatally shot and two more seriously wounded early Sunday during what police called a caravan of street racers involving about 100 vehicles that took over an intersection on the city’s Southwest Side. The shooting happened about 4 a.m. in Brighton Park after the caravan blocked streets leading to the intersection for illegal street racing, Chicago police Cmdr. Don Jerome said during a news conference. Those killed were between the ages of 15 and 20, Jerome said, adding that the two wounded are expected to survive. Police made no immediate arrests. Caravans blocking streets for drag racing, cars turning doughnuts and “drifting” are a “semi-recent phenomenon where they gather throughout different points of the city, and there were several others last night of no consequence … until this one,” Jerome said. The City Council member for the neighborhood where Sunday’s shooting happened said police and other city officials needed to act more aggressively to shut down such caravans. “This is not just fun and games on the street,” Alderman Raymond Lopez told reporters at the scene. “We are seeing gangs and criminality join into the drifting and drag racing.”\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: A northwestern Indiana man who pleaded guilty to fatally shooting his 9-year-old daughter as he was talking to her two brothers about gun safety won’t serve any prison time for her 2017 death. A Lake County judge sentenced Eric S. Hummel, 38, on Thursday to one year to be served in the county’s community corrections program while living at home, followed by 31/ 2 years of probation. Judge Natalie Bokota accepted the Hobart man’s guilty plea to reckless homicide and neglect of a dependent charges in Olivia Hummel’s death, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. Prosecutors had sought an 81/ 2 -year prison sentence for Hummel, but Bokota said she agreed with Hummel’s attorneys that incarcerating him would result in further trauma to his boys. According to court records, Hummel said he was showing a handgun to his sons and telling them to never play with it “because it can kill someone” when he accidentally shot and killed his daughter. Hummel told a 911 dispatcher he didn’t realize the gun was loaded when he pulled the trigger. He admitted in his plea agreement that he was talking to his sons about gun safety in a bedroom of his Hobart home in June 2017 when he pointed a handgun at the boys and pulled the trigger.\n\nIowa\n\nGrinnell: In a rare move, leaders of Grinnell College and the city appealed this month for the public’s help to put an end to racial harassment, slurs and graffiti that have shaken the campus community this fall. In an open letter to the public Oct. 16, Grinnell Mayor Dan F. Agnew and Grinnell College President Anne F. Harris asked residents to mobilize against the harassment against black citizens, students and community members and not be complacent to any racism they may witness. They urged residents to report any harassment or vandalism to police, tip police if they know any individuals who have been involved, and to enroll in bystander intervention training to help prevent future incidents. Grinnell police said Friday that they had only one formal incident report, and no arrests had been made. But in a statement to the campus community Oct. 12, the private college said there had been several incidents, including defacement of campus signs and vehicles with racist and white supremacist graffiti and harassment of community members by “unknown individuals screaming slurs from moving vehicles.” “We also know that additional incidents may not have been reported,” the statement said. Grinnell, routinely ranked as one of the nation’s best liberal arts colleges, has a diverse student body.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Two years after her mate’s death, a female lion at the Topeka Zoo has grown a mane. The confident, sassy African lion named Zuri was always pretty much in charge of her three-member pride at the zoo, said her animal curator, Shanna Simpson. But staff members were still taken aback when, in the wake of her mate’s death two years ago, the aging lioness began growing what appeared to be a “mohawk” atop her head. That was followed by a rare and significant growth of the fur around Zuri’s head and neck, Simpson said. Zuri is intelligent, feisty and easy to train, Simpson said. The Topeka Zoo acquired Zuri and sister Asante in 2005 from the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas, then in 2006 it acquired Avus from the Henry Vilas Zoo in Madison, Wisconsin, to mate with Zuri and Asante. Avus had a large mane. Female African lions are attracted to males with large manes, Simpson said. Those manes help protect the males as they fight with other lions and with predators such as leopards and hyenas, she said. Zoo staff suspect Zuri’s increase in fur was triggered by the death of Avus, which left she and her sister as the only remaining members of their pride, Simpson said. “She feels like she needs to protect her pride, so her testosterone increases,” Simpson said. “And boom, she’s got more fur around her neck.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Local public transit workers have authorized a strike, but they aren’t walking out just yet. Union members with the Transit Authority of River City voted 95% in favor of the strike authorization Thursday, amid contentious contract negotiations. For now, buses will continue to run as scheduled, with no immediate plans to initiate a strike, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1447 President Lillian Brents said after the vote. The two sides are set to return to the bargaining table Nov. 2. Union leadership said workers want “a safe workplace and a fair contract.” The union is asking for a 6% raise for all workers after one year and 4% raises after years two and three, along with a cost-of-living adjustment of 1.25% every six months. TARC has offered a 3% raise for technical maintenance workers and radio room employees, a 2.5% raise for coach operators and a 1% raise for nontechnical maintenance workers, according to the union. The raises would take place in each year of the three-year contract. They do not include a cost-of-living adjustment. TARC claims the union’s salary demands are unrealistic and would exceed TARC’s annual budget, which is set by Louisville’s mayor and Metro Council.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Prohibitions against nonunanimous jury convictions – outlawed by Louisiana voters in 2018 and, later, by the U.S. Supreme Court – do not have to apply retroactively to earlier convictions, Louisiana’s highest court ruled Friday. The ruling came in the case of Reginald Reddick, convicted of murder by a 10-2 jury vote in 1997, but the court acknowledged it had implications for hundreds of others convicted with 10-2 or 11-1 jury votes. In 2018, Louisiana voters approved a constitutional amendment prohibiting nonunanimous verdicts in trials for crimes committed after Jan. 1, 2019. At the time, Louisiana was one of only two states allowing such verdicts. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that nonunanimous verdicts were unconstitutional, broadening the effect of the state constitutional amendment. But in 2021, the Supreme Court made clear in a case known as Ramos v. Louisiana that its decision against nonunanimous verdicts applied only to future cases and cases in which the defendants’ appeals had not been exhausted. Friday’s state high court majority ruling by Justice Scott Crichton cited the Ramos case and other jurisprudence in determining that neither federal nor state law required a retroactive application of the prohibition.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: A Republican congressional hopeful in a highly competitive race is spreading misinformation about the state’s housing policies, public housing directors said. Former U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin is challenging Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who narrowly defeated the Republican in 2018. During his campaign, Poliquin has relayed a story about a woman living in her car who allegedly told him she was taken off a housing list because of immigrants who are living in the country illegally. Poliquin, who has focused his campaign on issues such as curtailing immigration and protecting gun rights, used the anecdote as part of his argument for increased border security. The Maine Association of Public Housing Authority Directors rebuked the story on Thursday with a statement to the Bangor Daily News that did not name the candidate but came in response to his statements. The statement said: “Such misinformation erodes trust in the public housing system on which so many individuals and families depend for safe, quality affordable housing, and it cannot be left uncorrected.” Eligibility for federal housing assistance is limited to U.S. citizens and noncitizens who have eligible immigration status, federal rules state.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A video shows Republican Dan Cox, who is running for governor, accepting a gift from a young man wearing a shirt with a Proud Boys insignia during the candidate’s primary victory party this summer. The video, obtained by The Washington Post, shows Cox accepting a comb from him. “Here, this is a present from Maryland Proud Boys to you,” the young man said in video footage publicly posted on Cox’s Vimeo account. Members of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, were involved in storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. After accepting the gift, Cox asked the man’s name and shook his hand. “Nice to meet you,” Cox said, before greeting other supporters. The Washington Post reports the clip was removed after the newspaper contacted Cox’s campaign, which responded with a statement denying an association with the young man. “In the noise of the victory celebration, it was hard to hear what was being said,” Cox said, adding that he was surprised by the man handing him something and that “frankly, I did not even keep the comb.” Cox has reiterated false claims that the 2020 presidential election “was stolen” from Donald Trump, and he volunteered to help decertify results in Pennsylvania. He has also issued denials and apologies about his conduct surrounding Jan. 6. Although he said he attended the “Stop the Steal” rally, he has said he left before the march to the Capitol.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlympton: A nearly three-week strike by truckers at New England’s largest wholesale food distributor has come to an end with a new labor agreement, the Teamsters union said. The five-year agreement includes an immediate $5 per hour pay raise, an $11 per hour raise over the course of the agreement, improved retirement benefits, and keeps drivers on the union health insurance plan, the Teamsters Local 653 said in a Facebook post Thursday. About 300 workers at the Sysco facility in Plympton south of Boston went on strike Oct. 1. “I’ve never been prouder to be a Teamster. This fight proves that we truly are the biggest, fastest, strongest union in the world,” Local 653 shop steward Kevin Whitten said. “This strike brought members together like never before and built solidarity that will continue for years to come.” An email seeking comment was left Friday with a spokesperson for Houston-based Sysco. More than a dozen picketers at the facility were arrested early Monday after blocking the exits with tractor-trailers and preventing some employees from leaving. Sysco, which has distribution facilities across the country, supplies food to schools, hospitals, nursing homes, restaurants and other businesses. The Plympton facility remained operational during the strike with third-party drivers.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A teenager accused of killing four fellow students and injuring more at his high school is expected to plead guilty to murder this week, authorities said Friday. Ethan Crumbley had created images of violence during a classroom assignment last November but was not sent home from Oxford High School in southeastern Michigan. He pulled out a gun a few hours later and committed a mass shooting. Authorities have pinned some responsibility on Crumbley’s parents, portraying them as a dysfunctional pair who ignored their son’s mental health needs and happily provided a gun as a gift just days before the attack. They also face charges. Crumbley, 16, is due in court Monday. “We can confirm that the shooter is expected to plead guilty to all 24 charges, including terrorism, and the prosecutor has notified the victims,” said David Williams, chief assistant prosecutor in Oakland County. A message seeking comment was left for the boy’s lawyers. Crumbley was 15 when the shooting occurred at Oxford High, roughly 30 miles north of Detroit.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd’s death are heading to trial on state aiding and abetting counts, the third and likely final criminal proceeding in a killing that mobilized protesters worldwide against racial injustice in policing. J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao have already been convicted of federal counts for violating Floyd’s civil rights and begun serving those sentences. Many witnesses expected to testify at their state trial have already done so at both their federal trial and at the state trial against their former colleague, Derek Chauvin. While much of the evidence in this proceeding will look similar, there will be some key differences. Jury selection gets underway Monday.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: Hundreds of people applauded – and some wiped away tears – as the community unveiled a larger-than-life statue of Emmett Till on Friday, not far from where white men kidnapped and killed the Black teenager over accusations he had flirted with a white woman in a country store. “Change has come, and it will continue to happen,” Madison Harper, a senior at Leflore County High School, told a racially diverse audience at the statue’s dedication. “Decades ago, our parents and grandparents could not envision that a moment like today would transpire.” The 1955 lynching became a catalyst for the civil rights movement. Till’s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, insisted on an open-casket funeral in Chicago so the world could see the horrors inflicted on her 14-year-old son. Jet magazine published photos of his mutilated body, which was pulled from the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi. The 9-foot-tall bronze statue in Greenwood’s Rail Spike Park is a jaunty depiction of the living Till in slacks, dress shirt and tie with one hand on the brim of a hat. The rhythm and blues song “Wake Up, Everybody” played as workers pulled a tarp off the figure. Dozens of people surged forward, shooting photos and video on cellphones.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a top Republican prospect for governor, wants to block public funding for library books that might appeal to the “prurient” – meaning sexual – interests of minors. Ashcroft proposed the new rule on libraries last week. It does not include a more-detailed definition or include examples of which specific books would be restricted as appealing sexually to children or teenagers. In a statement, the Missouri Library Association called Ashcroft’s rule “an infringement on the professional judgment of librarians, and an effort to further stoke division in the communities that libraries serve.” The group warned that small and urban libraries, which rely most on state funding, would face the greatest impact from the policy. Ashcroft on Friday said he didn’t propose the rule in response to any particular book but hoped it would prevent potential issues. “I know that a lot of Missouri libraries are doing a good job on this and reflecting the values of the taxpayers that paid for the materials,” Ashcroft said. “But I just think it’s good to have some guidelines to make sure that we’re reinforcing that parents are in control.” The proposal would require state-funded libraries to adopt policies on the age-appropriateness of literature, which is already common at both school and public libraries in the state. And under the rule, anyone could challenge access to books. The proposal is what’s known as an administrative rule, which would have the same effect as a law if enacted.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two physician groups have asked state election officials to issue a correction to statements printed in a voter information pamphlet that they argue are false and and could confuse voters as they consider an abortion-related ballot measure. The complaint comes from two groups that oppose a referendum that would raise the prospect of criminal charges for health care providers unless they take “all medically appropriate and reasonable actions to preserve the life” of an infant born alive, including after an attempted abortion. At issue is language in the pamphlet written by supporters that explains the proposed measure. Supporters say the referendum requires medical care to be provided if an infant is born alive after induced labor, cesarean section, attempted abortion or other method. The physicians say that supporters dropped a word from the language of the proposal and that the law, if passed, would also apply to an infant born as a result of natural labor, even if a fetus was born extremely preterm, and regardless of the infant’s prognosis or the family’s wishes. The complaint was made Friday by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology on Friday. They asked the Montana Secretary of State’s Office to issue a correction to statements.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific delivered 13% more profit in the third quarter, but the railroad predicted Thursday that its customers will ship fewer items than it expected, confirming the economy is slowing down in the face of soaring inflation. The Omaha-based railroad said it now expects the number of shipments it handles to be up about 3% this year and match the third-quarter number. Previously, Union Pacific had predicted that volume would be up 4% to 5% this year. “I have no idea if we’re in a recession or one is looming,” UP CEO Lance Fritz said. “I do know that the economy is slowing down.” Union Pacific reported $1.9 billion profit, or $3.05 per share, in the quarter. That’s up from $1.67 billion, or $2.57 per share, a year ago, but this year’s results were weighed down because the new contracts the railroads agreed to with their 12 unions cost $114 million more than Union Pacific had been planning on. Without that one-time charge for the new contracts, which only half of the unions have approved, Union Pacific would have reported earnings per share of $3.19. The results exceeded Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $3.06 per share.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A rural county can start hand-counting mail-in ballots two weeks before Election Day, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday, but it won’t be allowed to livestream the tallying and must make other changes to its plans. The ruling came in response to an emergency petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, which challenged several aspects of Nye County’s plan to start hand-counting votes this week. The ACLU said in its lawsuit that the plan risked leaking early voting results. It also said that rules on touch screens to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act were too vague and restrictive and that the county violated state law with its “stringent signature verification” for voter ID. Located between Las Vegas and Reno, rural Nye County was one of the first jurisdictions nationwide to act on election conspiracies related to mistrust in voting machines. Alongside the primary machine tabulation process, Interim County Clerk Mark Kampf’s plans to publicly hand-count all paper ballots. The hand count was first proposed to county commissioners by Republican secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant in response to false claims about Dominion voting machines. Sadmira Ramic, the ACLU of Nevada’s voting rights attorney, praised the ruling.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nKeene: A small plane crashed into a building, killing the two people on board and sparking a large fire on the ground, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement Saturday that a single-engine Beechcraft Sierra aircraft crashed into a building north of Keene Dillant-Hopkins Airport in Keene on Friday evening. City officials said on their Facebook page that no one was injured in the building hit by the plane but that “those on the plane have perished.” “The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate. The NTSB will be in charge of the investigation and will provide additional updates,” the FAA said. Keene Mayor George Hansel told the Associated Press that two people on the plane died but that they have not been identified. He said the the plane hit a two-story barn connected to a multi-family apartment building. All eight people were evacuated from the apartment building due to the subsequent fire. At a morning press conference, Hansel said the plane was owned by Monadnock Aviation, which is based at the airport. He said it was unclear where the plane was headed, and no one answered the phone at Monadnock. The cause of the crash remains under investigation, and the operations at the airport were not affected, he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s new K-12 public school mental health plan is facing lots of opposition from state lawmakers who say they won’t back its proposal to eliminate the decades-old School Based Youth Services program, which provides critical counseling and support for teens in low-performing districts. The School Based Youth Services program, set up in 90 of the state’s public schools, is scheduled to be eliminated by June 2023 to make way for NJ4S, New Jersey Statewide Student Support Service Network, an expanded and revamped system that would be available to all or most of the state’s 2,400 schools. Unveiled in October as a “first-in-the-nation” effort to centralize services and spread them beyond schools and into libraries, group homes and social service agencies, NJ4S was in the works for more than a year and created as a response to the pandemic’s teen mental health crisis under the guidance of Department of Children and Families’ Commissioner Christine Norbut Beyer. But it was immediately met with intense criticism from educators and advocates who support expanding services but said the time-tested school-based programs must also stay.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. Department of Agriculture will waive cost-sharing requirements for farmers and ranchers affected by the largest wildfire in the state’s recorded history. U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján on Thursday announced that the agency will cover cost sharing for emergency forest restoration, conservation and other environmental improvement programs. The move follows the approval of a massive federal spending bill that included $2.5 billion in relief for those affected by the fire and post-fire flooding. That bill included a provision to waive cost sharing for all programs administered by the USDA. The wildfire was sparked by two government planned burns earlier this year. It ripped through hundreds of square miles of forest and grazing lands, destroying homes and the livelihoods of many of the rural residents. Through no fault of their own, Luján said, residents lost large swaths of cherished lands and will have to grapple with the effects for years. “Our farmers and ranchers, business owners and families deserve relief to recover,” he said in a statement.\n\nNew York\n\nBuffalo: The victims of a racist mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket will be honored with a permanent memorial in the neighborhood, elected and community leaders announced Friday. The shooting “is part of the Buffalo story forever going forward,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said. “We want to do something that people remember. A place to come and reflect. A place to honor. And a place to say never again.” Former Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield, whose 86-year-old mother Ruth Whitfield was among the 10 Black people killed May 14, is among those appointed to a planning commission tasked with acquiring land, seeking input on the design, securing funds and maintaining the monument. Buffalo NAACP President Mark Blue will lead the effort. “It’s not going to take the place of my mother or the lives of the other loved ones that were lost here,” Whitfield said. “So we will forever miss them and honor their legacy by what we do going forward.” The officials did not specify a budget or timeline for the project’s completion. Brown said numerous businesses and people have offered to contribute. Payton Gendron, 19, has been charged with killing 10 and wounding three others at the Tops Friendly Market. Investigators said he drove 200 miles from his Conklin home intending to kill as many Black people as possible at the store, which he targeted because of its location in the predominantly Black East Buffalo neighborhood. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSalisbury: A man who was shot during a weekend concert at Livingstone College has been identified as a suspected shooter and is now facing charges, officials said Tuesday. The shooting took place Saturday during a performance featuring rapper Asian Doll at the historically Black college in Salisbury. Police are also asking for help identifying another person of interest. Salisbury police obtained a warrant charging Talib Latrell Kelly, 21, of Salisbury, with attempted first-degree murder, discharging a firearm on educational property and possession of a firearm by a felon, the department said. Kelly is not a Livingstone student, Salisbury police Capt. P.J. Smith said at a news conference. Officers were called to the campus about 11 p.m. and found gunshot victims and others who had been hurt as concertgoers fled the gunfire, city officials said in a statement. Video footage from the event shows that a fight broke out while Asian Doll was on stage. Two male victims were taken to Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center in Charlotte with gunshot wounds, and officials also identified a woman who had a superficial wound to her neck, Smith said. None of the victims’ injuries were considered life-threatening, he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A North Dakota farmer who had been detained in Ukraine since November 2021 on accusations he planned to kill his business partner is back home, the state’s two U.S. senators announced Friday. Kurt Groszhans, from Ashley, North Dakota, has ancestors from Ukraine and went there to farm in 2017. The relationship with his partner, law professor Roman Leshchenko, crumbled after Groszhans alleged that Leshchenko embezzled money from him. Groszhans and his assistant were arrested on charges of plotting to assassinate Leshchenko, who was then Ukraine’s agriculture minister. Groszhans said in a statement Friday that the Ukrainian officials made up the charges in an “effort to shut me up” after he discovered corruption “at the highest levels” of the government. “I am grateful to be home after this horrible ordeal,” Groszhans said in a statement. “My family and supporters worked tirelessly over a long period of time to make this happen and it was nice to be able to celebrate my birthday on North Dakota soil. The fact they refused to classify me as a wrongful detainee was an unfortunate and politically cowardly act that cost me almost a year of my life,” he said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The state of Ohio will not require the COVID-19 vaccine for school students despite a recommendation from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel. A panel with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday recommended adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the federal government’s list of routinely recommended vaccinations. The panel’s decision, likely to be adopted by the CDC director, formally adds the shot to a list often used by schools and health officials in making vaccination requirements. Ohio leaders made it clear Friday that the vaccine would not be required for Ohio students. “The State of Ohio does not mandate the COVID-19 vaccine for school attendance. The ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) vote does not change Ohio law. The state’s list of required vaccines can only be changed through legislation,” Ohio Department of Health Director Bruce Vanderhoff said in a statement. Indeed, not every vaccine on the list has been adopted by Ohio as a requirement for schoolchildren, such as flu shots. A list of required vaccines for schools and child care in Ohio can be viewed on the Ohio Department of Health website.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A private foundation has raised more than $6 million to build a residence for future Oklahoma governors and their families, under a plan that calls for the current mansion near the state Capitol to be used for official meetings and special events, according to Gov. Kevin Stitt and people involved in the project. Talks about building a new home on the mansion grounds predate Stitt’s inauguration in 2019 and grew out of concerns about the cost of renovating the century-old structure. Stitt told reporters on Wednesday that he and his family – who lived only temporarily in the mansion – would not live in the new residence if he wins a second term next month. “It will not benefit Gov. Stitt,” he said. The foundation, Friends of the Mansion, is expected to announce plans for the residence after the Nov. 8 election. The foundation was created in 1995 by former Gov. Frank Keating and former first lady Cathy Keating to pay for renovations and additions. The new residence is envisioned for land behind the current mansion. Plans would have to be approved by two zoning commissions that oversee the area near the Capitol.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The mayor plans to ban camping on city streets and move unhoused people to designated campsites, as the growing homeless population has become the top concern for the vast majority of residents. “The magnitude and the depth of the homeless crisis in our city is nothing short of a humanitarian catastrophe,” Mayor Ted Wheeler said Friday. “We need to move our scattered, vulnerable homeless population closer to the services that they need.” The resolution would establish at least three large, designated outdoor camping sites, with the first opening within 18 months of securing funding. Wheeler didn’t specify when the funding would be confirmed or how much the measure would cost. The designated camping sites would initially be able to serve up to 125 people and would provide access to services such as food, hygiene, litter collection and treatment for mental health and substance abuse, Wheeler said. The sites could eventually serve 500 people. Oregon’s homelessness crisis has been fueled by a housing shortage, the coronavirus pandemic and drug addiction. More than 3,000 people are living without shelter in Portland, a 50% jump from 2019, and there are more than 700 encampments across the city, Wheeler said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s elections chief wants legal penalties against two Republican county officials and their lawyer for what she calls in a new court filing their “unprecedented, reckless decision” to give an outside group access to voting machines during pending litigation on that subject. Lawyers for acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman last week asked the state Supreme Court to hold in contempt the two Fulton County commissioners and to dismiss the litigation that had been scheduled for oral argument before the justices this week. Chapman was appointed by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. On Friday afternoon, the justices appointed Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer as a special master to gather evidence on the contempt request and make a report with recommendations by Nov. 18. During their long-running dispute with the state, Fulton County GOP Commissioners Stuart Ulsh and Randy Bunch had allowed one group, Wake TSI, access to voting machines as part of the failed effort to locate fraud that might overturn ex-President Donald Trump’s 2020 election defeat. That prompted the Department of State to tell counties they “shall not” allow such access to voting machines. Ulsh and Bunch were moments away from permitting a second group, Envoy Sage, to inspect the machines in January when the state Supreme Court put that on hold. The inspection planned in January was to involve computers, electronic poll books, ballot scanners and possibly more.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A lawsuit claiming that Brown University failed to protect female students from sexual harassment and assault can move forward in part, a federal judge ruled last week. Four former students filed a federal class action suit in August 2021 alleging that the university systemically and repeatedly failed to protect women from harm, including rape, despite knowing that sexual assault on campus is “endemic.” Two current students later joined the suit. The university moved to dismiss the suit in March. On Oct. 18, U.S. District Court Judge John J. McConnell Jr. allowed the plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief to go forward but denied their efforts to seek monetary relief. The plaintiffs were enrolled between 2018 and 2021. The plaintiffs can sue to force Brown to “ensure that the Title IX office receives, investigates and resolves complaints.” The plaintiffs must still prove that their suit meets the criteria for class-action certification. Title IX protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or in activities that receive federal financial assistance.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Months after accusing disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh of killing his wife and son, investigators and prosecutors have released few details about the evidence that they believe connect him to the shootings. That’s led Murdaugh’s lawyers to file a flurry of court documents requesting information from the prosecution, seeking to publicly weaken the case before the January trial has begun. The defense attorneys argue that there was unknown DNA found under Murdaugh’s wife’s fingernails. They also have a different suspect, Murdaugh’s friend Curtis Eddie Smith, arguing that he failed a lie detector test regarding the killings. Murdaugh has already admitted to asking Smith to arrange Murdaugh’s own death to defraud his life insurance company. Those defense documents even boosted a story from Smith that prosecutors later said had no evidence to back it up – that Paul Murdaugh killed his mother, Maggie, when he caught her with a groundskeeper at the family’s Colleton County hunting lodge, and the groundskeeper then shot the son. Alex Murdaugh, 54, has proclaimed his innocence ever since June 2021, when he found the bodies, each shot several times. He has said through his lawyer he “loved them more than anything in the world.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nVermillion: The University of South Dakota may welcome a new sorority chapter in the coming years. Alpha Pi Omega, the country’s oldest Indigenous Greek letter organization, could open doors on campus if enough students express interest, according to a flier circulated on social media promoting an informational session held Oct. 13. APO is a sisterhood of Indigenous women who are committed to each other, communities, tribes, families, academic excellence and self-empowerment, according to the flier. Its philanthropic cause is the National Indian Education Association. Hanna Delange, a spokesperson for USD, said nothing has been solidified yet with the sorority’s plans but confirmed the informational session took place as a chance for students to learn about the potential organization. Brooke Poppe, director of sorority and fraternity life on USD’s campus, said while there is no current timeline to open the sorority, the plan moving forward is on hold until there is enough student interest. It takes five or more students to start any student organization on campus. When or if Poppe receives a list of interested students, USD can move forward with the APO national organization in the expansion process. Poppe said her office hopes to have that potential list together by the end of the semester.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Employees of Bess T. Shepherd Elementary School blasted a recent nighttime prayer meeting over the school’s exterior loudspeaker, although district officials said it was an accident. An unidentified neighbor who could hear the praying from inside his or her home Monday night posted a video on the Reddit website that recorded about two minutes of a speaker praying over the intercom, the Chattanooga Times Free Press reports. “This went on for 45 minutes,” the video caption said. The video included a woman’s voice repeatedly saying, “We need you in this school, God. We need you in every school, God.” She spoke of casting the things of hell “back to the abyss” and said: “You cannot rule in this school. You cannot rule in the hearts and minds of the children.” The speaker also prayed over staff members. District officials said the prayer meeting occurred about 6 p.m. Monday, although they were not aware of it until Thursday morning. “There were staff members inside the building praying who were unaware the external intercom system was enabled,” district spokesperson Steve Doremus said in an email. “As soon as they were made aware, the intercoms were turned off.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Texas Department of Public Safety fired an officer Friday who was at the scene of the Uvalde school massacre and becomes the first member of the state police force to lose their job in the fallout over the hesitant response to the May attack. The department served Sgt. Juan Maldonado with termination papers, spokeswoman Ericka Miller said. No details were offered about his role at the scene of the May 24 shooting at Robb Elementary School or the specific reason Maldonado was fired. The firing comes five months after the mass shooting that has put state police under scrutiny over their actions on the school campus as a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle killed 19 children and two teachers. Maldonado could not be reached for comment Friday night. Body camera footage and media reports have shown the Department of Public Safety had a larger role at the scene than the department appeared to suggest after the shooting. State troopers were among the first wave of officers to arrive but did not immediately confront the gunman, which experts say goes against standard police procedure during mass shootings.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox hosted the first of what governors across the U.S. are planning to be a series of new discussions on how states could address mental health issues. Neither Cox nor other governors involved are proposing specific policy solutions so far, but that isn’t the point – the idea is to listen to physicians, pediatric psychologists, educators, parents and others to try to find areas of consensus. Cox, the vice chair of the National Governors Association, is among a bipartisan group of governors who have joined NGA chair Phil Murphy, the governor of New Jersey, in forwarding the “Strengthening Your Mental Health” initiative, with the ultimate goal of finding nonpartisan policies that states everywhere might adopt. Over two days at a roundtable event in Salt Lake City, Cox, a Republican, and Murphy, a Democrat, hosted a series of conversations on the topic, hoping to hear experts’ opinions on potential solutions connected to prevention, early intervention and resilience building. “Youth mental health is an urgent issue in Utah and nationwide,” Cox said. “The (COVID-19) pandemic has heightened the problem, and it’s important that we be proactive in bolstering support resources and letting young people know that help is available.”\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: A fired deputy who is the only candidate on the November ballot to become sheriff of the county where he served was charged Friday with simple assault for kicking a shackled prisoner, authorities said. John Grismore, 49, of Fairfax, was cited on the charge Friday through his attorney. He is due in court Monday in St. Albans to answer the charge, Vermont State Police said in a news release. Surveillance cameras recorded the prisoner being kicked Aug. 7. In the Aug. 9 primary, Grismore won the nominations of both Franklin County’s Republican and Democratic parties to have his name on the November ballot for sheriff. But after the video became public, he was suspended and then fired by outgoing Franklin County Sheriff Roger Langevin. The county Republican and Democratic parties gave their support to a write-in campaign by Sheriff’s department Lt. Mark Lauer, a 27-year Vermont State Police veteran who has been at the department for nearly a decade. Gale Messier is also running a write-in campaign. He spent decades in law enforcement including 20 years at the sheriff’s department in Chittenden County, Vermont’s most populous county. On Friday, Grismore said in an email that “the story is still the same” and that he had nothing new to add.\n\nVirginia\n\nFort Belvoir: A “barricade situation” drew the FBI and other law enforcement officials to a U.S. Army base outside the nation’s capital Sunday, according to the official Twitter account of Fort Belvoir in northern Virginia. The base tweeted shortly before 1 p.m. that its law enforcement officials, local police and the FBI had responded “to a barricade situation” Sunday morning. “The situation is ongoing, & we cannot comment further at this time,” the base tweeted. It provided no other details except to say some of the gates to the installation remained open. The situation was inside a home, WUSA-TV reports. Fort Belvoir sits on about 8,800 acres of land along the Potomac River in Fairfax County and is located about 20 miles south of Washington. The base is home to several Army command headquarters, elements of the Army Reserve and Army National Guard and nine Department of Defense agencies, according to a Department of Defense website that serves the military community. The installation has 2,154 family housing quarters and seven child youth service facilities, according to Fort Belvoir’s 2022 strategic plan.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Authorities said Friday that they arrested three suspects in the slayings of two people and shooting of a police officer after a daylong search on a tribal reservation in northeastern Washington. The Colville Tribes Emergency Services said on Facebook on Friday evening that the third suspect was arrested in Elmer City, one of several small communities on the rural reservation. Two others were arrested earlier in the day. The search for the suspects began after the Colville Tribal Police Department responded to a report of a shooting Thursday in Keller, a small community about 275 miles east of Seattle. Officers found two people dead, and an officer who came across a vehicle described as having left the scene was shot in the arm, according to the department. He was doing well after being transported for medical care, the department said in a news release. Police identified two of the suspects as Curry Pinkham and Zachary Holt. Robin Redstar, a Colville Tribal member and Nespelem resident, said she and other residents waited in their home for hours, and at one point one of the suspects was believed to be in a gully behind her house. Authorities eventually arrested a man in front of her home around 10 a.m. after he tried to enter her neighbor’s back door, Redstar said. Her neighbor, a hunter with guns, was able to detain the man and get him to the street, where a tribal police car was waiting, Redstar said. “It was pretty quick. Corbie (the neighbor) was giving him a good speech about morals,” she said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Voters will get the final say on a ballot question that would amend the state constitution to give the Republican-dominated Legislature control over virtually every aspect of public schooling. The vote comes amid a fight raging nationally over the politicization of schools. West Virginia’s Republican leaders have joined politicians elsewhere in pushing to regulate how subjects such as race are taught in classrooms and funnel public money into alternative education options, including charter schools and voucher programs. Just this year, the state Board of Education joined a lawsuit against top Republicans over a school choice program – one of the nation’s most expansive – alleging it unconstitutionally drains money from public schools. The case went to the state Supreme Court, which sided with lawmakers. And in a state that once was a stronghold of organized labor, some see the proposed amendment as part of an effort to defang the most formidable center of union power left standing: public school employees. Four years after more than 30,000 school workers went on strike in one of the nation’s poorest states, igniting teacher walkouts nationwide, many say they’re overworked and exhausted.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A Milwaukee County judge on Friday denied a Republican Party of Wisconsin request to stop the city of Milwaukee from continuing a get-out-the-vote effort that the city argues it neither runs nor funds. Judge Gwen Connolly wrote that the arguments made by the party and Milwaukee voter Elizabeth Burke were “deficient” and that issuing such an order would chill constitutionally protected free speech. The lawsuit was one of two filed by the Republican Party of Wisconsin and other plaintiffs in the weeks after Mayor Cavalier Johnson made comments Sept. 12 about an initiative dubbed “Milwaukee Votes 2022” and referenced door-to-door canvassing funded by the “private sector.” Johnson’s spokesman then said the campaign conducting the canvassing is privately funded, and the city’s association was “limited to the mayor voicing support for the work.” The first lawsuit, which centered on an open records request, was dismissed earlier this month after the party said it had received the requested records from the Milwaukee Election Commission and Mayor’s Office related to the get-out-the-vote effort. In the second lawsuit, filed Sept. 28, Burke and Republicans argued that though Milwaukee Votes 2022 is a purportedly nonpartisan get-out-the-vote effort, the city would partner with an organization, GPS Impact, that openly works to elect Democratic candidates and advance progressive causes.\n\nWyoming\n\nPinedale: A hunter accidentally shot himself in the leg while trying to fight off a grizzly bear attack in west-central Wyoming – the second such attack in a week’s time, officials said. Lee Francis, 65, of Evanston, was taken to the University of Utah Health hospital for treatment after the encounter Friday, the Sublette County Sheriff’s Office said. Francis was hunting with his son in an area south of Grand Teton National Park on Friday evening when the bear attacked him. He was able to fire several rounds from his handgun, causing the bear to run away, but one of the rounds hit Francis in the lower leg, the sheriff’s office said. His son used a satellite phone to call for help just before 6 p.m., then began providing first aid. His son was able to help his father onto a horse, and they headed toward a nearby lake to meet search and rescue crews. Francis was eventually taken to the hospital via helicopter, the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Wildlife officials had not located the grizzly bear, Sgt. Travis Bingham with the Sublette County Sheriff’s Office said Sunday. Because it was snowing, Game and Fish planned to try to search for the bear again Monday, weather permitting, he said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}]}

Even more recently, Kylie Jenner and Tyga (who met when Jenner was 14 and Tyga was 21) and Florence Pugh and Zach Braff (21-year gap) raised eyebrows, as have several of Scott Disick's relationships.\n\nIt's a tale as old as the silver screen thanks to the love affair fans have had with the idea of two co-stars falling in love on set – and it was and is \"common for older leading men to be cast opposite much younger romantic female leads,\" McDonnell notes.\n\n\"Like much of the media, casting in films both reflects and shapes the culture,\" McDonnell adds. \"It reflects a society in which youth and beauty are highly valued in women and in which older men are associated with wisdom, prowess and power often through wealth.\"\n\nRelationship age gaps are prevalent no matter the couple's genders, such as Olivia Wilde and Harry Styles, Holland Taylor and Sarah Paulson, and Elton John and David Furnish, though it's more commonly called out in cases with older men and younger women.\n\nNow, some are calling out their former partners after feeling taken advantage of.

Does it feel comfortable?

Beating Trump is too ...", "text": "Ashley Judd\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWednesday evening, I was visiting, as we say in the South, with some of my beloved chosen and biological family. These folks are my roots, my sense of belonging, and meet many of my most intimate human needs.\n\nAnd some of them, remarkably, feverishly love Donald Trump.\n\nAnd I love these Trump folks as if my life depended on it, and at times, it literally has. I do not love the beliefs they believe and cling to.\n\nAnd Wednesday, as I listened to one of my dearest people share some of those beliefs and thoughts, it hurt. I was shaken. My body felt like it was on fire. The words activated in me profound alarm in the aftermath of the recent debate at which President Joe Biden, a deeply decent man, was incapable of countering Trump, while he, unchecked, gushed a firehose of galling lies.\n\n“Those people pouring over our border are less evolved than we are. They are naturally less intelligent. They have criminal natures. They are incapable of respecting the rule of law and order.”\n\n“Men must be strong. They cannot be weak.” We were talking about the wish for boys and men to experience a full range of human emotions without shame or punishment. “It is dog-eat-dog and men will get eaten if they show any weakness. China has a massive, 2-million-man army. They aren’t teaching DEI. Good men must be willing to kill at any moment, but just know how to control that impulse.”\n\nAnd Trump folks can act on those beliefs. Another one of my closest people, upon arriving at our local mall, came across Black youth hanging out, laughing, sitting on the hoods of cars. She went inside the mall to notify the security person on duty that Black kids were menacingly loafing and up to no good. The security person called the police.\n\nI do not necessarily think all Trump supporters believe, feel, act and speak like this. I know Donald Trump himself does. That is critical. That is why I have come to realize that my private, personal belief is one I should no longer just keep to myself.\n\nAnd so, I now ask President Joe Biden to step aside.\n\nIt's time for Joe Biden to leave the 2024 race\n\nThe defense of our cherished rights and freedoms, the moral imperative that we do better by more people, and our bodies, cannot be left to voters who see and are frightened of the consequences of President Biden’s obvious limitations, or who are now not going to vote. We take the risk of an off night and minimize the warning signs at our gravest peril.\n\nYou may judge me or be baffled by how and why I can continue to live with and love people who feel and act upon the same harmful beliefs that Trump espouses. And, of course, I wholly realize they feel my beliefs and positions are equally odious. I am humbled and grateful they neither exile me from our family nor allow our significant differences to taint their love for me.\n\nAs Father Richard Rohr has written, we live in a \"mixed reality.\" I forgive reality for being so mixed. And I do not choose to sanitize reality or my life. I trust real, however messy it is, and however much it hurts to hold this complexity.\n\nMy deal breaker is not with my loved ones who are thrilled by Donald Trump. I cannot change them. I tried that, failed at that, damaged our relationships by trying that, and I have had enough loss in my life. I neither want to nor will I lose any more of my folks, especially over politics. My deal breakers with Donald Trump are many, but after listening Wednesday night in that living room, what is searing me is the cruelty. It cannot be America’s future.\n\nAshley Judd:We have the power to help women and girls caught in crises. Why won't we?\n\nWe can't risk a Trump presidency\n\nI feel immense, bereft sadness at the beliefs Donald Trump holds, and that his supporters endorse. But that sadness is trivial compared to the hurt, devastation and loss millions will feel if Donald Trump is reelected. He would wield the power of the presidency with unprecedented, incalculable cruelty and unfairness.\n\nEspecially disturbing is his distortion of Christianity, the force of Christian Nationalism advancing him, and the risks for anyone who diverges from that.\n\nBiden? Harris?I don't care. Stopping Trump and Project 2025 is all that matters.\n\nThis is not something I wrote easily, quickly or for political convenience. My belief in what President Biden has done for our country runs deep. My hopes for the next term run high. My investment is personal. I bring my body. I show up. I am a Democrat who relishes traveling up to Wisconsin for early voting, bringing coffee and doughnuts at 6 a.m. to first-time voters who have slept overnight on the sidewalk outside their polling place, so eager to cast their ballots for an inaugural experience.\n\nShowing up publicly can cost me, and it absolutely will for far too many if Trump is reelected. When I read the “I am a Nasty Woman” poem at the Women’s March in 2017, I quoted Donald Trump. I was fired for doing so, by a company with whom I had an endorsement.\n\nTrump said it. He was elected. I quoted him, I lose a life-altering paycheck. That is the double standard of American life for women under Donald Trump. And for all who disagree with him.\n\nAnd writing this essay will cost me. Some, perhaps many, people will scorn me (and worse). Their outrage at me is insignificant compared to the harm that is assured under a second Trump term for, say, our LGBTQ+ families.\n\nWith Donald Trump in leadership, speech is chilled. Dissent is punished. Sharing your truth about your life in America can risk your livelihood. When a man raped me in 1998, I was able was have a safe, legal abortion that was accessible right where I live in Tennessee.\n\nWe already know many states ban abortions and 10 states have no exceptions for rape and incest, even for adolescent girls. This is reality for girls and women under Donald Trump and it must be the principle on which President Biden chooses to voluntarily, gracefully step aside.\n\nVoters deserve a real choice on the Democratic ticket\n\nMuch has been said and printed about the historic progress of this Biden administration. Historic job creation. Visionary investment in America that future generations will feel. I have a deep appreciation and fond regard for him.\n\nEqually, much has been said and printed about what Donald Trump has done and will do. I have been watching and listening.\n\nAs my mom’s dear friend Dr. Maya Angelou said, “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” Donald Trump, I see you, and I believe you.\n\nThus, because of the very real hurt millions of people would feel when he is president again, the Democratic Party must not delay in thanking President Biden and supporting a talented, robust Democrat to be our party’s nominee. We do not have another day for distraction or division among ourselves.\n\nSome in Washington may want to wait for the next week, the next press conference, the next network interview. Here, where I sit in rural Tennessee, it is clear that Americans have already made up their minds against President Biden, on top of the majority who love to vote for Donald Trump.\n\nMy folks are not bad people, despite what you may now think of them. They are facing bad options. We must give them a different choice from our Democratic Party for president of the United States.\n\nAshley Judd is a humanitarian, writer and actor.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/people/2022/11/22/kendall-jenner-devin-booker-november-2022-breakup/69671352007/", "title": "Kendall Jenner and Devin Booker's relationship debuted in Arizona ...", "text": "For the seemingly on-and-off again celebrity couple Kendall Jenner and Devin Booker, it all started and now has reportedly ended in Arizona.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns star and model-slash-tequila-brand-founder who comes from Kardashian family fame have supposedly ended their more than two-year relationship due to busy schedules, according to People.

On Oct. 26, Booker posted videos of himself and another person — who looks like Jenner from the back — walking with his dog, Haven, in the woods.\n\nRewinding to the start of Booker and Jenner's relationship, the two were first spotted together in public in April 2020 while on the road to Sedona — and if recent reports are correct, one of the couple's last trips may have been to Flagstaff.\n\nIt seems that things have come full circle for Jenner and Booker.\n\nReach Entertainment Reporter KiMi Robinson at kimi.robinson@gannett.com.

No explanations are needed and indeed if someone were to speak poorly about a recent ex-partner, it’ll potentially cause further problems.\"\n\nOur current era of celebrity social media makes fans feel like they know these celebrities – what's called a parasocial relationship – meaning many will have empathy for the couple in question, barring some kind of cheating scandal where one party may be burnt at the metaphorical stake.\n\n\"We are far more accepting of personal challenges celebrities face and even embrace them when they are forthcoming about their vulnerabilities,\" Laura Petiford, a licensed marriage and family therapist, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nIn case you missed:'Stan' culture needs to stop – or at least radically change. Here's why.\n\nHow to break up (carefully) in the public eye\n\nRemember that only you and your partner will know the full story. \"You can try to quell the speculation, you can try to get out ahead of questions, you can try to answer all the questions ... but at the end of the day, only you have the full context regardless of how much you elect to share with others,\" Ali Jackson, dating and relationship coach, previously told USA TODAY.\n\n\"You can try to quell the speculation, you can try to get out ahead of questions, you can try to answer all the questions ... but at the end of the day, only you have the full context regardless of how much you elect to share with others,\" Ali Jackson, dating and relationship coach, previously told USA TODAY. Set boundaries and rally your support system. Be clear about what you want out there and what you definitely don't. \"Having boundaries, and having a private life really becomes an important part of having very healthy overall wellbeing, being able to have both personal boundaries that you can control, and then also identifying really healthy social support,\" T.M. Robinson-Mosley, counseling psychologist, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nBe clear about what you want out there and what you definitely don't. \"Having boundaries, and having a private life really becomes an important part of having very healthy overall wellbeing, being able to have both personal boundaries that you can control, and then also identifying really healthy social support,\" T.M. Robinson-Mosley, counseling psychologist, previously told USA TODAY. Sit down with the most important players first. \"If the breakup is contentious, it may be important for the members of a couple to present a measured explanation to friends who are closest,\" Petiford says. \"Friends presumably care about friends and to that end have legitimate interest in how a longtime couple may fare through such a challenging time.\"\n\n\"If the breakup is contentious, it may be important for the members of a couple to present a measured explanation to friends who are closest,\" Petiford says. \"Friends presumably care about friends and to that end have legitimate interest in how a longtime couple may fare through such a challenging time.\" Be direct. \"If people won’t stop talking about the former relationship, one approach is to point out – directly – that it is over and that it’s time to move on,\" Fisher says.\n\n\"If people won’t stop talking about the former relationship, one approach is to point out – directly – that it is over and that it’s time to move on,\" Fisher says. Get ready for questions. In one's personal life, questions may come up as people consider which side they're planning on taking in a breakup. There may be little control, ultimately, for celebrities to move legions of fans one way or another without digging themselves into a drama-filled pit. Plus: \"If I were to advise those who were wondering, reaching out personally if they genuinely care is best,\" Fisher says. \"Otherwise, keep those motives in check – why do you need to know? Is it just being nosy or is there actual concern?\"\n\nIn one's personal life, questions may come up as people consider which side they're planning on taking in a breakup.

In three separate documents regarding the victim, all provided by the Diocese, the victim reported that Gillespie performed oral sex on him.\n\nEdward R. Graff\n\nWhere he served:\n\n06/1955 - 04/1957: Annunciation B.V.M., Shenandoah\n\n04/1957 - 05/1958: St. Anthony of Padua, Easton\n\n05/1958 - 09/1958: St. Elizabeth's, Pen Argyl\n\n09/1958 - 09/1959: Pius X High School, Roseto\n\n09/1959 - 06/1962: Residence, St. Anthony, Easton\n\n06/1962 - 09/1963: University of Notre Dame\n\n09/1963 - 03/1964: Our Lady Help of Christians, Allentown\n\n03/1964 - 07/1964: St. Elizabeth, Pen Argyl\n\n07/1964 - 02/1965: Pius X High School, Roseto\n\n02/1965 - 11/1966: Holy Rosary, Reading;\n\nCentral Catholic High School, Reading\n\n11/1966- 08/1968: Holy Name High School, Reading\n\n08/1968- 10/1969: St. Margaret, Reading\n\n10/1969- 04/1971: St Peter, Coplay\n\n04/1971- 04/1974: Annunciation B.V.M., Catasauqua\n\n04/1974 - 11/1979: Director, Thanksgiving Clothing Drive\n\n11/1979 - 07/1980: Sick Leave\n\n07/1980 - 06/1983: St. Margaret, Reading\n\n06/1983 - 02/1992: Holy Guardian Angels, Reading\n\n02/1992: Departed Diocese of Allentown\n\n1992 - 2002: Served in various capacities in Dioceses in New Mexico and Texas\n\nSummary: During his years in ministry, Graff raped scores of children. The grand jury investigated not only Graff's conduct but the knowledge of the relevant Dioceses. The case of Graff is an example of dioceses that minimized the criminal conduct of one of their priests, while secretly noting the significant danger the priest posed to the public.\n\nThe grand jury notes that the use of euphemisms was constant throughout the Dioceses of Pennsylvania, but particularly apparent in the case of Graff. Terms such as \"sick leave\" or \"health leave\" were often used to reference an absence from ministry related to child sexual abuse.\n\nRichard J.

In 1980, three separate complaints were made against him. The complaints asserted that Soderlund had engaged in sexual acts with three different children. The children were aged 12 to 13 years old. The Diocesan record, a \"summary of case\" relating to Soderlund, generalized the sexual conduct without referencing specific acts or crimes.\n\nOn June 11, 1980, a meeting was held at the Chancery during which photo albums were examined depicting nude photographs of a young boy engaged in sex acts with Soderlund. Soderlund admitted to Chancery officials that he engaged in sexual activity with the three young boys. While documents created at the time of the admission minimized the conduct, the facts became available through a detailed account of the abuse obtained from a victim in 1997 by the Diocese. The victim reported that: he was not a willing participant, but Soderlund threatened to harm or kill him.\n\nSoderlund also took pictures of the victim engaged in sexual acts and threatened to use them to embarrass him. Soderlund offered to leave the priesthood if the victim would go away with him. The victim then indicated that he knew of many other boys who were victimized by Soderlund.\n\nIn 2009, Soderlund, now living in Dubois, Wyoming, within the Diocese of Cheyenne was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration for two to five years for sexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography on his computer. He is a registered sex offender in Wyoming.\n\nHenry E.

On April 29, 2004, Yarrosh was removed from priestly ministry and entered St. John Vianney Hospital for evaluation and treatment. 2004, the Pennsylvania State Police filed charges against Yarrosh, specifically, 110 counts of sexual abuse of children after discovering hundreds of child pornography photos, books, magazines, videos, and DVD's in his possession. As law enforcement began its prosecution, Diocesan Support Services conducted an audit and determined that Yarrosh embezzled approximately $23,000.00 from the parish.\n\nCharges were filed related to this theft. On April 27, 2005, Yarrosh entered a plea of guilty to charges of theft and possession of child pornography. Yarrosh was sentenced pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to imprisonment for three to 23 months, $250.00 in fines, and restitution to the parish.\n\nOn July 21, 2005, Yarrosh left St. Francis Villa and moved into a motel. Yarrosh continued in residence at the motel until August 8, 2005, at which time he was incarcerated in Schuylkill County Prison in Pottsville. Upon his release on November 31, 2005,\n\nYarrosh registered with the Pennsylvania State Police as a sexual offender. Upon his release from prison, Yarrosh was still a priest. On December 6, 2005, Yarrosh was released from prison as a convicted and registered sex offender. The Diocese granted him residence at St. Francis Villa in Orwigsburg. The Diocese's own designation of Yarrosh noted he was a \"moderate to high risk to again use pornography and/or consort with prostitutes.\"\n\nIn November 2006, it was discovered that Father Yarrosh had taken trips to New York City with a seven-year-old child. Yarrosh was also found to be in possession of pornography in violation of his court supervision. The Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas subsequently sentenced Yarrosh to four to ten years in state prison for violating the terms of his supervision.\n\nFinally, in June 2007, the Diocese dismissed Yarrosh from the priesthood.\n\nJoseph A.

While in the ninth grade, the victim met Father Joseph A. Zmijewski. She was in a new school and was experiencing unhappiness. The victim began regular counseling sessions with Zmijewski.\n\nZmijewski proposed a course of alternative treatment. He directed the victim to come to his personal residence where he could help the victim through hypnosis. The victim complied and attended four hypnosis sessions with Zmijewski at his residence. After the first three attempts were unsuccessful by Zmijewski to hypnotize her, she agreed to a fourth session. In an effort to expedite her \"treatment,\" she faked hypnosis during her fourth session. While she pretended to be hypnotized, Zmijewski instructed her to take off one piece of clothing after another. The victim was scared and complied until she was nude. Zmijewski then left the room for a short period of time and upon his return, he instructed the victim to get dressed. The victim never returned for any further \"treatment\" and kept the incident to herself into adulthood.\n\nDavid Connell, Timothy Johnson, and Jim Gross\n\nNo further details of their employment history were listed.\n\nSummary: David Connell and Timothy Johnson were Carmelite priests and Jim Gross was a lay person. in September 2007, a known victim reported he had been sexually abused by Gross, a basketball coach at St. Patrick's in Pottsville. He reported that the abuse began in the 1970's while he was in sixth grade. In the summer of 1984, Gross resigned from teaching at St. Francis School in Minersville, Schuylkill County.\n\nIn the narrative of his last evaluation from June 1984, the victim also reported that he was sexually abused by a Carmelite priest named Father David Connell and physically abused by a Carmelite brother named Timothy Johnson while attending Nativity High School. The abuse was reported to the Provincial of the Carmelites, Father Michael Kissane, in October 2007. The victim stated that his family's house had burned down and the Carmelites took him and his brother in and had them live in a priory. During the time he was living in the priory, the victim was sexually abused by Connell. The victim remembered drinking juice that Connell gave him and the next memory the victim had was waking up in his own bed naked, with Connell in the room. The victim had no memory of the prior evening but, on waking, he was bleeding from his rectum.\n\nThe victim told Johnson he was going to also report the abuse to the police.

Father John Fischer testified that he walked in on Barletta and a young high school student in private chambers, and that the student was naked from the waist down, trying to pull up his underwear and pants as Barletta watched. Fischer recalled that Monsignor Hastings dismissed the report, and that fellow priests laughed it off.\n\nLater on, Bishop Trautman recorded details of a conversation that he had with Sister Donna Markham about Barletta. Trautman wrote that Barletta abused 5 children. Barletta was confronted with allegations of oral sex, naked messages, digital anal penetration and masturbation against a victim in 1994. When confronted, Barletta admitted his guilt to Trautman. The diocese paid for the victim’s counseling, but once the victim shared the story of abuse with a newspaper, Trautman advised that the victim should seek payment directly from Barletta.\n\nFrom 1975 though 1994 when he was dismissed from Erie Cathedral Prep, Barletta admitted abusing 25 children and young men.

The grand jury has found documents that the Diocese of Hawaii and possibly the Diocese of Erie knew Father Hannon had admittedly abused at least twenty youths between ages 12 and 19.\n\nOf the eight victims acknowledged by the Diocese of Erie, one is categorized as \"claim denied, not verified\" based upon a denial by Hannon. This victim was abused in Hawaii and occurred when Hannon was visiting the victim’s parents. While tucking her into bed, he allegedly fondled her under her underpants.\n\nWhen the victim was interviewed in 2004, the Diocese of Hawaii found her “extremely credible.” But the Diocese of Erie sided with Hannan, as he had previously admitted to abusing only boys. Hannon denied abusing females stating, “they do not have a penis.”\n\nThere are eight known victims within the Diocese of Erie. It is unknown if the Diocese ever informed law enforcement officials about Hannon's conduct.\n\nJames P.

Bishop Trautman detailed that the victim was a junior at Mercyhurst Preparatory when she was targeted by Hudock. This sexual abuse occurred in several different locations within the victim's parish community. Trautman documented that Hudock and the victim had engaged in kissing prior to a trip to Wasington, D.C. Records revealed that Hudock groped and kissed the victim on numerous occasions, and it was reported he showed he pornography.\n\nIn 2008, the victim was having a difficult time dealing with the psychological issues from being victimized by Hudock. The Diocese agreed to pay for her medical bills and provided her with airfare to be seen at St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland.\n\nHudock' s current employment status is not known, but he operates his own religious website titled, \"Faith Meets World\" and has written religious books for Liturgical Press under his given name, as well as the pen name \"Barry Michaels.\"\n\nJoseph W.

Jerge in early 1989. That year, he was sent for psychological therapy. In the fall of 1989, he was released and signed an aftercare contract that restricted his contact with young boys. He was placed back into ministry at St. John the Evangelist.\n\nIn 1991, Jerge had a meeting with several members of the clergy where concern was voiced about him violating his post-care contract. Bishop Trautman re -assigned Jerge to St. Francis Xavier parish.\n\nOne victim is well-documented by the ministry. He was a high school sophomore when Jerge took him on trips along and fondled him on multiple occasions. Later in the victim’s life, he was blackballed from employment and blocked from attempts to be admitted to seminary. The grand jury found documentation that Bishop Trautman personally instructed school administrators not to hire the victim, noting that he might be homosexual and might have attempted suicide. It is also noted that the Diocese paid at least $1,200 of the victim’s counseling fees.\n\nAnother victim stated that he was sexually abused by Jerge between approximately 1981 and 1985. He stated that all of the assaults took place in Jerge’s car. The victim made his history of abuse known to Trautman in 2003 and obtained an attorney. A letter stated Trautman advised Jerge to consider both legal and canonical counsel. According to the letter, Trautman called the District Attorney of Erie County to tell him of the situation and assure him of their compliance with the applicable standards and guidelines.\n\nStephen E.

All three men and several of their sisters testified that Jeselnick and a previously unidentified deacon would come to their house and get intoxicated. Once the adults were drunk, Jeselnick would find the boys and pray on them.\n\nIn 2014, Jeselnick sent a letter seeking suitability for ministry. After reviewing his file, Bishop Lawrence Persico denied the request.\n\nThomas C.

When he said he did not have the proper clothes, Kondzielski suggested that they lift weights naked. They then proceeded to lift weights together while they were naked. When he told his parents about the naked weight lifting incident, they were shocked and told him to stay away from Kondzielski.\n\nWhen confronted with this allegations, Kondzielski claimed he did not remember the incident, but did not deny it because it could have happened.\n\nGerard Krebs\n\nWhere he served:\n\n7/26/1964 - 6/3/1970: Secondary Education Venango Christian, High School, Oil City, PA\n\n7/26/1964 - 6/3/1970: Weekend Assistant, St. Stephen's, Oil City, PA\n\n6/3/1970 - 9/8/1970: Parochial Vicar, Our Lady Queen of the Americas, Conneaut Lake, PA\n\n6/3/1970 - 9/8/1970: Resident, St. Stephen's Rectory, Oil City, PA\n\n9/8/1970 - 12/6/1978: Parochial Vicar, Erie, St. John the Baptist\n\n12/6/1978 - 1/27/1983: Pastor, Holy Cross Church, Brandy Camp, PA\n\n1/27/1983 - 6/30/1990: Pastor, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n3/1/1990 - 5/4/1990: Health Leave, Guest House, Rochester, MN\n\n6/30/1990 - 1/6/1992: Pastor, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n1/6/1992 - 12/31/2003: Director of RCIA, Diocesan Office, Erie, PA\n\n1/6/1992 - 2/4/1994: Resident, Blessed Sacrament, Erie, PA\n\n2/4/1994 - 3/27/2004: Resident, St. Joseph/Bread of Life, Erie, PA\n\n4/10/1996 - 10/1/1996: Chaplain, Soldiers & Sailors Home\n\n11/17/1996 - 5/8/1997: Weekend Assistant, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n11/22/1996 - 12/31/2003: Director of Activities/Coming Millennium, Diocesan Office, Erie, PA\n\n1/1/04 - 5/25/2005: Retired, Priest Retirement Residence, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: Three known victims came forward indicating that they were sexually abused by Father Gerard Krebs.\n\nOne victim alleged that Krebs led him through \"a series of sexual rituals to both prove my faith and the fact that I was not a homosexual.\n\nThe grand jury found no documentation indicating that law enforcement was ever notified about any of Krebs interactions with his victims.\n\nJerry (John) Kucan\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1952-1954: St. Anthony's, Sharon, PA\n\n1954-1961: St. Joseph's, Bethlehem, PA\n\n1961-1972: St. Mary's, Steelton, PA\n\n1972-1973: Our Lady of Peace Friary, Beaver Falls, PA\n\n1973-1977: St. Anthony's, Sharon, PA\n\n1977-1978: Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, WI\n\n1978-1979: Beaver Falls Friary, Beaver Falls, PA\n\n1979-1982: St. Mary's, Steelton, PA\n\n1982-1985: St. Jerome' s, Chicago, IL\n\n1985-1986: Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, WI\n\n1986-1988: St. Anthony's, Chicago, IL\n\n1988-1994: St. Augustine' s, West Allis, WI\n\n1994-1995: Sacred Heart, Chicago, IL\n\n1995-2005: St. Anthony's Friary, Chicago, IL\n\nSummary: In February of 2005, a 29 year old man wrote a letter to the Diocese of Erie in which he stated that he had attended St. Anthony's School in Sharon, Pennsylvania and that in\n\n1974 he began serving midnight mass. Victim #1 stated that \"Father Jerry\" began an inappropriate relationship with him at that time. They would have special meetings together. Kucan told the victim that if he ever told anyone about their relationship, his mother would lose her job in the school kitchen and he would be kicked out of school. The victim wrote in the letter that he would go to confession weekly to confess his sins and that Kucan would tell him that the slate was wiped clean.\n\nKucan would perform oral sex on the-then eight year old. The letter also alleged that Kucan would have a brother in a brown robe present on some occasions and that this brother would also perform oral sex on the victim.\n\nFather Kucan was taken out of the ministry in March 2005, when the Order received its first complaint against him. The Order settled with the victim filing the complaint. The file note also indicated that Kucan was then in his mid- eighties and in the early stages of dementia.\n\nThere is nothing contained in this file that shows that any actual correspondence between the Church and the District Attorney occurred.\n\nLouis Lorei\n\nWhere he served:\n\n9/1981 - 9/1985: Pastor, Our Lady of Peace, Erie, PA\n\nUnknown: Possibly Gannon University\n\nSummary: In December 2009, Father Mark Hoffman called the Bishop's office to report an allegation involving child sexual abuse by Monsignor Louis Lorei. The parents of a boy had approached him to report that their son stated he \"was touched by Monsignor Lorei\" in the early 1980's. Bishop Trautman later met with the victim.\n\nThe victim stated that about 1980 or 1981, he was a student, roughly age 11 to 13, at Our Lady of Peace school. He was also an altar server during early mass with Lorei. On one occasion, Lorei invited him into the rectory and into his bedroom. Lorei had the victim sit on the bed while Lorei sat next to him and hugged and kissed him on the lips. This would occur several days in a row, stop, and then begin again. The victim eventually refused to serve mass with Lorei.\n\nLorei was soon removed by then -Bishop Murphy. In his own handwritten words, Trautman expressed the personal belief that Lorei' s sudden departure may likely have been indicative of some kind of significant event. Trautman offered the victim counseling services. Financial assistance was also discussed. In a memorandum dated March 30, 2007, Hoffman also documented an additional victim of Lorei. Hoffman found out through the father of the second victim that his son was allegedly abused by Lorei. The victim reportedly described the incident during a United Methodist retreat in 2000.\n\nA small note in the file states \"Review Board found no merit in processing since supposed victim did not come forth even after requests.\"\n\nIt is unknown who the request refers to.\n\nSalvatore P. Luzzi\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/09/1962 - 8/29/1968: Faculty, Venango Christian High. Residence at St. Joseph, Oil City, PA\n\n8/28/1968 - 8/28/1969: Sp.

Luzzi was moved to St. Mark's Seminary, where he filled several roles. Over the course of his 30 year ministry, he was accused of sexual misconduct by eight male victims ranging in age from early teens to early twenties. Some of these victims were groped, inappropriately kissed, hugged, and/or fondled. He also faced allegations of responsibility for the suicide of a former student/victim.\n\nLuzzi worked extensively with young would-be priests at St. Mark's where he and fellow priest Leon Muroski served as Spiritual Directors to the seminarians. Luzzi's inappropriate touching and fondling of at least two seminarians prompted the Diocese to settle with those seminarians for large sums of money. The first former Seminarian's case was settled in civil court for $34,500 and this individual received several thousand dollars over the course of the many years that the Diocese paid for his counseling and medication costs.\n\nSeveral other former juvenile victims of Luzzi received letters or phone calls of apology from the Diocese. These victims were counseled by the Diocese through correspondence or in person interviews wherein Luzzi's behavior was dismissed as \"Sal's way of expressing himself and his \"touching approach\" to ministry was attributed to his Italian upbringing.\n\nIn 1994, Bishop Trautman sent both Luzzi and Muroski to St. Luke's Institute for therapy. The Diocese publicly announced that Luzzi was going on an extended sabbatical for \"personal, spiritual and academic growth.\" Once Luzzi was discharged, the Bishop welcomed him back into pastoral ministry by letter on February 14, 1995. However, the welcome also came with several conditions and a Penial Precept, a formal notification in the church that restricts ministry.\n\nTrautman directed Luzzi to refrain from all contact with youth under 19 years of age and to avoid travel and social interaction with such parishioners. Later that same year, in September 1995, Trautman had Luzzi' s faculties as a priest removed and Luzzi began residing in a private residence, where he remains today.\n\nRicahrd D. Lynch\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/01/1963 - 5/26/1972: Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n5/26/1972 - 2/18/1983: Headmaster, Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n2/18/1983 - 8/30/1999: Pastor, Erie Holy Rosary, Erie, PA\n\n1984-1994:Dean, East Erie Deanery, Erie, PA\n\n8/31/1999 - Death: Pastor, St. Mark's the Evangelist, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: The victim claims Lynch slammed him into the wall and this resulted in a trauma to his head.\n\nIn a letter dated June 3, 2016, the victim stated that he wanted to write the Bishop to get some things off his chest. He alleged that Father Richard Lynch was responsible for the sexual abuse that he went through while attending Bradford Central Catholic Christian High School 1978-1979. He said he told Bishop Trautman about some physical abuse, but was too ashamed to talk about the sexual abuse.\n\nDaniel Martin\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1943 - 1945: Parochial Vicar, Sacred Heart, Sharon, PA\n\n1945 - 1962: Faculty, Erie Cathedral Preparatory High School, Erie, PA\n\n1948 - 1962: Assistant Headmaster, Erie Cathedral Preparatory, Erie, PA\n\n1950-1962: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College\n\n1962-1970: Pastor, St. Boniface, Kersey, PA\n\n1962-1970: Headmaster, Elk Co.

Calvary, Erie, PA\n\n1987: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College for Religious women\n\n2003: Blessed Sacrament, Residence\n\nSummary: Monsignor Daniel Martin was a priest the in the Diocese of Erie for 43 -three years who faced two known allegations of sexual abuse. The grand jury's review of his files found very little documented evidence of his abuse of a teenager who was an alter server in his parish. That victim would go on to become a priest himself and appeared in front of the grand jury to tell his story.\n\nHe reported that when he was upset over the troubles of his life, he would seek Martin's counsel. He testified that Martin sexually fondled him on at least sixteen occasions between the ages of sixteen and nineteen.\n\nOther victims came forward with similar encounters.\n\nRedacted – pending litigation\n\nThe name of the priest, where he served and the exact incident was entirely redacted in the grand jury report.\n\nLeon T.

This ministry lasted from 1982 until1995, but was abruptly halted when in the early 1990s Muroski was accused of sexual misconduct while he was a Spiritual Director at the seminary. Muroski was sent to St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland, for individual psychotherapy in 1994 after he admitted to inappropriate contact with the seminarians under his watch. These seminarians were all male, eighteen to twenty-three-year olds, when Muroski would counsel them. This counselling included allegations of full body massages, kissing, masturbation and fondling of the seminarians' buttocks and genitals. Muroski would eventually be placed back into ministry after therapy at St. Luke's and served in the Diocese of Erie and in The Christophers program in New York City.\n\nIn 2001, Muroski returned to the Diocese of Erie from The Christophers and was retired. Muroski was permitted to move into the retired priest home in 2002, which is where he still resides. In 2016, the Diocese rostered a list of all the retired clergy living in the home and made it public. Muroski was not listed as a resident. It was at this residence that the grand jury found him living in 2017, however.\n\nEdmundus Murphy\n\nNo further details regarding where he served were provided.\n\nSummary: On December 21, 2007 an e-mail communication was sent to Monsignor Robert Smith, Vicar General of the Diocese of Erie from the Society of the Divine Word in Techny, Ilinois. The purpose of the e-mail was to inform Smith that a victim was sexually abused by a staff member while he was a minor at Sacred Heart High School in 1964. This school was operated by the Society of the Divine Word Missionaries in Girard.\n\nThe victim claimed that during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of high school, Brother Edmundus Murphy, who was 33 years of age at this time, was the wrestling coach at the school. Murphy encouraged the victim to join the team and, under the pretense of teaching him some wrestling moves, the two wrestled naked \"as the ancient Greeks and Romans did.\" The victim alleged that during these \"wrestling\" sessions he was sodomized by Murphy.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the victim asked Murphy what he was doing and, according to the victim, Murphy sat on the floor and began to cry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation found no documentation that the Diocese notified local law enforcement or the District Attorney's Office about Murphy's behavior. The only note in the file was a handwritten notation on top of the printed out e-mail which read; \"not responsible-Priest/Deacon only.\"\n\nJohn L.

Capano, was trying to answer that question when she wedged herself into the white Igloo cooler that played a grisly role in one of the most sensational and dramatic court cases in Delaware history.\n\nIt was a key piece of evidence in the haunting case that still resonates 20 years after Capano's November 1997 arrest because it echoes current headlines: men in positions of power trying to exert absolute control over their alleged victims.\n\nThe 12-week trial kept the public riveted from October 1998 to January 1999.\n\nCapano had apparently stuffed the 5-foot-10-inch body of his younger, secret girlfriend, Anne Marie Fahey, into the ice chest after she was shot to death at his home with a gun bought by Deborah A. MacIntyre, one of his other longtime mistresses. Capano, married with four daughters, would later blame MacIntyre for Fahey's death.\n\nThe day after Fahey's mysterious June 1996 death, Capano, with the help of his youngest brother, Gerry, used the cooler to transport Fahey's body to Gerry's boat Summer Wind at Stone Harbor, New Jersey.\n\nSummer Wind motored east about 60 to 75 miles, Gerry testified, where he then gave his brother an anchor and chain and turned his back on the scene unfolding on deck. Gerry told the court that Tom Capano vomited, then put a body into the ocean. According to testimony, he turned around in time to see a human foot sink into the deep waters.\n\nTom Capano told his attorney Joseph S. Oteri that he first rejected putting Fahey's body into a brand-new garbage can. Instead, Capano used a 40½-gallon cooler, purchased two months before Fahey's death. Capano’s brother Joseph, who died of a heart attack in 2015, said he told Tom to buy the cooler as a gift for brother Gerry.\n\nTwo and half years after Fahey died, the jury hearing Capano's murder trial was sequestered at the Hilton Wilmington/Christiana near Stanton.\n\nDeliberations lasted three days.\n\nCapano case:For complete coverage, including past stories, videos and more\n\n\"Honestly, a lot of people would be surprised to know that when we first went in to deliberate, first thing we did was take a poll to see where everybody stood and it was half and half,\" said Lee, who counted herself among the not-guilty votes.\n\nLee recalled one of the jurors said: \"'We should see if she could really just fit [into the cooler].'\"\n\nLee, 28 years old at the time and known as Erin Reilly, was just a few inches shorter and weighed about the same as Fahey. Sitting at a big table in a hotel conference room, she felt all eyes on her.\n\nAlthough one of her fellow jurors said she didn't need to do it, Lee agreed to climb into the 3-foot-8-inch hard-plastic cooler that served as a makeshift coffin. She left her high heels on to compensate for Fahey's height.\n\n\"This is important,\" Lee remembers telling herself. \"It's important for everybody. It's important for me because I didn't know.\"\n\nJurors helped the young woman into the cooler and then watched as Lee tried to \"squoosh myself smaller\" to give others an accurate picture.\n\n\"My eyes were closed for sure,\" she said. \"I'm not sure why. Probably because I didn't want to see.\"\n\nAs jurors attempted to shut the cooler's lid, Lee recalls being surrounded by a darkness she had never known.\n\nIn court testimony, Capano said he laid Fahey's body into the cooler on her side. He said he pushed her knees into a fetal position but insisted he broke no bones to make her body fit. Capano also said he had wrapped her body in a cotton blanket.\n\nBut Lee and the other jurors soon learned it wasn't the gentle tuck-in Capano had described.\n\nAs Lee squirmed inside the cooler, the lid wouldn't close. And that's when some of the jurors realized Fahey's bones might have been broken, or worse, to make the corpse fit.\n\nThe macabre situation, and the enormity of what had happened to Fahey, suddenly became real and overwhelming.\n\n\"OK,\" Lee remembers another juror saying. \"That's enough. Let's get her out.\"\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, a traumatized Lee asked a bailiff to escort her to her hotel bedroom. Lee sat alone and sobbed.\n\nTears fell for Fahey, a troubled, insecure, single woman who wanted to end an off-and-on, three-year affair with the then 46-year-old Capano, a controlling, jealous, married lover who wouldn't let her walk away.\n\nAs she cried, Lee, only two years younger than the victim, said she spoke to Fahey: \"I'm just so sorry. I'm so sorry that this happened to you.\"\n\nThe climb into the cooler-turned-casket convinced Erin Reilly Lee and the jury of five other women and six men that Capano was a manipulative liar, a cold-blooded killer.\n\nIt was Capano who shot Fahey, the jury determined.\n\nWilliam Swain Lee, the Superior Court judge who presided over the trial, said he was walking on the beach Saturday, January 16, 1999, when his beeper went off.\n\n\"I had to run about a mile to get back to my car, drive to my house to get to a telephone, and call in,\" he said.\n\nThe jury had reached a verdict.\n\n\"We had to go find everyone,\" Judge Lee added. \"The lawyers were in different restaurants in a three-state area. So, the soonest we could get together was Sunday morning and I did not think that once it was announced that the jury had reached a verdict that we could take a day off.\n\n\"We needed to get it out, so I scheduled the unusual Sunday morning session.\"\n\nSunday morning the jury found Capano, then 49, guilty of the first-degree murder of 30-year-old Fahey, a scheduling secretary for then-Gov. Tom Carper.\n\nJudge Lee sentenced Capano to death.\n\nIt was a stunning fall from grace for the prominent Wilmington attorney who had once counseled a Delaware mayor and governor and was the privileged, eldest son of a well-known Italian custom home builder. In just 31 months, Capano had gone from admired power broker to pariah.\n\nFrom Fahey's disappearance on June 27, 1996, to Capano's conviction on Jan. 17, 1999, the public devoured every morsel of information uncovered. The trial spawned four books and a 2001 TV movie that starred Mark Harmon as Capano.\n\nMore:Prosecutor Colm Connolly: Tom Capano tried to take a hit out on me\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Search set for Carper assistant\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: 300 Join in Fahey search\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: FBI search for Fahey may go on\n\nThe case was revived again in 2006 when Capano's death sentence was overturned. A life sentence was his punishment.\n\nBy then, years of confinement and isolation on death row had begun to take its toll. Capano, overweight with sallow skin and a wispy, white beard, no longer resembled the fit, polished, man-about-town he had once been.\n\n\"He had gained a massive amount of weight since the trial,\" said Colm F. Connolly, the unflappable federal prosecutor who led the investigation and endured Capano's intense hatred, which included verbal attacks and, at one point, plans to put a hit on him.\n\nCapano died of a heart attack on Sept. 19, 2011, at age 61 at the Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna, where he was serving the life sentence.\n\n\"He ate himself to death; there's no question about it,\" Judge Lee said.\n\n\"His father died of a heart attack, he knew he had a heart condition. Once his appeals ran out, I think it was suicide by food,\" said Lee, who retired from the bench nine months after the trial and now lives near Rehoboth Beach.\n\nMore:'This is Tom, Tom Capano,' said the man on the phone\n\nCapano's obituary said he \"was many things to many people, but most of all he was a loving father who will be greatly missed by his [four] daughters.\"\n\nIt touched upon Capano's love of music and places in Wilmington, some no longer open. The man the family called \"Tommy,\" the obituary said, was known for \"his impeccable taste: blasting old classics – the Temptations, the Four Seasons, Aretha Franklin, Frank Sinatra, or the Rolling Stones – at full volume while waiting to pick up pizza from Gallucio's; allowing his daughters to skip school on their birthdays for a luxurious lunch at the Rodney Square Club; ordering an assortment of mouthwatering seafood from DiNardo's with extra Old-Bay seasoning.\"\n\nThe obituary did not mention the murder conviction.\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Capano held in murder of Anne Marie Fahey\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: The Capanos: A house in ruins\n\nTwenty years after he was arrested, the Thomas J. Capano murder mystery continues to fascinate because of its alluring – and grim – elements: sex, power, wealth, politics, secret affairs, lurid moments and an extraordinary reversal of fortune that wouldn't ring true if written in a crime novel.\n\n\"It was amazing the twists and turns throughout the case, especially during the trial,\" said Connolly, then an assistant U.S. attorney who had never before tried a murder case.\n\nWorking with Ferris W. Wharton, a seasoned state prosecutor with nearly 20 years' experience running murder trials, Connolly and his team won a first-degree murder conviction and a death sentence – even though there was no body, no witnesses to the killing and no found murder weapon.\n\nMore:Prosecutor Ferris Wharton: The moment I remember the most is the cooler\n\nIt would be Connolly's one-and-only murder trial. He is now managing partner of the Wilmington law office of Morgan Lewis.\n\n\"I do think the reality is, and I'll have to accept, it was the ultimate professional experience I will ever have, and I was very young to have had it,\" said Connolly, who was 33 when the trial began.\n\nOn the other side of the courtroom, Capano's defense was made up of four well-known criminal defense lawyers who frequently squabbled with their client.\n\nMore:Defense attorney Maurer: I wanted to withdraw from Tom Capano case\n\n\"Often dubbed the ‘Dream Team,’ the defense in this case became a nightmare,\" Eugene J. Maurer Jr. wrote in an essay for The News Journal.\n\n\"Tom was an impossible client, pushing the envelope at all times and making the representation quite unpleasant. Ethical boundaries were of no consideration to him in formulating his defense strategy, as was demonstrated by the evidence at trial.\"\n\nAdded Maurer: \"Instead of a challenging and fulfilling professional experience, the representation of Tom Capano was one of the most depressing and disappointing professional experiences of my life.\"\n\nJoseph S. Oteri, the Boston lawyer who led Capano’s “Dream Team,” was more blunt about representing Capano: “I made a bad mistake in taking a lawyer for a client.”\n\nOteri said he is usually the man in charge. But Capano’s insistence on running the case got in the way.\n\n“He was taking advice from people in the jail rather than the people he was paying for and it was tough,” Oteri told The News Journal. “It didn't make me feel anything but pissed off because I kept saying, ‘You're paying me an enormous fee and you're not listening to me. How stupid can you be?’”\n\n“‘Nah, nah,’” Oteri quoted Capano as saying. “We're doing fine. We're all right.\"\n\nJudge Lee said it was tough going for the defense.\n\n“Capano was always confident he was going to win and it was clear he considered himself smarter than his excellent group of lawyers,” the judge said.\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Cooler found in Fahey case\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: FBI sought weapons in Capano's home\n\nAnne Marie Fahey wanted – and believed – she had escaped Capano's dominance and intimidation.\n\n\"For one whole year, I allowed someone to take control of every decision of my life,\" she wrote in her diary April 7, 1996 – one of the final entries.\n\nHer plan was to move forward with a kind man younger than Capano. It was not to be. A little more than two months after that last entry, Fahey was reported missing.\n\nFahey's remains have never been found. One of the few places to mourn and remember her is a memorial bench erected in 2006 that sits in Wilmington's Brandywine Park. “In our hearts forever,” reads the inscription.\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Power broker now pariah\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Guilty as charged\n\nEvidence from the case, relatively untouched since 1999, today collects dust in a vault at the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center on Wilmington's King Street, formerly called the New Castle County Courthouse.\n\nIt serves as both an elegy and a 1990s time capsule with cassettes and videotapes of interviews with Capano's brothers, handwritten lists of state and defense witnesses –– and pieces of a life that ended much too soon.\n\nUsually, evidence is given away to the defense or destroyed after a defendant’s death.\n\n\"This is the only dead person I still have evidence for,\" said Colleen Redmond of the Prothonotary's office as she looked over items from the trial.\n\n\"The court said we shouldn't get rid of it,\" despite Capano’s death six years ago, she said.\n\nFolded up is a then-fashionable, size 6, cream-and-blue floral Laura Ashley dress. It is possibly the long, springtime dress Fahey bought to wear to Winterthur's Point-to-Point steeplechase races with her boyfriend Michael Scanlan, then community affairs chief of MBNA America Bank, whom she hoped to marry.\n\nAuthorities believe one of the reasons Capano killed Fahey was his jealousy of Scanlan, a devout Catholic who testified his relationship with Fahey was not sexual. Scanlan didn't know about Fahey's involvement with Capano until after her death.\n\nAccording to his Linkedin profile, Scanlan left MBNA in June 1999 and is now assistant headmaster at St. Benedict's Preparatory School in Newark, New Jersey. He also works as a photographer shooting high school sports, portraits and does some commercial work.\n\nGone from the evidence vault are Fahey's wallet, jewelry box and the diary that gave investigators much-needed clues that pointed to her murderer. Her family took those items years ago, court officials say.\n\nBut, still in the vault are the copies of letters mistress MacIntyre wrote daily to Capano in prison before she turned on him in February 1998 and became a key witness for the prosecution. Some of the letters from the divorced MacIntyre, a Capano girlfriend for more than 15 years, begin with the greeting, \"Hey Handsome.\"\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Death for Capano\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Capano found dead in prison\n\nFinally, there are two 162-quart Igloo ice coolers – one used as a demonstration in court, and one the actual cooler, and Fahey's coffin. Inside of it rests a 12-gauge shotgun.\n\nIn one of the case's most surprising twists, the abandoned cooler was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean by four fishermen about a week after Gerry Capano unsuccessfully tried to sink it by firing a slug into it with a 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun.\n\nThe fishermen, who kept it in a shed, turned it over to prosecutors the day after reading media accounts of Capano's arrest in November 1997.\n\nJudge Lee, in a recent interview, said it is astonishing that the cooler had been discovered off Indian River Inlet, 100 miles from where it had been thrown into the ocean.\n\n\"It's certainly stranger than fiction, the truth,\" Judge Lee said. \"My reaction was Tom Capano should know there really is a God now.”\n\nConnolly said bringing the actual cooler into court on Dec. 2, 1998, just before the state rested its case, still stays with him nearly 20 years later.\n\n\"I will never forget that moment. It was dead silent. It was a dark day, so not much light was coming in the windows of the courtroom,\" he said. \"Ferris and I walked the cooler in front of the jury. It was as if we were pallbearers carrying the coffin into the court.\"\n\nJuror Erin Reilly Lee, no relation to Judge William Swain Lee, still gets chills seeing pictures of the Igloo cooler.\n\n“Oh my gosh,” she told The News Journal after viewing photos. “You talk about divine intervention. There’s a great example.”\n\nWharton, now a Superior Court judge, said the court retains all the evidence while there's still ongoing litigation. But, after a defendant's death, it is then offered to the defense and/or destroyed after a period of time.\n\n\"It would surprise me if they got rid of all that evidence just because of the interest in it. People kept wanting to look at it for various reasons,\" Wharton said.\n\nOn the anniversary of Capano's arrest, The News Journal has asked some principal players to recall their memories of the investigation and trial.\n\nEssays and \"As Told To\" stories include thoughts from Connolly and Wharton, defense attorneys Maurer and Oteri, retired Judge Lee, former News Journal reporter Valerie Helmbreck, former Wilmington restaurateur Anthony Stella, juror Erin Reilly Lee and psychiatrist Neil Kaye.\n\nTime has a way of fraying memories and, 20 years later, some participants have slightly different versions of the same story and others share never heard before details. The News Journal has tried to clarify and add context to some of their words using information from court records and articles from the paper's archives.\n\nStill, some of the people who were caught up in Capano's web of lies are more than ready to put the past behind them.\n\nMacIntyre is remarried and now working at the American Society of Cytopathology, a nonprofit organization in Wilmington. The office is near the old Daniel L. Herrmann Courthouse, now the home of the law firm Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor. In the old courthouse two decades ago, she talked about her longtime affair with Capano and about buying a gun for him six weeks before Fahey died.\n\nMacIntyre, known now as Debby MacIntyre Sheldon, declined to be interviewed.\n\nWhen reached by The News Journal via email on Nov. 13, she replied: \"I have no interest in talking about the case. Best regards, Debby MacIntyre Sheldon.\"\n\nThe Fahey family declined to be interviewed or write about their memories.\n\nAfter Anne Marie’s disappearance, her brothers, sister and extended family said they decided as a group to talk to media to keep attention on the case.\n\nWhile family members were concerned they would appear as seeking attention, they felt it was proper to keep the case in the public eye, and keep pressure on the Capano family.\n\nAfter the trial, the Faheys decided as a group to stop talking to the media, and to draw no more attention to themselves.\n\nMembers of the Capano family reached by The News Journal declined to comment.\n\nThe Thomas J. Capano case captivated Delaware that's known, for better or worse, as a clannish community, especially concerning its native sons and daughters.\n\n\"What's your name? Where did you grow up? Where did you go to high school?\" are frequent questions that start a connect-the-dots conversation about common acquaintances.\n\nTies could be made to Capano and Fahey, both from large Wilmington-area families with high-profile jobs.\n\n“You have Anne Marie Fahey who worked for the governor and she had a family that a lot of people knew. She was very attractive and very personable, and young,” Wharton said.\n\n“Everybody knew of the Capanos. He (Tom) was very prominent. He had been a prosecutor, a public defender, the administrative assistant to the Wilmington mayor. Capano had been a partner in a couple big law firms, Morris James and Saul Ewing. He had been the governor's legal counsel. And everybody knows of Capano because of all the development that they did,” Wharton said.\n\nFor a few days in the summer of 1996, the disappearance of Anne Marie Fahey seemed to be little more than a missing person case.\n\nYears before being selected as a juror, Erin Reilly Lee remembers longtime friends talking about search parties being formed for a missing woman who’d grown up near her childhood neighborhood.\n\nFahey, a pretty and vivacious woman, went to dinner on June 27 with Capano at Ristorante Panorama on Front Street in Philadelphia. The eatery, which is still there, was considered one of the city's great wine destinations and featured classic Italian cuisine.\n\nCapano, married for 24 years, had recently separated from his wife. Going to Philadelphia was his routine. He had multiple mistresses and liked to take them on dates far away from his home and nosy, prying eyes in New Castle County.\n\n\"Wilmington is a small town, a gossipy place,\" he said on the witness stand on Dec. 17, 1998.\n\nAccording to a waitress that night, dinner wasn’t going so well. Capano ordered the food without consulting Fahey. They drank wine and picked at calamari and bruschetta, both looking miserable.\n\nFahey had met Capano in 1993, and wrote in her diary she fell in love with him on her January 1994 birthday. He lavished her with attention, gifts and visits to expensive restaurants. Capano also knew some of Fahey’s hidden secrets, such as she suffered from eating disorders.\n\nIn September 1995, Fahey met Scanlan, who was unmarried and closer to her age. She wanted to end the affair with Capano. But when they left the Panorama restaurant at about 9:30 p.m. June 27, it would be the last time Fahey was seen in public.\n\nTwo days later, family and friends, concerned that she failed to keep a dinner date with Scanlan at her brother’s house, went to her 1718 Washington St. apartment on the third-floor and found it empty. They also find a diary Fahey kept where she wrote that Capano was “a jealous maniac.”\n\nCapano was questioned twice on June 30 at his $2,000 a month rental home at 2302 Grant Ave. in the city’s Highlands neighborhood. Police looked through his home and a Jeep Grand Cherokee, but, at that time, found no signs of Fahey.\n\nMissing person photos of Fahey, a blue-eyed beauty with dark, curly hair, and yellow ribbons begin appearing on telephone poles, trees and signs around Wilmington. A billboard went up on I-95. Her family started a vigil on the front porch of the Washington Street apartment. They frequently met up at O’Friel’s Irish Pub, a then-popular bar in downtown Wilmington. Time marches on and the bar has closed. The building went up for sale in 2001 and later became a salon and spa.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton called Fahey’s boss, Gov. Tom Carper, now Delaware's senior senator, whom Fahey had worked for since her 1991 graduation from Dover's Wesley College.\n\nOn July 5, 1996, Clinton said the federal government would help with the search. However, it seems he forgot to notify the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Delaware, according to Connolly.\n\n“I was in the grocery store, the Acme on [U.S.] 202, and I ran into Judge Greg Sleet, who was the U.S. attorney, my boss. The lead story of The News Journal that day was President Clinton offered federal assistance. Judge Greg Sleet and I laughed because Greg Sleet was the U.S. attorney, so he was the chief federal law enforcement officer, and nobody had contacted him,” Connolly said.\n\n“If you were really going to get the feds involved, you would contact him. He said, 'Well, I'll call over to Wilmington, and we'll offer our services.' The next working day, July 8, the FBI called us.”\n\nState prosecutors later agreed to bow out of the picture. A federal grand jury investigation, which had to remain secret, began.\n\nConnolly, leading a team of investigators, began methodically chipping away at the investigation by conducting interviews, searches, and combing through phone and financial records.\n\nOn July 26, 1996, he and Wilmington police investigator Bob Donovan discovered, through financial records, Capano had made a purchase at a company listed as Wallpaper Warehouse two days after Fahey was last seen in public alive.\n\n“I knew enough about Capano at that point, because we're a week or so into the investigation, I know that he was not the kind of guy who does home improvements himself. I know he's living in a rental house, so he wouldn't be buying wallpaper. I thought it was very weird,” Connolly said.\n\nThey called the number, the person who answered said, “Airbase Carpet.”\n\n“Immediately, Bob and I looked at each other, and thought, 'Oh my goodness, he rolled her up in the carpet. That's what this is all about,'\" Connolly said.\n\nInvestigators also learn later Capano has replaced a love seat, and an employee of Capano’s brother, developer Louis L. Capano Jr., tells them on July 1 he was ordered to have a half-filled trash bin emptied from a Concord Pike construction site.\n\nThey also find Capano has visited a Happy Harry’s store in Trolley Square on June 30 and asks about a blood remover.\n\nInvestigators search Capano’s house for 11 hours on July 31 and find two tiny drops of blood that they later learn matches a sample of Fahey’s blood plasma.\n\nA search takes place Aug. 12-16 of two local landfills to try and find the rug, sofa and other evidence. The search is messy, and officers come up empty.\n\nA turning point arrives in October 1997 when federal agents raid the Wilmington home of Capano's brother Gerry and find illegal drugs and guns.\n\nCapano's brothers Gerald and Louis agree to began cooperating with the authorities in November 1997 to avoid federal charges.\n\nGerry becomes a cooperating witness. He tells authorities that he took out his boat, Summer Wind, and helped Capano dispose of a body in the Atlantic Ocean on Friday, June 28, 1996. He provided other incriminating evidence, including getting rid of a sofa with a basketball-sized bloodstain, and a rug.\n\nHis brother Louis says the stained sofa and rug were put into a dumpster on one of his properties.\n\nAfter the brothers began cooperation with the prosecution as part of a plea agreement, Capano is arrested on Nov. 12, 1997.\n\nWharton said Capano seemed to think he could get away with murder. Why?\n\n“Because he always had. He had done a lot of bad things that nobody ever called him into account for and he thought he could control things,” Wharton said.\n\n“He thought the investigation would be confined to the Wilmington police looking for a missing person which they were never going to be able to find.”\n\nIn February 1998, Deborah MacIntyre, a longtime Capano girlfriend, also signs a plea agreement and becomes a witness for the prosecution. She shares that she bought a .22-caliber gun at Capano’s request. It has never been recovered. MacIntyre also turns over her steamy letters she wrote to Capano and begins taping phone calls he makes to her from prison.\n\nAn outraged Capano asks an inmate, Nicholas Perillo, to arrange to burglarize MacIntyre’s house to intimidate her. The burglary never happened.\n\nDefense attorney Maurer will later accuse MacIntyre of firing the shot that killed Fahey. She vehemently denies it.\n\nThe case takes a twist when Capano attorney Joseph A. Hurley announces in early April 1998 he's quitting the defense team. Hurley, who had been friends with Capano for at least eight years, at that time would give no reason saying only that he will take it \"to his grave.\"\n\nOn Friday – 19 years later – he shared for the first time exclusively with The News Journal that a moment of moral clarity came to him while attending a funeral Mass at St. Helena's Catholic Church in Penny Hill for public defender James F. McCloskey Jr.\n\nHurley sat in a pew, in his childhood church, and said he had a conversation with God.\n\n\"I can only surmise that there was something making me feel like I was falling into an evil pit and this conversation, if that's what you have with God, [went] 'Joe, you're not like this. You can't be this way.'\"\n\n\"I think I was probably facing the reality he was, in fact, guilty of premeditated murder,\" Hurley said.\n\nHe said he'd never asked Capano what happened the night Fahey disappeared.\n\n\"I didn't want to ask him and hear the answer,\" Hurley said.\n\nHe left church, went to see Capano in prison and quit the case.\n\nNo longer considering him a friend, Hurley never saw Capano again.\n\n\"Killing a human being? No. That's the end of friendship,\" Hurley said.\n\nCapano’s trial begins Oct. 6, 1998, with jury selection. Capano’s attorneys try to talk him out of selecting young women.\n\n“The last thing we wanted on a jury was women under 30 with a college education because they would identify immediately with the victim,” Boston lawyer Oteri said.\n\nJudge Lee recalled after the women were included on the jury, he was approached by Oteri who said, \"'Can I go off the record, Judge?' And I went, 'Sure. Off the record.'\"\n\nOteri said: 'The dumb son of a bitch thinks they are going to fall in love with him.'\"\n\nOteri told The News Journal last week that he didn't recall the conversation.\n\nJudge Lee said he didn't know Capano when \"he had the reputation of being a charming man, but in the setting in which I knew him, he was more rodent-like. He was a frightening, scary figure. There was nothing charming about him at all.\"\n\nOteri, who joined the defense team only months before the trial started, drops a bombshell in his opening statement: He says while Capano did dump Fahey’s body at sea, she died from an “outrageous, horrible, tragic accident.”\n\nCapano claims Fahey was shot to death accidentally by MacIntyre in a jealous fit of rage, while she was attempting suicide. \"His story is nonsense,\" Wharton said.\n\nAnd it just gets keep getting stranger.\n\nNeil S. Kaye, a psychiatrist who met Fahey hours before she meets Capano for dinner, shows up to testify in a wooden hat. It earns almost as much attention as what he has to say about Fahey’s fear of ending her relationship with Capano because of his “rage and anger.”\n\nKeith R. Brady, who is then Delaware’s chief deputy attorney and Wharton’s superior, is called to testify about a sexual encounter he had five years earlier with MacIntyre while Capano watched. Capano has said he was supposed to golf with Brady the day after Fahey's death. Connolly questions him on the stand for the prosecution, and Oteri delves into the encounter with MacIntrye. Brady takes an unpaid leave of absence after leaving the stand.\n\n“I don't think Keith ever really accepted the fact that he was going to be a witness. He always thought that was not going to happen,” Wharton said. “We were very discreet about that, the way we phrased our questions, but Oteri was not. Keith looked like he was a dead man up there.”\n\nConnolly reads up on Capano’s cases when he was prosecutor and believes the Wilmington lawyer killed Fahey based on a 1976 murder Capano had prosecuted. Connolly says a man called Robert “Squeaky” Saunders shot a victim in the head, threw the body in a canal and disposed of the gun.\n\nConnolly also continues to get under Capano’s skin. In a burst of anger, he calls Connolly “a heartless, gutless, soulless disgrace of a human being” and is removed from the courtroom.\n\nA final last-minute surprise comes when a neighbor of MacIntyre comes forward in the remaining few days of the trial to say she saw a sobbing MacIntyre stumble out of her car on the night around when Fahey is killed. The neighbor claims the area was lit by floodlights.\n\nBut Connolly tracks down a Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, handyman who says he installed a new, brighter light fixture at MacIntyre’s house – six months after Fahey’s death.\n\nNearly 20 years later, the trial continues to be surreal for Erin Reilly Lee, whose willing venture into Fahey's plastic coffin helped bring focus to a divided jury and sealed Capano’s fate.\n\nHer journey began in Trolley Square, where Lee lived nearly oblivious to the developing Capano-Fahey saga.\n\nShe received a jury duty summons but was certain there were too many similarities between her and Fahey to be picked for jury duty. Lee went to the courthouse believing she would be sent away soon.\n\nWharton remembers that day. “Erin Reilly was a potential juror. She came in, in a plaid sort of jumper. She could have been Anne Marie Fahey. Tall, attractive. The defense lawyers wanted to strike her, but Capano insisted on keeping her because, I think, he thought, he could charm her.”\n\nAt voir dire, the process through which potential jurors are questioned by either the judge or a lawyer, Lee was interrogated then asked to leave the courtroom. When she returned, she was stunned when the judge said she’d been selected.\n\n“My brain just kind of stopped,” she said. “I was so shocked that I looked at him and I said, ‘I’m sorry. Excuse me, what did you say?’”\n\nShe remembers the somewhat taken aback judge reiterating that she’d been selected as a juror.\n\n“I kind of didn’t really hear a whole lot after that because I was thinking, ‘My mom is going to kill me. How am I going to be on this trial?’” Erin Reilly Lee said.\n\nAs the monthslong trial began, Lee watched the attorneys present evidence and question witnesses who would later help her, and others jurors, reach their conclusions. This includes Connolly questioning Capano about how he placed Fahey in the cooler.\n\n“Colm Connolly did such a phenomenal job of getting us to think about, could he really place this girl’s body into a big fishing cooler,” she said. “The way he would just keep pushing Tom.\n\n“Tom said, ‘I had this cooler that I was going to give to my brother and I panicked and so I just figured I’d put her body in there.’ ”\n\nBut Connolly kept pushing, wanting to know – and the jurors – if the body easily fit in or if bones had to be broken to make it fit.\n\n“When we were deliberating, it’s something that we kept coming back to,” Lee said. “You know, could she just fit?”\n\nWhen Lee didn’t fit, jurors realized that Capano was lying. It made it easier to find holes in other parts of his testimony.\n\nConnolly’s ability to bring out the anger in Capano, showed jurors another picture of the former prosecutor who, on the stand, was portraying himself as a meek man.\n\n“Colm did a great job at letting us see [Capano’s] anger and how he could turn,” she said.\n\n“It definitely was surprising. It’s not something I ever would even thought of happening in Wilmington, Delaware.”\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.

Keithley estimates it was about 11 p.m. or a little after when they began walking back to the Boardwalk entrance where they’d started their evening.\n\nThey were nearing the area of North Division Street, when a nearby Boardwalk clothing shop became the scene of a violent assault. Someone took a clothing rack, Keithley explained, and started to beat another person with it.\n\nThe fight grew from there.\n\n“It was just so many people fighting at the same time,” she told Delmarva Now. “He was hitting people with the rack, and then other people were like jumping him and bum-rushing him. And it was craziness.”\n\nShe and her cousin immediately grabbed the children and moved to the benches on the opposite side of the Boardwalk — hoping they were out of harm’s way. They spotted three officers writing a ticket for a woman a few benches from them.\n\nKeithley and her cousin started screaming for help: “There’s a fight breaking out! They’re beating up this boy over here!”\n\nShe estimated it took the trio about two minutes to wrap up what they were doing and make their way over, and another six minutes or so passed before more officers arrived on scene — some in cruisers, others on horseback.\n\nThe fight is one of several recent incidents on the Boardwalk and throughout town that have earned the ire of residents, town officials and even the governor, who has committed to ramping up state police support in the town.\n\nMore: Ocean City boardwalk unrest prompts council, police talk of solutions\n\nMore:Ocean City Boardwalk violence brings unease to visitors, businesses\n\nDelmarva Now sought to piece together through eyewitness, social media posts and police accounts the climax of what Mayor Rick Meehan has called \"June on steroids\" — a stream of violence and unruliness that has residents demanding answers and solutions.\n\nViral video of Boardwalk assault\n\nPart of the fight Keithley witnessed was captured in a 23-second video posted first to the social media app TikTok, and then to Facebook the morning of Saturday, June 13. Text laid over the video reads, “Ocean City is crazy. Mans got beat with a metal pole.”\n\nThe footage shows several people involved in the fight. One person is knocked to the ground, dragged by one of his legs, then hit with multiple punches, while another person wields a long metal pole. Others move around them, occasionally throwing a punch as well.\n\nAt least three officers — two in blue shirts and one in a bright green shirt — enter the frame around nine to 10 seconds into the video. The clip is at about 16 seconds when the fight seems to disperse; participants begin clapping as the video comes to a close.\n\nArrest records from that night place the fight a little after 11:30 p.m. near the Boardwalk arch. Charging documents show an officer on bicycle patrol was dispatched at 11:38 p.m. to respond to North Division Street and Atlantic Avenue for a fight in progress.\n\nThe officer wrote in a statement of probable cause that they saw two men “assaulting an unidentified male with closed fist strikes.” The men were identified as 21-year-old Shakwan Demario Kaskins and 22-year-old Donta Jamal Oakley.\n\nOakley grabbed a metal pole at one point and tried to hit the victim with it, according to the officer’s written account, but dropped the makeshift weapon upon seeing the officer. The victim then took off running down North Division Street.\n\nThe officer returned to the Boardwalk and noticed Kaskins arguing with someone before attempting to walk away, according to documents. Both Kaskins and Oakley were taken into custody.\n\nKaskins was charged with disorderly conduct, affray, failure to obey a lawful order, second-degree assault and resisting arrest, while Oakley was charged with disorderly conduct and affray.\n\nMore:Ocean City police investigating shooting; one person in custody\n\nMore:Ocean City Police chief says violence seen in online videos 'will not be tolerated'\n\nThe Ocean City Police Department’s crime reports log shows the pair were in custody by 11:44 p.m. It was at that exact time a Facebook post went up in a group about Ocean City, asking what was going on because “Like 20 cops just flew to the inlet” and more were on the way.\n\nAbout three minutes later, a 22-second long video appeared in the comments showing at least a half dozen police vehicles cutting through traffic.\n\nThe chatter on social media has left residents and visitors alike uneasy.\n\nCrowd control tractics used\n\nKeithley was still at the benches when a crowd came charging down the Boardwalk away from the Inlet Parking Lot.\n\n“Literally it looked like the stampede from the 'Lion King'. Everybody just started running,” she said.\n\nTwo or three officers on horseback had arrived by then. She remembers because it was no more than 30 seconds after she spotted the horses when a stench filled the air.\n\n“All of a sudden, our eyes start burning. We’re coughing. We can’t breathe,” she said. “I saw the elderly lady on the bench next to us, she started like vomiting and throwing up because, come to find out, they had tear gassed everywhere, just shut the Boardwalk down.”\n\nOcean City police spokesperson Ashley Miller wrote to Delmarva Now in a Monday, June 15, email that there was no “tear gas” deployed by officers over the weekend. Pepper spray was used, she explained, and many social media posts were likely referring to the “vacate” substance the department uses to disperse large crowds.\n\nAt least two videos of this Boardwalk “madness” as Keithley calls it circulated Facebook the next day.\n\nOne was a 37-second video likely captured from Snapchat. Text over the video stated, “Cops threw tear gas yoo” as dozens of people took off running away from the pier Ferris wheel, which can be seen in the distance.\n\nMore:Ocean City police arrest five in connection to Boardwalk stabbing\n\nMore:AK-47, drugs seized in Ocean City arrests: Police\n\nAnother nine-second video was included in a post that read, “OCPD tossing out the smoke last night.” It showed an officer on horseback moving amid a crowd, then a small, white cloud formed in the air as two officers rushed toward someone on the ground in front of the horse. Screaming begins just before the video ends.\n\nOCPD described the \"vacate\" substance as foul smelling.\n\n“This is a biodegradable (made from food ingredients) product that has a foul odor that lingers. It does not cause physical effects like tear gas does. It is a very strong foul odor, kind of like when a skunk sprays. You immediately want to leave that general area. The scent naturally fades after a little bit of time,” Miller wrote.\n\nThe fight Keithley witnessed wasn’t the first disturbance on the Boardwalk that day, Miller noted, and arrest records show it wasn’t the last to take place in those overnight hours either.\n\nWhat do the numbers say?\n\nBetween June 12 and June 15, a Delmarva Now analysis of online case records indicates members of the Ocean City Police Department filed charges in criminal cases against at least 103 people, and 96 of those cases had an offense date listed from June 11 to June 15.\n\nThose 96 cases include 57 involving at least one count of disorderly conduct, assault or affray, and 40 of those 57 occurred either Friday, June 12, or Saturday, June 13.\n\nMany have been critical of senior week — June is the traditional month for graduating high school seniors from Mid-Atlantic states to vacation in the resort — as the root of recent unruliness in the town, which has been captured in various social media videos.\n\nDelmarva Now's analysis found 20 of those 103 arrests were of people 18 or 19 years old, while the remainder were suspects age 20 or older.\n\nFrom June 1-14, Miller told Delmarva Now two dozen juveniles have been arrested in the town.\n\nThe police department provided documents to Delmarva Now for 21 arrestees charged between June 11 and June 13. All of those are for adults, as records for juveniles are not available to the public.\n\nPepper spray and Taser use\n\nA smoking violation earlier on June 12, resulted in three arrests, including one involving pepper spray. Smoking is not allowed on the Boardwalk, though designated smoking areas are available along the beach and 15 feet off the Boardwalk\n\nAt about 12:20 p.m. an officer was attempting to write up a smoking citation for a man with a cigar on the Boardwalk when “several disorderly subjects” started to gather, according to a statement of probable cause. They were told that if they continued to yell, curse and scream they would be arrested.\n\nAn officer tried to take Jamal Davone Coates, 26, of Gwynn Oak, Maryland into custody because he continued to yell obscenities after repeatedly being told to stop, but the man was pepper sprayed when he attempted twice to pull away, an officer wrote in charging documents.\n\nCoates was charged with disorderly conduct, failure to obey a lawful order, riot, resisting arrest and possession of more than 10 grams of marijuana.\n\nOfficers also arrested 22-year-old Deionja Johnson and 31-year-old Andreal Janae Hendricks, charging them with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and failure to obey a lawful order.\n\nAnother fight occurred on the Boardwalk just before 12:30 a.m. June 13, and arrest records show pepper spray was also used in that incident as well as a Taser.\n\nOfficers responded near Sixth and Seventh streets for reports of fighting on the Boardwalk. There were three men involved in the brawl, and one officer deployed pepper spray to stop the fight, while another used his Taser to stop one of the suspects who was trying to walk away, according to documents.\n\nJoseph Mark Verrico Jr., 29, and Terrance Moye, 23, were arrested for second-degree assault and affray, and 23-year-old Bradley Calhoun was charged with second-degree assault and resisting arrest.\n\nMore:Ocean City Boardwalk brawl captured in online video\n\nMore:OC Police ask for public's help after recent Boardwalk assaults, stabbing\n\nIt’s possible this is the incident seen in the nine-second video posted to Facebook in which at least one person appears to be knocked to the ground by a police horse. Charging documents show a mounted officer was among those who responded and the horse was used to push the fight to the ground.\n\nBefore 2 a.m., charging documents show three more arrests were made in another Boardwalk fight, this one in the area of 511 Atlantic Ave. In that incident, Roshoun Howes, 28, Zaire Maurice Frisby-Felder, 21, and Jaquan Darling, 21, were all charged with affray.\n\n'We won't be going back, not anytime soon'\n\nThis recent blow to the town's reputation may be the latest setback for residents and businesses who rely on a tourism industry that has already been hard hit by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nKeithley, her cousin and the three children didn't end up staying the night in Ocean City.\n\nThey were trapped on the Boardwalk for no more than eight to 10 minutes trying to break through the crowd.\n\nIn that time, Keithley's phone and wallet were lost when her bag was knocked from her shoulder, her 4-year-old nephew got a small scratch to the face and her 6-year-old niece ended up with a knot on her forehead that left her dizzy, Keithley said.\n\nHer small group was finally able to escape down a side street, but she was forced to return to the Boardwalk to track down her missing items.\n\n\"It was just so many people. There were so many people sitting on the benches. They were crying. They couldn’t breath. They had water. They were just like putting water bottles all over their faces, trying to clear their eyes … The whole entire town stunk, you know?\"\n\nShe was able to find the individuals who picked up her phone and wallet, but her cash was already gone.\n\nAlthough their hotel room was already paid for, Keithley said she and her cousin decided to pack the children up in the car instead and head back across the Bay Bridge at about 1:30 a.m.\n\nShe's a 33-year-old Maryland native who's been to Ocean City for everything from senior week to car shows, but says she's never cut short a trip.\n\nDespite crowds and busy events, she's only ever extended her stays. Keithley expects it will likely be years before decides to return — if she ever goes back at all.\n\nShe was frustrated by the fighting, but also by the police response, which to her seemed \"absolutely unorganized.\"\n\nShe acknowledges handling that kind of chaos is no easy task, but wants to see a more structured plan to deal with it in the future — especially when there are elderly people and small children on the Boardwalk.\n\n\"I hate to say it because who doesn’t love Ocean City? But we won’t be going back,\" she said. \"We won’t be going back, not anytime soon, not anytime in this season or probably the next season.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2024/05/07/delaware-school-board-election-guide-whos-running-in-your-district/73438239007/", "title": "Delaware school board election guide: Who's running in your district?", "text": "Correction: The Indian River School District was inadvertently left out of a previous version of this guide. It has been updated to include election information for the May 14 vote.\n\nDespite making up the largest body of elected officials across the nation, according to the ACLU, school board elections consistently show extremely low turnout. That was about 10% of Delaware voters in 2023, with several districts lower than 5% in turnout.\n\nThat makes each vote, your vote, increasingly influential.\n\nAnd while school board races are considered nonpartisan, these races have become increasingly rife with political discourse and party influence.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 14, polls will open once again for school board races throughout Delaware.\n\nContests are light. Per Delaware Code, no election will be held if there’s only one person running for a seat — thus leaving Brandywine, Christina, Caesar Rodney, Capital, Milford, Smyrna, Cape Henlopen, Laurel, Seaford and Districts 1 and 5 in Indian River without an election for that reason.\n\nWhich districts have elections?\n\nNew Castle County posts three contested races, in Appoquinimink, Colonial and Red Clay Consolidated school districts.\n\nKent County has one race, in the Lake Forest District, while Sussex County hosts contests in Indian River, Delmar and Woodbridge.

John Carney on Wednesday also met behind closed doors with students who helped to organize the local protests to discuss their desire for stricter gun control laws.\n\n“Students from across our state are standing up, making their voices heard, and calling for real change that will make Delaware safer,\" he said after the meeting. \"All adults should be listening, and should share their sense of urgency.\"\n\nWidespread student outrage over the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, has helped to refocus attention on gun control and other measures aimed at safeguarding schools, both at the national and state level.\n\nWeeks after meeting with students from Parkland, President Donald Trump on Monday released a plan to provide weapons training for teachers, create a commission to study responses to school shootings and improve existing background checks.\n\nUnder his direction, the U.S. Justice Department also ruled over the weekend that it has the power to ban bump stocks and other devices used to make semi-automatic weapons fire at a rate that rival their fully automatic counterparts.\n\nThe president, however, endured criticism for backing away from other measures he appeared to have previously endorsed, such as near-universal background checks and raising the legal age at which someone can buy a rifle.\n\nDelaware appears poised to enact its own laws meant to address many of the same measures both endorsed and abandoned by the president, most with the support of the National Rifle Association.\n\nBump stock ban\n\nThe bill to ban bump stocks and trigger cranks in the First State was passed by the Delaware House last week in a vote of 25-3, with 11 Republicans choosing not to vote at all.\n\nThe after-market devices were thrust into the national spotlight following an Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 concert-goers and injured another 550 — the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Bump stocks were attached to 12 weapons found in shooter Stephen Paddock's hotel room and are credited with helping him fire off 1,100 rounds in 15 minutes.\n\nIntroduced in December by Valerie Longhurst, D-Bear, House Bill 300 would make buying, selling or possessing bump stocks or trigger cranks a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nBuying and selling the devices would become illegal immediately, but owners would have 120 days to get the devices out of their possession.\n\nCritics such as the Delaware State Sportsmen's Association, the local affiliate of the NRA, have expressed concerns about the bill's potential to make felons out of people who purchased the devices legally. They also have pointed to the bill's lack of legal avenues for people to get rid of the devices outside of handing them into police.\n\nA lobbyist for the NRA, however, testified Wednesday in favor of the proposed bump stock ban being released to the Senate floor, however.\n\n\"I understand there is some discussion about amending the bill on the floor of the Senate to address some of our issues,\" Rick Armitage said. \"But this is still something that should become law.\"\n\nA half-dozen people also testified in favor of the proposed ban, including Middletown resident Kristen Ehlman – a member of the both the Delaware Coalition Against Gun Violence and a member of the progressive grassroots group Delaware United.\n\n\"I've gotten into a number of spirited discussions online about this and every time I ask why someone needs a bump stock,\" she said. \"The most recent answer that's been given to me is because it's fun ... Well, fun is not a good enough reason.\"\n\nTthe Senate Judicial & Community Affairs Committee voted to clear the measure for a final vote before the full chamber, where Democrats hold a one-vote advantage.\n\nCarney has said he would sign the measure if it reaches his desk.\n\n\"Straw\" purchases\n\nThe Senate Judicial & Community Affairs Committee also moved to the full chamber a bill that seeks to increase the maximum prison sentence for an initial violation of the state's prohibition against straw purchases, a term that describes when a gun buyer uses another person to fill out the paperwork required to purchase a firearm.\n\nThose purchases are illegal under federal law but several states, including Delaware, also have outlawed the transactions, which are often used by gun traffickers and people otherwise prohibited from owning a firearm.\n\nUnder the current state law, passed in 1994, a first-offense straw purchase is a felony punishable by up to three years in prison. House Bill 174, sponsored by Rep. John Mitchell, D-Elsmere, would increase that to five years but leave the maximum punishment for subsequent offenses at 15 years.\n\nOnly 38 people were charged with making a straw purchase in Delaware from 2013 through 2017. And only three of those cases resulted in convictions on those charges, according to the Delaware Criminal Justice Information System.\n\nJeff Hague, president of the DSSA, said he is unconvinced the measure will have much impact because most gun-related charges in Delaware get dropped as part of plea deals used to help secure convictions on other charges.\n\n\"If we really wanted to crack down on criminal behavior, we'd use the laws we already have on the books,\" he said.\n\nArmitage, the NRA lobbyist, struck a different tone during Wednesday hearing.\n\n\"Forty-seven percent of guns used in crimes are bought through straw purchases,\" he said. \"We support anything that deters crime.\"\n\nMinimum age for rifle purchases\n\nAcross the hall, two bills cleared their first legislative test by being voted unanimously out of the House Administration Committee, following supportive testimony from several high school students, state officials and candidates running for office.\n\nOne of those measures would raise the legal age limit to purchase rifles from 18 to 21 – matching a similar federal restriction on handgun purchases from licensed firearms dealers.\n\n\"What I'm trying to capture with this bill is somebody who wakes up on the wrong side of the moon, is really angry with the world and decides they want to go buy a gun at the age of 19 and kill people,\" said the bill's chief sponsor House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach. \"This will stop that.\"\n\nThe age limits for gun and ammunition purchases have been a hot topic since 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz used a legally purchased, semi-automatic rifle to commit last month's deadly Florida shooting.\n\nFlordia Gov. Rick Scott recently signed a similar bill that raised the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21. That prompted the NRA to file a lawsuit claiming the new law violates the constitution.\n\nSchwartzkopf, however, said some recent changes to House Bill 330 should protect Delaware from a similar suit.\n\nThe bill was amended this week so that anyone older than 18 would still be able to purchase a shotgun or muzzleloader. The measure also now includes a carve-out for anyone older than 18 to own a rifle so long as they are an active member of the Armed Forces or a qualified law-enforcement officer.\n\nArmitage on Wednesday encouraged the committee to release the bill to the full House but noted that the legality remains a question.\n\n\"This is a foray into a whole new area of policy that does not have a lot of precedent elsewhere in the country,\" he said.\n\nSeveral students from Newark High and Newark Charter School also spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that teens their age should not have access to military-style weaponry.\n\n\"We have a moral responsibility to ensure these 17 victims did not die in vain like the 20 6-year-olds did,\" Newark Charter student Vyshnavi Kosigishroff said, referring to the recent Florida shooting and the 2012 shooting at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School that caused outrage but few changes in gun laws.\n\n\"As students, we're doing our part,\" she added. \"The rest falls on you guys.\"\n\nKeeping guns from those with mental health issues\n\nThe second bill moved out of the House Administration Committee on Wednesday would allow police to seize the guns of someone a mental health professional deems to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\n\"When these events occur, like what happened in Parkland, the common refrain you hear from people of all stripes and all parties is we need to do something about mental health,\" said the bill's chief sponsor Rep. David Bentz, D-Christiana.\n\nHouse Bill 302 is named the Beau Biden Gun Violence Prevention Act and mirrors legislation proposed by the late former attorney general after the Newtown shooting. The measure passed 40-1 in the House but failed in the Senate.\n\nUnder the bill, health professionals could notify police that they believe someone is a danger and owns firearms or ammunition. Police could then seek permission from a Justice of the Peace magistrate to seize those weapons for up to 60 days.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Justice then would be able to petition Superior Court for an order to withhold the firearms even longer. The gun owner only would be allowed to present evidence that they are not a danger during that hearing.\n\nHague called the legislation a \"good bill,\" while Armitage said he supported his release.\n\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware has raised issues with the proposal.\n\nSpecifically, the ACLU argues that the gun owner does not have the right to be present at the initial hearing, while a recently added provision would allow the order to force someone facing a mental health crisis to vacate their home if another occupant owns firearms.\n\n\"This is a constitutional infringement on liberty without due process,\" the group wrote in a letter urging committee members to postpone their vote. \"Sixty days or longer with no hearing is well beyond the bounds of what the Constitution permits.\"\n\nThose concerns were not raised during Wednesday's hearing.\n\nBut two Democrats running for Delaware Attorney General -- former state prosecutor Kathleen Jennings and former Dover police officer Tim Mullaney Sr. -- testified in favor of the bill.\n\n\"This bill will save lives,\" Jennings said.\n\nThe proposal is slated for a final vote in the House on Thursday.\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/04/28/delaware-multiplying-good-jefferson-awards/7320895002/", "title": "These Delaware residents are changing the state for the better", "text": "EDITOR'S NOTE: This article has been updated to correct the name of William Gay's wife, Diane.\n\nAcross Delaware, citizens are doing good for the state and for each other.\n\nAs part of the Delaware Salute to Service with Multiplying Good, five Delawareans have been chosen for their outstanding service benefiting local communities. Delaware Online/The News Journal is a co-sponsor of the event.\n\nAll five finalists have been a “driving force” behind meaningful local change, according to Multiplying Good’s Delaware Executive Director Michele Fidance.\n\n“These folks are the backbone of public service,” Fidance said, detailing how each had brought their community together despite the pandemic to fulfill a lifelong call to help others.\n\nAll five will be honored during the 2021 Delaware Salute to Service at 6 p.m. on April 29. During the ceremony, one of the five finalists will also be chosen to represent Delaware at the National Jefferson Awards later this year.\n\nLouise Cummings\n\nIn 2017, Louise Cummings’ late husband Cpl. Stephen J. Ballard was killed in the line of duty while investigating a suspicious vehicle.\n\nSince his death, Cummings has dedicated herself to charitable work in his memory, including starting the Ballard Community Fund at the Delaware Community Foundation, which raised over $44,000 through its virtual event in 2020. The foundation has sponsored nonprofits focusing on veteran mental health, education, domestic violence, and other local causes.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the fund chose to focus on PPE distribution, raising over $12,000 to distribute face shields to law enforcement officers across the state.\n\nBeyond the Ballard Community Fund, Cummings also created and manages Ballard’s Reading buddies, an organization that partners with United Way to foster a love of reading in first and second graders.\n\nBACKGROUND:DSP widow raising funds for counselors who helped daughter through her grief\n\nShe’s also found time to volunteer as the interim executive director for Supporting Kidds, Inc., a nonprofit that supports children and families who have experienced loss.\n\nAs she wrote in a birthday fundraiser she hosted for the organization, “My daughter never met her biological father because he died before she was born. Then her only dad she knew in physical form Delaware State Trooper Cpl. Stephen Ballard was killed In the line of duty 2 years ago. She was only 5.\n\n\"This year for my birthday I want to help other families who have suffered a loss like we have (whether a child, sibling, parent or any other special person)… my birthday is truly a blessing to bless others.”\n\nWilliam Gay\n\nOver a long and meaningful life, Bill Gay has stayed busy.\n\nAfter a 20-year military career and 24 years in information technology, he started his third — and favorite, so far — career as a full-time volunteer in Sussex County.\n\nGay has focused on supporting veterans, serving as the mentor coordinator for the Sussex County Veterans Treatment Court, which has grown to assist 60 male and 7 female veterans. He and his wife Diane also served as two of the first volunteers for Bethany’s Operation SEA’s Day Warrior Family Beach Week, an event that has helped over 175 wounded warriors and their families heal and connect with one another.\n\nHe also volunteers with several other veteran-focused organizations, including the Home of the Brave (a transitional house for veterans), the Delaware Veterans Home assisted living facility, and the National Guard Youth Foundation.\n\nAdditionally, Gay has also helped five families become homeowners through a partnership with the Sussex Habitat for Humanity, the Diamond State Community Land Trust and the Sussex Contractors for a Cause. He’s also deeply involved with the St. Martha’s Episcopal Church, and chaired the team that hosted the annual Bethany Welcome to the Community Picnic for over 125 international students.\n\nMarkevis Gideon\n\nWhen Markevis Gideon was 12 years old, a middle school teacher let him take an old computer home so he could try his hand at repairing it.\n\nGideon credits that teacher’s investment with empowering him to believe a career in tech was possible for him at a young age, and giving him the incentive to focus his passions at the Howard High School of Technology.\n\nNow, he’s built a successful career for himself as the founder of NERDiT NOW, an organization that aims to “make tech affordable, accessible, and inspirational,” according to their website. NERDiT NOW aims to create a more ethical “technology ecosystem” through purchasing and repairing broken tech, then re-selling it at an affordable price or donating it to those in need in the community.\n\nBACKGROUND:Wilmington entrepreneur makes 'Shark Tank' pitch for the 'Redbox of technology'\n\nSo far, The NERDiT Foundation, the company’s philanthropic arm, has donated over 7,500 computers to those in need, to support their mission that “everyone should be afforded the opportunity to have technology in their lives.” In the past year, they ramped up their services, donating 5,000 total devices in 2020 alone.\n\nThe foundation also provides pre-apprentice and apprentice training programs for those looking for a pathway into a tech career, and aims to close not only the digital divide but the income divide, as well.\n\nJeremy Moore\n\nJust over eight years ago, Jeremy Moore was seriously injured during a night patrol in Afghanistan.\n\nMoore, an army veteran from the 82nd Airborne Division, sustained serious injuries to his back, legs and head, and had to learn how to walk again while battling chronic pain, depression and self-doubt. But after finding himself physically, mentally, and spiritually broken, Moore rebuilt his life through pursuing his passions for service and physical fitness.\n\nIn 2018, he co-founded the nonprofit More Than Fitness, an organization that works toward “equipping young people with the tools to build strong bodies, resilient minds, and unbreakable spirits,” according to the organization's website. Through More Than Fitness, Moore has helped over 100 high school students so far build self-confidence through building a practice of exercise, mindfulness, and meditation.\n\nMORE TO READ:Affected by Wilmington's challenges, this Delaware native is turning his story into activism\n\nIn the past three years, the nonprofit has already raised over $40,000 and prospered with CrossFit Diamond State and Wilmington’s Classic Barber Shop. Through their successful fundraising efforts, Moore has been able to provide free programming to young people across the state, and support them in building bolstering both their physical and mental health and resiliency.\n\nToni Short\n\nAfter sustaining a serious neck and back injury while working as a nurse in 2014, Toni Short found herself homeless.\n\nWith nowhere to call home, Short and her three cats pulled into the Rehoboth Walmart parking lot and ended up living there for two years. It didn’t take long for Short to realize she wasn’t the only homeless person living in the parking lot — or for her to begin working to help.\n\nEvery day, she went to find food for those who lived in that parking lot, and worked to connect them with motel rooms, clothes, meals, and money. In 2015, those efforts grew into Lighthouse for Broken Wings, a nonprofit for those experiencing homelessness which opened its first house the following year. Short’s outreach efforts grew to support over 50 individuals who were able to use her first transitional house.\n\nBACKGROUND:Freezing temperatures pose deadly threat to Delaware's homeless\n\nIn 2019, Short’s advocacy for the homeless entered a new chapter when she was hired as the manager for the Immanuel Shelter. There, Short supervised 81 people experiencing homelessness and helped many find jobs, permanent homes, and necessary medical attention.\n\nShort has worked without pay for her foundation for several years, and used her own money from outside jobs to pay for those who cannot afford to live in her houses. Over the many years she’s been helping the homeless, Short has impacted the lives of over 500 people and raised $30,000 in support of them.\n\nHow to watch\n\nTune in to watch the Jefferson Awards online at 6 p.m. Thursday.

The bronze bust likenesses of Amelia Boynton Robinson, a civil rights pioneer, and Pattie Ruffner Jacobs, the state’s leading suffrage activist in the early twentieth century, were unveiled Monday. Gov. Kay Ivey said the trailblazers worked to bring about “real and lasting change both in Alabama and in the nation. The statues are located at one of the entrances to the state archives and are passed by visitors, researchers and hundreds of students on field trips each year. A longtime civil rights activist, Boynton Robinson is perhaps best known as a leader in the movement in Selma. She was among those beaten during the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma in March 1965 that became known as “Bloody Sunday.” State troopers tear-gased and clubbed marchers. A newspaper photo featuring an unconscious Boynton Robinson drew wide attention to the movement. When the Voting Rights Act was signed into law on Aug. 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson invited Robinson to attend the signing as a guest of honor. Ruffner was the founder of the Alabama Equal Suffrage Association and a board member for Susan B. Anthony’s National American Woman Suffrage Association.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A federal report aimed at improving aviation safety in Alaska recommended improvements in providing weather information to pilots and continued work to update maps with information on mountain passes, among other steps. The Federal Aviation Administration, which released the report Thursday, said it will establish a team to outline plans for implementing the proposals. Several of the recommendations are underway, the agency said. The report came after the National Transportation Safety Board in early 2020 called for a comprehensive review to improve aviation safety in Alaska, citing a fatal and non-fatal accident rates far higher than the national average. Board Chair Jennifer L. Homendy in a statement called the FAA report “a step forward in addressing Alaska’s unique place in aviation safety. But more needs to be done to ensure air transportation is as safe in Alaska as in the rest of the nation. We look forward to reviewing the recommendations.” Matt Atkinson, president of Alaska Air Carriers Association, said despite progress that has been made, “there’s roughly 100 communities, numerous tour routes, mountain pass routes that lack basic aviation weather reporting, adequate communications infrastructure and other aspects that are necessary for safe operations in Alaska,” Alaska’s News Source reported.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An equipment failure caused a power outage at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on Monday morning, impacting a significant amount of flights. Shortly after 8 a.m., Arizona Public Service notified the airport about a partial power outage that affected systems in several terminals, according to Eric Everts, spokesperson for Sky Harbor. Power was restored to Terminal 3 at 9 a.m. Monday but power was still out in Terminal 4 and a nearby checkpoint was closed, he said. The power was fully restored to the airport about 1:45 p.m., according to Everts. “All systems are quickly returning to regular operation. Passengers should continue to check flight status with their airline before coming to Sky Harbor. Delays are likely into the evening,” Everts said. “Sky Harbor had more than 200 delays, more than 90 cancellations and more than 15 inbound flights diverted to other airports. American and Southwest, our two busiest airlines, were the most severely impacted,” Everts said.\n\nArkansas\n\nFlippin: A $4.2\n\nmillion expansion at a northern Arkansas boat manufacturing operation is expected to add 50 jobs, officials said. Vexus Boats said it would add 30% more square footage to its operation in Flippin, about 105 miles north of Little Rock near the Missouri border. The company makes fishing boats. “Arkansans take pride in our state’s stunning scenery and its access to outdoor recreation, and we are excited to have a company like Vexus that exemplifies our passions and values here in the Natural State,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. “These 50 additional jobs will go a long way in improving the quality of life for families in Flippin.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Two California couples gave birth to each others’ babies after a mix-up at a fertility clinic and spent months raising children that weren’t theirs before swapping the infants, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles. Daphna Cardinale said she and her husband, Alexander, had immediate suspicions that the girl she gave birth to in late 2019 wasn’t theirs because the child had a darker complexion than they do. They suppressed their doubts because they fell in love with the baby and trusted the in vitro fertilization process and their doctors, Daphna said. Learning months later that she had been pregnant with another couple’s baby, and that another woman had been carrying her child, caused enduring trauma, she said. The Cardinales’ complaint accuses the Los Angeles-based California Center for Reproductive Health and its owner, Dr. Eliran Mor, of medical malpractice, breach of contract, negligence and fraud. It demands a jury trial and seeks unspecified damages. Yvonne Telles, the office administrator for the center, declined to comment on Monday. Mor could not be reached for comment. The two other parents involved in the alleged mix-up wish to remain anonymous and plan a similar lawsuit in the coming days, according to attorney Adam Wolf, who represents all four parents.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Police tweeted just after 6 a.m. Monday that a mountain lion was sighted in the vicinity of Mathews Street and Tulane Drive in central Fort Collins. An officer spotted the mountain lion crossing a road in the area at 3 a.m., according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife. It is unknown if the mountain lion remains in the area. Mathews and Tulane run parallel to each other a couple blocks east of College Avenue and near Drake Road. O’Dea Elementary School, located at Tulane Drive and Princeton Road, and Morning Glory Preschool at Christ United Methodist Church, between Mathews Street and Tulane Drive south of Drake Road, are located in the area where the mountain lion was seen. Poudre School District schools did not have class Monday because of a teacher work day. Police advised people in the area to keep watch for children and small pets. Anyone who sees the mountain lion is asked to contact the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Northeast Region office at (970) 472-4300.\n\nConnecticut\n\nAnsonia: Gov. Ned Lamont said he has filed the necessary paperwork to begin the process of possibly running for a second term in the 2022 election. “I’ve got to make up my mind formally in the months to come, but I figure, let’s be prepared. Let’s file the paperwork. Let’s get this thing going,” Lamont said following a news conference about improvements to the Waterbury Branch of the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line. Although Lamont, 67, said he wasn’t ready to make a formal announcement, the Democrat sounded a lot like a candidate who will be on the 2022 ballot. “Look I love the job, I think we’re making a difference, I think the state is much better off today than it was four years ago,” Lamont said. His running mate, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, said she also filed the necessary paperwork to form a candidate committee for reelection. Much of Lamont’s time as Connecticut’s 89th governor has been spent dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. The state’s first positive case was announced on March 8, 2020, a little more than a year after he had begun his first term on Jan. 9, 2019.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: David Mann, board president of the Rehoboth Beach Museum, said at a city workshop meeting that the board would be willing to mount the iconic Dolle’s Candyland sign on the side of the museum. The future of the sign sparked an emotionally charged debate over the last several months after Dolle’s Candyland owner Tom Ibach moved his business from its original spot to a smaller shop a few doors down. Visitors to Rehoboth Beach would see the sign on the façade of the museum building as they head east into the city on Rehoboth Avenue. The museum ruled out placing the sign on top of its roof, largely because of concerns about the weight of the sign and a desire to have the sign facing west toward incoming traffic, according to Mann. The proposed solution came after Ibach offered to donate the sign to the city in September. Mayor Stan Mills clarified that Ibach was willing to donate the sign either to the city or the Rehoboth Beach Museum, but not to any other organizations or businesses. Before accepting Ibach’s donation though, the city agreed to conduct a feasibility study to determine the logistics and cost of moving the sign.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: For the first time in 16 years, Smithsonian’s National Zoo is celebrating the birth of golden-headed lion tamarin twins, WUSA-TV reported. Small Mammal House keepers reported for duty Oct. 7 and observed that 4-year-old mother Lola had given birth overnight and was caring for two infants. These babies are the first offspring for Lola and her partner Coco. Zoo visitors can view the golden-headed lion tamarin family at the Small Mammal House. Animal care staff closely monitor the family visually but leave Lola and Coco to bond with and care for their infants without interference. Keepers have observed Lola carrying and nursing the babies, which appear to be healthy and strong as they hold on to Lola as she explores their habitat. Because Lola is cradling the infants close to her body, it might be some time before keepers can determine their sexes. Native to the southern part of the state of Bahia, Brazil, golden-headed lion tamarins live in the tall evergreen broadleaf tropical forests and semi-deciduous forests along the Atlantic coast, the zoo said. The greatest threat facing this species is deforestation; they spend the majority of their time from 10 to 33 feet in the forest canopy. Much of their habitat has been cleared for agricultural use, including cattle ranching and cocoa plantations. Conservation scientists estimated only 6,000 golden-headed lion tamarins are left in the wild.\n\nFlorida\n\nPompano Beach: A Brightline commuter train hit a car carrying a woman and her grandchild Monday on the higher-speed line’s first day back in operation since the coronavirus pandemic began. The 71-year-old woman suffered some broken bones and the child did not appear to be seriously injured, Pompano Beach Fire and Rescue spokeswoman Sandra King told news outlets. They were both taken to a hospital. Television stations showed images of the woman’s crushed car at the intersection in Pompano Beach, which is north of Fort Lauderdale. The woman had made a right turn was was trying to cross the train tracks when the crash happened, King said. The train was heading south from West Palm Beach to the Fort Lauderdale station with Brightline officials, including President Patrick Goddard. He was scheduled to appear at an event in Fort Lauderdale marking the train’s return. The train travels at speeds of up to 79 mph through some of Florida’s most densely populated cities. The private company, which began operations in 2017 between West Palm Beach and Miami, suspended service in March 2020 shortly after the pandemic began. During the shutdown, Brightline has continued laying track for its planned expansion from South Florida to Orlando and its theme parks. That route is set to open in late 2022 or early 2023. Brightline then plans to open a line between Orlando and Tampa and one between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\n\nGeorgia\n\nRinggold: A north Georgia county on Tuesday will recount election votes after a local city council member requested the review because he lost his reelection bid by just three votes. The Chattanooga Times Free Press reported that veteran Ringgold City Council member Randall Franks faced off against incumbent council member Kelly Bomar and former council member Earl Henderson to fill two city council seats in last week’s election. Bomar took the lead with 285 votes, and Henderson beat Franks, 220-217, for the second spot, according to the newspaper. Catoosa County Elections Director Tonya Moore confirmed that a recount will be held Tuesday morning at Franks’ request. Georgia state law said a candidate can request a recount if the margin of the election outcome was decided by less than or equal to 0.5%. That request has to be made within two business days of the results being certified. Moore said the recount will be done by machine and said any other kind of recount, such as a hand recount, would require a court order.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A Big Island County Council resolution is asking state lawmakers to restrict the use of Hawaii location names on coffee packaging. The resolution, which passed unanimously last week, called for laws that would require coffee blends be at least 51% Hawaii-grown to use local geographic names such as Kona in their labeling, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Monday. Currently, distributors can use Hawaii names on coffee that has only 10% of beans grown in the named region. Hawaii coffee farmers testified at a meeting on Wednesday that the use of their regional names is limiting profits and damaging their brand. Ten percent “blends take millions of dollars each year from Hawaii family coffee farms, and that money is sent as excess profits to the owners of the … blenders on the mainland,” said Big Island coffee farmer Bruce Corker. “When consumers are misled into believing that ‘Kona’ blends are (genuine) Kona coffee, and they are disappointed by the taste of those blends, our heritage coffees … are permanently damaged,” Corker said. Hundreds of Kona coffee farmers filed a class action lawsuit against major coffee sellers in 2019 for falsely advertising coffee blends. Some of those companies have offered preliminary settlements totaling more than $13\n\nmillion, the Tribune-Herald reported.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A first-term Republican representative is the only elected official from the Legislature in a reconfigured district in southwestern Idaho, and has announced he will run for a now-open Senate seat. Rep. Ben Adams of Nampa made the announcement on social media on Sunday. Adams is in District 13 but the legislative map approved last week by the six-person, bipartisan Idaho Commission for Reapportionment puts him in District 12 for the next election. Adams is among the more conservative lawmakers in the House, and if elected to the Senate would likely tilt the chamber to the right. The District 12 Senate seat is held by Republican Sen. Todd Lakey, who is in his fifth term. Lakey, who has been active in getting legislation through the Senate on everything from gun rights to a law shielding Idaho businesses, schools and government entities from lawsuits if someone catches COVID-19, didn’t immediately return a call from the Associated Press on Monday.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Federal agents have seized 220 pounds of cocaine in Chicago. Three people were arrested, and a private plane was seized as part of last Wednesday’s operation, the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Northern District of Illinois said Monday in a release. The cocaine was part of a suspected Mexico-to-Chicago drug pipeline. About 176 pounds were found in a vehicle in the city’s River North neighborhood, and another 44 pounds were taken from a hotel room along Chicago’s Gold Coast, according to criminal complaints filed in federal court. The drugs allegedly had been flown into an airport in Gary, Indiana, earlier Wednesday from Houston. The flight originated southwest of Mexico City in Toluca, Mexico. A 30-year-old man from Toluca and a 25-year-old man from Columbus, Indiana, were arrested Wednesday in downtown Chicago. A 39-year-old Indianapolis man was arrested Thursday. A warrant was obtained Monday to seize the plane, a Bombardier Challenger 600 business jet.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Initial testing has shown the presence of lead in debris samples collected following the controlled burn of a house during a firefighter training exercise in southern Indiana. The controlled burn was Friday in Bloomington and area residents noticed and collected what appeared to be pieces of paint debris during and after the burn, the city said Monday in a release. Bloomington fire crews have been going door-to-door surveying residents about the debris. The fire department was coordinating with the state’s Department of Environmental Management to implement remediation recommendations and was working to identify and contract a company to clean up the area. Owners of the house had secured a demolition permit and donated the structure for the firefighter training. It was reviewed and approved by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, according to the city. All utilities were disconnected and potentially toxic contents and components of the house, including furniture, carpeting, asphalt roofing shingles, roofing underlayment, and vinyl siding, were removed prior to the controlled burn, the city said. Children and pets should be kept away from the paint debris, according to local health officials.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City: A Kansas woman was arrested on felony changes Sunday for allegedly driving over and ramming her former landlord’s downtown Sioux City property with a van. Valerie Marrero, 25, of Liberal, Kansas, is charged with two counts of second-degree criminal mischief, a class D felony, and eluding, a serious misdemeanor. She was held at Woodbury County jail on $7,500 bond. According to a criminal complaint filed in Woodbury County District Court, Marrero was upset with a landlord for not taking care of a property in the 800 block of Nebraska Street, where she had been staying. At 11:19 p.m., Marrero intentionally drove a white 1994 Ford Econoline van through yards in the area and struck fencing belonging to the landlord. Officers located the van traveling westbound in the 500 block of Ninth Street, where the landlord also owns property. Marrero drove over the north curb and struck a dumpster, backed up and drove north through a private drive. She struck a chain-link fence, running it over, and, then, struck a chain-link gate that blocks off the parking lot, according to the complaint. The damage is estimated at $5,000.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Shawnee County has 59 bridges in need of repair or corrective action, according to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. None is designated unsafe. “If we had any bridges that were unsafe, the road would be closed,” Shawnee County Public Works director Curt Niehaus said. Bridges are flagged for needing to be repaired for two primary reasons: It is either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. A bridge is considered structurally deficient when it isn’t recommended to carry federal legal loads like box trucks, school buses, dump trucks and tractor trailers. “It does not mean that it (the bridge) is at risk of collapse or failure,” Niehaus said. “It’s not unsafe. It just means it’s not ideally suited to carry legal loads every day. Most of our bridges don’t carry loads that heavy every day.” Bridges are determined to be functionally obsolete by being too narrow along with having a high traffic count, and as a city’s population grows, more vehicles drive over the bridge each day than for which it was designed.\n\nKentucky\n\nRussell: A new bridge in northeastern Kentucky is expected to open this month, replacing a 1930s-era viaduct and easing congestion at the approach to an Ohio River bridge, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said. The new Kentucky 244 and “flyover” design bridge into downtown Russell are scheduled to be fully opened the week of Nov. 15. Gov. Andy Beshear ceremonially cut the ribbon last week. The project caps a $110\n\nmillion Ohio-Kentucky investment that began in 2012 when ground was broken on the $80\n\nmillion Ironton, Ohio-Russell bridge. That bridge opened five years ago\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Management of the nearly century-old Louisiana Old Governor’s Mansion in downtown Baton Rouge has been transferred to Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin’s office. The governor’s Division of Administration has entered into an agreement shifting control of the mansion to the secretary of state’s office, which already runs the Old State Capitol down the street, the State Archives and seven other museum facilities. “I am excited about the addition of the Old Governor’s Mansion, which complements and accentuates the mission of the Old State Capitol, providing visitors and event-goers a tangible opportunity to experience our history first hand,” Ardoin said in a statement. The Division of Administration previously had contracted with the Foundation for Historical Louisiana Inc. to manage the Old Governor’s Mansion, which has been rented out for weddings and other large events. The Advocate reported the former home for Louisiana’s governors was built by former Gov. Huey P. Long as a copy of the White House. Using inmate labor, Long tore down and replaced in 1929 the traditional homestead that had existed for the state’s chief executive since 1887. Nine governors and their families lived at the site until 1962, when Gov. Jimmie Davis moved into the current Governor’s Mansion near the state Capitol.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: M.J. “Sunny” Eberhart, 83, of Alabama strode into the record books Sunday as the oldest hiker to complete the 2,193-mile Appalachian Trail. Eberhart, known by the trail name Nimblewill Nomad, acknowledged that despite having tens of thousands of miles under his belt, the trail was tough going at his age, leading to quite a few spills on slippery rocks. “I’ve a got a couple of skid marks on me, but I’m OK,” he said in a recent interview. “You’ve got to have an incredible resolve to do this.” He hiked the trail out of order, in sections, to take advantage of optimal weather, and had completed northern sections, including Maine’s Mount Katahdin. He completed his final section in western Massachusetts, in the town of Dalton, in the same year in which a 5-year-old became among the youngest to complete the feat. Joining Eberhart for the finish was the former record-holder, Dale “Greybeard” Sanders, who lives outside Memphis, Tennessee. He completed the hike at age 82 in 2017. Jordan Bowman, of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, confirmed that Eberhart is the oldest to finish the trail, surpassing Sanders.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Baltimore County officials said hey expect their only active landfill will become inoperable within the decade – sooner than previously estimated – and the only way to expand the facility without wiping out scores of homes is to build upward. A work group has been meeting since last year to recommend changes to the county’s long-term solid waste strategy. Several options were laid out in the group’s September report, including a vertical expansion of the Eastern Sanitary Landfill in White Marsh. Expanding vertically could extend the life of the landfill by 11 to 48 years, but it comes with drawbacks. The work group recommends the county consider spending $750,000 in the coming years to study and plan the expansion, estimated to cost between $63\n\nmillion and $162\n\nmillion to build. Fourteen out of 17 work group members agreed the option should be a priority for the county. The site has grown “a couple of hundred feet in height” in the last four decades, said Stephen Simmons with the Virginia-based solid waste consulting firm Gershman, Brickner & Bratton. The work group did not recommend building a new landfill site elsewhere. The 375-acre landfill was built in the 1980s and includes two transfer stations and recycling drop-off. It has been penalized in the past been for long-standing water pollution and solid waste violations but is now up to code. When it was built, the expected life span of a landfill was around 30 years.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWinchendon: A veterans organization sold an original 1945 Norman Rockwell painting for $3.6 million at auction over the weekend in order to raise funds after years of dwindling revenue made worse by the pandemic. American Legion Post 193, located in Winchendon, acquired the painting through a donation in 1959 from a local priest’s art collection. Coral May Grout, a former Post president, said that after weighing whether to sell for nearly two decades, it was time, The Telegram & Gazette reported. “Home for Thanksgiving” depicts a soldier seated beside his mother, who looks at him lovingly while he peels potatoes. It was commissioned for the November 24, 1945, issue of The Saturday Evening Post. The auction listing described the painting as “the tale of the first Thanksgiving after the Allies’ victory.” The artwork hung near the Legion’s main door for years, with most members assuming it was a reproduction. They got the painting appraised in the early 1980s after someone offered to buy it for $500, the newspaper said. The Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge has since kept it safe, occasionally displaying it in special exhibits.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The annual observance of the Edmund Fitzgerald shipwreck will be held in-person and livestreamed from Mariners’ Church in downtown Detroit. The Great Lakes Memorial service starts at 3 p.m. Sunday and remembers the lives lost in the roughly 6,000 shipwrecks on record in lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario. It will be broadcast over YouTube for people unable to attend. Last year was the first time the service was livestreamed, and it attracted more than 1,200 viewers, organizers said. One of the most notable and tragic wrecks occurred on Nov. 10, 1975 when the S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald sank during a storm on Lake Superior. The vessel was carrying a load of iron ore pellets to a Detroit steel mill when it plunged to the bottom, 17 miles from Whitefish Point in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. All 29 crewmen were lost. Singer and songwriter Gordon Lightfoot’s “Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald” tells the tale of the sinking and the power of the massive inland lake.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State pollution officials on Monday released a proposed impaired waters list for 2022, an update that included the addition of 15 northeastern and central Minnesota water bodies where fish have been contaminated with long-lasting chemicals. The 15 were added because of contamination with a family of widely used chemicals known as PFAS, sometimes called “forever chemicals” because of their inability to break down. It’s the first time water bodies outside the Minneapolis-St. Paul area have made the list because of PFAS contamination. A PFAS compound known as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS, can accumulate in fish and potentially cause adverse health effects in people who consume them. The waters include several bodies east of the Twin Cities metro area where the chemicals – used by Maplewood-based 3M to make products resistant to heat, oil, stains, grease and water – entered the area’s groundwater after decades of dumping into landfills. Three lakes downstream from an active cleanup site at the Duluth International Airport were also found to have high levels of PFOS, which has been used in firefighting foam.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: WDAM reported a mural commissioned by the Hattiesburg Alliance for Public Art has been unveiled in the city’s downtown. The mural, titled “Spread Your Wings,” features a green-and-blue hummingbird beating its wings. The bird was painted by Avery Orendorf of Austin, Texas, and was painted on the side of a building that houses the Fairley’s Wings restaurant. The owner of the restaurant, Nick Fairley, said the mural was a great addition to the downtown. The television station reported the hummingbird mural is the 30th to go up in the city and is one of 45 stops on the city’s public art trail. Orendorf it took three days to paint the mural.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The city’s Board of Education voted to approve a continuation of the mask requirement by a unanimous vote. With child vaccines scheduled to start, the mandate might end in January.” Good news is coming,” said Superintendent Brian Yearwood, who added he hopes the district will receive guidance to remove masking requirements after elementary students have an opportunity to receive the vaccine. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt is suing the school district over its mask mandate, though he didn’t succeed in making it a class-action lawsuit with a ruling applying to all Missouri school districts.\n\nMontana\n\nFort Harrison: A Montana soldier is the first woman to graduate from the U.S. Army’s sniper course, the Montana National Guard announced. “We are extremely proud of this soldier’s achievement and recognize that this is a milestone for not only Montana, but the entire National Guard and Army,” Maj. Gen. J. Peter Hronek, the adjutant general for Montana, said in a statement Monday. The military is not identifying her at this time. The soldier enlisted in the Montana Army National Guard in December 2020 and underwent a 22-week training course at Fort Benning in Georgia that combines Army basic training with advanced individual training in infantry skills. Her training staff recommended she be given the opportunity to attend the sniper course after she qualified as an expert shooter, Hronek said. She began the U.S. Army sniper course in September and graduated on Nov. 5. The course trains soldiers to deliver long-range precision fire and to collect battlefield information. Now that her sniper training is completed, she will rejoin her Montana National Guard unit.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Five teenagers were arrested early Monday after shots were fired from their car at police during a chase from Omaha, east into Iowa and back into Omaha. Omaha police said that five people arrested were a woman who turned 19 on Monday, an 18-year-old man, two 17-year-old boys and a 15-year-old boy. One of the juvenile offenders was treated for a minor injury and released. No officers were injured, police said. Police said they were called to an area in north Omaha just after midnight by a report of shots being fired. An officer driving an unmarked car saw a vehicle driving erratically and attempted to follow it when someone in the vehicle fired at the officer, police said. A chase ensued, police said, with the Omaha police’s air unit and other area law enforcement agencies involved.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The Carson Ranger District and the Carson Valley Trails Association are planning just over 8 miles of new, nonmotorized trails for the Jacks Valley area. The trails will connect the Jacks Valley North Trailhead to James Lee County Park in the Indian Hills community in south Carson City. The trails will also include an optional loop through the southern part of the Jacks Valley Wildlife Management Area. Construction is set to start this year and wrap up in 2022. Plans for an expansion to the trail system in the Jacks Valley area – part of the Clear Creek Trail system – has been in the works for more than a decade. The 15-mile-long Clear Creek Trail connects Jacks Valley Trailhead to the Spooner South Trailhead. Opened in 2014, it traverses through Forest Service and private land and Douglas County and Nature Conservation easements.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State officials warned residents about reports of scammers sending out a fraudulent letter that appears to be from the attorney general’s office and claims that the recipient’s identity has been used by someone to buy products online. The letter also claimed the attorney general’s office is investigating the “unsanctioned transaction” and warned the recipient that accounts linked with their Social Security number will be shut down unless the recipient buys gift cards and sends cash, the attorney general’s office said. Attorney General John Formella said in a statement that his office will never send correspondence to identity fraud victims, or any other crime victims, threatening to shut down the victim’s accounts or demanding gift card purchases. The matter is being investigated by the office’s Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Republican Jack Ciattarelli’s campaign denied there was fraud in this year’s governor’s election but his campaign’s attorney said the margin could shrink enough to warrant a recount. The statement from Ciattarelli’s campaign came after the Associated Press declared Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy the winner last week. Murphy’s lead has grown from less than a percentage point last week to about 2.6 points by Monday, as votes continue to be counted. The difference amounts to more than 65,000 votes. “Let me be clear, no one on this team is alleging fraud or malfeasance, as we have not seen any credible evidence of that,” said Ciattarelli’s legal counsel Mark Sheridan in a statement. But Sheridan added that this year’s new election law, which in part allowed early in-person voting for the first time, is also contributing to what he called “excruciatingly slow vote counting.” The campaign estimated there are about 70,000 provisional ballots – which only count after officials determine that the voter has not already cast another ballot – left to count, along with an unknown number of mail-in ballots. Each of New Jersey’s 21 counties are conducting their own count of any mail-in and provisional ballots left to be counted. The state Board of Canvassers doesn’t meet until Dec. 2 to certify the results.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: New Mexico State University and Bosque Brewing Company collaborated again to produce another university licensed alcoholic beverage. The 1888 Hard Seltzer is available in Bosque locations across the state. NMSU previously collaborated with Bosque Brewing Company on the popular Pistol Pete’s 1888 Ale, which was released in 2017. The beer is available at more than 300 locations statewide and won a bronze medal at the 2018 Great American Beer Festival. Following the ale, Aggie Athletics has licensed its wine, liquor and coffee, earning $36,000 from selling the products in the past fiscal year. NMSU is now the second university in the nation to feature a collegiately licensed hard seltzer, according to a news release. The 1888 Hard Seltzer is a cranberry tea-flavored hard seltzer which compliments Bosque Brewing Company’s line of New Leaf hard seltzers, according to the release.\n\nNew York\n\nUpper Nyack: A leading art historian diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease was found dead by police in the woods of Nyack Beach State park on Monday after having gone missing on Nov. 3. Neighbors, residents and police had been searching for Richard Kendall, 75, after he went missing from his home in Nyack, the Journal News reported. Orangetown Captain James Brown said Kendall’s body was found about 4:30 p.m. Monday. He thanked everyone who participated in the search. A statewide Silver Alert had been issued for him. Police said they were investigating the death but did not consider it suspicious. Kendall was a specialist in the impressionist movement and an expert on French artist Edgar Degas, most famous for his paintings of ballet dancers. He published multiple books on the movement with Yale University Press, according to its website. He had served as curator-at-large at Clark Art Institute in Massachusetts, and had worked on exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as the Tate Gallery and the National Gallery in England, the newspaper reported. Multiple other local, county and state agencies had participated in the search for Kendall.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nKinston: Two juveniles are facing criminal charges after one tried to back a vehicle over a police officer and led others on a chase before they were captured. The Kinston Police Department said in a news release that officers checked out what was described as a suspicious vehicle early Monday. When the officers tried to find out why they were there, the driver tried to back over one of the officers, who was able to get out of the way and avoid injury, police said. Officers attempted to the stop the vehicle as it went through several parking lots and headed east on U.S. Highway 70, police said, After the chase reached speeds of 120 mph, the supervisor called it off. Deputies from Lenoir and Jones counties spotted the vehicle but couldn’t stop it. Craven County sheriff’s deputies located the vehicle and stopped it approximately 35 miles away in New Bern when the driver lost control, the news release said. The juveniles were returned to Kinston, and the police department said they face charges including assault with a deadly weapon, felony flee to elude and a number of motor vehicle violations.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A $500,000 federal grant will help farmers in North Dakota cope with stress brought on by drought conditions, reduced commodity prices and other difficulties. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture is providing the grant money for North Dakota’s effort through the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network. “Creating and expanding a network to assist farmers and ranchers in times of stress can increase behavioral health awareness, literacy, and positive outcomes for agricultural producers, workers and their families,” institute Director Carrie Castille said in a statement. The state Agriculture Department plans to partner with North Dakota State University and the North Dakota Department of Career and Technical Education on programs dealing with behavioral health counseling and referral for other forms of assistance, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The USDA is providing nearly $25\n\nmillion nationwide in 50 grants supporting network projects.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Ohio Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide whether Gov. Mike DeWine had the legal ability to end the state’s participation in a federal pandemic unemployment aid program ahead of a government deadline for stopping the payments. At issue before the court is a weekly $300 federal payment for Ohioans to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The federal government ended that program Sept. 6, but DeWine stopped the payments June 26, saying the need for the payments had ended. DeWine, a Republican, followed the position of business groups that said the weekly payment was making it difficult to recruit employees. Critics of ending the payments said workers had multiple reasons why they might not be returning to jobs. A county judge rejected a lawsuit’s claimed DeWine didn’t have the authority to stop the payments, but the 10th Ohio District Court of Appeals reversed that ruling. Ending the program early stopped about $900\n\nmillion in Ohio payments. The two parties disagree on whether that money could still be paid, should the court rule against DeWine. The Ohio Supreme Court voted 4-2 to take the case, with Justice Patrick DeWine, the governor’s son, recusing himself to avoid the appearance of impropriety “that might result from my father’s public involvement in this case.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma County Commissioner Kevin Calvey said he is running for district attorney. Calvey, 55, is the fourth Republican to announce for the 2022 race to become the county’s top prosecutor. He vowed, if elected, to drop “bogus” criminal cases against police officers involved in fatal incidents. He directly criticized retiring DA David Prater . “Unlike our current DA leadership, I will support the police, not persecute them,” Calvey said. Calvey also addressed a pending first-degree manslaughter charge against five Oklahoma City police officers. The officers are charged in the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old robbery suspect last year. The suspect, Stavian Rodriguez, was shot about 7 p.m. Nov. 23 after he had dropped a gun outside Okie Gas Express in south Oklahoma City. An autopsy found he had been hit by gunfire 13 times, according to affidavits filed with the charge. “That case ... is a wrongful and malicious prosecution of police officers who defended each other and the public from a violent thug,” Calvey said. “My first day in office, I will dismiss those charges and other wrongful charges against law enforcement, and open an investigation as to how such bogus charges could have happened. The current DA’s hand-picked successor, Gayland Gieger, lacks the moral courage to stand up to his boss on this malicious prosecution of police officers.”\n\nOregon\n\nMonmouth: Three gravestones were placed near Bellamy Hall on Western Oregon University’s main campus over the weekend to memorialize the termination of three traditional majors – anthropology, geography and philosophy. This time last year, the university’s board of trustees approved an adjusted 2021 budget, which required an update on fall 2020 enrollment numbers. Several positions and programs at Western were to be reduced and eliminated to curb a growing concern for the institution’s financial stability. Western is the state’s oldest public university and serves nearly 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The university opened its new Salem campus in September. The institution’s original budget for this academic year, initially adopted at the board’s June 2020 meeting, was based on a projected enrollment decrease of 2.5%, officials said. But because of the COVID-19 pandemic and “many other factors,” officials reported enrollment was actually down by 7.9%, resulting in a decrease in revenue. School leaders decided cuts in spending, salaries and other expenses would be used to cover the deficit. The university planned to reduce or eliminate nearly three dozen full-time equivalent positions and programs, including the elimination of a major or minor in anthropology, a major in philosophy and the entire master’s in music and master’s in information technology programs.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMcCandless: When the monks of the Pittsburgh Buddhist Center needed a major restoration of its outdoor statue of the Buddha, they turned to an auto restoration shop specializing in classic cars. This partnership of ancient Asian spirituality and modern American craftsmanship came to fruition recently with the reinstallation of the newly refurbished, gleaming white statue at the center’s temple. Eyes closed and sitting in the lotus position, the Buddha underwent weeks of painstaking work at Exoticars in the town of McCandless, north of Pittsburgh. The statue sat amid an array of vintage vehicles from Bentleys and Corvettes to Porsches and a 1951 Ford pickup. Workers stripped multiple coats of deteriorating paint and primer – a task that required precision tools as they worked on the Buddha’s hair, depicted in detailed curls. They also repaired cracks in the fiberglass, added a metal strip to strengthen the statue’s base and put on a new coat of white auto body paint, giving it a glasslike sparkle in the sunshine. The repair job fascinated customers and also the classic car enthusiasts who bring old hot rods and sports cars of their own to Friday evening happy hours hosted by the shop, according to Exoticars co-owner Dave Ley.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island is getting a $10.6 million boost from the federal government to help the state’s tourism and hospitality industry recover from the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Daniel McKee said. The grant from the Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration will be used to support projects, businesses and jobs in the travel, tourism, and outdoor recreation sectors, he said in a statement. “This sector has been severely impacted by the pandemic, and these funds will go a long way in ensuring this sector not only bounces back but is even stronger going forward,” McKee said. More than 26\n\nmillion people visited the state in 2019, pumping $7\n\nbillion into the economy and generating $843\n\nmillion in state and local tax revenue. That fell to 21.6\n\nmillion visitors in 2020, spending $4.9\n\nbillion and generating $597\n\nmillion in state and local taxes, according to the state’s tourism agency. The state’s grant proposal included boosting advertising and marketing to attract new overnight visitors, and development of new attractions and events to boost visitation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: The city said a city-owned waste barrel had made a 3,500-mile trek across the Atlantic Ocean and washed up in County Mayo on Ireland’s northwestern coast. According to the city, Keith McGreal of Ireland wrote them and shared pictures of the bright blue barrel with city stickers on it. “I wanted to share some images of a Blue Trash barrel that has been washed up on our local beach on the West Coast of Ireland, Mulranny, County Mayo,” McGreal wrote, according to an exchange the city posted online. “We spotted the stickers and thought it would make a good news story.” The city posted the photos online, showing that the barrel’s Atlantic crossing took enough time for it to be encrusted with shells. City officials also wrote McGreal, saying the barrel must have been carried away in the Gulf Stream during a major wind or storm event.“We typically remove trash containers from the beach before a hurricane, but this one apparently had a mind of its own,” they said, adding that they “already had a city employee volunteer to come fetch it.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state House launched an investigation Tuesday into whether the state’s attorney general should be impeached for his conduct surrounding a car crash last year that killed a pedestrian. A sizable majority of the Republican-dominated House voted to have a committee prepare a report and recommend whether Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg should be impeached. It could take weeks for the committee of seven Republicans and two Democrats to delve into the crash investigation. The committee is a mix of Ravnsborg’s political allies and those who have called for his ouster. Ravnsborg, a Republican who was elected to his first term in 2018, pleaded no contest in August to two misdemeanors in the crash that killed 55-year-old Joseph Boever, who was walking along a rural stretch of highway when Ravnsborg struck him with his car. Ravnsborg has insisted that he did not realize he killed a man until he returned to the scene the next day and discovered his body. House lawmakers said they first wanted to know whether Ravnsborg could be impeached for his misdemeanor convictions, the fact that he killed a man, or that law enforcement associations have said they no longer have confidence in his office.The state constitution stipulates that officials such as the attorney general can be impeached for “corrupt conduct, malfeasance or misdemeanor in office.” But a state official has never been impeached in South Dakota. Gov. Kristi Noem, who has called for Ravnsborg to resign, has delivered a hard drive containing the crash investigation to Gosch, but he said the committee would subpoena the crash investigation from the Department of Public Safety “just to ensure accuracy.” Ravnsborg’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the House’s move.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A judge on Tuesday resentenced a death row inmate to life in prison for the second time in two years, after finding the man’s trial was marred by racism during jury selection. In his order, Judge Monte Watkins vacated the conviction of Abu-Ali Abdur’Rahman after finding his Constitutional right to a fair trial had been violated. Then the trial court judge accepted a plea agreement in which Abdur’Rahman pleaded guilty to charges of murder, attempted murder and armed robbery for which he received three consecutive life sentences, according to the court order. If the resentencing is not challenged, Abdur’Rahman will spend the rest of his life in prison but without the threat of execution. Abdur’Rahman was originally sentenced to die in 1987 for the murder of Patrick Daniels, who was stabbed to death. Norma Jean Norman was also stabbed but survived. The stabbing took place in Norman’s house while her two young daughters, Katrina and Shawanna, huddled in a back bedroom. The state Attorney General’s Office could still appeal Abdur’Rahman’s resentencing. That’s what happened in 2019, the first time Watkins threw out Abdur’Rahman’s death sentence. The 2019 resentencing came after Abdur’Rahman, who is Black, petitioned to reopen his case, presenting evidence that prosecutors at his trial treated Black potential jurors differently from white potential jurors.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: Project Bravo is providing funding for people who are behind on natural gas and energy bills, but the deadline to apply is Friday. The funds are available through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a federally funded program that helps households pay a portion of their home energy costs, according to a Project Bravo news release. “The funding can pay more than just your natural gas bill, and it is not a loan, rather money dedicated for utility assistance,” said Elizabeth O’Hara, Texas Gas Service community relations manager. Texas Gas Service is promoting the program. The funds can be used to pay energy bills for up to 12 months, up to a maximum household benefit of $1,600. The level of benefit varies according to household income, the number of people living in the home, the type of residence, the type of heating fuel and utility rates. To apply, visit projectbravo.org and for more information, call (915) 562-4100.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Republican lawmakers gave an early nod of approval to redistricting maps that further carve up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County, despite urging from a crowd to choose districts drawn by a voter-approved independent body. Many speakers argued the lawmaker-drawn maps were aimed at further diluting the political voice of those who live in and around the state capital, a process known broadly as gerrymandering. Lawmakers, though, said their districts are aimed at reflecting the state as a whole by including urban and rural voters. Many people speaking at a legislative hearing, though, said putting Salt Lake County into four districts rather than the three it’s currently in would further drown out dissenting voices. Utah is overall a reliably Republican state, but its 4th Congressional district has flipped between Republicans and Democrats. The lawmaker-drawn maps are generally considered to make that district more reliably conservative.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: The explosives license for the owner of a Castleton quarry has been revoked after blasting this summer ejected rocks onto adjacent properties, risking public safety, the Vermont Department of Public Safety said. An investigation by the department, police and the State Fire Marshal’s Office, found that nearby residents were not given adequate advance notice about the July 16 blasting and no blasting mat was used, the department said. Public Safety Commissioner Michael Schirling sent a letter to the quarry owner on Oct. 29, revoking his explosives license. The quarry owner could pursue a future license if he undergoes agreed-upon training and an examination demonstrating his competency to safely handle and use explosives, Schirling wrote. The quarry owner has 15 days to appeal the decision, the department said. He could not be reached for comment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Days after Democrats conceded control of the Virginia House of Delegates to Republicans, they walked back that concession as two key races in which the GOP holds razor-thin leads appeared headed for recounts. As of Tuesday, vote counts showed Republicans with 50 seats and holding slight leads in two additional seats that have still not been called by the Associated Press. Democrats have 47 seats and are leading in one other district that has not been called. In both districts where Republicans are leading, the margins are below 0.5%, which allows candidates to request state-funded recounts. In District 91, Democrat incumbent Del. Martha Mugler conceded to Republican challenger A.C. Cordoza on Friday. Mugler’s concession was quickly followed by a statement from Democratic House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, who acknowledged that with Mugler’s concession, the Republicans had control of the House, with 51 seats. But Mugler walked back her concession over the weekend after final absentee and provisional ballots were totaled and Cordoza’s lead shrunk to just 94 votes out of 27,388 counted. In House District 85, Republican challenger Karen Greenhalgh’s lead over Democratic incumbent Del. Alex Askew narrowed to just 127 votes out of 28,413 counted after final absentee and provisional ballots were totaled.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A metallurgist pleaded guilty to fraud Monday after she spent decades faking the results of strength tests on steel that was being used to make U.S. Navy submarines. Elaine Marie Thomas, 67, of Auburn, Washington, was the director of metallurgy at a foundry in Tacoma that supplied steel castings used by Navy contractors Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding to make submarine hulls. From 1985 through 2017, Thomas falsified the results of strength and toughness tests for at least 240 productions of steel – about half the steel the foundry produced for the Navy, according to her plea agreement, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Tacoma. The tests were intended to show that the steel would not fail in a collision or in certain “wartime scenarios,” the Justice Department said. There was no allegation that any submarine hulls failed, but authorities said the Navy had incurred increased costs and maintenance to ensure they remain seaworthy. The government did not disclose which subs were affected. Thomas faces up to 10 years in prison and a $1\n\nmillion fine when she is sentenced in February. However, the Justice Department said it would recommend a prison term at the low end of whatever the court determines is the standard sentencing range in her case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republican Delegate Josh Higginbotham has resigned from his seat after moving to Kanawha County. Higginbotham, 25, submitted a resignation letter Friday to House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, saying he no longer lives in the district he was elected to represent, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported. He represented House District 13, which includes portions of Putnam, Mason and Jackson counties. First elected in 2016, Higginbotham said in September that he would run for a Senate seat. Under the district map adopted last month by the Legislature, his new residence would put him in Senate District 8. “From Day One, my goal has been to make West Virginia a place where young adults can find jobs that affords them a chance to stay in West Virginia and raise their families,” Higginbotham said in the letter. “While there is still more work to be done, I truly believe over the last six years West Virginia has made great progress toward that goal.” Gov. Jim Justice will appoint a delegate from a list of recommendations to fill the rest of Higginbotham’s term, which ends next year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nCamp Douglas: Col. Leslie Zyzda-Martin has been relieved of her duties as commander of Volk Field Air National Guard Base at Camp Douglas. The National Guard said in a statement that Brig. Gen. David W. May ended Zyzda-Martin’s command Monday because of “lost confidence in her ability to lead.” “This is a very difficult decision, but it is the right thing to do in the best interest of Volk Field,” May said. “The men and women that make up Volk Field are extraordinary at what they do. It is my obligation to ensure they have the type of leadership that will meet the unique needs and challenges of our state and federal missions.” The guard’s statement said the decision was made following investigations that revealed issues concerning command climate and alleged misconduct. Additional investigations are ongoing. The move is in sharp contrast to the welcoming speech May gave for the commander in September 2020 when he said Zyzda-Martin had “the passion, the drive, and the heart to get the job done with integrity and decisiveness. In other words, you’re the right officer for the right command at the right time.” Lt. Col. Tom Bauer, who serves as the vice commander at Volk Field, will act as interim commander until a new commander is selected. A phone number for Zyza-Martin was not immediately available.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Longtime Jackson resident Paul Bruun was among the latest inductees into the Fly Fishing Hall of Fame, joining a 2021 class that also features baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams, Dave Brandt, a longtime fly-fishing instructor and Trout Unlimited leader, and William Taylor, a bamboo rod maker and legendary caster. Bruun is the only living inductee this year; the others will receive the honor posthumously. Bruun, 77, started the Snake River Fund, which works to protect and preserve the Snake River watershed in Wyoming. He also launched the Jackson Hole Daily, and has written outdoors columns for various Jackson newspapers for a half-century. He’s a lifetime member of Trout Unlimited and the Coastal Conservation Association. Bruun, who has guided anglers for more than 35 years, is also a master of gear. He has consulted Patagonia on its fly-fishing line dating to the 1980s. He co-created the South Fork Skiff, the first fiberglass, low-profile drift boat. The expertise became well-recognized within the fly-fishing industry, and Bruun went on to consult for rod manufacturers such as Sage, Winston, Orvis and Scott and for fly-line makers, including Rio and the Cortland Line Company.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/insider/2017/05/04/childs-journey-truegender/100371580/", "title": "A child's journey to 'truegender'", "text": "Margie Fishman, The News Journal\n\nHer first word was Mama.\n\nHer first sentence: \"I am a girl.\"\n\nShe never felt at home in her body, which biologically reflected a boy. Once, she tried to castrate herself with kiddie scissors.\n\nThis Wilmington toddler knew she was all wrong.\n\nAnd that absolute certainty sent the girl and her mother on a decadelong struggle for her to be recognized and live as her \"truegender.\"\n\nIt was not a well-beaten path for the girl's mother, DeShanna Neal. With her baby barely out of diapers, she mounted a campaign to convince family members, daycare providers, educators and ballet instructors that her child had the heart and spirit of a girl.\n\nDeShanna wasn't the type who ached for marriage or kids, much less a high-maintenance girl. She fancied herself a feminist.\n\nSo, when the ultrasound tech announced that her first-born would be a boy, there were lukewarm congratulations and a baby blue shower.\n\nDeShanna and her then-fiancé, Chris, both comic book geeks, named their baby Xavier after the founder of the X-Men, who promoted peaceful coexistence and equality between humans and mutants.\n\nTrinity would be the baby's middle name, in a nod to the fierce female hacker from \"The Matrix\" who escapes simulated reality. The idea came to DeShanna in a dream. The expectant mother was surrounded by blue wallpaper on all sides until the paper ripped into shards, exposing a patch of pink.\n\nDeShanna thought nothing of it as she embraced her two-week-old baby, her pudgy arms encased in wool sleeves. In that moment, she didn't care who she'd be or whom she'd love. She only knew that her love didn't come with asterisks. And that anyone who tried to hurt her little girl would face the wrath of \"Momma Bear.\"\n\nBut when her three-year-old pointed to a picture of a boy and said, \"This is my body,\" before pointing to a picture of a girl and declaring, \"This is who I am,\" DeShanna had no inkling how it would all unfold.\n\nWas this just a phase? And if it wasn't, who would they go to for help and how would they pay to alter the balance of hormones coursing through the child's veins? Trinity was about to join less than one percent of the U.S. population and be branded with a big bullseye.\n\nAn estimated .6% of adults, or about 1.4 million people, identify as transgender in the U.S. There are no reliable statistics for youth. In Delaware, more than 4,500 adults identify as transgender, the ninth-highest percentage of population in the country.\n\nForty-one percent of transgender people nationwide have attempted suicide, compared to less than 5 percent in the general public, a study by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the Williams Institute shows. The national Human Rights Campaign counts nine American transgender women who were murdered in this year alone, all of them women of color. That doesn't include an untold number of victims of violent crime whose genders were misidentified by police.\n\nDeShanna kept slamming into brick walls while buffering her child from society's lack of understanding and empathy. The journey would severely test her mettle.\n\nShe drew strength from her child, who believed society just needed to catch up. People grow and evolve.\n\nAnd isn't love tucked into the word evolve?\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Xavier.\"\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"Three.\"\n\n\"Are you a boy or a girl?\"\n\n\"I'm a girl.\"\n\n\"You need to fix your child,\" the Wilmington daycare worker scolded DeShanna and Chris. \"Your child is going to be gay.\"\n\nTrinity, then known as Xavier, wasn't allowed back. Neither was her younger brother, Lucien, after he bit a classmate who called Trinity a \"sissy.\"\n\nAt first, DeShanna disregarded the teachers' warnings. It was just innocent make-believe for a toddler to steal her mother's silky nightgown. Toys had no gender, so if Trinity wanted a dollhouse and she was good, she got the dollhouse. She watched her brown eyes sparkle as she played with the miniature family until Lu clobbered them with his monster truck.\n\nWhile Trinity blossomed at home, she alternated between throwing tantrums and acting withdrawn at her new preschool. She scored in the 98th percentile for clinical depression, according to the child's pediatric psychologist. She despised her body, declaring it \"all wrong.\"\n\nThe family consulted a child therapist, who instructed DeShanna to find work outside the home so that her child would stop emulating her. Low-key Chris needed to be \"more masculine,\" and they both had to smack their child whenever she behaved like a girl.\n\n\"All I heard was that this was my fault,\" DeShanna remembered. \"Everything I had believed when pregnant for the first time — that I'd be the worst kind of mother — had come to pass.\"\n\nAt a loss, the professional debt collector scoured the Internet. \"My son says he's a girl,\" she punched into the computer keyboard.\n\nAll the articles dealt with teenagers and adults. Until she found Jazz.\n\nIn 2007, Jazz Jennings appeared on \"20/20\" with Barbara Walters as the brave and beautiful face of a child born into the wrong body. Obsessed with mermaids and cheerleading, she had socially transitioned from a boy to a girl at age 5, making her the youngest transgender person to become a national celebrity. Jazz confirmed for DeShanna that Trinity's \"phase\" didn't have an expiration date.\n\nBy that point, her child had developed an anxiety-induced Pica eating disorder, gnawing on wood splinters from her bed and chewing holes in her sheets and denim dungarees.\n\nHeartbroken that she couldn't wave a wand and grant Trinity a vagina, DeShanna located one of the few gender therapists in Delaware who would agree to evaluate a four-year-old.\n\nThe therapist immediately diagnosed Gender Identity Disorder, a tidy classification for an agonizing conflict between biological sex and expressed gender identity. It would be another five years before the American Psychiatric Association replaced the term with the less stigmatizing Gender Dysphoria.\n\nGender identity is established in the brain as early as age 2, according to medical research. Studies of transgender people's brains have found that they more closely resemble the brains of their self-identified gender, not of their sex assigned at birth.\n\nThere is no official cause for why a person is transgender or gender non-conforming, but doctors have concluded that it isn't acquired through exposure. Rather, it is interwoven with a person's biology, possibly caused by scrambled hormones or a gene involved at a stage of fetal development.\n\nTrinity belonged to the first generation of Americans to grow up with transgender role models. More than a decade after the word \"transgender\" entered widespread use, members of Generation Z were articulating their gender identity at a much younger age.\n\nFor those who are transgender, \"I wish I were a girl\" isn't a fleeting thought like \"I wish I were a rap star.\" Medical providers say it's a consistent, persistent and insistent belief that you deserve a do-over in utero.\n\nResponses from authority figures like \"man up,\" or \"quit being a tomboy\" won't help struggling children, experts say.\n\nMore:More transgender youth demand medical treatment\n\nResearch shows that transgender children with supportive parents have better outcomes for emotional well-being than those locked into pre-determined roles. A 2012 Canadian study found that transgender teenagers who were rejected by family members were more than twice as likely to exhibit symptoms of depression and more than 90 percent as likely to have attempted suicide.\n\n\"It's most important for kids in pre-puberty to encourage them not to pigeonhole themselves,\" said Brett Herb, one of the few therapists based in Delaware specializing in transgender issues. \"Let them direct where they're going.\"\n\nTrinity's gender expert suggested that she experiment with gender-neutral clothing, swapping her lumberjack flannels for blue T-shirts with just a hint of a ruffle.\n\nWith no improvement after four weeks, the couple returned to the therapist's office.\n\n\"Help us,\" DeShanna beseeched her through strangled sobs. \"Help our child.\"\n\nThe gentle woman with the bob cut looked gravely at DeShanna. Then at Chris.\n\n\"Do you want a happy little girl or a dead little boy?\"\n\nMom relented: \"Guess we're going shopping.\"\n\nBy the time they arrived at Wal-Mart, DeShanna was full-blown frazzled.\n\n\"What do girls wear?\" she grilled Chris, who stared back, incredulous.\n\nA deli manager at BJ's, Chris wasn't entirely sure what being transgender meant. But he understood that the XX and XY he learned in biology class didn't account for fluid gender roles.\n\nRaised Catholic, the thirty-something grew up in a time when talk show host Maury Povich paraded around transsexuals in swimsuits, asking his studio audience to vote on \"male or female?\" Men \"pretending to be women\" functioned as empty punchlines and reviled villains in mainstream films. Happy Meal toys were either hulking action figures or sparkly unicorns.\n\nBack then, bathrooms weren't battlegrounds.\n\nChris recalled \"Bible thumpers\" in the African American community who believed fervidly that rejecting your God-given genitalia meant that you were destined for damnation.\n\n\"You don't give up on your kid,\" he consoled himself. \"It's basic common sense.\"\n\nAfter ransacking the girls' department for frilly pajamas, panties and Mary Janes, DeShanna and Chris beat the school bus home.\n\nLu hopped off first, chirping about all the Play-Doh he had ingested earlier that day. Trinity hung back, thumb firmly lodged in mouth.\n\nDeShanna attempted small talk: \"How was your day? What did you do?\"\n\nNo response. (As usual).\n\n\"Trinity, how was your day?\" mom pushed, trying on her middle name for the first time since her birth certificate.\n\n\"It was fine,\" came the meek reply.\n\nEmboldened, DeShanna continued: \"Daddy and I have a surprise for you. It's in the bedroom.\"\n\nShe let Trinity go alone to discover the My Little Pony dress and leopard-print leggings, laid out on her Spider-Man sheets.\n\nShe lingered there for several minutes as mom became increasingly agitated.\n\nWhat if this doesn't work? she fretted. What if it drives her deeper into a black hole?\n\nBut when Trinity re-emerged, she was a vision in pink with a gummy smile. DeShanna hadn't seen her child beam like that in years, not in the snapshots of her wearing football jerseys or plopped next to Legos.\n\nTrinity had been drowning, she realized, waiting for her mother to summon the nerve to rescue her.\n\nIn her blog, \"Through Her Eyes,\" DeShanna shared this insight years later: \"It was never Trinity that transitioned because she already knew she was a girl. It was her father and I that needed to take off the blinders and open our eyes.\"\n\nSTORY: No more 'fronting:' Transgender inmate embraces new name\n\nThe apprehensive child reveled in the empire-waist gown and accessories. She asked her mother: \"Is this mine? Will I wake up tomorrow and they'll be gone?\"\n\n\"No,\" DeShanna assured her. \"These are all yours now.\"\n\nShe hesitated before asking Trinity one last time.\n\n\"I just need to know. Are you a girl or a boy?\"\n\n\"I'm a girl,\" came the resolute reply.\n\nAlright, then. \"Lu, this is your sister,\" Deshanna motioned to her only son.\n\n\"Yeah, I know.\"\n\nThat was a Friday. By Monday, DeShanna had notified the preschool that Trinity would no longer go by Xavier and she'd be wearing a dress. Confused, the school administrators went along with it — to a point.\n\nWhen it came time for class pictures, there was a radiant girl with white flower barrettes pinned to her close-cropped hair above the label Xavier Neal.\n\nTrinity's classmates, meanwhile, seemed oblivious.\n\n\"They don't know hate at that age until they learn it from an adult,\" DeShanna reasoned.\n\nWith Trinity racking up gold stars for her behavior, her parents figured they had dodged a bullet by the time kindergarten rolled around.\n\nDeShanna met with a Wilmington public elementary school, which she declined to name, to discuss adding Trinity's name to the official school roster to avoid pronoun slips, along with giving her access to the girls' bathroom. It was eight years before President Obama mandated that public schools allow transgender students to use bathrooms matching their chosen gender identity, a decision that was recently reversed by the Trump administration.\n\nTrinity had never set foot in a boy's bathroom, so school officials struck a compromise. She could use the nurse's bathroom on the other side of the school. When riding the bus, she would be forced to wear a school ID identifying her as Xavier, and male.\n\nNo exceptions.\n\n\"Guess we're homeschooling,\" mom decided.\n\nShe quit working at the bank and the family dipped below the federal poverty line. They rented a dreary apartment in a complex near Canby Park where a stabbing, not Santa, heralded Christmas.\n\nBut that was nothing compared to the assaults, masquerading as questions, directed at the Neals.\n\nDeShanna recalls her family's initial \"emotionally constipated\" reaction to Trinity's transition, which soon degenerated into accusations of unfit parenting, mental illness or a \"split brain,\" sexual abuse and references to a long-lost grandson. Some referred to the child simply as \"it.\"\n\nDeShanna declined The News Journal's request to interview members of her family, explaining that they'd prefer not to go public.\n\n\"My family thinks we're leaving him out to dry,\" she wrote in her blog. \"Leaving him to the wolves.\"\n\n\"What is really getting to me,\" she confessed, \"is the question of, 'What did you do that has made your child this way?' \"\n\nDeShanna's mommy group, one of her few social outlets, disowned her.\n\n\"Maybe you should consider a late-term abortion because there's something obviously wrong with your uterus,\" a tattoo artist sneered at DeShanna, then seven months pregnant with her third child.\n\nBut the most common line of interrogation began with this: \"How does she really know?\"\n\nWhen did I know I was a girl? DeShanna asked herself. How old was I?\n\n\"I just knew.\"\n\nGender identity is not the same as sexuality or even sex, which has more to do with chromosomes and gonads, DeShanna calmly explained to Trinity's critics. Gender identity is who you are inside, not just how you feel, but what you know: Male, female, a blend of both, or neither.\n\nIt was a hard sell, like trying to persuade our ancestors that the Earth was really round.\n\n\"The very idea that we've been wrong (about gender),\" DeShanna said, \"that scares people.\"\n\nBut she also knew that the simple act of switching pronouns, a change that some family members vigorously resisted, made her child feel \"happy and whole.\"\n\nEventually, some retrained their grammar. Others DeShanna had to let go.\n\nBy age 7, Trinity, too, was demanding answers, not oversimplifications. She had joined the soccer team and wanted the correct terminology for what society would call her and people like her.\n\nDeShanna's first inclination was to sugarcoat it, to repeat to her daughter that she was born a boy like her brothers, but that her heart and soul were all girl. She had shielded her from the label, concluding that it was unnecessary and potentially lethal.\n\n\"You are transgender, Trinity,\" DeShanna blurted out finally, the word sitting like bitter dirt on her tongue.\n\n\"Transgender,\" the girl whispered over and over before scooting off to play, her chest puffed out.\n\nHer dreads wrapped in a side ponytail, the 9-year-old leaped out of the car like a gazelle clad in purple sweats to join the other ballerinas.\n\nIt had been two years since Trinity had attended the family-owned dance school, where teachers but no one else knew her secret. The pirouettes ended abruptly after the birth of her second brother, Hyperion (from \"The Avengers\").\n\nThat day, one of the teachers pulled DeShanna aside as she was preparing to leave.\n\n\"Does Trinity still have her male genitalia?\" she prodded.\n\nMom nodded, jaw dropping.\n\n\"Well then, she won't be allowed to dress in the main room with the other girls during the recital. She'll have to dress in the utility closet.\"\n\nDeShanna rushed home, compared notes with her online support network, then drove back, fuming.\n\nHow dare they treat her child like a predator, especially one who was so self-conscious about her genitalia. Apart from being discriminatory, isolating Trinity would likely undermine five years of progress toward self-acceptance.\n\nThe school's \"safety\" concerns weren't registering with the incensed mother, so the owners took a different tact. They threatened to \"out\" Trinity to the other dance parents.\n\nDeShanna broke the news to her ebullient daughter on the car ride home.\n\n\"Trin, you won't be going back to that dance school.\"\n\n\"Why? I did my steps right and everything?\"\n\nDeShanna murmured something about finding a better fit, a more \"loving and caring environment.\"\n\n\"It's because my body got all mixed up, isn't it?\" her child demurred.\n\n\"Yeah, baby. I'm sorry.\"\n\nThen puberty hit.\n\nWithin eight months, Trinity's hormone levels spiked to stage 2 on the widely-used Tanner scale of physical development, when pubic hair and testicles begin to grow. Her testosterone was going gangbusters.\n\nThis alarmed Trinity; she had assumed she would go through female puberty like the other girls.\n\nShe had nightmares about growing a beard, her voice plunging to Barry White depths. She willed her body to cooperate, but her renegade brain kept signaling \"Change!\"\n\nIn late 2015, less than a month before Trinity's 12th birthday, Daniel Doyle, chief of the Division of Pediatric Endocrinology at Alfred I. duPont Hospital, ordered puberty blockers for his patient.\n\nTrinity was the youngest transgender person the Rockland doctor had treated over a career spanning nearly three decades. He could count the others on one hand.\n\nPragmatic with incisive, deep-set eyes, Doyle knew that he and the Neals had painstakingly assessed this next step. He wasn't about to let them down.\n\n“It’s not something that they take lightly and will change their mind,\" he said of the family.\n\nPuberty blockers involve suppressing the release of two hormones, LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), from the pituitary gland. The treatment, endorsed by the Pediatric Endocrine Society and offered at more than 35 clinics nationwide, stops testosterone from being released from the testes, and estrogen from being released from the ovaries, thereby halting sexual development.\n\nIn essence, blockers buy more time for a transgender youth who is transitioning, since the effects are reversible once a person ceases treatment. Youth are spared from the anguish of watching helplessly as their developing bodies subvert their gender identity.\n\nNot being exposed to one’s own sex hormones also offers a blank slate for cross-hormone therapy, which is the point of no return. For Trinity, that meant achieving a curved, feminine shape without enduring surgery later on.\n\nDoyle outlined these arguments in a letter to Highmark Health Options, a Delaware Medicaid provider. He recommended the drug, Lupron, which is injected in the upper buttocks every three months at an average annual cost of more than $9,000.\n\nHighmark's denial came a week later. DeShanna didn't miss the reference to Xavier \"Trinity\" Neal, as if Trinity were a fun nickname.\n\nThe state's largest insurance provider concluded that the blockers weren't medically necessary for Trinity's diagnosed gender dysphoria. They were only FDA approved to treat precocious puberty among youngsters.\n\nHad her daughter suffered from cancer or diabetes, Medicaid wouldn't dare deny treatment, DeShanna huffed as she began strategizing an appeal. Eleven days later, another letter arrived, informing her that the appeal window was now closed.\n\nStupefied, DeShanna attended a service at her Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Newark, where she shared her family's struggle. Hurtling toward puberty, Trinity was tormented and frightened, she told the congregation.\n\nState Rep. Paul Baumbach, a former treasurer of Equality Delaware who was in the audience that day, empathized with the testimonial. The Neals didn't live in his district, but the lawmaker and financial planner offered to intervene.\n\nBaumbach got in touch with Sarah McBride, an old friend, Wilmington native and national transgender advocate. McBride, who made history last year as the first transgender woman to speak at the Democratic National Convention, hooked up Baumbach and the Neals with the latest medical research on the effectiveness of puberty blockers.\n\nSTORY: Trans woman's road to DNC included ties to Markell, Biden\n\nMeanwhile, DeShanna, an author of erotic fiction, had persuaded Highmark to grant her an appeal hearing by penning a clever response that was copied to multiple state health leaders and Baumbach. In it, she cited a provision of the Affordable Care Act, which prohibited discrimination based on gender identity in federally funded programs. It was a veiled legal threat.\n\n\"Your kids aren't asking for much except to know you've got their back,\" she would explain later. \"And maybe an allowance.\"\n\nOn Dec. 11, 2015, DeShanna strode into the Highmark conference room to face off against a half dozen health care officials representing the insurance giant and the state. With her husband busy watching the kids, DeShanna brought along her Unitarian reverend, Andrew Webber, who offered to wear his clergy collar to elicit sympathy. Doyle joined by phone.\n\nWearing a pained \"I don't want to be here but this is my job\" look, a Highmark executive turned to an oft-repeated 20-year-old study: In 1995, researchers found that of a sample of 45 gender-nonconforming children, 80 percent were not transgender by the time they entered high school.\n\nDoyle interjected, explaining that new guidelines released by the Pediatric Endocrine Society recommended early medical interventions for transgender youth experiencing severe distress.\n\nThe executive then grilled the doctor about his scant record treating transgender youth.\n\nAs the hearing wore on, DeShanna grew increasingly agitated. Didn't her daughter deserve the same respect as any other low-income child seeking medical care?\n\nHer indignation masked a mother's guilt. She could roar and clog up email inboxes. But she couldn't afford to save Trinity.\n\nBy the time the state took this seriously, she worried, it would be too late for Trinity and all the other black transgender kids deserving of unconditional love.\n\nTheir Black Lives also mattered.\n\nSTORY: Delaware prisons beef up transgender protections\n\nThat day, the reverend had the final word.\n\n\"I hope you think deeply in your heart and make the right decision,\" he urged the bureaucrats holding the purse strings.\n\nTucked into their packets was a handwritten note from Trinity. Cramped lettering revealed a timid child who didn't understand why everything had to be so complicated.\n\n\"I don't want to be a boy or I'll be sad for the rest of my life,\" the letter read. \"Please give me my blockers.\"\n\n\"It'll be a dream come true.\"\n\nPart 2 of 2:Transgender teen pushes boundaries to be \"legal\"\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.\n\nAn estimated .6% of adults, or about 1.4 million people, identify as transgender in the U.S. There are no reliable statistics for youth.

Carney\n\nLast year, Carney called for cuts across state government combined with a number of tax hikes to close a $386 million budget gap.\n\nDebate in the General Assembly about those measures led to a contentious finish to the legislative calendar missing a June 30 deadline but ending with a final spending plan that cut spending while raising taxes on real estate transfers, tobacco, and alcohol.\n\nThe latest budget projections indicate those measures should result in nearly $88 million more in revenue than was expected for the coming fiscal year – just in time for an election cycle that will see 10 senate seats and all 41 house seats up for grabs.\n\nBut last year's deal failed to address larger structural deficiencies that are expected to eventually result in costs once again outpacing revenue, thanks largely to rising health care costs and growing enrollment in Delaware's public schools.\n\n\"It’s a simple math problem,\" Carney said Thursday. \"Our long-term growth rate for state spending is two times the growth rate of our revenues. We have to find a long-term way to limit our spending growth.\"\n\nThe governor called on legislators to resist the temptation of using one-time revenue windfalls to balance the budget and instead focus on structural spending reform.\n\nBut he also outlined several new initiatives aimed at improving the state's public education system, enhancing life in Wilmington and offering new benefits to state workers, all of which are expected to carry a price tag.\n\nNo proposed spending cuts were offered during the 30-minute speech.\n\n\"It was a great speech but I heard a lot of fiscal contradictions,\" said Senate Minority Whip Greg Lavelle, R-Sharpley. \"He said we can't spend money we don't have, we can't rely on one-time money in the budget, we spend twice as much as we take in and, by my count 10 to 12 new spending initiatives.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach, said he is less concerned about the governor's new spending proposals.\n\n\"The State of the State is just an outline,\" he said. \"A lot of the answers will be filled in next Thursday when he rolls out his budget.\"\n\nEducation\n\nCarney's speech offered a preview of the governor's spending priorities for the coming year, many of which are focused on improving education for some of the state's youngest and most vulnerable students.\n\n\"The best thing we can do to invest in our state’s future is to invest in quality education for every Delaware child,\" he said. \"And we know that students are best prepared for success when they reach kindergarten ready to learn.\"\n\nThe state's final budget for this year included $26 million in education cuts.\n\nBut the governor said he will call on legislators to include more funding next year to cover the cost of hiring nearly 200 teachers statewide to account for an increase in students, as required by state law.\n\nCarney said he also plans to target additional funding to expand the number of math coaches in middle school across the state.\n\nThe Opportunity Grants program that in September spread $1 million across 13 schools that serve at-risk students should get more money, Carney said. He hopes to more than triple that number this year to help pay for after-school programs, reading interventions or other resources.\n\nAnd he will propose additional money for Delaware Stars for Early Success, which offers training for early child care providers and rates them on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. Providers that improve can get reassessed and secure more funding through a tiered reimbursement plan tied to a program that helps working, low-income families pay for preschool.\n\nDue to last year's budget shortfall, early child care centers were stuck at their current reimbursement levels, regardless of how much time, energy and money they put into improving the quality of education they provide.\n\nCarney also highlighted his administration's efforts to help improve education in the five Christiana School District schools located in Wilmington.\n\nThe governor has offered the district an additional $18.5 million in funding to consolidate those schools into two buildings and enhance various programs. The Christina School Board has twice voted to table a memorandum of understanding with Carney and the state Education Department – most recently on Tuesday night.\n\n\"This may be the most difficult thing we do during this administration,\" Carney said. \"But it is clearly the most important.\"\n\nWilmington\n\nA long-time resident of Delaware's largest city, Carney highlighted numerous \"unprecedented\" efforts his administration has undertaken to make \"Wilmington strong again.\"\n\nThe city last year set new records for shootings and homicides and suffers from highest-in-the-nation gun violence among youth.\n\nThe state and city, Carney said, are working to implement recommendations from a 2015 report from the Centers for Disease Control that suggested agencies better share information and proposed linking schools with community health and social services, among other actions.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, he noted, has launched a unit specifically dedicated to providing support for Wilmington’s struggling neighborhoods. Caseworkers are being stationed at community hubs. And probation and parole officers are working closely with the Wilmington Police Department.\n\nA key improvement the governor hopes to make this year centers on providing jobs to many of the city's low-skilled and underemployed residents.\n\nHe specifically referred to a plan to expand the Port of Wilmington and redevelop DuPont Co.'s former Edge Moor chemical plant into a new container import-export dock.\n\nThe Diamond State Port Corp. has received three proposals from private companies willing to undertake the work and management of the facility at no cost to taxpayers, state officials say.\n\nThe expansion promises to bring 5,000 new jobs to the area and up to $300 million in investment.\n\nCarney said he hopes to present a plan to the General Assembly for a new public-private partnership at the port in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We can’t undo decades of distress in Wilmington in a single year,\" he said. \"But working with the Mayor and city leaders, we’re determined to turn the ship around.\"\n\nState workers\n\nThe governor also spent a significant portion of his State of the State address discussing what he called an investment in state workers to \"treat them like the professional, dedicated workers they are.\"\n\nCarney teased a much-anticipated proposal to provide raises to many of the state's 30,000 employee – a common tactic in an election year. The state is the single largest employer in Delaware.\n\nThe governor also highlighted his support for legislation that would provide state workers with 12 weeks of paid parental leave, a rare benefit in the United States.\n\nThe governor is expected to include the roughly $2.5 million in funding needed to pay for the measure in his proposed budget\n\nFirst introduced in 2017, House Bill 3 would allow full-time state workers, including school district employees, to take up to three months of paid maternity during the first year after the birth of a child. Parents who adopt a child that is 6 years old or younger also would be eligible.\n\nCurrently, only three states – California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island – require private employers to provide paid family leave, including time off to care for sick family members. Seven others offer some form of paid family leave to state workers alone.\n\nThe Office of the Controller General estimates about 1,000 state workers a year, both men and women would be eligible for the paid parental leave offered by the bill.\n\n\"This is the right thing to do for our workers and for their children,\" Carney said.\n\nPerhaps the biggest bombshell of the speech came when the governor announced he and legislators are working on a bill that would create a student-loan forgiveness program for educators, an initiative he said would help retain teachers in some of the state's highest need schools and highest-demand subject areas.\n\nHe also said he would be proposing funding to upgrade state buildings in an effort to \"increase productivity and give us a happier workforce.\"\n\n\"State employees deserve to work in spaces that are clean and well-maintained,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, many state office buildings have fallen into disrepair, are poorly lit, and are in need of a little TLC.\"\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/05/golden-gate-bison-prisoner-paintings-dining-dogs-news-around-states/111395748/", "title": "Golden Gate bison, prisoner paintings: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: The son of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., as well as family members of a condemned inmate, is asking the governor to stop Thursday’s execution of the man convicted in the 2004 killing of three police officers but who was not the trigger man. Nathaniel Woods is scheduled to be executed by injection. Woods and co-defendant Kerry Spencer were convicted of capital murder for the 2004 killings of Birmingham police officers Carlos Owen, Harley A. Chisolm III and Charles R. Bennett. Spencer was also sentenced to death for the killings. Prosecutors said the officers were gunned down in an ambush as they tried to serve a misdemeanor warrant on Woods at a home where he and Spencer sold crack cocaine. Martin Luther King III sent Gov. Kay Ivey a letter Tuesday “pleading with you not to execute Nathaniel Woods.” King wrote on Twitter that the execution is an “injustice.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Reports of felony sexual offenses are up nearly 20% across the state but on the decline in the Southeast region, the Alaska Department of Public Safety says. The department released its compilation of reported felony sexual offense numbers from 2018 last week, The Juneau Empire reports. Reports of felony-level sex offenses increased 19.5% in 2018 compared to 2017. More than 1,762 offenses were reported across Alaska in 2018, the department said. Western Alaska reported the highest rate of felony-level sex offenses statewide, while Southeast Alaska reported the lowest rate. The victims were 88% female, and 95% of the suspects were male. More than 55% of the victims were minors. Family members and acquaintances made up the largest portion of suspects at 93%, while 98% of suspects were known or related in cases involving victims under 11 years old.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Mayor Kate Gallego called Tuesday for a shared regional response to surging homelessness and lack of affordable housing in and around the city, saying more money and longer-term solutions are needed to tackle what she said is “a crisis situation.” “As the nation’s fifth-largest city, we’ve seen abundant opportunity come from our historic growth, but it’s also brought challenges,” Gallego said. “Two of these challenges, a lack of affordable housing and a growing issue with people experiencing homelessness, are deeply intertwined.” Gallego wants to add $3 million to the $20 million the city already spends annually on homelessness and a shortage of affordable housing but said other cities, Maricopa County and the state should provide more help. The Maricopa County Association of Governments said a one-night count in early 2019 found some 6,600 people in metro Phoenix did not have a home.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The chief administrative law judge for the Arkansas Workers’ Compensation Commission and wife of the state Republican Party chairman was elected Tuesday to the Supreme Court after a race that focused on her deep ties to the GOP. Barbara Webb defeated Pulaski County Circuit Judge Morgan “Chip” Welch in the race for the seat being vacated by retiring Justice Jo Hart, winning an eight-year term on the court. The race was the only statewide election on Arkansas’ ballot other than the presidential primaries. The state’s high court races are technically nonpartisan, but Webb faced scrutiny during her bid over her appeals to GOP voters. She had the backing of Sen. Tom Cotton and former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and had spoken to Republican gatherings around the state. Welch during the campaign criticized Webb over her ties, accusing her of talking to an “echo chamber of one political party.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Five young bison have joined Golden Gate Park, doubling the bison population in time for the park’s 150th anniversary. The 1-year-old female bison arrived at the park in the heart of the city Friday, bringing the total number of bison to 10 in the paddock that has existed since the 1892. The new humpbacked, shaggy-haired wild ox were brought from the Northern California ranch where they were born. They will be formally introduced to the public on April 4, the park’s anniversary, said Phil Ginsburg, general manager of the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department. Besides more bison, the park will celebrate its anniversary with the opening of a 150-foot observation wheel, a kids carnival, community picnics, a large display of the iconic AIDS Memorial Quilt, live entertainment, and free entry into all park museums and cultural centers.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A controlled burn that became a wildfire was the result of weather conditions that were underestimated by fire personnel, state officials said. The Colorado Department of Public Safety Compliance and Professional Standards Office issued a report Sunday about the October fire in northern Larimer County. The fire burned less than 1 square mile outside the planned area but forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents in Glacier View, 35 miles northwest of Fort Collins. No one was injured, and one outbuilding was destroyed. The burn in complex terrain spread when weather conditions quickly turned drier, warmer and windier than anticipated, the state’s report said. The prescribed burn led by The Nature Conservancy on the private Ben Delatour Boy Scout Ranch was part of a forest restoration effort, the report said. Area residents were upset at the time that the prescribed burn was started despite the dry, windy conditions.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Lawmakers are revisiting a proposal to greatly expand the gambling reach of the state’s two federally recognized tribes, but the governor expressed doubts Tuesday whether that’s the right approach this year. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, who previously sought a wide-ranging gambling agreement, said the General Assembly should instead support a simpler, competing bill that would authorize the tribes, the state’s lottery and existing off-track betting operators in Connecticut to conduct sports wagering. “It also builds upon the state’s existing partnership with the tribes, is more likely to withstand legal challenges from third party competitors, and promotes a fair and competitive sports betting market outside the tribes’ reservations,” Max Reiss, Lamont’s spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: It’s now legal to bring your dog to restaurants in the First State. Thanks to a bill that Gov. John Carney signed into law Tuesday, restaurants and beer gardens can now decide themselves whether to allow canine owners to bring furry companions to dine in outdoor seating areas. The law requires the pup to be leashed, and the restaurant still has to abide by health regulations. The bill comes after a minor controversy last summer when the Delaware Division of Public Health took a renewed interest in an existing state regulation that prohibited pets in food establishments, including the outdoor areas. The ban did not apply to service animals. “Many, including myself, had no idea this policy existed,” bill sponsor and House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in other parts of the world could have an impact on attendance of the National Cherry Blossom Festival, WUSA-TV reports. The annual festival draws more than 1.5 million people over a four-week period to experience a wide range of events centered on the district’s Yoshino cherry blossom trees. “It’s really Washington’s grandest springtime tradition,” said Mike Litterst with the National Park Service. He said the park service is doing what it can to prepare in case there is a coronavirus crisis in D.C. While there have been no confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the district, Maryland, or Virginia, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said she fears tourism might take a hit for the festival. Festival organizers say two Japanese high school music groups have canceled plans to travel.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Landlords wouldn’t be able to prohibit emotional support animals, but people who falsely claim to need one could face jail time, under a bill unanimously passed by the state Senate on Tuesday. Landlords could ask people with emotional support animals whose disabilities are not apparent to document the need. Health care professionals who certify the need for the animals would have to have personal knowledge of the renter’s disability. People wouldn’t be able to simply download a certification of need from a website. Democratic Sen. Kevin Rader of Boca Raton said he often hears complaints from condominium residents about people falsely claiming their pet is an emotional support animal, saying people are “getting phony baloney psychological papers saying they’re allowed to have animals in their communities.” A similar House bill is awaiting a full chamber vote.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State employees would receive three weeks of paid time off when they become new parents under a proposal backed by Republican leaders in the Georgia House. Speaker David Ralston is among the influential GOP lawmakers supporting a bill that would grant paid parental leave to nearly 250,000 state workers, including public school teachers and employees of state-run universities. Private employers would not be affected if the measure becomes law. “Our goal is not to dictate to the private sector what they should and shouldn’t be doing because that’s not consistent with what any of us up here believe,” Ralston said at a news conference Tuesday. “But hopefully they will take inspiration from us.” Currently, state employees in Georgia are eligible for 12 weeks of unpaid leave when they have a new child, as required by federal law.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: The island of Molokai could have its first movie theater in 12 years if the project is approved by local regulators. The owners of the RWH Chen Building in Kaunakakai plan to open a 48-seat theater, The Maui News reports. Brad and Grace Ellis recently renovated the space on the island in Maui County. The theater would be located in the third of three units in the building, sharing the structure with two apparel stores. “When we started renovating it, we were amazed at the number of people who were saying we could use a movie theater,” Brad Ellis said. The last movie theater on Molokai was the Maunaloa Town Cinemas, which closed in 2008 after the Molokai Ranch property with a lodge, golf course and cattle operations closed and laid off more than 120 employees.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The amount of money in the state’s rainy-day fund that serves as a cushion against a potential economic downturn would increase under legislation that headed to the governor’s desk Tuesday. The Senate voted 31-4 to approve the legislation that is in line with Republican Gov. Brad Little’s recommendation. It would increase the Budget Stabilization Fund from 10% to 15% of general fund revenues. State officials said the change plus deposits would get the fund to more than $600 million by next year. Backers said the extra money will shield the state from a recession. Opponents said the money could instead be used for education and other pressing matters long neglected. The legislation passed the House 64-2 last month.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Two police officers who were involved in the shooting of an unarmed man in a downtown train station last week should be completely stripped of their police powers for the time being, the head of the agency that investigates the city’s police shootings recommended Wednesday. The officers, whose names haven’t been released, were already placed on administrative duty until investigations into Friday’s shooting are completed, which is policy in cases of officer-involved shootings. But if the officers are stripped of their police powers, they would be relieved of their service weapons and would no longer have the authority to make arrests, said police spokesman Luis Agostini. Interim police Superintendent Charlie Beck was told the recommendation but didn’t immediately decide on the matter, Agostini said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: After a tumultuous year in school accountability, Indiana schools got their report cards Wednesday, but the state-awarded letter grades used to rate schools – and, in some cases, intervene in cases of poor academic performance – arrived with little fanfare. The Indiana State Board of Education released the letter grades months later than normal and without comment. The grades were delayed while lawmakers crafted legislation that renders the grades moot, protecting schools from the impact of poor performance on the state’s new standardized test, the ILEARN exam, which was administered for the first time last spring. The law says that a school’s A-F grade for the 2018-19 school year may not be lower than that same school’s A-F grade for the previous year. In order to determine the final 2018-19 grade for each school, the Indiana Department of Education awarded schools the higher of the two grades.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Felons would be required to repay restitution to victims before they could get their voting rights restored under a bill passed Tuesday by the state Senate. Earlier in the day, Gov. Kim Reynolds for the first time indicated support for the measure after having previously stood firm that she didn’t want to make voting rights restoration more difficult. Currently, felons must apply to the governor individually, and Reynolds has required that they have at least a payment plan for court-ordered financial obligations but not total repayment to be considered. Senate Republicans are insisting on complete repayment to victims before they will consider passing a separate constitutional amendment that would automatically restore felon voting rights upon the completion of a sentence, a priority of Reynolds that Republicans failed to pass last year.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The University of Kansas has settled an age discrimination lawsuit brought on behalf of a former employee who said he was ousted in retaliation for raising the alarm that his department was told to fill job openings with mainly millennials and other young people. Under a consent decree agreed to last week with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of former school employee Jeffrey Thomas, the university pledged not to discriminate against job applicants or employees based on age and to give Thomas $144,000 in back pay and damages, KCUR-FM reports. Thomas worked for the school from July 2004 until December 2014. As part of the consent decree, the university was required to mail a letter of reference on behalf of Thomas noting that he was promoted and received an award for his performance as a supervisor.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state House passed a bill Tuesday requiring Kentuckians to present photo identification in order to vote. It would go into effect for the general election this fall. Senate Bill 2 passed by a 62-35 vote, with all present Republicans members voting for it and all but two Democrats voting against the legislation. Kentucky law currently allows eligible voters to cast a ballot if they present personal identification, but SB 2 would require government-issued identification that includes the voter’s photograph. Republican supporters of the bill – including new Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, who campaigned on the issue – say the bill is needed to combat voter fraud through impersonation and restore public confidence in the election system. Democrats and groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky fear it would create unnecessary barriers to voting in order to stop a form of fraud that has never been a problem in Kentucky.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: As many as 31,000 of the state’s food stamp recipients could lose their benefits under a new Trump administration rule starting April 1 that enacts stricter work requirements on childless adults, according to estimates released Wednesday by the state social services agency. The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services will be contacting the affected people who get food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program with information about how they can keep getting assistance. The new rule will limit work-eligible adults to three months of SNAP benefits in a three-year period unless they are working, volunteering or participating in a job training program for at least 80 hours a month. Exceptions are allowed for people with dependents, people who have a disability, students, pregnant women and certain other criteria.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state Republican Party won the right Tuesday to collect signatures for a referendum drive to repeal ranked-choice voting in presidential races even as Portland residents voted to expand ranked-choice voting in local races. The GOP went to court after being denied the right to collect petitions at polling places in Portland. A judge granted a temporary restraining order Tuesday afternoon, allowing the GOP to begin collecting petitions at 3 p.m. In denying the GOP request, the city cited a state law prohibiting groups from trying to influence voters on an issue before them on the ballot. Ranked-choice voting is allowed in mayoral races in Portland; the proposal on the city ballot would allow ranked voting to apply to council and school board races. The GOP wants to roll back a ranked-choice voting law adopted by lawmakers last year to use ranked-choice voting in presidential races in Maine.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The Salisbury Zoo has confirmed it lost its national accreditation during a standard five-year renewal process. The Association of Zoos & Aquarium cited the Salisbury Zoo for not meeting certain industry standards during its fall 2019 evaluation, said the zoo’s acting director, Leanora Dillon. The zoo’s level of deferred maintenance, inadequately maintained buildings and the lack of a full-time veterinarian all contributed to the zoo losing its standing. Representatives didn’t share further specifics on where the zoo fell short, but Dillon emphasized that none of the concerns had to do with animal welfare and that zoo is not in danger of losing any animals immediately. It must wait one year to reapply for accreditation while making progress toward fixing its citations. In the meantime, the zoo has been told it can maintain the animals it currently holds, such as Andean bears, otters, wallabies and jaguar.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Mayor Marty Walsh’s next chief of staff will be the first indigenous person to hold a Cabinet-level position at City Hall, officials said. Kathryn R. Burton, 43, will start in her new role March 9, Walsh’s office announced Tuesday. Burton has worked as director of operations for a housing development firm for the past four years. She also previously worked as chief of staff for former state treasurer Steve Grossman. Walsh’s office said in a statement that Burton will focus on implementing the mayor’s priorities and “ensuring the effectiveness of city services.” Burton is a member of the Gesgapegiag Mi’kmaq tribe in Quebec, Canada. She grew up on the Eskasoni First Nations reserve in Nova Scotia. “I look forward to helping Mayor Walsh achieve his ambitious goals for the city and being part of the team that is leading the charge in making Boston a better place for all,” Burton said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nVanderbilt: The 108,000-acre Pigeon River Country State Forest is getting a nearly 600-acre addition in a land deal valued at more than $2 million, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources. The property purchase, finalized last month, adds the Elk Forest at Black River, which is in Montmorency County, to the state’s public lands. The area is surrounded on three sides by existing state-managed land and includes public access to Walled Lake. “This spectacular place adds a gem to the crown of Michigan’s public lands,” said Debbie Begalle, DNR forest resources division chief. “The land will be open for hiking, hunting, fishing, elk viewing, skiing, snowshoeing, bird watching, mushroom hunting and berry picking, to name just a few activities.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Men incarcerated at the Minnesota Correctional Facility-St. Cloud presented paintings Wednesday to honor the three Minnesota National Guard soldiers killed in a December Black Hawk helicopter crash. Kao Xiong, Jason Ricci and Sergio Zapata did not have painting experience before taking a class at the prison, but the three worked together to create pieces honoring the guardsmen. “Words cannot express our deepest condolences,” Zapata said before the artists unveiled the work, saying the process was “an honor and privilege.” Each painting contained the name of one of the soldiers killed in the Dec. 5 crash – Sgt. Kort M. Plantenberg, 28, of Avon; Chief Warrant Officer 2 James A. Rogers Jr., 28, of Winsted; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Charles P. Nord, 30, of Perham. This was the first commission for the artists, although they paint on their own through classes at the prison, they said.\n\nMississippi\n\nBay St. Louis: The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation granted more than $2.8 million to The Nature Conservancy in Mississippi to expand its oyster reefs. The funding will be used to increase the existing oyster reef in Bay St. Louis by 20 acres, WLOX-TV reports. The reef is currently 10 acres. The project was expected to add more height to the reef so it can be stronger if there’s an influx of fresh water, such as what happened last year when the Bonnet Carre Spillway was opened twice. Oysters help maintain water quality and provide habitat for several estuarine species. But sudden influxes of massive amounts of polluted fresh water can lower oxygen levels, killing oysters and other marine life.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The state is denying severely disabled children full access to services and failing to prevent unnecessary placements in institutions, according to a federal lawsuit. The suit was filed Tuesday on behalf of nine children and teenagers with medically complex conditions who are enrolled in Medicaid – public coverage administered by the state, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Though the children have been approved for intensive in-home nursing care, the state is failing to arrange for the care or make sure the services are available, the suit alleges. Also listed as a plaintiff is the Caring for Complex Kids Coalition, an association of parents and caregivers of medically complex children in Missouri. A spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Social Services said in an email that the department does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state Supreme Court has upheld the certification of a class-action lawsuit against the city of Billings over franchise fees charged on residents’ water, sewer and garbage bills. The plaintiffs argue the fees, which were ended in mid-2018, constitute an illegal sales tax, and they are seeking reimbursement. District Judge Gregory Pinski certified the case as a class action involving up to 35,000 people last April. The city appealed, and the Supreme Court upheld his ruling Tuesday. The wastewater class includes people who paid the franchise fee dating back to Jan. 18, 2010, and the garbage class paid fees dating back to July 1, 2012. Justices and the plaintiffs agreed the claims over the water franchise fees could date back only to February 2014 after the city argued that water is a “good” and that a four-year statute of limitations applies.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: People who are sexually assaulted could have a personal advocate to help them through the aftermath under a bill state lawmakers advanced Tuesday. Lawmakers gave the measure first-round approval on a 41-0 vote. It would create a sexual assault survivor’s bill of rights, giving survivors the right to have an advocate of their choosing present during medical exams and legal depositions. Survivors could also be interviewed by a law enforcement officer of the gender they choose. Sen. Kate Bolz, of Lincoln, said she introduced the measure to help people who have just experienced an extremely traumatic event. Some lawmakers questioned whether the measure could have unintended consequences but agreed to work on it before it receives final approval. Two additional votes are required in the Legislature before the bill goes to the governor.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The city is making more than 100 homeless people leave an encampment along railroad tracks near a shelter in the downtown area. The city provided a week’s notice before police and other city workers began enforcing the order Wednesday. Those staying in the encampment had to pack up their belongings and take them with them, but some said they had nowhere else to go. Officials said the people were trespassing on railroad property and posed an extreme fire danger. According to the Washoe County Health District, the city had to dismantle the encampments because of health code violations. The Community Assistance Center is nearby but lacks space to house the people who have been staying in the encampment. City spokesman Jon Humbert, a city spokesman, estimated there were about 130 people in the tent encampment.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nCampton: Applicants are wanted for this year’s Artist in Residence program at the White Mountain National Forest and Arts Alliance of Northern New Hampshire. The program offers artists a chance to pursue their particular art form while being inspired by the surrounding forest and to engage members of the public with their work and artist process. The application deadline is March 15. One artist residency of at least three weeks will be offered between mid-July and the end of September. The artist will be provided accommodations on or near the forest, as well as a $2,000 stipend. Public programs may include demonstrations, exploratory walks or hikes, performances, interactive or participatory installations, group creative projects, or other programs based on the medium, interest and experience of the artist.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy had a tumor that is likely cancerous removed from his kidney Wednesday, Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver said in a statement. Murphy’s office did not disclose the hospital, beyond saying it was in New York, or who performed the surgery but said the partial nephrectomy was done by a urologist and a team of doctors. Murphy, 62, announced late last month that doctors had found a 3-centimeter-wide tumor on his left kidney during a CT scan. It’s unknown whether the tumor was cancerous, but kidney tumors usually are, according to the Mayo Clinic. The tumor was caught early enough, Murphy has said, that his prognosis was “very good.” He ceded all his authority, such as signing bills and declaring a state of emergency, to Oliver beginning Wednesday “until further notice.” He is expected to slowly return to a public schedule of events over the next several weeks.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nBandelier National Monument: The National Park Service says the popular loop trail at Bandelier National Monument will be getting a much-needed facelift this summer. Officials say the 1.2-mile paved path at the bottom of Frijoles Canyon is showing the effects of weather, time and tons of foot traffic. The trail provides access to dozens of archaeological sites. Acting Superintendent Dennis Milligan said visitors should expect rerouting, closures and delays. The work is scheduled to begin in May and will last from four to six months. Starting in May, visitors also will be required to take a shuttle bus from the White Rock visitor center to access the monument’s most visited area in Frijoles Canyon. The shuttle helps relieve the shortage of parking during the busy season. The shuttles will run daily from May 14 through Oct. 14.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State senators moved to strengthen seat belt laws Tuesday and approved a bill that requires back-seat adult passengers to buckle up. The legislation, passed by the state Senate and Assembly, now moves on to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Current law requires front-seat adult passengers to be buckled, but the legislation would force adult back-seat passengers to use a seat belt too – a move supporters say will save lives and cut down on the risk posed to buckled-in front seat riders. “The simple fact is you’re not any safer in the back seat. So we have to make that message loud and clear by passing this legislation,” state Sen. David Carlucci said on the chamber floor Tuesday. Carlucci, a Democrat whose district includes Rockland County, said New York in the 1980s became the first state in the nation to require people in the front seat to wear a seat belt. But since then, dozens of other states have enacted back-seat belt laws, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Primary voters on Tuesday chose a Democratic former state legislator and Iraq War veteran to challenge Republican Sen. Thom Tillis this fall and the GOP lieutenant governor to try to unseat Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Cal Cunningham, who ran unsuccessfully for a Senate seat 10 years ago, defeated party rival Erica Smith and three others to earn the Democratic nomination. As in 2010, he received the backing of Washington Democrats. His military career, centrist views and fundraising advantage propelled the waste-management company attorney to victory over Smith, who ran on a more liberal platform. GOP primary participants also chose Lt. Gov. Dan Forest over state Rep. Holly Grange for the gubernatorial nomination to take on Cooper. Primary voters decided dozens of nominations for federal, state government and legislative seats.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nJamestown: Area Republicans auctioned bottles of wine named for and signed by state Superintendent Kirsten Baesler just days after she was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving. North Dakota District 12 and 29 Republicans held their Lincoln Day dinner last weekend. House Majority Leader Chet Pollert says that for years the dinner has included a wine auction as a fundraiser for candidates. Eleven bottles of “Baesler’s Bulldog Red” and “Superintendent Baesler’s Honor Roll White” were auctioned. Baesler signed the bottles before the dinner Saturday, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Baesler, 50, is seeking the North Dakota Republican Party’s endorsement for a third term. She was arrested on suspicion of driving drunk Wednesday night.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A new effort to legalize recreational marijuana in the state got underway this week. Backers of a measure called the Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Amendment submitted the initial petition and 1,000 signatures to the Ohio Attorney General’s Office for review. A long process awaits the proposal, which backers want on the November ballot. The constitutional amendment would allow adults over the age of 21 to buy, possess and consume limited amounts of marijuana, including growing up to six marijuana plants. Voters in 2015 handily defeated a ballot issue to legalize marijuana in the state, though some opposition involved concern over exclusive rights that would have been given to initial growing sites under that proposal. The state’s current medical marijuana program, approved in 2016 and now just over a year old, would remain in place if the legalization effort passed.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state House has backed a bill that would require hundreds of public buildings in the state to display the national motto, “In God We Trust.” The House voted 76-20 on Tuesday in favor of the bill, sending it to the Senate. Critics say the bill is an affront to the separation of church and state that could alienate nonreligious people. Rep. Collin Walke, D-Oklahoma City, suggested that the bill is an election year stunt. But the bill’s Republican sponsor, House Speaker Charles McCall, said it wasn’t intended to be a religious issue but rather to honor the nation’s history. The bill could cost the state an estimated $85,000 to place the signs in 342 state buildings. Others, though, say it could be more because the bill specifies that each displayed motto match the size and placement of the one in the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center in Washington.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The capital city’s fourth annual Women’s March will be held Sunday, moving this year to a new date. “Women Rising” is set for 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Oregon State Capitol. In a release, march board chair Debbie Miller said the event was moved to a later date to avoid conflicts with Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January, as well as to co-celebrate International Women’s Day, a global day for celebrating the achievements of women and advocating for equality. The mission of Women’s March Salem is to harness the political power of diverse women and their communities to create transformative social change, Miller said. The event will include a rally with speakers, booths, food and music, followed by a 1-mile march. Vanessa Nordyke, a city councilor and senior assistant attorney general with the Oregon Department of Justice, will serve as master of ceremonies. Organizers said the event will be free, peaceful and family-friendly.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The City Council unveiled proposals Tuesday aimed at reducing the number of people in poverty in the city by 25%, with a goal of lifting at least 100,000 people above the threshold by 2024. A special committee released its poverty action plan with recommendations to address several areas including housing, education and guaranteed income for the city’s poorest residents through public initiatives and private partnerships. Some of the proposals include providing rent subsidies; guaranteed income; increasing the availability of adult education in every neighborhood; and streamlining the process to apply for federally funded benefits. A study by the Pew Charitable Trusts in 2018 found about 400,000 Philadelphia residents – nearly 26% – live below the national poverty level. That percentage was more than double the national average and was the highest of the 10 most populous U.S. cities.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s first health clinic for the LGBTQ community has opened to offer a variety of services including primary care, HIV prevention and treatment, and express screening for sexually transmitted infections. Open Door Health, an initiative of the Rhode Island Public Health Institute, opened Monday. It will fill an important role for members of the state’s LGBTQ community, who disproportionately experience poor health outcomes as well as a lack of access to culturally competent care, Executive Director Amy Nunn said. Tiara Mack, a member of the clinic’s community advisory board, said navigating the health care system as a black woman is already difficult, but it was compounded after she came out as lesbian. “I was excited to see that there is now an affirming place where my community won’t have fear of sharing their identity with their doctors,” she told The Providence Journal.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Plans are moving forward to construct a memorial to the nine African American worshippers killed at church in 2015. The Mother Emanuel Memorial Foundation announced Monday that Bank of America is giving the board a $250,000 grant toward the construction of a permanent memorial at the Mother Emanuel A.M.E Church in downtown Charleston, news outlets report. Construction is expected to cost about $10 million, which includes buying additional property. The foundation has raised over $7 million as of Monday, Foundation Board Co-Chair John Darby said. Plans for the memorial were designed by Michael Arad, the same architect who created the National September 11 Memorial in New York City. The Charleston site is set to include a marble fountain engraved with the victims’ names surrounded by two high-back benches facing each other that resemble “sheltering wings.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A Senate committee on Tuesday advanced Gov. Kristi Noem’s proposal to revive the state’s riot laws with criminal and civil penalties for those who urge rioting. Native American groups opposed to the Keystone XL pipeline warned that the initiative would stoke tensions that could lead to situations similar to the stand-offs over the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. The bill will next be voted on by the full state Senate. It has already passed the House. Candi Brings Plenty, a lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the bill “sets the stage for a continuation of tensions.” Many tribal members spoke of their experiences of demonstrations at Standing Rock and described how law enforcement used violence and threats of incitement to riot charges against them. They argued that the bill represents another step in long-standing oppression of Native American people since the violation of treaties dating back to the 1800s.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: An elections administrator in the tornado-stricken county that includes the capital is praising voters for turning out on Super Tuesday despite damage to voting locations and treacherous driving conditions. More than a dozen voting locations in Davidson County were damaged and closed after a tornado swept through Nashville and surrounding areas in the early morning darkness Tuesday. Voters navigated road debris and street closures to reach precincts that were not damaged to cast ballots in the presidential primary election. Polls in Davidson County opened at 8 a.m., an hour later than originally planned. A couple of locations remained open until 10 p.m. Despite the adversity, voters still made it to the polls in respectable numbers, Davidson County elections administrator Jeff Roberts said Wednesday.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A fourth area code has been approved for the Dallas area, the Public Utility Commission of Texas announced Tuesday. In a statement, the PUC said it had approved the addition of 945 as an overlay because of a looming shortage of telephone number possibilities for the 214, 469 and 972 area codes. Those codes are used by Dallas County and parts of Collin, Denton, Fannin, Hunt, Johnson, Kaufman and Tarrant counties. The new code is to be implemented over the next nine months, and telephone numbers containing the 945 area code will be assigned once the numbers available for the other three codes are exhausted early next year. According to the PUC statement, the addition of the code should be simplified because callers within the region already are required to dial 10 digits.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state is poised to study the disproportionate violence inflicted against Native American women and girls after the Legislature voted to create a task force. Indigenous communities gathered at the Capitol to celebrate Tuesday after the proposal passed the Senate unanimously, the Deseret News reports. It now heads to Republican Gov. Gary Herbert’s desk. Democratic state Rep. Angela Romero’s plan would bring together a nine-member task force of lawmakers, researchers, tribes, law enforcement and an advocate for victims. The task force will identify data-collection gaps in local, state and federal enforcement agencies. Nationwide, American Indian women face a murder rate more than 10 times the national average, according to federal statistics. Utah had the eighth-highest number of missing and slain indigenous women in a nationwide study of 71 cities completed by the Urban Indian Health Institute several years ago.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: Voters in the city have overwhelmingly opposed a $209 million school bond proposal to build a new middle and high school. About 6,500 voted against the project, while roughly 1,700 voted for it, on Town Meeting Day on Tuesday. The school board said the project was needed because of overcrowding and aging infrastructure at the South Burlington High School and Frederick H. Tuttle Middle School. The board said that if the proposal were rejected, it would come up with another solution to address the concerns.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Museum of History & Culture is set to open an exhibit that celebrates a century of female activism. “Agents of Change: Female Activism in Virginia from Women’s Suffrage to Today” is scheduled to open Sunday. The exhibit will feature artifacts from the museum’s collections, new acquisitions made through a major collecting initiative and rarely seen loans from private individuals. It is intended to honor change-makers who have brought about positive change in their communities, Virginia and the nation. In a news release, Museum Collections Curator Karen Sherry said the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 marked the culmination of a concerted fight for women’s suffrage and heralded a new age of female participation in American civic life. She said the stories in the exhibit underscore the importance of civic engagement.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The Legislature on Tuesday approved a bill that reduces the crime of intentionally exposing a sexual partner to HIV from a felony to a misdemeanor. Supporters of the change to the rarely used law say the current penalties don’t have an effect on reducing transmissions or improving public health. Opponents argue the move diminishes the significance of the impact on a person who is unknowingly infected. The measure now heads to Gov. Jay Inslee, who is expected to sign it. Democratic Sen. Annette Cleveland said that the bill modernizes criminal statutes and recognizes “advancements in medical science that have rendered HIV a treatable disease.” The legislation, requested by the state Department of Health, also calls for more intervention from local and state health officers, allowing them to recommend options ranging from testing to counseling. They could even mandate treatment for an individual determined to be placing others at risk.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice urged state residents Wednesday to “live our lives” despite the emerging threat of the new coronavirus. Justice held a news briefing along with Department of Health and Human Resources Secretary Bill Crouch at the Capitol to discuss steps West Virginia is taking and to give common-sense advice on how people should protect themselves. There are no known cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 thus far in West Virginia. The briefing came after Justice held a private roundtable with administration and medical officials to make “absolutely certain that we’re ready, God forbid, if we do have a situation here in West Virginia,” Justice said. Crouch said the risk that the virus will arrive in West Virginia is low, especially due to the very small number of international travelers coming to the state. But he predicted most states will see such cases “the way it’s moving.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nSuamico: Gov. Tony Evers gave out nearly $75 million Wednesday to help local governments around the state pay for 152 transportation projects and programs. The one-time funding was included in last year’s state budget as the Democratic governor and Republican lawmakers sought to provide more money for transportation. The local funding will go toward projects and programs in 66 of the state’s 72 counties. “Think about tourism or farmers getting their products from point A to point B,” Evers said. “Folks getting to and from work, to school, and our state economy absolutely depends on having good roads, safe bridges and great highways.” He announced the grants at a news conference at the headquarters of the Howard-Suamico School District near Highway M in Brown County, which will receive $1 million for a widening project.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Sleeping Giant Ski Area will remain open after previously planning to suspend operations for the 2020-2021 season, Yellowstone Recreations Foundation said in a statement. The ski and recreational area was scheduled to close over financial concerns after reopening in 2009, the Cody Enterprise reports. The mountain initially closed in 2004 because of similar monetary issues. No changes have been planned for the summer zipline business, which could be affected if winter ski operations are shut down about 50 miles west of Cody, officials said. The mountain has operated at about a $200,000 loss most years since reopening but nearly broke even in 2013, foundation officials said. The mountain made about $335,500 profit in 2015, including volunteer contributions. Sleeping Giant is tentatively expected to remain open until March 22, depending on conditions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2023/05/25/delaware-beach-guide-a-locals-guide-to-rehoboth-lewes-dewey-more/70153728007/", "title": "Delaware beach guide: A local's guide to Rehoboth, Lewes, Dewey ...", "text": "We feel sorry for those in the region who only know the Jersey Shore or Ocean City, Maryland.\n\nSure, they are bigger than the Delaware beaches and have more to do, but they seem a bit, uh, soulless compared with the character found at our summertime playgrounds.\n\nLewes has the feel of a small New England port town with Stephen King writing a novel in a house overlooking the quaint Lewes and Rehoboth Canal.\n\nRehoboth Beach has a mighty melange of families seeking fun, candy, games and rides, along with an established LGBTQ community that helps make it stand out from its competitors with big boardwalks.\n\nUndiscovered gems:The best 'secret' beaches in Delaware: Broadkill, Pickering, Slaughter. Plan your visit.\n\nJust south, Dewey Beach may still be a run-and-run town for the young (and young at heart) looking to bar-hop, but it's growing into more than that as more families visit and also settle down in what once were group beach houses.\n\nBethany Beach is the opposite of Dewey with a small boardwalk and sleepier feel known as \"The Quiet Resorts\" in tandem with Fenwick Island, the smallest of Delaware's beach towns ― and the closest to the way Delaware's beaches once were before development took over years ago.\n\nWith five coastal Delaware towns to choose from within 25 miles of each other, it can be tricky to figure out what's right for you and your fellow beach-goers.\n\nTo help, the Delaware Online/The News Journal newsroom brainstormed a local's guide to Delaware's beaches to help point the way.\n\nWhether you want to let loose at a beach bar, take a quiet nature walk or escape a rainstorm with the family for some indoor shenanigans, we have plenty of ideas because we've done them all ourselves.\n\nWith the temperatures rising, it's time to grab your bathing suit and soak in some sun.\n\nRehoboth Beach\n\nIf you're searching for the classic American summer beach experience, Rehoboth and its milelong Boardwalk, which dates back to 1873, is the place for you.\n\nSoaked in nostalgia, it's the land of beach umbrellas, saltwater taffy, and, of course, hungry seagulls looking for a runaway french fry.\n\nIts main drag, Rehoboth Avenue, is packed with non-chain shops and eateries, and you'll find the LGBTQ-heavy Baltimore Avenue just a block away.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nA beach scene. A foodie scene. A gay scene. That's the reason Rehoboth is Delaware's favorite playground for so many.\n\nIt's where President Joe Biden has his summer beach house in North Shores, sometimes seen riding bikes on the Gordons Pond Trail located in Cape Henlopen State Park. NBC News \"Today\" co-anchor Hoda Kotb also has a home here, often seen on the Boardwalk or at Browseabout Books, a beloved independent bookstore that dates back to 1975.\n\nOther celebrities spotted over the years: Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, NBA great Michael Jordan, actor Denzel Washington, auteur John Waters, TV host Kathie Lee Gifford, actor Richard Gere and even U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nBy day, the sun and the beach rule with shopping at the town's bountiful boutiques a close second. By night, you can stroll the romantic alleyways lit by string lights where they serve crepes and sell tie-dye after a fine dining experience.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nThere are some staples that have become so intertwined with the town that it's almost a crime not to stop in at least once, if not to just taste what generations of beachgoers have been drawn to.\n\nGrotto Pizza's \"legendary taste\" has several locations in town with its distinctive sauce swirl and use of a mild cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. Traditionalists should try a couple of other family-owned hometown favorites: Louie's Pizza (since 1974) and Nicola Pizza (since 1971, but now located on Route 1), also home to their famous \"Nic-o-boli\" strombolis.\n\nBesides pizza, the Ocean City, Maryland-founded Thrasher’s with its three Rehoboth locations is a go-to for French fries for decades (try with salt and vinegar!), along with the more down-home Boardwalk legend, Gus & Gus Place. Other Boardwalk spots that have lines for good reason: Kohr Brothers (soft-serve frozen custard), The Ice Cream Store (100-plus varieties of ice cream) and Dolle's (saltwater taffy and caramel popcorn).\n\nBut Rehoboth is much more than beach food for the masses. In fact, its restaurant scene just may arguably be the best in the state, ranging from breweries armed with impressive kitchens to fine dining spots that have foodies flocking.\n\nThe Back Porch Cafe is a classic, splurge-worthy restaurant where \"everything but the baguettes\" are made in-house.\n\nOther favorites include Houston White Co. for steaks and red wine, Lupo Italian Kitchen's to try shaved Brussels sprouts and lobster bucatini, and Henlopen City Oyster House for its impeccable raw oysters and other seafood dishes that never fail to please. Salt Air also has seafood that keeps people coming back, along with a banana cream cake dreams are made of.\n\nMariachi Restaurant is a favorite for Mexican and Latin-American foods, along with Dos Locos with its unique mid-Atlantic take on Mexican food. For Asian cuisine, The Cultured Pearl Restaurant & Sushi Bar is the GOAT for sushi with Stingray as another favorite and Confucius, which boasts an array of upscale Chinese dishes.\n\nFor breakfast, the newly-expanded Egg is a cool spot with inventive offerings such as siracha bacon \"candy\" and a peanut butter French toast sandwich. But if you're really hungry (and hungover), the Crystal Restaurant is a more traditional down-home diner-type setting that draws long waits at peak times.\n\nBars near the beach:Here are 5 new spots for nightlife & bites at Delaware beaches this summer\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nRehoboth Beach has its own King of Beers: Dogfish Head Brewing & Eats. Founded in town in 1995, the brand has helped put Rehoboth on the map, drawing beer tourists from around the world.\n\nPurple Parrot Grill’s outdoor biergarten is a fun detour tucked off Rehoboth Avenue with indoor fun including karaoke and DJs on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, drawing gay and straight alike.\n\nOther LGBTQ hot spots include AQUA Bar & Grill with a deck that acts as a magnet for day-drinking fun-seekers, along with Rigby's Bar & Grill, Freddie's Beach Bar & Restaurant (a spinoff of the Arlington, Virginia, spot) and Diego's Bar & Nightclub, which boasts an outdoor, sand-filled patio.\n\nAnd if you really want a taste of the local scene, drop into the original Arena's Deli and Bar downtown where deli sandwiches and a full bar collide with live local music Thursday through Sunday during the summer.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nThe drag scene at Blue Moon, which melds dining with stage shows since 1981, is unmatched. Drag shows sometimes join karaoke at Purple Parrot as well. The LGBTQ organization CAMP Rehoboth has its own arts and culture offerings, as well as Clear Space Theatre Company with its own renditions of musicals and other shows all summer long.\n\nFor live music, Dogfish has a large stage, making bands as important as the beer, just like founder Sam Calagione likes it. You'll find a mix of local, regional and even national acts on their calendar. And if you're willing to head out to the highway, The Pond has local live music nightly, anchored by Thursday nights with hometown standbys Lower Case Blues featuring guitar slinger Jake Banaszak and funky bassist B.J. Muntz.\n\nFor families looking for live music, the Rehoboth Beach Bandstand has it all, ranging from tribute acts and orchestras to local cover bands and military bands. It's been free since first launching in 1963 just off the Boardwalk, giving musicians and fans alike beautiful views and an ocean breeze.\n\nFor the kiddos (and grown kiddos), Funland amusement park (first opened in 1961) is a must-stop with rides and games right on the Boardwalk, with five generations of the Fasnacht family working to keep the throwback just like parents remember from their own childhood.\n\nAbove Ryan's Beach Shop you'll find an 18-hole mini-golf course with killer panoramic views. And if you head out to the highway, Jungle Jim's water park with its waterslides, go-karts and bumper boats is a freshwater alternative to the ocean.\n\nWhat do I need to know about parking?\n\nIf you visit Delaware's biggest beach town, also expect the biggest beach crowds. If you plan to park in a metered space, you're going to be spending a fair amount of time looking for one.\n\nRehoboth Beach parking is by meter or permit only between May 15 and Sept. 15. Meters run 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., while permits are only enforced through 5 p.m.\n\nMeters are $3 an hour and can be paid with quarters or via ParkMobile. Download it before you get there to save a headache. If you're into masochism, change machines are available at the following locations:\n\nCenter of Rehoboth Avenue at First Street,\n\nCenter of Rehoboth Avenue across from City Hall,\n\nThe Parking Department, 1 City Hall Drive\n\nRehoboth has two metered parking lots, off Christian Street next to the senior center and off Rehoboth Avenue next to the Fire Department.\n\nClick here for a map of Rehoboth Beach parking areas.\n\nPermits can be purchased at the Parking Department or from multiple kiosks throughout town. Check the city's website for hours.\n\nDon't forget: All perpendicular or angled parking in Rehoboth Beach, except handicapped, is head-in only.\n\nIf just the thought of spot-hunting on a summer day in Rehoboth causes a blood pressure spike, try DART First State's Park & Ride on the highway. The air-conditioned buses will drop you off at the Bandstand and are able to get you there quicker than a car thanks to bus-only lanes.\n\nWhat do I need to know about the beach?\n\nOnce on the beach, there are no tents, tarps, cabanas, pavilions or canopies allowed, except for small baby tents that must be anchored. Beach umbrellas must not be wider than 7 feet, 6 inches wide.\n\nExpect to be very close to your neighbors. If you have pearls to clutch, leave them at home.\n\nThe entire 2-mile area of beach within the corporate city limits is guarded between Memorial Day and Labor Day, weekdays 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and weekends 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.\n\nIf you're into surf-fishing, it's only permitted when lifeguards are off-duty, except for the beach area between the jetty north of the Henlopen Hotel and 250 feet north. Of course, you'll need a Delaware fishing license.\n\nSorry, pet owners. Dogs are not allowed on the beach or boardwalk between May 1 and Sept. 30.\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nThe 6-mile Junction Breakwater Trail from Rehoboth Beach to Lewes gets crowded, but it’s a good option for soft-surface running or walking. For a longer workout, you can connect to the 8-mile Lewes-Georgetown Trail.\n\nGrove Park Canal Dock now hosts Cape Water Tours & Taxi, which offers tours, cruises and taxi service from the dock, much as they do on the Rehoboth and Delaware bays.\n\nAlso, try Cape Henlopen State Park and Gordons Pond to the north or follow the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal south to Thompson Island Preserve.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nWhen raindrops fall, the family-owned Movies at Midway on Coastal Highway is a longtime favorite, as is shopping nearby at Tanger Outlets, also located on the highway.\n\nIf you have wheels, you can also drive out to Dogfish Head's brewery in Milton, located about 13 miles away. It is there where you can get a tour, sip their specialties and eat in the Tasting Room & Kitchen.\n\nThe aforementioned Purple Parrot is a fun place for rainy day drinking and Browseabout Books also offers refuge of a different kind.\n\nWhat are the don’t-miss annual events?\n\nIn the summer, the Fourth of July is the star of the show. When the city hosts its annual fireworks display, a city with only about 1,500 year-round residents draws up to 100,000 some years who fill every square inch of the beach, Boardwalk and sidewalk that can be found. (Get there early and stay late to avoid the nightmare traffic jam each year.)\n\nA Piping Out the Summer parade is held on the Boardwalk on Labor Day to close out the season and The Sea Witch Festival attracts thousands of revelers during the Halloween season, making it well worth an autumnal return to Rehoboth. Also in the fall, the Rehoboth Beach Jazz Festival draws national acts to the beach, playing on stages throughout town.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nThe Bellmoor Inn & Spa may be an expensive place to stay, but if you like bougie, the breakfast in the morning (free with your stay) is worth it. They have made-to-order omelets and a very nice buffet spread. The hotel now has a bar and you can take your cocktails and sit in the lush courtyard.\n\nAnd when it comes to shopping, boutiques abound, including Bella Luna and its eclectic jewelry, gifts, decor and artwork. For surf shops, try Quiet Storm and Sierra Moon. And to go back in time, '60s-themed Sunshine Octopus has tie-dye, while Gidgets Gadgets has vinyl and retro toys.\n\nDelaware history:8 things to know about newly restored World War II tower in Delaware Seashore State Park\n\nDewey Beach\n\nOnly 20 blocks long and two blocks deep, Dewey is a unique strip at Delaware's beaches, best known for its nightlife.\n\nWhile Dewey can still party hard, the days of the Girls Gone Wild bus stopping in town seem to be long gone as Dewey has grown up a bit over the past decade or so.\n\nMore family-friendly events have been rolled out as the number of families who live in town or visit for vacation has risen a bit.\n\nEven so, summer weekends are dominated by masses of day-and-night drinkers, bopping from bar to bar in search of cover bands and fun.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nDewey is home to only about 300 people year-round, but that number swells in the summer as group beach houses begin to fill, some housing 20 or more people.\n\nBar-hopping in Dewey is as commonplace as reaching for water and aspirin in the morning to soothe a raging hangover. But the town is more than its drinkables.\n\nThere's a cool surfer scene on the ocean side, Rehoboth Bay offers more relaxed water fun, and there are even movies on the beach for the kids.\n\nWhile there are plenty of adults in town (even if some act like children when drunk), the town's relaxed beach vibe also draws teens and tweens running around with lacrosse sticks and skateboards.\n\nThe town's motto is \"A Way of Life\" and it is. With out-of-towners dominating, it still has a tight-knit feel. If you go enough, everyone will know your name, especially if you dress in a ridiculous costume, which is still a familiar Dewey sight.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nSure, Dewey is filled with quick bites. Perhaps the most famous was Mama Celeste's Pizzeria, located next to The Starboard, one of the biggest and most beloved bars in the state, never mind Dewey. Mama Celeste's owners \"Mama\" and \"Papa\" retired in the off-season and it will be open this year as the new Starboard Sauced, serving New York-style slices to late-night hordes of hungry bar-goers. Celeste \"Mama\" Gutt will be working there some days, so you may see her familiar face behind the counter.\n\nBut for a more proper meal, you have to visit Woody's Dewey Beach, best known for its award-winning crab cakes since 2009. It's small. It's busy. It's worth it. They even ship their crab cakes across the country for those who can't make the trip to the beach.\n\nThose looking for healthier options in the land of pizza and fries have found a home at Gary's Dewey Beach Grill, where hummus platters, salads, turkey breast cheesesteaks and sushi are served, along with fresh beer brewed on-site.\n\nIn fact, it's another brewery in town that just may have the best menu: Dewey Beer Co. Its slightly higher-end offerings have more of a Rehoboth Beach restaurant scene feel, allowing for more civilized meals of shrimp and chorizo lo mein, chicken & waffles and steak sandwiches.\n\nThe Starboard is a favorite for brunch, especially their weekly \"Suicide Sunday\" celebrations with a massive Bloody Mary bar and a singing Elvis impersonator wandering around the bar. For an open-air lunch under a roof with live music, try Jimmy's Grille Dewey, best known for its fried chicken.\n\nAlso, the old Hammerheads will be replaced by the new Starboard Claw.\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nDid you say drink? You're in the right town.\n\nThere are four major bars, all with their own vibe and all within a half-mile.\n\nWe'll start with The Starboard, the iconic bar with a shark head busting out of the top of the building. A hodgepodge of bar rooms, the 'Board is home to the best Orange Crush in town. It's not even close. They are served in 16-ounce cups with oversized straws for extra-easy drinking and come in many flavors: orange, grapefruit, lemon, watermelon, mango and more. Throw in DJs, live music and celebrities (we're looking at you, Delaware native Ryan Phillippe) and you have a night to remember ... or perhaps a night to try to remember.\n\nThe other three major watering holes are owned by the same restaurant group so you'll see a lot of the same acts, drinks and people. Still, each is a unique slice of Dewey.\n\nThe Rusty Rudder with its large deck and Rehoboth Bay views is more easy-going during the day and turns up at night with cover bands. Local legends Love Seed Mama Jump have a Thursday night residency there that has been going for decades.\n\nFour blocks north is northbeach, also located along the bay with killer sunset views. A sandy patio along the water is the perfect place to try the bar's signature frozen Dewey Devil drink. The bar draws a younger crowd, especially at night, encouraged by DJs and dancing inside.\n\nA block from northbeach is the Bottle & Cork, a 21-only nightclub that hosts national acts with a schedule that has been weighted more toward modern country in recent years. But it's the Cork's Saturday \"Jam Session\" that makes it special. The tradition begins at 5 p.m. and usually rotates three to four cover bands until 1 a.m. A sea of crushed beer cans cover the ground by the end.\n\nOther spots to hit include Hawaiian-themed Nalu Surf Bar & Grill, Dewey Beach Country Club (a golf-themed bar, not an actual golf course) and The Lighthouse, a long-serving favorite recently rebuilt after a fire.\n\nAnd Dewey Beer Co. has more than good food — it boasts the top-ranked beers in the state.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nNearly every bar in town hosts cover acts or DJs, some both day and night. It's what Dewey does and it does it well.\n\nIn addition, the town added Nick's Mini Golf recently, a small course where Ed's Chicken and Crabs stood until a single-car accident caused a fire in 2016.\n\nAnother family-friendly idea is the free weekly movie nights on the beach, a partnership between Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce and the town of Dewey Beach. Films screen Mondays at 8:30 p.m. on the beach at Dagsworthy Street. Glow necklaces are available for a $1 donation.\n\nWhat do I need to know about going to the beach?\n\nSeasonal parking permits are available for those staying in town awhile. You can purchase them via an automated kiosk outside of the Town Hall, at 105 Rodney Ave., or online.\n\nOtherwise, between May 15 and Sept. 15, the ParkMobile app makes paying (and adding time) much easier. Metered spaces are $3 an hour. Some take coins but not all.\n\nMore:More sand coming to Delaware beaches faster. Schedule moved up as another dredger arrives.\n\nBe warned: Finding a metered spot in Dewey can take time and patience in the summer. But there is a silver lining: Parking in Dewey is free Monday through Wednesday from 5 to 11 p.m. Also, those with handicapped license plates or placards park for free.\n\nAs for the actual beach, rules allow surf fishing, bonfires with a permit and dogs before 9:30 a.m. and after 5:30 p.m. during the summer.\n\nCanopies, umbrellas and open-sided tents are permitted on the beach, but should be behind the lifeguard stands so they can see the water. No alcohol is allowed on the beach during the summer.\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nDewey Beach Watersports is your gateway to fun on the bay, offering personal watercraft, pontoon, stand-up paddleboard, kayak and bike rentals. They also offer fun \"banana boat\" rides on a tube.\n\nAnother option is Cruisin' Tikis, a six-person tiki bar boat that goes out on the bay for a unique BYOB experience on the water.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nWhen the beach is a washout, The Starboard's digital billboard out front always has the same message: \"When it rains, we pour!\" The bar fills with wet party-seekers and can be a rowdy scene, even in the morning hours.\n\nJust south of Dewey, you'll find the Indian River Lifesaving Station, which dates back to 1876 when it was built to save shipwreck victims near the coast. It has been restored to its 1905 appearance and is an interesting visit on a rainy day for history buffs.\n\nWhat are the don’t-miss annual events?\n\nIn the summer, there is only one event that matters: Running of the Bull.\n\nHeld each July, the straight-up goofy event at The Starboard features two people in a bull costume crossing the highway (with a police escort) followed by hundreds of the bar's patrons. They then all run along the beach and return to the bar parking lot where a celebrity matador squares off with the bull, capping one of the weirdest (and most fun) events the state has to offer. Started by a handful of Starboard regulars in 1997, it now draws thousands dressed in red and white just like in Pamplona, Spain.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nOne of the best parties in Dewey each year happens after the summertime visitors leave. The Dewey Business Partnership hosts an all-ages end-of-season party in mid-September on the beach from New Orleans Street to Dagsworthy Street, complete with a band on stage and alcohol and food in hands. It usually costs $5.\n\nTake the ferry:Have you ever been on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry? Here's everything you need to know\n\nLewes\n\nIf you're looking for more of that New England seaport town feel, Lewes is for you.\n\nUnlike some other beach towns in the state, Lewes has a large year-round population, giving it more of a hometown vibe than a tourist trap.\n\nWith the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal cutting through town and a beautiful Lewes Canalfront Park to watch the boats go by, it's about as scenic as it gets.\n\nThrow in historic houses, a slower pace than Rehoboth and Dewey, and its fair share of fine restaurants and you realize why it's one of Delaware's best towns.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nIts charming, historic blocks boast quaint homes, Dutch architecture and blooming tulips everywhere in the spring. And if you want to visit the Jersey Shore, the Cape May-Lewes Ferry terminal is right near the beach, ready to bring you and your car the 17 miles across Delaware Bay.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nAgave Mexican Restaurant is a true gem and a local favorite. So much so that the long wait there is a punchline because of the crowds. Started in 2007 with 30 seats, they now have two locations (the other is out on Coastal Highway near Rehoboth). Be sure to try the puffy fish tacos, margaritas and even a flight of guacamole. (There's one on Del. 1 as well.)\n\nFor fine dining, Heirloom is a must-visit. Delaware Online/The News Journal food writer Patricia Talorico once wrote it \"might be Delaware's best restaurant,\" wowed by the \"feminine, but not at all frilly, upscale restaurant\" with entrees ranging from pan-seared scallops to grilled flank steak.\n\nOther fun stops include The Station on Kings cafe and market for pastries, Touch of Italy for sandwiches, Mr. P's for wood-fired pizza and Raas for some of the best Indian food in the state.\n\nFamilies really like Crooked Hammock Brewery. It's not just for the fresh beer for parents, but the \"Backyard\" filled with family-friendly games like ping pong, ring toss and cornhole.\n\nFor breakfast, Kaisy’s Delights is a treasure with omelets, quiches and croque monsieur sandwiches. Try the signature Kaisy bowl for dessert. Also, Bountiful Bowls is good for an acai bowl and Nectar Cafe for great brunch and juices/mimosas. And if you can get to Coastal Highway, Surf Bagel has bagels that even New Yorkers will concede are delicious.\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nWhile most bars and restaurants close by 10 p.m., it doesn't mean the night has to be over. Irish Eyes Pub & Restaurant stays open until 1 a.m.\n\nBefore it gets late, the Crooked Hammock and Big Oyster breweries offer fresh brews. Try Solar Power, a Belgian blonde from Big Oyster, which is like a Blue Moon beer on steroids.\n\nOne of the most scenic spots to grab a drink is Grain on the Rocks, located right at the ferry terminal near the beach. Striper Bites, a casual bistro, is also a favorite bar/restaurant for many who like a nightcap.\n\nHalf Full is the place to go if you want to grab a glass of wine or appetizer while waiting for tables at Agave or Striper Bites and Nassau Valley Vineyards is a 4-mile drive inland.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nCrooked Hammock and Irish Eyes often host local music acts, as does Stango Park with its Summer Concert Series on Tuesday nights. On Coastal Highway, blues can usually be found at Bethany Blues BBQ.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Grain began hosting large-scale concerts at its waterfront location, selling seats in socially distanced pods. Its Rocking the Docks concert series has lived on with ticketed shows under the stars with the Robert Randolph Band (June 21) and Dumpstaphunk (August 23) among the acts.\n\nWhat do I need to know about going to the beach?\n\nLewes has a calm and shallow beach, which is great for children. Don't plan on seeing any surfing or boogie boarding.\n\nLewes beaches have a little loophole for dogs in the summer season. They're permitted, leashed, before 8 a.m. and after 6 p.m. Surf-fishing is similar: Only before 8 a.m. or after 6:30 p.m.\n\nBeach parking lot meters are in use May 1 to Sept. 30 and downtown meters through Oct. 14. Meters are in use in all areas from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nMeters are $2.50 per hour at the beaches and $1.50 per hour downtown. There is a three-hour maximum downtown. Quarters are accepted only at downtown meters (a change machine is located at Mary Vessels Park, behind Biblion on 2nd Street), while cash is only accepted at the beach parking lots. Credit cards are accepted for all metered parking through the ParkMobile app, with a 50-cent fee.\n\nThere is limited metered parking at the beach with many deciding to park at nearby Cape Henlopen State Park instead. Also, check out the new Lewes Line pilot program that can be picked up all over town.\n\nAnd be sure to walk up to the nearby Dairy Queen for a cone, like locals have done since it came to town in 1954.\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nIf you walk around Lewes, you'll find plenty out there.\n\nThe Lewes and Rehoboth Canal and Lewes Canalfront Park are the crown jewels, but also try Blockhouse Pond at George H.P. Smith Park for a peaceful getaway with a little bass fishing if you're up for it. (Fisherman also can be found at the wharf by the drawbridge.)\n\nThe Lewes Unleashed Dog Park is great for your four-legged friend or if you just want to see doggies out there playing. The Georgetown-Lewes Trail is worth a walk with a big chunk of it running through town. People who live along it go all out with landscaping and decorations.\n\nJust south of town is the 5,193-acre Cape Henlopen State Park filled with all sorts of outdoor fun, a beach and a nature center.\n\nGordons Pond is also a fun trail for a walk or run. You can connect from the beach via the bike loop or park at Herring Point or Gordons Pond and go from there.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nGo shopping inside at The Brush Factory Kings (unique home goods) or try a rum tasting at Beach Time Distilling.\n\nAs we mentioned in the Rehoboth Beach entry, Movies at Midway is great for rainy day films. Also try Lefty's Alley & Eats with bowling, laser tag, ax-throwing and an arcade all under one roof.\n\nShell We Bounce Trampoline Park is also open, giving your kids an opportunity to bounce around so much that they fall asleep early that night.\n\nBiblion Used Books and Rare Finds, as well as its sister store The Vintage Underground, are great for cozy escapes in Lewes. You can probably find something for anyone: the bookworm, the person who likes buttons with sassy sayings, the record lover and more.\n\nWhat are the don’t-miss annual events?\n\nDuring the summer, you should try to be there for the Fourth of July holiday when the annual Doo-Dah Parade kicks off. Dating back to 1968, you can watch or join the fun-loving parade. Just be sure to be wearing red, white and blue because everyone else will be.\n\nThe same day also offers the Lewes Independence Day Boat Parade with decorated boats making their way along the canal as spectators watch from the canal banks.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nThe historic Lewes Farmers Market is a must and probably the best in the state. And try the rotisserie chicken at Lloyd’s Market, a terrific family-owned market that has local produce and milk from Lewes Dairy.\n\nDelaware Seashore State Park:5 things to do, admission, eats and more\n\nBethany Beach\n\nThis tidy coastal town greets visitors on Coastal Highway with its 24-foot Chief Little Owl landmark totem pole made by sculptor Peter Wolf Toth.\n\nWith its own half-mile Boardwalk — half the size of Rehoboth's — the \"Quiet Resort\" is a dainty throwback that draws an older crowd looking for a slower pace than other bustling beach towns.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nBethany has none of the buzz of Rehoboth or Dewey and that's by design.\n\nMany restaurants close by 10 p.m. even on weekends. Good luck finding a bar with a band. Bars — establishments that focus mostly on selling alcohol — are not allowed in town, and bands are mostly relegated to the town's Bandstand.\n\nFamilies and retirees dominate the area, which has a small number of shops downtown — and almost all are not chains, though Five Guys arrived several years back.\n\nThe Boardwalk isn't mobbed like Rehoboth or Ocean City and most businesses have built up out on Route 26, which has seen plenty of growth as more and more restaurateurs and retail shops have moved in.\n\nOverall, it's a sleepy getaway. Perhaps that's why actor (and New Castle native) Ryan Phillippe purchased a summer home here for seasonal escapes from Los Angeles.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nIf you're traveling from the Rehoboth/Dewey Beach area, there are a couple of restaurants on the way to Bethany that offer unbelievable views near the Indian River Inlet Bridge.\n\nFirst is Big Chill Beach Club with its 360-degree views from an iconic circular bar high above the Atlantic Ocean, offering beers and bites in the sun. On the other side of the bridge in Delaware Seashore Park, you'll find a real hidden gem: the former Hammerheads Dockside, now a Big Fish Restaurant Group's Dockside Marina Bar + Grill. It had been a small eatery and bar complete with a sandy patio with palm trees and live music on a stage along the dock. Expect more of the same, but with the Big Fish stamp all over it.\n\nThe newest addition to the Bethany area is on Route 26 in the form of SoDel Concepts' Ocean View Brewing Co., which brews its own fresh beer and offers a unique menu with favorites like fried chicken and food challenges like The Naptime: a sandwich with doughnut buns, a fried lobster tail and fried egg. (Um, what?!?)\n\nSoDel also has a pair of seafood-themed menus that draw crowds at Matt's Fish Camp and Bluecoast, along with North East Seafood Kitchen in Ocean View, just outside of town.\n\nFans of Italian must stop at DiFebo's Restaurant and slurp on some of Big Bob's Sunday gravy or try their nearby DiFebo's Market, filled with local goodies, baked goods, paninis and homemade deli case items.\n\nA family-style local's pick on the highway is The Cottage Cafe, owned by a pair of college buddies since opening in 1993, serving down-home breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nIn downtown, the large-scale Mango's has stunning beach views, a happy hour that fills the bar and a menu that has everything from tacos and steak to burgers and seafood. A block away is Bethany Blues BBQ, which smokes its own meats for lovers of brisket and pulled pork. (A new, third location will open in downtown Rehoboth Beach this summer.)\n\nOther area restaurants worth your money: Sedona (American cuisine), 14 Global (tapas/small plates), Mickey's Family Crab House and Misaki (sushi).\n\nFor sweets, try Sandy Pony Donuts with their mouth-watering hot, made-to-order doughnuts. They got their start as a food truck on Chincoteague Island and expanded northward. Oh, and Rosenfeld's Big Fish in South Bethany offers cake slices as big as your head and hefty one-pound eclairs (along with Jewish deli standbys.)\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nMango's with its lively bar and beach views is the most fun you'll have in downtown.\n\nIf you drive just outside the town limits, you'll find Bethany Boathouse on the highway with a fun beachy atmosphere and a nighttime party vibe worth checking out.\n\nBethany Blues also has a large bar filled with bourbons and The Salted Rim Margarita Bar & Grille further out on Route 26 in Millville has margaritas away from the beach crowds.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nThe Bethany Bandstand has musical acts on Thursday evenings if you want the \"Pleasantville\" experience of a small-town event.\n\nMango's hosts bands Friday and Saturdays at 10 p.m. until they close at 11:30 p.m., and acoustic acts can be found at Bethany Blues BBQ on Saturdays for happy hour.\n\nBethany Boathouse takes advantage of being outside the town limits by offering the most entertainment around with nightly live music and a true bar experience for those looking for late-night excitement.\n\nAnd don't forget that the Freeman Arts Pavilion with national acts is only 9 miles away, and the Jolly Trolley will pick you up in town for select shows so you can leave your car behind.\n\nWant to head inland? Shipwrecked Mini Golf & Ice Cream is about 2 miles west off Route 26. Also, check out the Millville Boardwalk for mini-golf, ice cream and even a giant beach ball pit.\n\nWhat do I need to know about going to the beach?\n\nThere are plenty of no-nos: no tents, canopies, tarps, cabanas, ball playing, kites or alcohol, and umbrellas can be up to only 3 feet wide. No dogs on the beach or boardwalk from May 15 to Sept. 30. Surf-fishing is allowed only when lifeguards are off-duty.\n\nAll perpendicular or angled parking is head-in only in Bethany Beach. It's pay- or permit-to-park May 15 through Sept. 15, between 10 a.m. and 4, 8 or 11 p.m., as indicated by signage. There is a two-hour limit on Garfield Parkway.\n\nMeter rates are $2.50 per hour, paid via ParkMobile or using credit cards or quarters at pay stations and meters. Change machines can be found throughout the beach and 100 blocks of Garfield Parkway, as well as at North Pennsylvania Avenue and Central Boulevard.\n\nParking in Bethany Beach is very limited. Metered parking can be found on Garfield Parkway, the beach blocks, Atlantic Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue. Most other downtown parking areas are reserved for those with residential or business permits.\n\nThis map of Bethany Beach parking areas will help with any confusion. Probably.\n\nParking permits can be purchased at the Police Department (214 Garfield Parkway) at a rate of $25 per day, $75 for three days and $175 for seven days. Permits are valid in all pay-to-park areas except Garfield Parkway.\n\nAnd here's a quaint option: Trolleys continuously run from the Friday before Memorial Day through mid-September between 9:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. and cost only a quarter. (Driver does not make change, so time to hunt for some coins!)\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nFresh Pond just north of town off the coast is part of Delaware Seashore State Park, an oasis with walking trails and the nearby James Farm Ecological Preserve.\n\nRight on Coastal Highway, you'll find the 6.8-acre Bethany Beach Central Park for a whole lot of manicured grass and pickup games.\n\nSeven miles out of town you'll find Holt's Landing State Park, a 203-acre bayside escape with a salt marsh, forest, hiking trails, crabbing, a boat launch and family fun nights with music.\n\nAnd if you're thinking about where you might want to stay next time you visit, look into the Indian River Cottage rentals north of Bethany Beach at Delaware Seashore State Park. They're perfect for a more quiet and secluded experience, so book early.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nFor kids — and the grown-up kids that come out in some of us on summer vacations — video games, Skee-Ball, air hockey and pinball can be found at the Shore Fun Family Fun Center just off the Boardwalk.\n\nDickens Parlour Theatre, located 5 miles west of town, hosts nightly magic performances during the summer, along with live music.\n\nWhen it rains, the town's independent bookstore fills (Bethany Beach Books) as does Bethany Beach Comics and Gaming, along with the dozen or so boutique shops that can be found along Route 26.\n\nIf Daddy or Mommy needs a drink, Salted Vines Vineyard & Winery is a 15-minute drive west for wine, live music and food trucks. (They say children are welcome but must be under the supervision of an adult at all times.)\n\nWhat are the don’t-miss annual events?\n\nIf you stay until the end of Labor Day weekend, definitely attend the Bethany Beach Jazz Funeral, which dates back to 1985. A jazz band will mourn the \"death\" of the summer with a march down the Boardwalk as others pretend to weep, dressed in black. Totally unique.\n\nAlso, the Fourth of July fireworks on Bethany Beach is about as red, white and blue as you can get, complete with live music at the Bandstand.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nTake a 20-minute drive south to theAssawoman Bay State Wildlife Area. Sure the name will make the kids giggle, but you'll find more than laughs there: bald eagles, herons, egrets, woodpeckers, deer, amphibians, reptiles and more.\n\nFenwick Island\n\nLet's get one thing straight right off the bat: Fenwick Island is not an island just like Coney Island is not an island.\n\nBut it is a tiny beach town that reports only about 350 people as residents. Unlike Rehoboth, Lewes, Dewey and Bethany, it has a beach and that's about it except for a few restaurants (some of which are quite good) and shops.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nThere's no Boardwalk or large-scale amusements, but they don't need it since they border the massive, touristy Ocean City, Maryland.\n\nEven though Fenwick is quiet, it's not quite like Bethany since the excitement of Ocean City sometimes spills over.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nJames Beard-nominated chef Matt Kern purchased Fenwick farm-to-table restaurant One Coastal, giving the local favorite a shot in the arm with high-end entrees worth the money. (He had previously been at Heirloom in Lewes.)\n\nJust like in Bethany, the beach-based SoDel Concepts restaurant group runs a handful of spots that bring in the bodies during the summer, including seafood-heavy menus at Catch 54 (with sweet bay views) and Matt's Fish Camp and Mexican cuisine atPapa Grande's.\n\nOther dining rooms to drop into include Our Harvest (platter-style feasts available), Nantucket's (fine dining seafood) and Warren’s Station, which is family-friendly and does not serve drinks.\n\nAnd for your sweet tooth, a Fisher’s Popcorn with caramel popcorn of all flavors — a perfect gift to bring back for whoever is watching your dog.\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nThe bayside Harpoon Hanna's off Route 54 is your best shot at a beachlike, fun bar experience, complete with a Tiki bar, nightly live music and a sports bar that's open until 1 a.m. It's also a scenic spot for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nViking Golf & Go-Karts is tucked away off Coastal Highway on Island Street with 18 holes of golf, go-karts and water park in one spot.\n\nAnd just like for your Bethany visits, it's a short drive to Freeman Arts Pavilion for ticketed concerts with national acts. (It's 5 miles east of town, and Jolly Trolley offers rides for select shows to and from Fenwick.)\n\nWhat do I need to know about going to the beach?\n\nParking requires paying a meter or purchasing a permit in Fenwick Island, between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. from May 15 to September 15.\n\nDogs aren't allowed on the beach May 1 through September 30. Surf fishing is permitted only when lifeguards are off-duty, unless they say otherwise.\n\nIf you go to Fenwick Island State Park, you should get there real early on weekends because the small lot fills up very quickly. (It's $5 for residents and $20 for non-residents.)\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nFenwick Island State Park has 3 miles of ocean beaches for swimming and surf fishing, along with access to Little Assawoman Bay with kayaking and stand-up paddleboards available.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nThe DiscoverSea Shipwreck Museum on Coastal Highway is a great escape — just like some of the tales you'll find inside with rotating exhibits that focus on maritime heritage with 10,000 artifacts to dig through.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nIt's easy to miss, but Jimmy's Kitchen on Coastal Highway is that greasy spoon breakfast spot that draws locals early, opening at 7 a.m. and closing 5½ hours later each day. Try the chipped beef or \"The Heavyroller,\" a five-egg omelet that may send you right back to bed.\n\nThe staff of Delaware Online/The News Journal contributed to this report. Have a story idea?

The Salesianum School graduate sat out Delaware’s third game, against Cornell.\n\nHis return was highlighted by a 34-yard fumble return for a touchdown in Delaware’s 43-28 win at Richmond on Oct. 6, already the second touchdown of his UD career. Reeder scored on a 5-yard fumble return in Delaware’s 31-17 win at Maine last year.\n\nWhile still the youngster in Delaware’s distinguished four-man linebacker crew of brother Troy, Charles Bell and Ray Jones, who are all seniors, Reeder continues to stand out.\n\n“I think he understands everything much better,” Delaware coach Danny Rocco said. “You can actually see little subtleties, Colby kinda back to being carefree and having fun and running around, spending less time making sure he’s OK.”\n\nThis week brings a unique test as Reeder plays against New Hampshire and its imaginative offense for the first time. No. 24-ranked Delaware (4-2 overall, 2-1 CAA) and the Wildcats (1-5, 0-3) kick off at 3:30 in Durham (College Sports Live/CBS Digital) on Saturday.\n\nDespite its troubles this year, New Hampshire, an NCAA tourney qualifier the last 14 years, remains a difficult foe.\n\n“I know they have a really talented quarterback [Trevor Knight] who has come back and talented receivers,” Reeder said. “I think what’s going to really fuel us this week is just the fact that even though they’re not having their best year, that last year, in November, we sat there and watched them make the playoffs [UNH was chosen ahead of Delaware, though both were 7-4). So I think we’ve just gotta prepare and keep that in the back of our head.”\n\nReeder has 18 tackles on the season, including nine solos. He had an interception, the third of his UD career, in Delaware’s season-opening loss to Rhode Island. His biggest play was the fumble runback that allowed Delaware to go ahead 16-0 just 5:08 into the game at Richmond.\n\n“Tenny [Adewusi] hit him and it was a good shot and I got my hand in there just enough to rip it loose,” Reeder said, “and, once you turn around with the ball and it’s just clear field ahead of you, it’s a good feeling.”\n\nReeder has repeatedly demonstrated the athletic ability that highlighted his Salesianum career, in which Reeder blocked six kicks, was state defensive player of the year as a senior safety, rushed for 2,000-plus yards in 2015 and returned an interception 100 yards for a touchdown in the 2016 DFRC Blue-Gold all-star game.\n\nAt Delaware, where he redshirted in 2016, Reeder moved up to outside linebacker. When Rocco took over as coach in 2017 and installed a 3-4 defensive alignment, Reeder began playing the “Kat” outside linebacker spot, which sometimes involves lining up as a defensive end. The 6-foot-4, 240-pound Reeder has been up to the task.\n\n“His last game of high school he was playing safety and his first games playing in college he’s almost playing defensive end,” marveled Troy, Delaware’s preseason All-American senior inside linebacker. “It’s such a different skill set. Pass rushing is very intricate. I think that’s made him a better off-the-ball linebacker.”\n\nAt the same time, Troy has watched Colby get to the point where he’s “preparing like a veteran” the way he studies tape while continuing to be one of the team’s most diligent and accomplished conditioning enthusiasts.\n\nLast Saturday, Colby was thrilled to watch Troy make 15 tackles, including 4 ½ for lost yardage, in Delaware’s 28-16 win over then-No. 5-ranked Elon, which earned him CAA defensive player of the week honors. Colby called it “probably one of the best games I’ve ever seen” from Troy.\n\nTroy, 2½ years older and two grades ahead of Colby at Salesianum, transferred from Penn State, where he started as a redshirt freshman in 2015, to Delaware after Colby verbally committed in early 2016 so the two could play together.\n\n“It’s probably been better than we expected,” Colby said of how much the two enjoy being teammates. “We spend so much time together and really focus on all the fundamentals. I think we make each other better. After a big win like that [against Elon] it’s extra special to be able to celebrate with him.”\n\nTroy agreed, saying, “I know now, 2½, three years later, that if I didn’t have him pushing me, as competitive and hard-working as he is, I don’t think I’d have gotten as far as I have.”\n\nTheir father, Dan, was a standout running back at Christiana High before starring at Delaware, where he was captain in 1984, and playing two NFL seasons.\n\nWhen Rocco watches the Reeder brothers play football, he can’t help but feel a twinge of familiar sentiment himself.\n\n“I love it,” the coach said. “Because I also had a big brother and my big brother was a really good football player.”\n\nRocco’s brother, Frank. Jr., who is one year older, was a Parade All-American quarterback at Fox Chapel High near Pittsburgh, where their dad Frank Sr. was coach. Frank Jr. went to Penn State, where Danny, a linebacker/safety who was also widely recruited, followed a year later before later transferring to Wake Forest.\n\n“When I watch Troy and Colby it just reminds me so much of when I was younger,” Danny Rocco said. “My dad, who was the head coach, my brother Frank, who was older than me ... He had already established himself and here I am wanting people to know that I also have a chance to do something.\n\n“I’m right in the middle of it and I’m stoking it all the time,” he added of the Reeder family dynamic. “I’m probably out of place occasionally but it’s all good family fun I think.”\n\nColby elected to play at Delaware despite overtures from the likes of Syracuse, Illinois and Miami (Fla.). His career is off to a strong start.\n\n“He’s a special athlete,” Rocco said. “He has the skill, the tools to be a really dominant player. He has the size, power, explosion and quickness to be able to do a lot of different things. To be quite honest with you I feel like we’re using him better. I think we’re understanding better what all he can do and then maybe what all you can do with him.’’\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

All those Hens, drenched with sweat and their chests heaving, dashed ahead, some faster than others but all in a hurry.\n\nDelaware, after all, has places it wants to go this fall, especially after a season-ending loss to Villanova last year cost the Hens an NCAA Tournament berth.\n\nThese are no exercises in futility. Preseason practice is four weeks away, starting Aug. 1, but the time to get in peak physical condition, Stewart and UD players said, is now.\n\n\"The goal and the purpose of what we’re doing now is to build strength, speed, endurance and set ourselves up for the first day of practice,” Stewart said.\n\nFootball camp was once the grueling period in which players worked themselves into shape with gut-wrenching two-a-day sessions aimed at building endurance. But the NCAA no longer allows double daily sessions.\n\nPractices are now focused on football, making it vitally important for players to arrive in peak physical shape and build a conditioning base that can carry them through the season and sustain them in games, particularly the decisive fourth quarter when fatigue sets in.\n\n\"Early mornings, they make it tough on us,” said Troy Reeder, the Blue Hens fifth-year senior linebacker and captain, of the Tuesday/Thursday hourlong sessions that start at 7 a.m. \"It’s all fourth-quarter mentality-type stuff.\"\n\nDuring the Tuesday/Thursday gatherings, the entire team comes together inside the air-conditioned Field House for 30 minutes of light running, stretching, core and mobility workouts, and exercises in which players lift and throw large balls that weigh 10 to 20 pounds.\n\nMaking chest passes with those balls while the muscles in his upper arms and shoulders ripple, senior safety-turned linebacker Ray Jones said it builds \"more power” and makes him feel \"more explosive.”\n\nOn Tuesday, in high heat and humidity, the team then jogged to the UD outdoor track for a series of 200-meter runs. On Thursday, it was those 16 sprints — \"champion runs,” Stewart calls it — on the practice field in which linemen run 50 yards, \"mids\"; mostly linebacker and tight end types go 55; and skill players, such as defensive backs, running backs, quarterbacks and receivers, gallop 60.\n\n\"It’s a seven-second sprint with a 25-second recovery which kind of mimics the tempo of our game,” said Stewart. \"Seven-second play being a long play and then a 25-second game clock.\"\n\nPlayers lift weights and do speed and agility training in groups Mondays and Wednesdays. Delaware coach Danny Rocco is only permitted, by NCAA rules, to meet with the players two hours a week, leaving them in the hands of Stewart, who spent 11 years at Tennessee and seven at Richmond before coming to Delaware after Rocco was hired in December 2016.\n\n\"After that first winter and first year, guys were like ‘This really worked,’” Reeder said, complimenting Stewart’s influence. \"Guys got faster and stronger than they ever had. That helped everybody’s attitude this winter.\"\n\nOn Fridays, players have what Stewart terms the \"strongman circuit.” It involves two stations with muscle-making activities such as lifting and turning over giant truck tires —and a longtime UD strength-and-stamina-building favorite — running up the high, steep stairs inside Delaware Stadium. Thighs and calves usually still remember those climbs a couple days later.\n\nThe Blue Hens' offseason conditioning runs through next week, after which players get a break — though they'll train on their own — until camp starts. The season opener is Aug. 30 at home against Rhode Island.\n\n\"It’s about building up for those four months of the season,” said Charles Bell, the fifth-year senior linebacker and captain who is returning from a broken back that knocked him out of the final seven games last year. \"It’s running, it’s getting stronger, getting in shape mentally. We’re just trying to improve a little bit in each and everything we do.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

The 154 receiving yards were the most since Johnson’s 168 against Wagner in 2013.\n\nWalker had been Delaware’s starting quarterback in 2015 and 2016 and the first part of 2017. The senior was moved to wide receiver this season.\n\n“He does a great job creating separation,” Kehoe said of Walker. “He’s a big target to put it out there for.’’\n\nKehoe, a fourth-year junior, had been No. 3 on the UD depth chart the last three seasons and appeared for only one series in one game last year without throwing a pass.\n\nHe continued his stellar first season as a starter, completing 14 of 29 passes for 254 yards and a touchdown and also running for 23 yards and a touchdown. He hasn’t thrown an interception this year and is the first quarterback in UD history to surpass 200 yards passing in each of his first three starts.\n\n“We threw the ball down the field, and we made some plays down the field,” Delaware coach Danny Rocco said. “We challenged their defensive backs, and we had guys go up and make plays so certainly excited about that.”\n\nThe Blue Hens (2-1) now prep for next Saturday’s much-anticipated visit to No. 1-ranked North Dakota State, which has won six of the last seven FCS national championships. The Bison (2-0) beat North Alabama 38-7 Saturday in Fargo.\n\nCornell was playing its season opener. Delaware won last year’s first-ever meeting against the Ivy Leaguers 41-14, keyed by five first-half takeaways. This time, the Big Red scored its lone TD with 26 seconds left in the game.\n\nDelaware outgained Cornell 391-232 in total yards, with 75 of Cornell's yards coming on a final scoring drive. Kani Kane’s 65 yards on 18 carries led Delaware rushers. Kehoe also provided several timely runs.\n\n“We were able to do a few things today that do demonstrate that we could be a little more versatile with our offense,” Rocco said.\n\nKehoe passed 14 yards for a touchdown to a leaping Walker on the last play of the first quarter as Delaware took a 7-3 lead.\n\nThe Blue Hens had gone three-and-out on their first two series. But on the scoring drive, they needed just seven plays to cover 78 yards, with Kehoe running nine yards, DeJoun Lee covering seven and Kehoe completing four of five passes. The longest was a 21-yarder to Vinny Papale.\n\nDelaware then made it 14-3 after Kehoe’s 5-yard TD run with 1:31 to go in the second period, ending a seven-play, 75-yard march. That series included Walker’s eight- and 39-yard receptions.\n\n“In a lot of ways we changed the game today because of our ability to connect on some of those throws,” Rocco said.\n\nA defensive stop set up Delaware’s third touchdown drive. Inside linebacker Troy Reeder thwarted Cornell’s Dalton Banks on a fourth-and-3 carry from the UD 33, one yard shy of a first down.\n\nThe Blue Hens then drove 69 yards on 12 plays, with Kani Kane scoring on a 3-yard run with 12:47 left in the fourth quarter as Delaware went ahead 21-3.\n\nA 41-yard Kehoe-to-Walker hookup then set up Frank Raggo’s 40-yard field goal that increased Delaware’s lead to 24-3 with 7:02 left.\n\nRaggo, who had earlier been wide left from 45 yards, later added a 33-yard field goal to make it 27-3.\n\nCornell drove 64 yards on the game’s first possession but had to settle for Nickolas Null’s 28-yard field goal with 9:00 left in the first quarter. It closed a series that took nine plays, including a pair of third-down conversions.\n\n“After that, we settled down; the energy picked up,” said Delaware outside linebacker Ray Jones, the senior from Hodgson Vo-Tech. “The flow of the game came easy and natural for us.”\n\nDelaware 27, Cornell 10\n\nCornell 3 0 0 7 – 10\n\nDelaware 7 7 0 13 – 27\n\nFirst quarter\n\nC – Null 28 FG, 9:00\n\nD – Walker 14 pass from Kehoe (Raggo kick), 0:00\n\nSecond quarter\n\nD -- Kehoe 5 run (Raggo kick), 1:31\n\nFourth quarter\n\nD – Kane 3 run (Raggo kick), 12:47\n\nD – Raggo 40 FG, 7:02\n\nD – Raggo 33 FG, 4:06\n\nC – Lizana 9 pass from Catanese (Null kick), :26\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

It gives me more room to play and work on speed and get releases.”\n\nCollins played in one spring game in 2021, zipping 20 yards on a carry in the season-opening win over Maine.\n\nIn the fall, he had 12 catches for 138 yards and two touchdowns. Both were on passes from Zach Gwynn, who started the last seven games after Nolan Henderson’s season-ending injury – a 26-yarder against James Madison and a 25-yarder against William & Mary, both at Delaware Stadium.\n\nLike last year, Collins hopes to once again be a player who can “deliver in key situations,” he said. “Any way I can help out.”\n\nRECRUITING REUNION: Carty was first to see Henderson’s potential as college QBDEPTH CHART CLIMBERS: DII transfer Lewis among breakout playersVANDAMIA MANIA: UD defensive coaches wanted TE to play LBKEY TRANSFERS: Cumby among dozen newcomers who boost Blue Hens\n\nHaving been a second-team All-State pick at Mount Pleasant as a wide receiver, returnman and defensive back, Collins is quite familiar with contributing any way he can.\n\n“His skillset is undeniable,” Henderson said. “He’s a very talented kid. During his time here he’s continued to develop and show he has the athletic ability but also the understanding of what being a good receiver is and the nuances that kind of only come through experience and getting good coaching and putting time in. The sky’s the limit for him.”\n\nCollins is among a dozen Delaware high school products – out of 18 on the roster – who appear likely to be regular contributors for the Blue Hens this season. The others:\n\nNolan Henderson, quarterback, Smyrna\n\nDelaware's grand ambitions for 2022 have much to do with the quarterback, whose clutch play in 2021 sparked the Blue Hens’ NCAA semifinal run. Likewise, his absence in the final seven games last season factored into the Hens’ 5-6 finish. Delaware’s new offense is tailored for a quarterback with Henderson’s play-making talents and he has a chance to flourish.\n\nKedrick Whitehead, safety, Middletown\n\nDeservedly the most decorated Blue Hen, two-time first-team All-CAA pick and All-American selection Whitehead is the centerpiece of a Blue Hens’ defense that aims to be among the best in FCS this fall. His 223 career tackles rank 39th all-time at Delaware.\n\nRiah Burton, cornerback, William Penn\n\nBurton spent his first two seasons at Virginia playing wide receiver and has been a valuable reserve since coming to Delaware and being switched to cornerback in 2019. In 14 career games, he’s had 17 tackles and an interception. But after playing in just four games last year due to a leg injury and COVID-19, Burton is poised for a banner final season. “He’s a darn good cover corner,” Carty said. “He is long and fast and fluid . . . He’s had a great camp.”\n\nZach Gwynn, quarterback, Salesianum\n\nNot recruited by Division I programs out of high school, Gwynn walked on at East Carolina, where he honed his game in two seasons well enough that, after transferring to Delaware, he beat out all the quarterbacks Delaware had recruited to serve as Henderson’s back-up. He ended up starting the Hens’ last seven games with mixed results. Gwynn completed 114 of 205 passes (55.6 percent) for 1,328 yards with eight touchdowns and nine interceptions. Still No. 2, he’ll benefit from that experience if and when he has to step in this season.\n\nJake Reed, long snapper, Caravel\n\nA sixth-year player and fourth-year starter, Reed has been rewarded for his reliability with a scholarship and brings a steady hand and determination to an important role.\n\nBradly Anyanwu, offensive lineman, Dover\n\nNow in his fourth UD season, Anyanwu has been a dependable player for Delaware and provides important experience and know-how to the offensive line. With 18 career games under his belt including a couple starts, Anyanwu has been playing with the second unit at right guard in preseason camp.\n\nT.J. Thomas, offensive lineman, Delaware Military Academy\n\nThomas was a frequent starter on the offensive line at Georgetown in 2018, 2019 and, after the Hoyas didn’t have a 2020-21 season due to COVID-19, 2021 before a hip injury sidelined him last year. He’s healthy now after surgery and has appeared to handle the rigors up front, often lining up at left guard with the No. 2 unit.\n\nMakhi Jackson, wide receiver, Smyrna\n\nDelaware has considerable depth, experience and potential at wide receiver. But opportunity abounds at the position in the Blue Hens’ pass-oriented attack and Jackson, still seeking his first game action in his third UD season, has shown he has the skills to take advantage as he showed while being a first-team All-State playmaker at Smyrna.\n\nTrey Austin, cornerback, Middletown\n\nAnother sixth-year player thanks to a red-shirt season and the COVID year, Austin provides talent and experience behind the Blue Hens’ solid first three of Justis Henley, Amonte Strothers and Burton at cornerback and is also a special teamer. He got in two games last year, his first on-field action since playing in 10 games as a red-shirt freshman at UNLV in 2018 before transferring home.\n\nJared Duncan, safety, Tatnall\n\nThe fourth-year Blue Hen has appeared in just one career game after spending his first college year at Morgan State. But the son of one of Delaware’s best high school players ever, Christiana linebacker and NFL alum Jamie Duncan, provides versatility and experience to the UD defense and has become a valuable reserve and special teamer.\n\nBrandon Dennis, defensive back, Concord\n\nA fifth-year Blue Hen, Dennis has appeared in four career games and could land special teams duty.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

But the Blue Hens (4-2 overall, 2-1 Colonial Athletic Association) are back on track.\n\nDown 10-0 early and 16-14 through three quarters, the Hens demonstrated the necessary offensive firepower and defensive toughness to rule in the decisive fourth quarter.\n\nThat made them 28-16 winners over Elon, which had risen to No. 5 in the STATS media Top 25 national FCS poll after last week’s 27-24 win at James Madison.\n\n“We felt this would be a very pivotal game in our season,” coach Danny Rocco said.\n\nDelaware took the lead with 7:01 left on Pat Kehoe’s 23-yard touchdown pass to Vinny Papale on third-and-4. It closed a six-play, 68-yard drive that also included a pass-interference penalty against Elon.\n\nAfter the Phoenix were forced to punt after three incomplete passes, Kani Kane’s 2-yard TD run with 4:02 to go closed a six-play, 53-yard march that was all runs, including Kane’s 32-yard gallop.\n\nThe defense then stopped Elon again on downs to lock up the win.\n\nElon lost its starting quarterback to a knee injury in the first quarter, though its backup had seen significant previous duty while doing more running than passing. In addition, the CAA’s leading rusher, Malcolm Summers, didn’t play because of an injury.\n\nBut the Phoenix had plenty of other formidable features, including an offensive line with 133 career starts and a sturdy defense. Yet Delaware, despite three first-half turnovers that could have been its downfall, managed to overcome a shaky start and score a big win.\n\nFive takeaways from Saturday:\n\nSensing the stakes\n\nThe Blue Hens understood the critical nature of this game in perhaps determining their long-term fate, even though many challenges remain.\n\nThe victory should provide confidence moving forward. Delaware has five games left, including three against teams presently in the Top 25.\n\n“It felt that way from really, probably Monday, or Sunday night when we started breaking down film,” senior inside linebacker Troy Reeder said of the game’s huge importance.\n\n“Guys just saw it as what it was. It was No. 5 coming in to play us at home and we love playing at home. I think guys did a really phenomenal job preparing all week and hopefully the rest of our schedule we continue to prepare like we’re playing a top-five team.”\n\nRegaining the run\n\nKane’s 124 yards on 19 carries, Delaware’s first 100-plus effort since Kane’s 106 in the opening-night loss to Rhode Island, highlighted a resurgent day for UD’s running attack.\n\nDelaware averaged 4.7 yards per carry against Elon. The Hens came in averaging 3.0.\n\n“We are physical,’’ Rocco said. “We thought we’d be able to get some movement in there, knock them around a little and sure enough in the fourth quarter that was somewhat the difference in the football game.”\n\nDeJoun Lee, a smaller, quicker, more elusive runner, was again effectively mixed in to complement the powerful Kane.\n\nBut Delaware also had success lining up in its wildcat formation with Joe Walker at quarterback, his old position before moving to wideout. From that, Delaware unleashed a variety of plays.\n\n“We played a complete game up front,” Walker said, crediting the offensive line’s role in the effort. “They went to war every single play.”\n\nHome-field advantage\n\nSaturday’s crowd of 19,924 was the largest in three years, since 19,924 attended the game against New Hampshire in 2015.\n\nCertainly, Family & Parents Weekend always brings a larger gathering and it’s still nothing like the 2000s, when sellouts and 20,000-plus throngs were the norm.\n\nBut it was impressive and added to a great game-day atmosphere.\n\n“There were some times out there today,” Rocco said, “that we had so much energy in that stadium that it was just joyful for me and I’m hoping it was joyful for our fans because there was excitement and energy. Our kids were playing hard, and it was a big factor in the game there at the end.”\n\nRocco mentioned the fanfare that followed Noah Plack and Jack Dinicola stopping Elon’s returnman at the Phoenix 18 on Delaware’s kickoff following its go-ahead TD.\n\n“Our sideline went nuts. The fans went nuts, crazy,” Rocco said. “And this is a kickoff play. It was just all right there for us. I do think that’s what we’ve all been kind of searching for.”\n\nGotta be more careful\n\nDelaware was fortunate Elon didn’t take greater advantage of the Hens’ sloppy start that included three first-half turnovers. Delaware’s 64 yards in penalties were also well above its 41-yards-per-game average.\n\n“That made it more difficult than it needed to be but it gave us that opportunity to rise up and we certainly did that,” Rocco said.\n\nFuture situations may not be as forgiving.\n\nDelaware now goes to New Hampshire, where it hasn’t won in 15 years. Though the Wildcats (1-5, 0-3) are likely to see their string of 14 straight years in the NCAA playoffs end, they are no easy task anywhere.\n\n“I do think this team is getting better,” Rocco said. “I think that we learn from our experiences, we’ve learned from our hard defeats. This team has been through a lot of adversity. This team has been challenged, doubted, disbelieved and we keep coming back every day, going to work, focusing on the next day, staying together, staying united.”\n\nNumbers game\n\nDelaware limited Elon to 289 total yards – they’d averaged 415.4 — after giving up 608 at Richmond and 527 at North Dakota State.\n\nReeder, the CAA’s leading tackler, had 15 more, including five for lost yardage in another inspired effort.\n\nJoe Walker passed for 37 yards, ran for 17, had 25 yards receiving and 84 on kickoff returns. No wonder NFL scouts have taken notice.\n\nThe Blue Hens won despite having no takeaways but making three turnovers.\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

One of them, he said, was “right across the street” from his home in North Brunswick Township, New Jersey.\n\nThat school is Rutgers, where, on Saturday afternoon in somewhat of a personal homecoming, Hemmingway hopes to show the Scarlet Knights what they may have missed.\n\nLONG-AGO RIVALS: Recounting 5 memorable Delaware-Rutgers games\n\nRutgers and Delaware, each 2-0, meet at 3:30 p.m. at SHI Stadium (Big Ten Network).\n\nHemmingway did have an opportunity to be a walk-on at Rutgers. But the scholarship opportunity from Delaware – several of its CAA rivals also offered him -- and chance to experience a new setting was more inviting.\n\n“There’s really no negative part in it,” Hemmingway said of if he had attended Rutgers. “But I just wanted to start off on my own, go outside of New Jersey and make a name for myself.\n\n“I just felt like I wanted to go somewhere where they wanted me, you know what I mean? So you know I got a chip on my shoulder for the game.”\n\nDelaware, ranked sixth nationally at the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) level, will be playing a Big Ten team for the first time.\n\nThe Blue Hens and Scarlet Knights were mid-20th-century rivals and have met 31 times before with Delaware winning 13. But this is their first collision since 1973.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 275-pound Hemmingway is among 14 New Jersey players on the UD roster, including likely starters Gene Coleman II and Brett Buckman at wide receiver and linebacker Johnny Buchanan.\n\nBETTER THAN BEFORE: Big Ten Rutgers a major challenge for Hens\n\n“We’re very fired up,” Hemmingway said. “We’re in our home state. We haven’t been back to play there since we were in high school. There’s a lot on the line right now. So I’m excited. All my boys from Jersey are excited as ever. It’s going to be a great game.”\n\nHemmingway starred at Pope John XII High in Sparta, New Jersey, and will know some Rutgers players. He’ll hope, afterward, they remember him.\n\nWeighing just 240 pounds when he arrived at Delaware, Hemmingway didn’t play in a game while red-shirting his true freshman season of 2017, when Delaware had standouts Bilal Nichols, now with the Chicago Bears, and Blaine Woodson, who has played in the Canadian Football League, in its defensive front.\n\nHe then saw spot duty as a red-shirt freshman and sophomore, making 11 tackles in 14 games while watching what worked for players such as Cam Kitchen, Brandan Hall and present teammate Frank Burton III.\n\n“It was most definitely a culture change,” he said, “because everything’s more fast paced. You gotta make sure you’re on your P’s and Q’s the second you step on campus. My first couple weeks here I was kinda star-struck.\n\nMOURNED BY MANY: Ruly Carpenter’s passing saddens those with UD, Phillies ties\n\n“Those older players always told me ‘Don’t think too much,’ slow my game down, 'just play ball.' That’s something I took personally because I wanted to play, I wanted my shot. They definitely encouraged me in becoming the player I am today and the work ethic I’m trying to show.”\n\nDelaware defensive line coach Levern Belin can pinpoint the key moments that allowed Hemmingway to go from being a role player to starter and valuable contributor.\n\nAfter four games in the 2019 season, the two had a “heart-to-heart” talk, Belin said. The coach told Hemmingway he had “the talent to be a very, very good football player” but he needed a more consistent, diligent effort.\n\n“When you can show me that you can go two weeks in a row doing everything right, you will play,” Belin said he told Hemmingway. “ . . . And I saw it, for two weeks in a row. Every day he came out to work. He put his mind to the fundamental techniques and did it all the time as opposed to sometimes.\n\n“Before that he’d have a good day, have a bad day. Have two good days, have an OK day. Now it’s to the point where he might have a bad day but his bad days are still pretty stinkin’ good.”\n\nCLEAN GAME: Limiting mistakes key for Hens vs. St. Francis\n\nHemmingway’s efforts paid off in the spring 2021 season, played after the 2020 fall schedule was erased by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDelaware was 7-1 and reached the FCS playoff semifinals. Hemmingway’s 24 tackles included five for lost yardage and 2.5 sacks. He forced a fumble in Delaware’s FCS quarterfinal win over Sacred Heart.\n\n“With the older players leaving, I knew I had to step up into a role that I was never given,” Hemmingway said.\n\n“Once I received that role I had to take it and run with it. Physicality, working on pass rushes and everything like that. I just felt like that was big for my game and what I needed to do to be successful for our defense.’’\n\nHemmingway missed the Maine opener this season with a broken right hand. He returned for Saturday’s home opener against St. Francis and made a key play in the 27-10 win.\n\nHe and Burton were pressuring quarterback Jyron Russell on a first-and-10 at the Red Flash 47 in the second quarter when Hemmingway got a hand on Russell’s pass. Linebacker Liam Trainer intercepted it. Dejoun Lee scored on a 1-yard run to close the subsequent 58-yard drive as Delaware took a 13-3 lead.\n\n“Artis has really made himself into a good football player,” Delaware coach Danny Rocco said afterward.\n\nHemmingway also had Delaware’s one sack in the St. Francis game.\n\nNow he’ll relish one of the biggest challenges of his UD career in familiar territory at Rutgers on Saturday.\n\n“He’s a great kid,” Belin said. “He’s one of the kids that, before a game, makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up that I’m ready to run through a brick wall for because of how intense he is and his purpose and his strive for that particular game. That’s the way he was all spring and he’s the same now.”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

Come Saturday, potentially millions of people across the United States will be drawn to look to the skies to glimpse the rare annular solar eclipse, which astronomers warn will be the last opportunity to see the phenomenon until 2039.\n\nBut gazing at the sun with the naked eye is never wise. That's why astronomers also caution that celestial enthusiasts be prepared with the proper eyewear to view the ring of fire as NASA said it will travel in the U.S. from the coast of Oregon to the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nHow to safely watch the solar eclipse:Rare 'ring of fire' has the potential to damage your eyes if you don't take precautions\n\nWhere to find solar eclipse glasses\n\nAccording to NASA, the only safe way to watch an eclipse is through a pair of approved solar eclipse glasses or a handheld solar viewer.\n\nFortunately for stargazers, solar eclipse glasses are readily available for purchase and even for free ahead of the ring of fire, which should be viewable in some form in all lower 48 states.\n\nBut don't confuse the specialized eyewear with your run-of-the-mill sunglasses: certified solar eclipse glasses are held to an international safety standard and are 100,000 times darker to block nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light.\n\nFree solar eclipse glasses available at libraries nationwide\n\nIn Buffalo, New York, for instance, Erie County officials provided funding to hand out hundreds of thousands of the eyewear at its local libraries, according to the Buffalo Museum of Science.\n\nMany libraries around the country, in fact, will be giving away free pairs of approved eclipse glasses through Saturday. The Space Science Institute distributed 5 million solar-viewing glasses to 10,000 libraries and maintains a map of participating libraries on its website.\n\nGet solar eclipse glasses through American Paper Optics\n\nResidents in Memphis, Tennessee have several options available to acquire solar eclipse glasses, according to the Commercial Appeal, a USA TODAY Network publication. In addition to the city's libraries giving away the eye protection, a popup shop will also be open every day through Saturday where glasses produced by American Paper Optics costing up to $20 are for sale.\n\nAmerican Paper Optics, the nation's largest supplier of eclipse glasses, also offers express shipping across the country.\n\nPlenty of other online sellers have eclipse glasses for sale that are compliant with ISO 12312-2, a long number that simply specifies the properties that a solar viewer should have in order to protect eyes from injury.\n\nFind solar eclipse glasses through approved vendor\n\nFor more manufacturers and retailers who sell certified glasses, the American Astronomical Society maintains a curated list of approved vendors.\n\nOf course, Prime Day may be over, but consumers can also turn to Amazon for their eclipse-watching needs. The online retailer has a variety of certified solar eclipse glasses, many of which can be bought in bulk (including a 50-pack for $49.99.)\n\nBut be wary of counterfeit or unsafe eclipse glasses when shopping Amazon. If the seller's name is not one of the verified suppliers on the American Astronomical Society's list, look elsewhere.\n\nWill 2024 solar eclipse be better?Real showstopper comes in April when large portions of the country see an even more impressive total eclipse\n\nWhy solar eclipse glasses are necessary protection\n\nAt least some of the sun’s powerful light will be visible Saturday even in places without a view of the spectacular partial solar eclipse.\n\nDirectly staring at the sun at any time can cause blindness or disrupted vision, but the concentrated solar rays of the partial eclipse are especially acute. Looking at it through a camera lens, telescope or binoculars is also dangerous, as the rays can burn through even those filters, according to NASA.\n\nAn annular eclipse is different from the nighttime darkness of a total eclipse in which the Moon completely blocks the face of the Sun from Earth's view, the next of which is expected to occur in April.\n\nRather, an annular solar eclipse occurs when the moon is at the farthest point of its orbit from Earth and passes in front of the sun. Because it is incapable of completely blocking the sun, the moon instead appears as a smaller dark disc in front of the larger and brighter star, creating what looks like a ring of fire.\n\nWeather permitting, the eclipse will first become visible in Oregon around 9:13 a.m. PDT and end in Texas around 12:03 p.m. CDT, according to NASA. It will then move beyond the U.S. and over Mexico, Central America and finally South America before ending around sunset off of Natal, Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Once inside the darkened space, audience members become uneasy as they peer down a brightly lit and very deep-looking hole that drops into infinite darkness. Glenn Kaino’s work is a contemplative gesture that explores the complicated and diverse history of tunnel making, from the secret tunnels between Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the common childhood (and Orientalist) fantasy of digging a hole through the planet and ending up in China.

Lions linebacker Derrick Barnes intercepted Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield on Tampa Bay’s final drive of the game to seal it.\n\nMayfield had three touchdown passes – his first two to tight end Cade Otton and Rachaad White tied the game, but his third to Mike Evans trimmed Tampa Bay’s deficit to 31-23 with 4:37 left in the game. But his second interception of the game ended Tampa Bay’s season.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nDetroit advances to a conference championship game for the first time since 1991. It is one of four NFL franchises to never reach a Super Bowl.\n\nTampa Bay enters the offseason after Mayfield led the Buccaneers to the NFC South title, and their first playoff win since Tom Brady retired in 2021. — Safid Deen\n\nLions vs. Bucs score\n\nLions — 31\n\nBuccaneers — 23\n\nLions vs. Bucs winners, losers\n\nWINNERS\n\nBen Johnson and the Detroit offense didn’t panic\n\nCredit the Lions offense and coordinator Ben Johnson, who appears very likely to end up with a head coaching gig whenever the Detroit offseason arrives, for working through early game adversity. Through their first six offensive possessions (not counting a kneel at the end of the first half), the Lions had recorded three three-and-outs and had crossed midfield just twice.\n\nThen, quarterback Jared Goff started to work the ball down the field. The Lions scored touchdowns on their seventh, eighth and ninth possessions, and averaged 8.3 plays and 76 yards in those. Tampa Bay and coach Todd Bowles did a tremendous job early of shutting down the rush and Detroit’s offense stalled. Johnson didn’t panic and allowed the pass to open up the rush, namely in a beautifully-timed counter that went 31 yards and was a Jahmyr Gibbs touchdown early in the fourth that helped Detroit run away with it.\n\nThe young Lions weapons\n\nIt’s not just that Detroit reached its first NFC title game in 32 seasons, it’s also that they’ve set themselves up for the short-term future, especially on offense. The Lions have a nice trio of emerging stars at running back, receiver and tight end.\n\nJahmyr Gibbs, 21, is a rookie running back who had 114 yards from scrimmage and one touchdown on 13 touches. Amon-Ra St. Brown, 24, is already a downfield threat who led the Lions in receiving yards (77) and scored the game-sealing touchdown. Sam LaPorta, 23, is a rookie tight end who paced Detroit in catches with nine and was a steady threat all day long.\n\nLOSERS\n\nTampa Bay ground game a letdown, again\n\nThe Buccaneers and offensive coordinator Dave Canales very clearly tried to create some balance Sunday. The team’s inability to get anything at all going put way too much pressure on quarterback Baker Mayfield, which in turn stressed the Tampa Bay offense beyond repair.\n\nThe Buccaneers ranked dead last in the NFL during the regular season in rushing yards per game (88.8) and rushing yards per play (3.44). Against the Lions, Tampa Bay was more or less right on that average, recording 89 rushing yards at a 5.9 yards-per-carry clip. The problem isn’t talent; Rachaad White is a very capable back. The issue is the team often abandons the running game and doesn’t execute it with enough consistency. Against Detroit, the Bucs posted only 15 total carries. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nLions-Bucs highlights\n\nLions interception: Derrick Barnes picks off Baker Mayfield\n\nThe Bucs last chance to tie the ballgame ended in a Baker Mayfield interception.\n\nOn second-and-5 with 1:59 remaining, Mayfield’s pass over the middle was intercepted by Lions linebacker Derrick Barnes. Barnes’ interception preserved the 31-23 victory for the Lions.\n\nBarnes’ interception was the first of his career and it stamped the Lions’ ticket to the NFC championship game.\n\nMayfield had two picks in the loss. — Tyler Dragon\n\nBucs score: Mike Evans 16-yard touchdown catch from Baker Mayfield\n\nOn fourth-and-14 with the season on the line, Baker Mayfield passed to star wideout Mike Evans for 24 yards.\n\nMayfield and Evans weren’t done there.\n\nWith their season hanging in the balance, Mayfield tossed to Evans running a skinny post for a 16-yard touchdown to conclude a nine-play, 75-yard touchdown drive. On a two-point conversion attempt, the two tried to hookup again on a fade route but the pass fell incomplete.\n\nThe Bucs still trail 31-23 with 4:37 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nEvans has seven catches for a game-high 142 yards and a touchdown. He is possibly playing his last game in a Tampa Bay uniform. — Tyler Dragon\n\nLions score: Amon-Ra St. Brown 9-yard touchdown catch from Jared Goff\n\nLions QB Jared Goff hit wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown for 16 yards on a critical third-and-15 to extend Detroit’s series. Four plays later, Goff found St. Brown again in the end zone for a nine-yard touchdown to extend the Lions’ lead to 31-17 with 6:22 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Lions have scored touchdowns on three straight possessions to give themselves some breathing room as they inch closer to earning their spot in the NFC championship game.\n\nSt. Brown has seven catches, 62 receiving yards and a touchdown. — Tyler Dragon\n\nAfter Lions touchdown, Bucs' drive ends with punt\n\nAfter Jahmyr Gibbs and the Lions took the lead, the Bucs had no answer on their next time on the field offensively.\n\nRachaad White was tackled short of the first down, and the Bucs punted after a three-and-out.\n\nThe Lions will take over inside their own 10-yard line with 12:12 left, hoping to hang onto their 24-17 lead in the fourth quarter. — Safid Deen\n\nLions score: Jahmyr Gibbs 31-yard touchdown run\n\nLions running back Jahmyr Gibbs took the handoff on a zone-read run and the rest was history.\n\nGibbs saw an opening on the left side, took one cut in the open field and raced to a 31-yard touchdown to cap off Detroit’s five-play, 75-yard touchdown drive. Gibbs’ touchdown lifted the Lions to a 24-17 lead with 13:13 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe rookie out of Alabama now has eight carries, 70 rushing yards and a touchdown. — Tyler Dragon\n\nEnd of 3rd quarter: Lions 17, Bucs 17\n\nThis game is coming down to the wire.\n\nThe Lions and Buccaneers scored a touchdown in the third quarter to keep the score even at 17.\n\nCraig Reynolds ran in a 1-yard touchdown for Detroit. On fourth down, of course. The drive was boosted by a 29-yard pass from Jared Goff to Brock Wright.\n\nThen, Tampa Bay turned up the heat and went 75 yards in seven plays. The Bucs capped off the drive with a 12-yard touchdown where Rachaad White took a short pass from Baker Mayfield and snuck into the end zone.\n\nMayfield has gone 19-of-28 for 259 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Goff is 20-of-32 for 168 yards and a score. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nBucs score: Baker Mayfield 12-yard touchdown pass to Rachaad White\n\nAs the third quarter ends, we’ve got a tied game in Detroit.\n\nThe Lions sent the blitz, and Baker Mayfield checked down to running back Rachaad White for a 12-yard touchdown to tie this game at 17.\n\nOne play earlier, referees ruled Mayfield threw the ball away incomplete when replays showed he was sacked. The call was missed.\n\nMayfield heated up during the drive, finding tight end Cade Otton for three consecutive completions for 9, 13 and 27 yards to get into the red zone. – Safid Deen\n\nLions score: Craig Reynolds 1-yard touchdown run\n\nThe Lions were in four-down territory, at least by Dan Campbell’s standard.\n\nQuarterback Jared Goff hit tight end Brock Wright for a 29-yard gain into Buccaneers territory. Campbell and the Lions would find themselves in a fourth-down situation later in the drive. On fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line, the Lions handed off to Craig Reynolds. The third-string back gave Detroit a 17-10 lead with 3:48 remaining in the third quarter.\n\nThe completion to Wright was the longest play of the game for either team. The third-year tight end out of Notre Dame hadn’t caught a pass in the Lions’ last two games.\n\nPrior to the scoring drive, the teams were trading punts. After Detroit forced a three-and-out, the Lions went 64 yards in 10 plays (4:23 drive time) to go back into the lead. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nAidan Hutchinson sack ends Bucs drive\n\nThe Buccaneers had a promising opening drive going, but it ended with a punt.\n\nOn third-and-4 from Detroit’s 38-yard line, Hutchinson came across the edge unblocked and sacked Baker Mayfield for a nine-yard loss. Hutchinson’s sack knocked the Bucs out of field goal range.\n\nThe Lions have three sacks in the game.\n\nBucs running back Rachaad White had 20 rushing yards during the drive. — Tyler Dragon\n\nLions' Jonah Jackson injury\n\nWhile starting center Frank Ragnow is back in the game for the Lions, starting guard Jonah Jackson was ruled out for the rest of the game due to a knee injury. — Tyler Dragon\n\nBucs on the road in postseason: A brief history\n\nA win today would put Tampa Bay into the NFC title game for the fifth time in the franchise's 48-year history. Of course, that first means securing a victory in Detroit. If only Tom Brady was still here …\n\nThe Buccaneers are 3-0 all-time on the road in the playoffs – with TB12, who guided the 2020 road warriors all the way to their Super Bowl 55 victory (ironically at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium). Otherwise? The Bucs are 1-6 in postseason roadies, their lone victory coming in the 2002 NFC championship game – when Ronde Barber and Co. upset the Eagles in Philadelphia in what turned out to be the final game played at Philly's old Veterans Stadium. — Nate Davis\n\nLions leaders at halftime\n\nJared Goff: 14-22, 99 passing yards, TD\n\nJahmyr Gibbs: 4 carries, 17 rushing yards\n\nSam LaPorta: 5 receptions, 46 receiving yards\n\nIfeatu Melifonwu: 6 tackles, 1 sack, 1 TFL\n\nBrian Branch: 6 tackles, 1 sack, 1 TFL\n\nBucs leaders at halftime\n\nBaker Mayfield: 13-18, 181 passing yards, TD\n\nRachaad White: 5 carries, 39 rushing yards\n\nMike Evans: 4 receptions, 94 receiving yards\n\nK.J. Britt: 10 tackles, 1 TFL\n\nCalijah Kancey: 1 sack\n\nLions vs. Bucs: Total yards in first half\n\nTampa Bay has 233 yards of total offense at halftime.\n\nDetroit has 134 yards of total offense.\n\nHalftime: Lions 10, Bucs 10\n\nThe defenses have held the upper hand for most of the first half, but Tampa Bay showed the biggest offensive spark in the final two minutes to pull into a tie at the break.\n\nBucs QB Baker Mayfield completed 13-of-18 passes for 181 yards – 67 of them coming on the final TD drive of the half to pull his team even.\n\nMike Evans leads Tampa Bay with four receptions for 97 yards.\n\nIt's been a battle of field position for most of the half. Tampa Bay has 233 yards of total offense, while Detroit has 134.\n\nFor the Lions, QB Jared Goff has completed 14-of-22 passes for 99 yards and one score. TE Sam LaPorta has five catches for 46 yards. — Steve Gardner\n\nBucs score: Baker Mayfield 2-yard touchdown pass to Cade Otton\n\nThe Buccaneers marched down the field in 73 seconds to score a touchdown before the halftime break.\n\nBaker Mayfield found Mike Evans for back-to-back throws of 27 and 29 yards (where the wide receiver showed his field awareness and veteran expertise) to put Tampa Bay at Detroit’s 2-yard line.\n\nMayfield then tossed the ball to tight end Cade Otton in the corner of the end zone for the touchdown. The referees initially threw a flag for an offensive pass interference, but ruled that Otton made contact within the permitted space.\n\nOn the Buccaneers' first set of downs, Mayfield kept the drive alive by running for 14 yards on third-and-1.\n\nThe game is tied 10-10. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nLions' Frank Ragnow injury\n\nDetroit has injury concerns upfront.\n\nLions starting center Frank Ragnow got his leg rolled up on when quarterback Jared Goff fell into him as he was being sacked to the ground by Bucs defensive lineman Calijah Kancey.\n\nRagnow did return to snap the ball on the final play of the first half, a kneel-down by Goff.\n\nDetroit is already dealing with an injuring to starting guard Jonah Jackson. Jackson is questionable to return after injuring his knee in the first half. — Tyler Dragon\n\nLions drive before halftime ends in sack\n\nThe Lions had a chance to add to their lead before halftime, but their drive stalled right around midfield.\n\nLions quarterback Jared Goff was sacked by Bucs defensive lineman Calijah Kancey, and to make matters worse: Lions center Frank Ragnow was injured on the play.\n\nThe decisive play on the drive was a pass play to Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, which was was ruled short on second-and-6 instead of extending the drive with a first down.\n\nThe play and review by referees proved to be costly for Detroit. — Safid Deen\n\nBuccaneers miss field goal\n\nThat sound you barely heard over the crowd noise in Detroit?\n\nDOINK.\n\nTodd Bowles and the Buccaneers wasted a nine-play, 55-yard drive by sending out the field goal unit on fourth-and-5 from the Detroit 32-yard line. Chase McLaughlin’s attempt hit of the left upright and the Buccaneers still trailed 10-3 ahead of the two-minute warning.\n\nTampa Bay opened the drive with big gain to Mike Evans off play-action. Rachaad White used a nifty first move to pick up a key third-down conversion near midfield. Tight end Cade Otton had a first-down reception, but Baker Mayfield missed Chris Godwin on a third-and-5 throw, and Bowles’ conservative nature cost the Buccaneers a chance at points. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nLions punt back to Bucs\n\nThe Lions were forced to punt on their fourth drive.\n\nJared Goff and the Lions were able to pick up one first down, but they were ultimately stopped on third-and-10 from their own 44-yard line.\n\nThe Lions are currently 4 for 7 on third downs. — Tyler Dragon\n\nLions vs. Buccaneers: Celebrities in Detroit for playoff game\n\nThe biggest star at the Lions divisional round game against the Buccaneers might be one who hasn't won a Grammy and doesn't have a bust in Canton.\n\nAmong the Detroit diehards is Benjamin Capp, a 66-year season ticket holder who went viral last week during the wild-card win with his distinct glasses and love for his team.\n\nCapp was on the sidelines ahead of the divisional round game against the Buccaneers. He had a chat with Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith.\n\nLions Hall of Fame receiver Calvin Johnson was also at Ford Field for the big day. Current Detroit players got a few words of motivation from Megatron himself.\n\nFlavor Flav, Taylor Lautner, Bob Seger and Jeff Daniels were also in attendance. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nFord Field history\n\nThe Lions' wild-card defeat of the Los Angeles Rams last weekend was their first home playoff game at Ford Field since it opened in 2002. (The venue's only previous playoff utilization occurred in Super Bowl 40, when the Pittsburgh Steelers and Motown native Jerome Bettis vanquished the Seattle Seahawks.)\n\nAnd while today is obviously the first divisional round game Ford Field has witnessed, it also marks the first time in the Lions' 94-year history that they've had multiple home playoff games in the same season. A win today will qualify Detroit for the NFC championship game for only the second time. — Nate Davis\n\nIs Devin White playing?\n\nThe Buccaneers’ defense was without one of its top contributors for the first quarter, as linebacker Devin White did not take a snap over the first 15 minutes.\n\nThe reason for White’s absence was a mystery. His strength as a defender is not against the pass, but the Lions called a balanced first quarter (10 passes, eight runs). White was coming off a two-tackle performance in the Buccaneers' wild-card victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nK.J. Britt filled in for White alongside Lavonte David as the Buccaneers’ off-ball linebackers. White did return for the start of the second quarter and was on the field for the Lions’ touchdown. The 2019 No. 5 overall pick is a free agent after the season and finished tied for second on the Bucs with nine quarterback hits during the regular season. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nBucs punt back to Lions\n\nOne yard short.\n\nThe Buccaneers are punting on their first possession after the Lions took a 10-3 lead.\n\nBucs tight end Cade Otton was called for pass interference on a pass play to running back Chase Edmonds, and Baker Mayfield’s pass to Edmonds went for 14 yards on third-and-15.\n\nThe Lions have the ball again with a chance to extend their lead in the second quarter. — Safid Deen\n\nMike Evans contract\n\nMike Evans and the Buccaneers were unable to agree on a contract extension this past offseason. The Bucs star receiver is in the final year of a five-year, $82.5 million extension that he signed in March of 2018.\n\nEvans has produced franchise records in career receptions (762), receiving yards (11,680) and touchdowns (94) in 10 seasons, all in Tampa Bay. He is the first player in NFL history to begin his career with 10 consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons. — Tyler Dragon\n\nLions score: Jared Goff 9-yard touchdown pass to Josh Reynolds\n\nThe Lions converted a pair of third downs on quick passes from QB Jared Goff to star wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown, marching into Tampa Bay territory as the first quarter concluded.\n\nAs the second quarter began, the Lions continued their march downfield with Goff hitting rookie TE Sam LaPorta on consecutive plays for a first down at the Bucs 14.\n\nFrom there, Goff connected with a wide-open Josh Reynolds in the back of the end zone for a 9-yard touchdown and a 10-3 Lions lead. — Steve Gardner\n\nEnd of 1st quarter: Lions 3, Bucs 3\n\nThe Lions converted a pair of third downs on quick passes from QB Jared Goff to star wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown, marching into Buccaneers territory as the first quarter concluded.\n\nThe teams are even on the scoreboard and nearly so on the stat sheet.\n\nDetroit has 62 yards of total offense. Tampa Bay has 67. — Steve Gardner\n\nBucs score: Chase McLaughlin 43-yard field goal\n\nTampa Bay tied the proceedings on a Chase McLaughlin 43-yard field goal with 4:19 left in the first quarter. McLaughlin has missed twice all season and has made every extra point attempt.\n\nRunning back Rachaad White sharted the drive with an eight-yard run, but the big plays came from QB Baker Mayfield to his receiving corps. Mike Evans caught a third-down pass for 18 yards, and Trey Palmer – who woke up feeling angry – had a 23-yard gain. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nCJ Gardner-Johnson backs up Baker Mayfield smack talk\n\nWhile preparing to face the Buccaneers, Lions safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson made headlines for dissing Tampa Bay quarterback Baker Mayfield.\n\n\"If you give that Tampa group a good quarterback, that’s a good group – (Mike) Evans, (Chris) Godwin, (Russell) Gage, that’s a great group,\" the former Florida standout said, according to Detroit radio station 97.1 The Ticket.\n\nThe defender backed up his smack talk early in the divisional round game Sunday when he intercepted Mayfield on the Buccaneers’ first drive of the game.\n\nMayfield and Tampa Bay lost to Detroit 20-6 in a regular season matchup where he didn't score and threw a pick.\n\n\"He didn’t play our first game so I’m excited to see him,\" Mayfield said of Gardner-Johnson’s criticism. \"I think he’s a really good player. He has been for a while. He’s been an impactful guy on every team he’s been on. … But yeah, he’s gotta do a little bit more film study.\"\n\nRunning back Rachaad White also brushed off Gardner-Johnson's comments and expressed confidence in his quarterback.\n\n“I expect a lot of poise from him, a lot of leadership. What he brings in every week, just a guy that just get us in and out of situations like he normally do,\" White said on ESPN’s NFL Countdown. \"… That’s the biggest thing I love about Baker and our team loves: When in doubt, he’s gonna leave it all out there on the field. He’s gonna do everything that needs to be done in order to try to get the win.\" — Victoria Hernandez\n\nLions score: Michael Badgley 25-yard field goal\n\nThe Lions are on the board, although they left some points off of it.\n\nDetroit settled for a field goal after a run by running back Jahmyr Gibbs got them inside the Buccaneers 5-yard line. Jared Goff nearly threw an interception in the end zone, and a run by David Montgomery was stuffed.\n\nMichael Badgley’s kick from 25 yards out was good, giving Detroit a 3-0 lead in the first quarter. — Safid Deen\n\nLions interception: CJ Gardner-Johnson picks off Baker Mayfield\n\nThe homestanding Lions looked to take charge early after winning the coin toss and taking the ball, but the Buccaneers defense held them to a three-and-out.\n\nOn their first possession, the Bucs leaned heavily on running back Raschaad White. The second-year back carried the ball twice for 17 yards and caught a pass for 8 more.\n\nBut after a sack, QB Baker Mayfield's pass went off the hands of WR Mike Evans and into the hands of Lions DB C.J. Gardner-Johnson for an interception and the first big break of the game. — Steve Gardner\n\nLions vs. Buccaneers coin toss\n\nThe Lions won the coin toss and elected to receive the ball. That means the Buccaneers will get the ball after halftime.\n\nBucs' Rachaad White in musical mindset on way to Motown\n\nAhead of Sunday’s game, Buccaneers RB Rachaad White explained how he’s preparing to face the Lions in the divisional round – embracing the music of the Motor City for his game day playlist.\n\n“I’m with Tee Grizzley, I’m with 42 Dugg,” he said on ESPN’s NFL Countdown. “I’m with a lot of Detroit rappers right now today, which they’re probably against me, but it’s all good.”\n\nTee Grizzley appeared in a social media video to hype up Lions fans at Ford Field ahead of the 2022 season. 42 Dugg had Detroit safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson on stage with him this weekend at his homecoming show. The rapper led the crowd in a “Go Lions” chant. – Victoria Hernandez\n\nLions vs. Buccaneers game time\n\nKickoff is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET inside Ford Field in Detroit.\n\nLions vs. Buccaneers how to watch\n\nWho is favored Lions or Buccaneers?\n\nThe top NFL betting apps favor the Lions over the Buccaneers in their divisional playoff game.\n\nLions vs. Buccaneers spread\n\nThe Lions are 6-point favorites over the Buccaneers, according to the BetMGM NFL odds.\n\nLions vs. Buccaneers over under\n\nThe over-under is 49.5, according to BetMGM.\n\nLions vs. Buccaneers moneyline\n\nDetroit is a -275 favorite on the moneyline.

Overall, Detroit leads the series 32-29, and that includes a 20-6 victory in Tampa Bay during the 2023 regular season.\n\nLions playoff history\n\nThe Lions are 8-13 all-time in the NFL playoffs. They have never been to the Super Bowl and the last time they went to the NFC championship game was the 1991 season. Their win against the Rams in last week’s wild-card round was their first playoff victory since that 1991 season.\n\nBuccaneers playoff history\n\nThe Buccaneers are 12-11 all-time in the NFL playoffs. They have appeared in two Super Bowls and won them both, the last one coming with Tom Brady leading the way after the 2020 season. This marks the fourth consecutive year that Tampa Bay has reached the postseason and the third time it has won at least one game.\n\nLions depth chart\n\nOffense\n\nWR: Jameson Williams, Antoine Green\n\nLT: Taylor Decker, Dan Skippers\n\nLG: Jonah Jackson, Kayode Awosika\n\nC: Frank Ragnow\n\nRG: Graham Glasgow, Colby Sorsdal\n\nRT: Penei Sewell\n\nTE: Sam LaPorta, Brock Wright, Anthony Firkser\n\nFB: Jason Cabinda\n\nRB: Jahmyr Gibbs, David Montgomery, Craig Reynolds\n\nQB: Jared Goff, Teddy Bridgewater, Hendon Hooker\n\nWR: Josh Reynolds, Donovan Peoples-Jones\n\nWR: Amon-Ra St. Brown\n\nDefense\n\nDE: Josh Paschal, John Cominsky\n\nNT: Benito Jones, Tyson Alualu\n\nDT: Alim McNeill, Levi Onwuzurike\n\nRUSH: Aidan Hutchinson, Romeo Okwara\n\nWLB: Alex Anzalone, Jalen Reeves-Maybin\n\nMLB: Derrick Barnes, Malcolm Rodriguez\n\nSLB: Jack Campbell, Anthony Pittman\n\nLCB: Kindle Vildor, Chase Lucas\n\nSS: Ifeatu Melifonwu, C.J.

Day 2 saw several exciting selections. In fact, even in the 10th round, the Cleveland Guardians were able to snag a Top 100 prospect in Durant High School's Chase Mobley. While not many Top 250 prospects were still available at the start of the day, there were certainly some potential game-changers waiting in the wings for their names to be called.\n\nMany of the most highly-ranked prospects were high schoolers with scholarships. Taking a chance that they'd rather play in the minors than in college can be very detrimental to a team's future. Playing it safe in most instances is likely the smartest thing to do. Still, there was tons of talent ready to be taken if MLB organizations were willing to take that risk.\n\nToo often, future All-Stars have fallen to the later rounds of the MLB draft. So, will 2024 bring yet another of those stories?

Rachaad White added 18 carries for 72 yards in the ousting of the defending NFC champions.\n\n“We fought so hard to get to this point, to get a chance to be in the playoffs, and I’m so proud of this team tonight,” Mayfield said on the ABC broadcast after the game. “The way we came out and started fast, I’m so proud.”\n\nJalen Hurts, who was playing with a finger injury on his throwing hand, finished 25-of-35 for 250 yards and a touchdown. DeVonta Smith had eight catches for 148 yards. Julio Jones left the game in the second quarter and was evaluated for a concussion.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThe Buccaneers will face the No. 3 seed Detroit Lions at Ford Field in the divisional round. The Lions defeated the Los Angeles Rams in their own wild-card matchup to win their first playoff game in more than 30 years. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nWinners and losers from Buccaneers' playoff win over Eagles\n\nWINNERS\n\nTodd Bowles, Tampa Bay’s defense: Todd Bowles and the Bucs effectively dialed up the blitz all night, and the Eagles did little to stop it. The blitz was working so the Bucs appropriately kept sending the heat.\n\nJalen Hurts had trouble finding open receivers outside of DeVonta Smith. Hurts routinely tried to escape the blitz with his legs. However, much like most of the regular season, Hurts’ speed and acceleration weren’t there.\n\nThe Bucs blitzed on 40% of their defensive snaps during the regular season. They likely blitzed on more than half of their defensive snaps on Monday night.\n\nLinebacker Lavonte David had five tackles and two tackles for loss.\n\nBaker Mayfield, Tampa Bay’s passing attack: Mayfield managed the game well and played winning football.\n\nMayfield picked apart Philadelphia’s leaky secondary. The Bucs quarterback finished 22-of-36 passing for 337 yards and had three touchdown passes. Nine different players had receptions.\n\nFive players had at least 45 receiving yards. David Moore, Trey Palmer and Chris Godwin each caught touchdowns.\n\nBucs kicker Chase McLaughlin: McLaughlin converted all three of his field goals, including one from 54 yards out.\n\nEagles WR DeVonta Smith: Smith was the lone bright spot for the Eagles.\n\nSmith was the only player Jalen Hurts seemed to trust. The Alabama product and former Heisman Trophy winner tallied eight catches for 148 receiving yards. No other Eagles player had more than 34 receiving yards.\n\nA.J. Brown was out Monday due to a knee injury. The Eagles missed Brown, but Smith tried to do his part.\n\nLOSERS\n\nCornerback James Bradberry, Eagles secondary: Bradberry’s poor regular season carried over into the postseason. The Bucs picked on him for most of the game.\n\nBradberry played a big role in Philly’s leaky secondary. But the veteran corner was hardly the only one getting beat. Cornerback Darius Slay was also subpar in the loss. Unfortunately, Slay was carted off the field in the fourth quarter due to injury.\n\nThe entire defensive back group played with poor angles and had an abysmal night tackling.\n\nThe Eagles had the second worst pass defense in the NFL during the regular season, and it showed in their playoff exit.\n\nEagles' MIA run game: The Eagles had a top five rushing attack last year. They never found consistency in their running game this season. The club rushed for 41 yards in the loss. Even the Eagles’ patent Tush Push (a.k.a. Brotherly Shove) didn’t work on a two-point conversion try.\n\nFall of this Eagles team: The Eagles’ demise was rapid. It’s almost hard to remember that the Eagles began the regular season 10-1.\n\nInept pass defense, a missing pass rush, combined with a stagnant and predictable offense ultimately led to Philly’s downfall.\n\nThe Eagles lost six of their last seven (including the playoffs) to end the year. — Tyler Dragon\n\nBuccaneers-Eagles highlights\n\nBaker Mayfield threw for three touchdowns to lead the resurgent Buccaneers to a wild-card playoff victory over the defending NFC champion Eagles.\n\nEagles: 9\n\nBuccaneers: 32\n\nFirst quarter\n\nBuccaneers field goal (10:02) — Chase McLaughlin, 28 yards\n\nBuccaneers TD (5:47) — David Moore, 44-yard pass from Baker Mayfield (Chase McLaughlin extra point\n\nSecond quarter\n\nBuccaneers field goal (14:03) — Chase McLaughlin, 54 yards\n\nEagles field goal (11:31) — Jake Elliott, 47 yards\n\nBuccaneers field goal (5:35) — Chase McLaughlin, 48 yards\n\nEagles touchdown (3:06) — Dallas Goedert, 5-yard pass from Jalen Hurts (two-point conversion attempt fails)\n\nThird quarter\n\nBuccaneers safety (2:16) — Jalen Hurt incomplete pass, intentional grounding penalty in end zone\n\nBuccaneers touchdown (1:19) — Trey Palmer, 56 yards from Baker Mayfield (Chase McLaughlin extra point)\n\nFourth quarter\n\nBuccaneers touchdown (5:42) — Chris Godwin, 23-yard pass from Baker Mayfield (Chase McLaughlin extra point)\n\nBuccaneers 32, Eagles 9: Baker Mayfield throws for third TD\n\nDagger.\n\nFacing a third-and-7 from the Philadelphia 23-yard line, Baker Mayfield dropped back and found Chris Godwin for his third touchdown toss of the game. It capped a 12-play, 83-yard drive that ate six minutes, 15 seconds off the clock.\n\nThe Buccaneers led 32-9 with 5:42 remaining in the game. The Philadelphia defense has allowed at least 25 points in seven of its last nine games; in four of those instances, the opposing team has scored more than 30 points. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles' hopes dim after turning ball over on downs\n\nThe Eagles have not scored in 21 minutes and time is ticking away for them to come back against the Buccaneers.\n\nPhiladelphia marched down the field and had Jake Elliott kick a 40-yard field goal, which he made. Tampa Bay’s Zyon McCollum committed an offsides penalty on the kick, which wiped out the three points and gave the Eagles fourth-and-five. Philadelphia decided to go for it.\n\nJalen Hurts took the snap and threw downfield to DeVonta Smith in the end zone. The wide receiver was covered by Carlton Davis III, who jumped up in front of Smith. The ball slipped through both of their hands along with Philadelphia’s hope for a comeback — for now.\n\nThe Eagles turned the ball over on downs with the score 25-9 and 11:57 left in the game. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nEagles have a quarter to save their season\n\nThe Eagles have 15 minutes to save their season. They didn’t do much in the previous 15 to stop that from happening.\n\nJalen Hurts committed an intentional grounding penalty in his own end zone, which by rule, is a safety. Two plays later, Bucs receiver Trey Palmer caught a short pass and zoomed half the field for another long Tampa Bay touchdown. Philadelphia’s inability to tackle was once again an issue on the play. The Eagles were 0-for-3 on third down in the third quarter but started the fourth on the Tampa Bay side of the field. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nBuccaneers 25, Eagles 9: Safety quickly leads to Tampa Bay TD\n\nThe Buccaneers are taking all the air out of the Eagles toward the end of the third quarter.\n\nAfter getting a possession from a safety, Baker Mayfield tossed the ball to the side and found rookie Trey Palmer. The receiver shook off a tackle attempt by Eagles cornerback James Bradberry and then scurried all the way downfield for a 56-yard touchdown. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nBuccaneers 18, Eagles 9: Jalen Hurts intentional grounding penalty leads to safety\n\nThe Eagles started with the football at their own 10-yard line on their third possession of the second half and went backwards.\n\nOn first-and-10, running back Kenneth Gainwell was tackled for a six-yard loss. Two plays later, Jalen Hurts held on to the football too long and was corralled in the end zone. Hurts tossed the football out of the end zone just before being tackled to the ground, but it was ruled intentional grounding. The play resulted in a safety since it took place inside the end zone. — Tyler Dragon\n\n'Bro, you did not invent (Omaha)': Bruce Arians appears on ManningCast\n\nFormer Buccaneers and Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians joined the “Manningcast” during the first half of the Eagles-Bucs matchup. A few highlights were:\n\nArians saying that when he coached Bucs head coach Todd Bowles at Temple University in the 1980s, the coach – then in his 30s – admitted “I didn’t know (expletive).”\n\nEli Manning asking Arians if he planned on talking to Peyton about the use of “Omaha!” in the Hall of Fame QB'’'s production company, Omaha Productions. According to Eli, it was Arians who invented the famous “Omaha” cadence both Mannings became famous for. Arians coached the elder Manning with the Indianapolis Colts as his first pro quarterback coach.\n\nThe broadcast showing photos of Arians from his days as a QB at Virginia Tech in the early 1970s.\n\n— Chris Bumbaca\n\nBuccaneers up a touchdown at halftime\n\nThe Bucs scored on four of their five drives and have a 16-9 lead at halftime.\n\nTampa Bay jumped out to a 16-3 advantage in the second quarter behind its passing attack. But the Eagles got within one score after Jalen Hurts found DeVonta Smith deep for a 55-yard catch. Philadelphia scored one play later.\n\nHowever, Philadelphia’s offense was stagnant for much of the first half. While the team’s poor pass defense reared its ugly head.\n\nBaker Mayfield has 174 passing yards and one touchdown in the first half.\n\nSmith leads the Eagles with four receptions for 111 receiving yards.\n\nBucs cornerback Jamel Dean and Eagles linebacker Nicholas Morrow have six tackles apiece. — Tyler Dragon\n\nJulio Jones evaluated for a concussion\n\nEagles wide receiver Julio Jones is being evaluated for a concussion, the team announced during their wild-card matchup. He was later ruled out of the game.\n\nThe All-Pro star was taken out of the game in the second quarter after being hit when he grabbed a catch from Jalen Hurts. He was initially pushed by Buccaneers cornerback Zyon McCollum and then pancake tackled by linebacker Lavonte David.\n\nJones was slow to get up and his teammate, tackle Jordan Mailata held him up.\n\nJones has three catches for 22 yards in the game. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nBruce Arians reflects on Temple coaching days on ManningCast\n\nBruce Arians, the retired NFL coach, made a guest appearance on the ManningCast and used some colorful language when recalling his coaching days at Temple in the 1980s.\n\n\"When I was a head coach, I was only 30 years old,\" Arians said. \"Man, I thought I knew everything. I didn’t know (expletive).\" — Josh Peter\n\nBuccaneers 16, Eagles 9: Eagles finally find end zone, then stood up on two-point try\n\nThe Eagles were desperate for a big play. Jalen Hurts and DeVonta Smith provided it.\n\nTrailing 16-3 and at their own 40-yard line, Hurts found a streaking Smith deep down the middle of the field for a gain of 55 yards. Now five yards from the end zone, the Eagles scored on the next play, a Dallas Goedert touchdown reception.\n\nThe Eagles attempted a normal extra point, but the Buccaneers jumped offside. Nick Sirianni put the offense back on the field for the two-point try via the Eagles’ patented “Tush Push.” The Tampa Bay defense stood Hurts up short of the goal line, however, and dragged the Eagles quarterback backward. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nBuccaneers 16, Eagles 3: Chase McLaughlin makes third field goal\n\nThe Buccaneers boosted their lead back to 13 with a field goal in the second quarter.\n\nBaker Mayfield made throws and ran for nine yards to get one of the first downs in the drive. Tampa Bay’s offense slowed when Eagles linebacker Zach Cunningham tipped a pass.\n\nOn fourth-and-5, Chase McLaughlin lined up and made the 48-yard field goal. — Victoria Hernandez\n\n‘Overreaction’? ESPN analyst pans Eagles’ mid-season coaching change\n\nAhead of the Eagles’ “MNF” game against the Seattle Seahawks on Dec 18, news of head coach Nick Sirianni’s decision to replace defensive coordinator Sean Desai with Matt Patricia as the play-caller on defense. The Eagles lost that game on a game-winning drive by Seattle backup QB Drew Lock that featured more than one blown coverage.\n\nThe Eagles’ defense had surrendered 42 points to the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys in back-to-back losses to start December. The Seattle loss was actually the least amount of points the Eagles allowed since Patricia took over.\n\nOn Monday against the Bucs, \"MNF\" analyst Troy Aikman said Sirianni’s decision to change coordinators at that point in the season was unwise.\n\n\"I thought it was an overreaction after a couple of losses,” Aikman said on the broadcast, “and it has not improved at all.\" — Chris Bumbaca\n\nBuccaneers 13, Eagles 3: Jake Elliott gets Philly on the board\n\nThe Eagles offense finally got something going on their third possession.\n\nJalen Hurts passed to wide receiver DeVonta Smith in the middle of the field for a 31-yard gain. The Eagles’ 45-yard drive stalled in Tampa Bay territory, but kicker Jake Elliott was able to convert a 47-yard field goal to make the score 13-3 early in the second quarter.\n\nThe 45-yard drive was by far Philadelphia’s best thus far.\n\nSmith has two receptions for 43 yards to lead Philly. — Tyler Dragon\n\nBuccaneers 13, Eagles 0: Chase McLaughlin hits 54-yard field goal\n\nThe Buccaneers have scored 13 unanswered points, the latest being a 54-yard field goal.\n\nTo start the second quarter, Baker Mayfield was sacked by Eagles defensive end Josh Sweat. He then threw an incomplete pass and Tampa Bay was left with fourth-and-13.\n\nChase McLaughlin nailed the kick to further the Buccaneers lead to 13-0 over Philadelphia. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nBuccaneers dominate first quarter\n\nThe Bucs dominated the opening quarter, much to the delight of the home crowd.\n\nTampa Bay has a 10-0 advantage at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe Bucs converted a field goal on their first drive and entered the end zone on their second possession.\n\nWide receiver David Moore has the game’s only touchdown thus far. Moore, who is celebrating his 29th birthday, had a nice 44-yard touchdown reception in the opening quarter.\n\nTampa Bay produced 178 total yards in the quarter compared to just 26 yards by a sluggish Eagles squad. The Bucs had 10 first downs in the first quarter, and Jalen Hurts and the Eagles were only able to pick up one first down. — Tyler Dragon\n\nBuccaneers 10, Eagles 0: Baker Mayfield, David Moore burn Eagles D for long TD\n\nThe Eagles’ secondary woes have shown up early.\n\nOn the Bucs secondary drive, Baker Mayfield passed to a wide open David Moore. Moore maneuvered by multiple Eagles defenders on the way to a 44-yard touchdown. Tampa Bay now has a 10-0 midway through the first quarter.\n\nMoore navigated by Philadelphia’s secondary easily on the touchdown catch and run.\n\nMoore’s playoff touchdown came on his 29th birthday. — Tyler Dragon\n\nEagles forced to punt on first series\n\nThe Eagles took the ball second in their wild-card matchup against the Buccaneers and didn’t quite go three-and-out, but were forced to punt quickly.\n\nAfter D'Andre Swift got a first down with two rushing plays, Jalen Hurts connected on two short passes. Then, a toss to Dallas Goedert was batted down by Buccaneers safety Antoine Winfield Jr.\n\nPhiladelphia was left with fourth-and-two and opted to kick the ball away. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nBuccaneers 3, Eagles: 0: Tampa Bay gets field goal on opening drive\n\nThe Buccaneers offense had little trouble moving the ball against the Philadelphia defense on its first drive.\n\nMike Evans had a 21-yard gain for his first catch of the game and the drive’s first game. Rachaad White had three carries for 19 yards.\n\nThe Tampa Bay drive stalled at the 10-yard line, however, and Chase McLaughlin converted a 28-yard field goal for the game’s first points four minutes, 58 seconds into the contest. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nFamous Eagles fan Rob McElhenney is watching from the Emmys\n\nPhiladelphia native and noted Eagles fan Rob McElhenney is stuck at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony on Monday night, but has found a way to watch his beloved NFL team.\n\nMcElhenney is most famous for his role in \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\" which he also co-created. McElhenney, along with actor Ryan Reynolds, are co-owners of the Welsh soccer team, Wrexham AFC, which has been covered on a documentary series, \"Welcome to Wrexham.\" — Jim Reineking\n\nWhat time is Eagles vs. Buccaneers?\n\nKickoff for Eagles vs. Buccaneers is set for 8:15 p.m. ET on Monday, Jan. 15.\n\nHow can I watch Eagles vs. Buccaneers?\n\nEagles at Buccaneers will be broadcast on ABC and ESPN.

Guests for Monday night's game include former NFL head coach Bruce Arians and Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Lewis.\n\nEagles at Buccaneers: Predictions, picks and odds\n\nThe Eagles are favorites to defeat the Buccaneers, according to BetMGM NFL odds.\n\nSpread: Eagles (-3)\n\nMoneyline: Eagles (-155); Seahawks (+130)\n\nOver/under: 43\n\nUSA TODAY Sports’ staff picks for this game:\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Eagles 25, Buccaneers 20 — Everything about Philadelphia’s recent play tells me this is not a pick to make, but I do think the Eagles will get right at some point. With the playoffs adding to the urgency of the situation and with the Buccaneers playing well, if unpredictably, I think the Eagles should rise to the task. The defense is still a concern but, simply put, the Eagles have a better roster.\n\n— Everything about Philadelphia’s recent play tells me this is not a pick to make, but I do think the Eagles will get right at some point.

The defense is still a concern but, simply put, the Eagles have a better roster. Tyler Dragon: Eagles 24, Buccaneers 20 — No playoff team has had a more dramatic plunge than the Eagles. Philadelphia’s lost five of its last six as they enter the postseason. They are struggling on both sides of the football. Although maybe the Eagles can tap into recent postseason success and the invaluable experience from last year. The Bucs are a well-coached team under Todd Bowles, but they are in the playoffs because somebody had to win the weak NFC South division.\n\n— No playoff team has had a more dramatic plunge than the Eagles.

Safid Deen: Buccaneers 26, Eagles 23 — Both teams have some experience getting to the Super Bowl recently, but the injuries are concerning here. Baker Mayfield (foot) was injured last week, while Eagles’ stars Jalen Hurts (hand, knee) and DeVonta Smith (ankle) are all questionable to play. Philly finished this season losing five of their last six games, and their run will mercifully end in Tampa Bay on Monday night.\n\n— Both teams have some experience getting to the Super Bowl recently, but the injuries are concerning here.

Victoria Hernandez: Eagles 24, Buccaneers 20 — This one took me a long time to mull over and ultimately I couldn’t pick against Jalen Hurts — yet. In the last six games, the Eagles have not shown any of the spark or grit that had them in contention for the NFC East crown and they’re dealing with plenty of injuries. This game might depend on Baker Mayfield’s health, but either way, I think the reigning NFC champions will their way to the win.\n\n— This one took me a long time to mull over and ultimately I couldn’t pick against Jalen Hurts — yet.

Jordan Mendoza: Eagles 20, Buccaneers 19 — What a difference a few weeks makes. For most of the season, this would be seen as another Philadelphia victory, especially since it already beat Tampa Bay earlier this season. But the free-fall will make this a much closer game. Still, the Eagles' defense can limit Baker Mayfield and company to pick up the road victory.\n\nWho will Eagles-Buccaneers winner play in divisional playoff round?\n\nAfter the Green Bay Packers upset the Dallas Cowboys and the Detroit Lions won their first playoff game in more than 30 years, that meant that the winner of Monday night's NFC wild-card playoff game would be going to Detroit for the divisional playoff round.\n\nThe seventh-seeded Packers will face the top-seeded San Francisco 49ers on Saturday (8 p.m. ET on FOX), while the Lions will host the Eagles-Buccaneers winner on Sunday (3 p.m. ET on NBC).\n\nMLK family members will be honorary Buccaneers captains\n\nMartin Luther King III, Arndrea Waters King and Yolanda Renee King will be special guests of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, as well as honorary team captains and participate in the pregame coin toss, for the wild-card playoff game against the Philadelphia Eagles, which is being played on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nIt will mark the first time that Martin Luther King III and his family have joined in the commemoration of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day at an NFL game.\n\n\"Having the King family in attendance to celebrate the remarkable legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on this special evening is an honor and a privilege,\" Buccaneers co-owner Darcie Glazer Kassewitz said in a statement. \"The work being done by the Martin Luther King III Foundation is truly inspirational and aligns with the Buccaneers social justice mission to effect meaningful and positive change through purposeful dialog and impactful programs.\"\n\nAll six of the NFL's wild-card playoff games featured MLK and Be Love decals on player helmets, as well as end zone stencils with \"It Takes All Of Us\" and \"Be Love.\" — Jim Reineking\n\nAll is not OK in Bird Land.\n\nEntering December, the Eagles were 10-1. They were the defending NFC champions. They had lost four times dating back to the start of the 2022 season.\n\nFive weeks later, and the fifth-seeded Eagles – who dropped five of their final six games to relinquish the NFC East crown – are unrecognizable from that previous form as they face the fourth-seeded Buccaneers in the NFC wild-card round. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles vs. Buccaneers inactives: A.J. Brown is out\n\nEagles wide receiver A.J. Brown (knee) will miss Monday night's playoff game against the Buccaneers. Brown was hurt during the first quarter of last week’s loss to the New York Giants.\n\nBrown led the Eagles in receptions (106) and receiving yards (1,456), while also scoring seven touchdowns. Brown — who didn't practice all week — had nine catches for 131 yards in the Eagles’ September win over the Buccaneers.\n\nBuccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield (ankle/ribs) had been questionable heading into the game, but will start for Tampa Bay.\n\nEagles' inactive players:\n\nQB Tanner McKee\n\nWR A.J.

The team has appeared in four Super Bowls (including last season's), winning one (Super Bowl LII). Prior to the Super Bowl era, the Eagles won three NFL championships (1948, 1949 and 1960). Philadelphia is in the playoffs for the third consecutive season.\n\nBuccaneers' playoff history\n\nThe Buccaneers are 11-11 all-time in playoff games. The team has won both of its Super Bowl appearances (Super Bowl XXXVII and Super Bowl LV). Tampa Bay is in the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season, the longest such active streak in the NFC.\n\nEagles vs. Buccaneers playoff history\n\nThe Eagles and Buccaneers have some shared playoff history. Monday night will mark the sixth time that these two teams have met in the postseason.\n\nMost recently, the Buccaneers defeated the Eagles in a wild-card game during the 2021 season. The most important playoff showdown between the Eagles and Buccaneers was the 2002 NFC championship game, which was won by the Buccaneers.

And it’s disturbing,” said McLaurin, a 28-year IRS veteran who works out of the agency’s Philadelphia office.\n\nThe uncertainty caused by the shutdown has left many workers anxious, confused and frustrated, said Ryan Baugh, a furloughed statistician in the Office of Immigration Statistics in the Department of Homeland Security and a steward for the American Federation of Government Employees union.\n\n“We just don’t know when it will be over, so we don’t know how to plan,” Baugh said. “Should we cut back? Should we start looking for other jobs? Should we apply for unemployment?”\n\nSteve Reaves, a furloughed fire safety official for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said his wife works as a sales manager in the private sector and started taking on extra hours in early December so they could pay their mortgage in the event of a shutdown.\n\n“She didn’t get to spend as much time with the family during the holidays,” said Reaves, who lives in Arlington, Texas, and is president of AFGE Local 4060.\n\nBecause FEMA is part of the Department of Homeland Security, furloughed employees can’t get moonlighting jobs without approval from their supervisors, Reaves said.\n\n“The problem is the managers have been furloughed,” he said. “It’s like a catch-22. You can’t go out and get a new job to make ends meet.”\n\nMcLaurin, too, is worried about making the next mortgage payment on the house she shares with her college-aged daughter.\n\nOn Thursday, she boarded a bus with nearly 100 employees out of the Philadelphia IRS office and traveled to Washington to rally near the White House with other displaced federal workers represented by the National Treasury Employees Union.\n\nOn the same bus was Horatio Fenton, a contact representative for the IRS who lives in Lumberton, N.J. After decades of paying his bills on time, Fenton is worried about making his utility and mortgage payments as well. Soon he’ll be filing for unemployment for the first time since he joined the federal government 25 years ago.\n\n“We’ve had furloughs before, but I’ve never had to file for unemployment because it was always assumed it would be short term and you’d be back to work,” Fenton said. “But this one’s a little different. Both sides are dug in, and we’re paying the cost for that. I’m not sure if there’s an end to this.”\n\nIn Washington, Democrats and Republicans profess empathy with the impacted workers.\n\n“These families, many of them veterans, are not able to meet their mortgage payment, their rent payment, their car payment, harming their own credit ratings,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., placing the blame on Trump for triggering the shutdown with his demand for funding to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump’s insistence on $5.7 billion in border wall funding has been the main sticking point in a budget standoff that led to the government shutdown.\n\nThe president “doesn’t appreciate the role of public policy in the lives of the American people,” Pelosi said.\n\nFor his part, Trump said earlier this week that he can relate to the pain of federal workers who can’t pay their bills. But, “I’m sure that people that are on the receiving end will make adjustments,” he said. “They always do.”\n\nThe billionaire president’s words ring hollow to McLaurin and other federal employees.\n\n“He says a lot of things, but he doesn’t have real accountability for what he says,” she said. “How can you relate when you’ve been born with so much?”\n\nFBI agents added their voices to the thousands of federal employees Thursday calling for an end to the government shutdown, asserting that the bureau's diminished resources put national security and investigative operations at risk.\n\nAn estimated 5,000 of the bureau’s 35,000 agents, analysts, lawyers and other personnel have been furloughed, limiting support for some surveillance and laboratory operations, said Thomas O'Connor, president of the FBI Agents Association.\n\nWith the agency and the rest of the federal government facing the prospect of missing a paycheck Friday, O'Connor said the burden could weigh most heavily on agents who are required to meet their financial obligations to maintain security clearances necessary for their work.\n\n\"Financial security is national security,\" O'Connor told reporters, adding that the ongoing shutdown was \"entering uncharted territory\" as the longest suspension of government operations in history.\n\nIn a petition to lawmakers and other government leaders, the agents’ group said the personal financial disruption \"could even disqualify agents from continuing to serve in some cases\" because of the potential damage to their clearance status.\n\nFEMA workers also are “freaked out” that their security clearances could be in jeopardy, Reaves said.\n\n“They are afraid that because they are not able to pay their bills in a timely manner, it will affect their (security) clearance investigation,” he said. “And if it affects their clearance investigation and they can’t get a clearance, they lose their jobs. I can’t appeal that. I can’t take that to court.”\n\nOther employees who continue to work without pay include thousands of air-traffic controllers at the Federal Aviation Administration and tens of thousands of checkpoint screeners at the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nEven before the shutdown, the number of air-controllers had dropped from a peak of 11,753 in 2012 to 10,483 in September 2018, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a union representing the workers.\n\n“Overtime in the form of six-day weeks and 10-hour days is common at many of the nation’s busiest and most short-staffed facilities, including radar facilities in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, and Dallas,” said Paul Rinaldi, an air-traffic controller who is president of the union.\n\n“And none of the controllers forced to work during this shutdown will see pay for their hard work to keep travelers safe until the shutdown ends,” Rinaldi said. “This shutdown must end now.”\n\nTwo unions representing federal workers – AFGE and the National Treasury Employees Union – have filed suit, arguing that the government is violating federal law by forcing some employees to work without pay during the shutdown.\n\nThe affected workers could eventually get back pay once the shutdown is over, but that’s not guaranteed since it would require an act of Congress.\n\n“People feel like they are caught between a rock and a hard place,” Baugh said, adding that many believe they are being used as leverage in a political battle that has nothing to do with their jobs.\n\n“There’s a real sense of disbelief,” he said. “People never thought this would go on this long.”\n\nMore:Exclusive: Pentagon preparing options to build border wall as Trump weighs emergency declaration\n\nMore:Government shutdown: Pelosi says Trump prefers 'soap opera' over serious negotiations\n\nMore:'I live paycheck to paycheck': Federal workers rally for their jobs at White House", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/highschool/sports-awards/2022/08/01/usa-today-high-school-sports-awards-winners-include-cade-klubnik/10161840002/", "title": "USA Today High School Sports Awards winners include Cade Klubnik", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nStar Texas High School quarterback Cade Klubnik repeated as national Offensive Football Player of the Year during the 2022 USA TODAY High School Sports Awards show, which debuted July 31.\n\nKlubnik wrapped up his career at Westlake High School with three Texas 6A state championships and zero losses.

And while his slugging stats were through the roof — he batted .570 with 65 hits and 13 home runs — it was his willingness to step in as a pitcher that helped propel Wesleyan to Georgia’s Class A Private state title. It was Druw's first high school championship ring and Wesleyan's first in seven years.\n\nFinalists: Gabe Escobedo, Miami High School (Arizona), senior; Colin Sahlman, Newbury Park High (California), senior\n\nBOYS TEAM OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Newbury Park High School (California) boys cross country\n\nWhy they won: Led by two pairs of brothers — the Sahlmans and the Youngs — Newbury Park blasted state and national records on their way to high school cross country lore. The Panthers swept the top four spots and scored a state-record 16 points at California’s large-school Division I championship meet, their team-time of 73 minutes, 23 seconds a runaway course record. They set their sights even higher entering the Garmin RunningLane Nationals in Huntsville, Alabama, hunting the national individual 5K record time of 14 minutes, 10 seconds. Three of Newbury Park’s runners wound up decimating that mark, which had stood for 20 years. Sahlman, a senior, was the pack leader, finishing in a national-record time of 14-minutes, 3.29 seconds. Close behind were twin brothers Leo and Lex Young, who both finished in 14 minutes, 5 seconds. Those times have high school cross country historians calling the 2021-22 Newbury Park High School cross country team the greatest of all time.\n\nFinalists: Saint Mary’s Prep (Michigan) Baseball; Westlake High School (Texas) football\n\nGIRLS TEAM OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Lake Creek High School (Texas) softball\n\nWhy they won: Behind unflappable junior pitcher and slugger Ava Brown, Lake Creek was perfect in every sense of the word during the 2022 season — just the school’s third year of varsity competition. On their way to a 41-0 season and No. 1 national ranking in the USA TODAY Super 25, the Lions outscored their opponents 337-33. Their 19th shutout of the season, a 7-0 rout of Georgetown, clinched the Texas 5A state title and the first softball championship in school history. The catalyst was Brown, a Florida commit who fired a 1-hitter with no walks and eight strikeouts in the state game. Head coach Michell Rochinski deployed another star junior in leadoff hitter Maddie McKee, who hit .511 at the plate and tormented opposing pitchers with 77 stolen bases. But there were many standouts in the Lions’ relentless lineup that combined to club 29 home runs, 16 triples and 71 doubles. With only three total seniors on the 2022 roster, Lake Creek will look to build on its current stretch of 79 wins in 81 games.\n\nFinalists: Marymount High School (California) girls volleyball; Hazel Green High School (Alabama) girls basketball\n\nPLAY OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Jaren Kanak, Hays High School (Kansas), senior\n\nWhy he won: Recruited by the University of Oklahoma to play linebacker, it was Kanak’s bulldozing highlight on a designed quarterback run that went viral during a game against Maize High School in November.\n\nKnown for his elite speed on the football field, Kanak ran the 41st best time in the nation in the 100 meter dash during the spring track and field season. He proved he packs plenty of power, too, during the high school football season in November. He trucked not one, but five different defenders and broke through one final tackle on his way to a jaw-dropping, 61-yard touchdown on a designed quarterback run.\n\nFinalists: Diego Leon, Dowling Catholic High School (Iowa), senior; Maci Neely Cameron High School (West Virginia), freshman\n\nCOURAGE AWARD\n\nRecipient: Tate Myre, Oxford High School (Michigan), junior\n\nWhy he won: Myre was one of four Oxford students who died after being shot in the school by a fellow student on Nov. 30. Several students said they saw Myre, a standout football player and wrestler, running in the direction of the shooter while others ran out of the school.\n\n“Knowing Tate, knowing how he was raised, he’s the kind of kid that wouldn’t think about it twice,” said Ross Wingert, who coached Myre in football and wrestling. “And he’s gonna do it.”\n\nJuniors are rarely made captain, but Myre was a rare athlete and teammate. He was an immediate standout and was brought up to the varsity as a freshman. Oxford coach Zach Line is determined to make sure Myre will never be forgotten, especially the courage he displayed in the final moments of his life.\n\n“Next year is going to be interesting, but I think Tate will be with us,” Line said. “Eventually we’ll learn to walk with Tate and not have a cloud over our heads, which I think will give this team a lot strength.”\n\nSPECIAL OLYMPICS ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\nRecipient: Kamari Graham, Homestead Senior High School (Florida), sophomore\n\nWhy he won: Graham not only has an intellectual disability, but at a young age suffered injuries from a firework accident that left him without his left hand. A participant in Special Olympics since attending Homestead Middle School, Graham participates in multiple sports and was instrumental in the team winning an FHSAA state championship in Unified flag football. He then helped Homestead become a two-time national champion, catching a key touchdown pass in the semifinals of the 2022 USA National Games in Orlando. Homestead represented Florida at the Games and brought home a gold medal. Graham is also a leader in the classroom, serving as Vice President of his school's Unified Club.\n\nBOYS RISING STAR OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Dee Lockett, Stillwater High School (Oklahoma), freshman\n\nWhy he won: Months before his first high school wrestling match, Lockett delivered a pair of statement wins at the U15 National Championships. He outscored his opponents 51-8 in the Freestyle tournament and was named Outstanding Wrestler, leaving with a pair of national titles. Lockett rode that momentum into his first high school experience, winning the prestigious Ironman Tournament in Ohio. He capped his stellar debut season by claiming Oklahoma’s 6A state championship at 145 pounds, beating a junior and senior on his way to the final. He’ll enter an anticipated sophomore season with a top-10 national ranking at 152 pounds by FloSports.\n\nMore:Meet the nominees for All-USA Today HSSA Boys Rising Star of the Year!\n\nFinalists: Cameron Boozer, Columbus High School (Florida), freshman; Bryce Underwood, Belleville High School (Michigan), freshman\n\nGIRLS RISING STAR OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Joyce Edwards, Camden High School (South Carolina), sophomore\n\nWhy she won: The Camden High School girls basketball team has a new career points leader in Edwards, who surpassed the 2,000-point milestone as a sophomore while leading Camden to South Carolina’s 3A state game. The top-ranked basketball recruit in the Class of 2024, Edwards saw her first varsity games as a seventh grader and this year averaged 23.8 points, 12.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game. With Division 1 college basketball offers rolling in, including Oregon and Oregon State, Edwards will be a name to watch in 2023 and beyond.\n\nMore:Meet the nominees for All-USA Today HSSA Girls Rising Star of the Year!\n\nFinalists: Jaloni Cambridge, Ensworth School (Tennessee), sophomore; ZaKiyah Johnson, Sacred Heart Academy (Kentucky), freshman\n\nBOYS TEAM COACH OF THE YEAR, SPONSORED BY MUNICIPAL\n\nWinner: Vito Campanile of Bergen Catholic High School (New Jersey) football\n\nWhy he won: Coaching at a school where football state championships are the expectation, not the goal, Campanile earned his first ring as head coach at Bergen Catholic behind a 12-0 season. It was the football team’s first perfect season in 24 years. The Crusaders finished the year with a resounding win over Don Bosco in New Jersey’s Non-Public A state game. They finished No. 3 in USA TODAY’s final Super 25 poll, behind only California prep power Mater Dei and Texas Class 6A powerhouse Westlake High. Few give their programs the kind of personal investment as Campanile, who was named a finalist for the All-American Bowl’s Coach of the Year honor and is always quick to deflect credit from himself to his players, especially his seniors.\n\nFinalists: David Peavy of Duncanville High School (Texas) boys basketball; David Zimmerman of Conestoga High School (Pennsylvania) boys soccer\n\nGIRLS TEAM COACH OF THE YEAR, SPONSORED BY MUNICIPAL\n\nWinner: Tamika Dudley of Sidwell Friends School (Washington, D.C.) girls basketball\n\nWhy she won: Dudley’s basketball program scored a hat trick this postseason — winning three separate tournament championships on its way to a 30-0 season. The Quakers’ postseason haul included a national title at the inaugural State Champions Invitational in Tampa, Florida, and dominant performances in both the Independent School League and D.C. State Athletic Association championship games. With her program now firmly established as a national powerhouse, Dudley won the prestigious Naismith Coach of the Year Award, considered among the highest honors in prep and college basketball.\n\nFinalists: Sue Butz-Stavin of the Emmaus High School (Pennsylvania) field hockey; Valorie McKenzie of Horizon High School (Arizona) girls volleyball", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/ud/2023/09/12/zach-marker-injury-may-affect-delaware-qb-depth-for-saint-francis/70816666007/", "title": "Zach Marker injury may affect Delaware QB depth for Saint Francis", "text": "Delaware's No. 2 quarterback Zach Marker has been used regularly through the Blue Hens' first two games.\n\nIf Delaware needs a second quarterback this week, it may have to be somebody else.\n\nMarker walked off the field at Beaver Stadium Saturday with his right arm in a sling and bandages looped over his shoulders after Delaware's 63-7 loss to Penn State.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2023/03/24/the-outsiders-cast-now-tulsa-oklahoma-ponyboy-c-thomas-howell-matt-dillon-tom-cruise-ralph-macchio/70038079007/", "title": "Oklahoma film 'The Outsiders' 40 years later: Where is the cast now?", "text": "\"The Outsiders\" served as a kickstart for several future A-list actors, including C. Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio, Matt Dillon, Diane Lane, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise.\n\nIt had its theatrical release on March 24, 1983, and was directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola and is based on S.E. Hinton novel.\n\nThe home where the movie was filmed was restored by Danny Boy O'Connor, formerly of the hip-hop group House of Pain. Several celebrates have taken tours at The Outsiders House Museum, including Leonardo DiCaprio, the band Green Day and \"The Outsiders\" author and Tulsa native S.E. Hinton.\n\nHere is a look at where the cast of \"The Outsiders\" are now:\n\nC. Thomas Howell: Michael 'Ponyboy' Curtis\n\nHowell stars as Ponyboy Curtis, a bookish greaser who can quote Robert Frost.\n\nHe is most known for his roles in \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,\" \"Red Dawn,\" \"The Hitcher\" and a recurring role as a serial killer in \"Criminal Minds.\"\n\nNearly 41 years after he journeyed to Tulsa to star as Ponyboy Curtis in the 1983 film \"The Outsiders,\" Howell maintains strong ties to the Sooner State — and a deep love for the iconic movie that supplied just the second role of his almost lifelong acting career.\n\n\"I get how some people might feel like, 'Hey, dude, let go of the Ponyboy thing and move on.' I hope I'm never that way. I hope I'm never jaded that way. I love and respect 'The Outsiders' so dearly, and the children come to me and have so many questions,\" Howell said in a phone interview. \"I feel I have a bit of responsibility to the piece in itself, just to respect and to honor it. It would be wrong not to, so I'm grateful for the duty.\"\n\n'It's a special place':Howell shares love for Oklahoma ahead of release of restored 'Outsiders'\n\nMatt Dillon: Dallas Winston\n\nDillon stars as Dallas Winston with blue eyes \"blazing ice, cold with a hatred of the whole world.\"\n\nDillon also starred in the film \"Rumble Fish,\" also set in Oklahoma.\n\n\"Rumble Fish\" follows a low-level street thug (Dillon) who is trying to live up to his older brother's (Mickey Rourke) reputation. The movie was shot at various locations throughout Oklahoma, but mostly in Tulsa. It is also directed by Coppola and based on Hinton's novel of the same name.\n\nDillon was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Sgt. John Ryan in the 2005 film \"Crash.\" The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing.\n\nHis works also include \"There's Something About Mary,\" \"The House That Jack Built,\" \"Wild Things\" and \"You, Me and Dupree.\"\n\nCinematic classics: Several iconic films have been made in Oklahoma in the past 100 years\n\nRalph Macchio: Johnny Cade\n\nMacchio stars as Johnny Cade, a \"dark puppy that has been kicked too many times.\"\n\nHe went on to to have a breakout role as Daniel LaRusso in the 1984 film \"The Karate Kid.\" He would reprise his role for \"The Karate Kid Part II\" and \"The Karate Kid Part III.\" He would also reprise the role in 2018 for the series \"Cobra Kai.\"\n\nHe also published a memoir \"Waxing On: The Karate Kid and Me\" in 2022. The book traces the rise of Macchio after the original film's 1984 release.\n\n\"The book is always tied into the Daniel LaRusso of it all, ‘The Karate Kid’ journey of it all,\" Macchio tells USA TODAY. \"Even though I talk about ‘The Outsiders’ and ‘My Cousin Vinny,’ and my life and my wife and kids here and there, and the '90s that got a little dry for me after the '80s success.\"\n\n'It was magic':Ralph Macchio talks 'Cobra Kai,' relationship to Pat Morita in 'Waxing On'\n\nPatrick Swayze: Darrel 'Darry' Curtis\n\nSwayze starred as Darrel Curtis, oldest brother to Ponyboy.\n\nHe went on to star as Johnny Castle in “Dirty Dancing,” as Sam Wheat in “Ghost” and as Bodhi in “Point Break.”\n\n\"Dirty Dancing\" was a cultural phenom that grossed $218 million at the global box office and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life,\" sung by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes.\n\nSwayze died of pancreatic cancer at age 57 in 2009.\n\n“You’re only on this planet for so long,” Swayze says in a 2019 documentary. “You could be dead tomorrow, go for it now.”\n\nGrab your tissues: 5 Patrick Swayze moments in the new documentary that'll give you all the feels\n\nRob Lowe: Sodapop Curtis\n\nLowe starred as Sodapop Curtis, the second oldest of the Curtis brothers.\n\nIn 1982, Lowe was relatively unknown in Hollywood. But now, he's most known for his roles in \"9-1-1: Lone Star,\" \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"The West Wing\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire.\"\n\n\"I had my 18th birthday here, on the set of 'The Outsiders,'” Lowe told The Oklahoman and The Associated Press in 2017.\n\n“Tulsa is where it all started for me,” he said. “I didn't go to college, I went to Tulsa. I left home and this is where I came. I did the movie here and I did a movie after that and a movie after that and a movie after that and that brought me to where I am today.”\n\nLowe also has a podcast, \"Literally! With Rob Lowe,\" where he interviews celebrities and friends such as Oprah Winfrey, Chris Pratt and LeVar Burton.\n\n'People want the real':Rob Lowe on his new podcast, binge-watching and '9-1-1: Lone Star'\n\nEmilio Estevez: Keith 'Two-Bit' Matthews\n\nEstevez stars as Two-Bit Matthews, a greaser and Steve Randle's bestfriend.\n\nEstevez would go on to star in many '80s films such as \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Young Guns\" and \"St. Elmo's Fire.\" He is the son of actor Martin Sheen and brother to Charlie.\n\nIn 2021, Estevez stepped back into his role of Gordon Bombay for \"The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,\" a revival of the '90s movie franchise now streaming on Disney+.\n\nDecades later, Estevez, remains fond of his role. \"I never had a coach like Bombay,\" he says of the \"compassionate father figure.\"\n\n\"I wish I did. And I think that's probably why people connected with the character as they did.\"\n\n'The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers':Emilio Estevez's surly Bombay is 'a guy who's given up'\n\nTom Cruise: Steve Randle\n\nCruise stars as Steve Randle, a greaser and Sodapop's best friend.\n\nCruise is most known for his roles in the films \"Top Gun,\" \"Jerry McGuire,\" the \"Mission: Impossible\" movie franchise and \"The Last Samurai,\" to name a few.\n\nHe also starred opposite Dustin Hoffman in the 1988 film \"Rain Man.\" The movie was filmed in El Reno, Guthrie and other Oklahoma locations. It won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor for Hoffman and Best Director for Barry Levinson.\n\nCruise has received the following Academy Award nominations: Best Actor for \"Born on the Fourth of July\" and \"Jerry Maguire,\" Best Supporting Actor for \"Magnolia\" and Best Picture for \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\n\nHe was recently honored with a career achievement award at the 34th annual Producers Guild of America Awards.\n\n\"I was certain this was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life,\" Cruise said, recalling that he studied the movie-making process. \"I was overwhelmed by what I didn’t know.\"\n\nProducers Guild Awards honor Tom Cruise, give top prize to 'Everything Everywhere All At Once'\n\nDiane Lane: Sherri 'Cherry' Valance\n\nLane stars as Cherry, a Soc Cheerleader.\n\nLane has a long list of credits including \"Unfaithful,\" \"Under the Tuscan Sun,\" \"A Streetcar Named Desire,\" \"A Walk on the Moon,\" \"Man of Steel,\" \"Inside Out\" and \"Rumble Fish.\"\n\nLane was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for the film \"Unfaithful.\"\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola: Director\n\nCoppola and Hinton co-wrote the screenplay to her 1975 novel \"Rumble Rish\" on his days off from filming \"The Outsiders.\" The director made the movies back to back in Tulsa.\n\nWith \"The Outsiders,\" Coppola was able to cast the cream of the crop of Hollywood's young actors, whom he famously auditioned in groups, trying different combinations to get the right dynamic.\n\nHe said he decided to make the film adaptations of Oklahoma author Hinton’s novels after receiving a letter from a class of schoolchildren and their teacher, who said “The Outsiders” was their favorite book and the youngsters had elected him to make a movie of it.\n\nCoppola has been nominated for 55 Academy Awards and has won a total of 5. He won Oscars for \"The Godfather,\" \"The Godfather Part II,\" \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Bram Stoker's Dracula.\"\n\nSome of his works include: \"The Godfather,\" \"The Godfather Part II,\" \"The Godfather Part II,\" \"Apocalypse Now,\" \"The Rainmaker,\" \"Jack\" and \"Rumble Fish.\"\n\nRemaining cast:\n\nWhat is 'The Outsiders' about?\n\nThe 1967 coming-of-age novel received an equally iconic adaptation directed by Coppola.\n\nThe film takes place in Oklahoma in the 1960s and features rival teen gangs: the Socs, short for Socials and the Greasers.

That structure helped keep commissions higher than they would otherwise be, the lawsuit alleged. It also meant a seller had to pay the agent representing the other side of the deal, a practice many observers thought was inappropriate.\n\n“So much of the industry doesn’t make sense from a common sense point of view,” said Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow with the Consumer Federation of America, who’s been advocating for realtor commission changes for decades. “The key argument was it’s just not fair for sellers to pay both the listing agent and the buyer’s agent.”\n\nNow, a seller will need to decide whether, and how much, to pay a buyer’s broker. Whatever the decision, that information can no longer be included in what’s known as the “multiple listing service” or MLS, the official real estate data service used by local realtor associations.\n\nWhatever the seller decides about compensation may, however, be communicated personally by phone or text, or advertised by social media, a sign on the lawn, or other informal means.\n\nBuyers, meanwhile, will be required to sign an agreement with their own broker before starting to view homes. The buyer and the agent must agree, and put in writing, how much the agent can expect to receive from the buyer.\n\nThere's some latitude on what exactly that means. A recent explanation of the rules from the National Association of Realtors says it must be \"objective (e.g., $0, X flat fee, X percent, X hourly rate) – and not open-ended (e.g., cannot be 'buyer broker compensation shall be whatever the amount the seller is offering to the buyer').\"\n\n“Any time we have the opportunity to have a conversation with the consumer about the value that we bring to the transaction, the services that we’ll be able to give to them in what is likely one of the largest financial transactions of their lives, and that we expect to get paid for it which is entirely negotiable, that’s a good thing,” said National Association of Realtors President Kevin Sears.\n\nThe group is a powerful Washington lobby with more than 1.5 million member agents – about 85% of the real estate agents in the country.\n\n“The more the consumer is educated and empowered, the more conversations we have with consumers, the better off everyone will be,” Sears said.\n\nMany elements of the new practices are familiar to many real estate agents, buyers, and sellers. Many states have long required buyers to sign a broker agreement before starting the process. The rise of alternative brokerage models, such as Redfin, means many homeowners are aware they have options beyond the typical method of paying 3% to a listing agent and 3% to a buyer’s agent.\n\nBut questions about what the changes will mean in practice are stymying agents across the country. What happens if a buyer has the money to compensate her broker up to a certain amount, but falls in love with a home that would cost more than the commission would work out to? On the flip side, what happens if it turns out that the seller of a particular home is also willing to compensate a buyer’s broker?\n\nMany real estate agents say a process that was meant to bring transparency is just creating more confusion.\n\n“Now a buyer’s agent has to reach out to every listing they’re going to show to figure out what the commission is,” said Aaron Farmer, owner of Texas Discount Realty in Austin.\n\nIn Austin, where a booming pandemic market turned sharply, leading to unsold inventory piling up, Farmer thinks it’s only natural that sellers will want to compensate buyer’s brokers, as a deal sweetener. That may not be the case everywhere, however, and Farmer also worries egos may get in the way of smart business decisions in some transactions.\n\nAndi DeFelice, owner of Savannah, Georgia-based Exclusive Buyer’s Realty, thinks first-time buyers stand to lose the most from the rule changes. Many who are already strapped for cash may have trouble also coming up with the money for the commission, forcing them to negotiate on their own, she thinks.\n\n\"Don’t force our clients into a situation where they have no representation in the biggest transaction in their lives,” DeFelice said. “If you’ve never done it before, it’s not easy. There are so many steps to buying a house. Do you know a good termite inspector, a good insurance agent, a good lender? There are so many aspects to the transaction.”\n\nDeFelice says she’s confident the industry will move past what she calls the “hiccup” of the Saturday deadline and adapt relatively quickly, but others expect bigger changes ahead.\n\n“For consumers, things are not going to change much in the immediate future,” Brobeck told USA TODAY. \"But it’s like a dam that’s springing a leak. I’m fairly confident that within five years the industry will look quite different.”\n\nFarmer, of Texas Discount Realty, agreed.\n\n\"I'm already seeing a lot of people saying, 'I’m going to get out of the industry, I don’t want to deal with the changes,'\" he said. \"The way I’ve always looked at it is if there’s fewer agents, it helps the industry. You could drop commission rates that way and do more volume.\"\n\nAndrea Riquier covers the housing market.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2024/03/28/real-estate-nar-settlement-home-buyers-sellers-commission-win/73070096007/", "title": "I'm a Realtor. NAR settlement may not be as good for home buyers ...", "text": "Emily Ross\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nOne of my favorite \"Modern Family\" episodes depicts the hilarity and nonsense of a real estate agent’s daily life as Phil Dunphy rattles off deed restrictions and the proper pronunciation of the word \"Realtor\" (real-TOR).\n\nA registered trademark of its originator, Realtor is a title only real estate agents who pay membership to the National Association of Realtors (NAR) are allowed to boast.\n\nToday, after more than 10 years as one myself, the “Realtor” prestige has lost its allure.\n\nJust when it felt like NAR was bouncing back after a sexual harassment scandal in 2023, we real estate agents and brokers now find ourselves in the aftermath of this month’s multimillion dollar NAR settlement.\n\nWhile I am nervous about what these NAR settlement changes mean for my residential real estate business and community, I am pleased that we’re all turning our eyes and ears to a company whose pockets have gotten too big and too dark for too long.\n\nBut enough about NAR.\n\nBrokers, their agents and our local associations are scrambling to decide how to restructure serving residential buyers fairly without undervaluing our work. It feels a bit like a bomb just went off, and we’re running up to each other screaming, “Can you hear me talking? Are you talking? What are we going to do about this?!”\n\nWe have only until mid-July to figure it out.\n\nHere’s what we know now: Buyer broker compensation is no longer allowed to be included on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS). And buyers are now required to sign a Buyer Representation Agreement, which includes the buyer broker’s compensation.\n\nReal estate agents are worth it. So how do we get paid?\n\nBuyer services are harder and more unpredictable, I think, than seller services (even in a buyer’s market!). Some buyer clients take years to find a property, while others take only a few weeks.\n\nThe stories we agents could tell would make anyone roll with laughter or cry – probably both. Being a real estate agent is like a reality TV show. How will we divide our whole job into billable hours? Billable tasks?\n\nAs an agent, I’m not only giving advice about market data and negotiating terms for sale. I’m also an on-call therapist, a babysitter, an interior designer, a cleaner, an exterminator … agents gladly do an endless list of tasks for our clients. Just ask your favorite agent what she keeps in her car for emergencies!\n\nOne thing I can predict with much certainty: Buyers will have to do more work to buy a property in the future. Private tours will be less common and replaced by 3D tours, video tours and open houses. Buyers might also have to meet with their inspectors, contractors and others without their agent.\n\nMaybe buyers really will do it all themselves without losing money.\n\nBuying a house?Don't go it alone. A real estate agent can make all the difference.\n\nIf you’re hoping to buy in the next three months, my recommendation would be to close by July 1. Most first-time homebuyers have no idea what has happened or how it will affect their ability to negotiate.\n\nIn the past week, I’ve had to explain the NAR settlement to every friend, neighbor and client outside the industry. I can only tell you that we’re all racing to get it figured out by the time it does affect everyone.\n\nNAR settlement explained: How will this impact home sellers and real estate prices?\n\nSeller-paid buyer broker commissions were created with equitable rights to good representation in mind. Specifically, so that first-time buyers could afford to have a fair negotiation, instead of being swept under the rug by a seller’s agent signed to protect the seller (a law in most states).\n\nMy heart breaks for those sellers who were swindled into commissions. As much as I’d like to blame NAR, this error is also on agents, brokers and local boards who clearly violated our ethical code. It’s maddening to watch agents and brokers feed right into the stereotype that real estate agents are lazy and just in it for the biggest paychecks.\n\nSo, who will pay the buyer’s agent now, and how will this affect home prices?\n\nReal estate prices:Will home prices fall after Realtor lawsuit settlement? You shouldn't count on it.\n\nIt’s commonly acknowledged that the 5-6% sales commission was “baked into” the sales price. Investor agents and builders have been using low-to-zero percent buyer broker commissions as leverage for years.\n\nWhile I do think that 5-6% sales commissions will be a thing of the past, there is a chance that sellers will find a way to simply advertise buyer broker commissions through a different medium. This compromise walks a fine line with the new restriction.\n\nSeller-paid “buyer credits” is my favorite idea bumping around. Buyer credits would be offered on the listing, and could be distributed as the buyer sees fit at the closing table. The buyer could use the funds for themselves, their broker or both.\n\nIf buyers are responsible for the buyer broker commission on top of other purchasing costs, the sales prices will have to come down. Lower sales prices should not affect the sellers' net proceeds in this instance, since the sales price deficit should roughly mirror the now absent buyer broker’s commission.\n\nIn short, even though most sellers think they should be celebrating now, these new rules probably won’t affect sellers much, if at all, once the dust settles.\n\nWhat does the NAR settlement mean for buyers?\n\nGone are the “Let’s go tour this house for fun!” days.\n\nA signed Buyer Representation Agreement is now required before a property showing. This has always been best practice. For some states this will be a big change.\n\nFor example, I usually complete a buyer consultation and one or two property tours before requiring a buyer’s agreement. I do this to be sure we’re a good match for each other. A successful client-agent squad requires a lot of trust and a common communication style.\n\nTake the tours off the table, and I think things will get awkward. Now I spend one hour with a potential buyer and then prompt, “So do you trust me to guide you through your biggest life purchase? Sign here.” I’m sure thankful many of my clients are referrals.\n\nHow will the commission change impact real estate agents in 2024?\n\nThe part-time agents and small brokerages will likely diminish over time, which will either be great or horrible for the industry. Agents will have to do more with less, and our 60 to 70 hour work week will feel impossible without high sales volume.\n\nOnce in escrow, the brunt of the work usually lands on the buyer’s agent, too. If there are more transactions without buyer’s agents, then the seller’s agent will have to pick up the slack.\n\nI often joke that as a 1099 real estate agent, I’m either overpaid or underpaid on each property. Still, my annual income mashes up into a worthwhile sum despite the work-life balance.\n\nWithout that 2-3% buyer’s commission propping up half my income, I am not sure the 11:30 p.m. phone calls, 6 a.m. texts, missing my daughter’s basketball game for an impromptu showing, and never having paid time off or maternity leave will be worth it.\n\nMaybe I ought to go back to copywriting.\n\nIt feels like most brokers and Realtor associations are strategizing how to make the buyer agent obsolete with new technologies. I think they’re focusing on the wrong solution, but that’s a story for another day.\n\nEmily Ross has been a real estate agent in Austin, Texas, for 10 years and a writer for much longer. Her background is in copywriting and editing, and she holds a master’s degree from Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/natural-gas-ban-preemptive-laws-gop-climate/index.html", "title": "Natural gas bans: 20 states have laws that prohibit cities from ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn 2019, the city council in Berkeley, California, held a stunning vote: it would ban natural gas hookups in all new building construction to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the city’s impact on the climate crisis.\n\nNo gas furnaces in new homes, the council said. No gas stoves or ovens.\n\nOther progressive cities followed suit with similar bans. San Francisco passed its own ban in 2020. New York City became the largest US city to pass a version in 2021, with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowing to pass a statewide law that would ban natural gas by 2027.\n\nBut other municipalities looking to take similar action are running into a brick wall. Twenty states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called “preemption laws” that prohibit cities from banning natural gas.\n\nIt’s bad news for municipal climate action: Taking natural gas out of the equation and switching to electric appliances is one of the most effective ways cities can tackle the climate crisis and lower their emissions, multiple experts told CNN.\n\n“Natural gas bans are kind of low-hanging fruit,” said Georgetown Law professor Sheila Foster, an environmental law expert. Foster said cities can make a significant impact by moving away from natural gas and toward electricity, especially considering what little federal action there’s been on climate, and the mixed record of states.\n\nThe climate stakes are high. Residential and commercial emissions made up 13% of total US emissions in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 80% of those emissions came from the combustion of natural gas, the fuel that heats homes or powers a restaurant’s cooking stoves, and emits planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide in the process.\n\nBut clean alternatives exist: Electric heat pumps can heat homes more sustainably than gas furnaces; induction ranges can replace gas stoves. And experts stress that to fully transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, homes and businesses need to operate on electricity – not gas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which fizzled in the Senate after objections from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, contained billions in tax incentives to help consumers switch to cleaner ways of heating their homes. But people who own and rent homes in big, multi-unit buildings depend on developers and city planners to make the switch.\n\nAdvocates worry these preemptive bills could stall impactful climate action at a critical time.\n\n“We’re afraid that’s going to have a chilling effect on cities that want to take action,” said Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, a building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Many cities and towns have small staffs, they don’t want to be taken to court, being seen as going outside state law.”\n\nA ‘new trend’\n\nIn November, a GOP bill to block natural gas bans in new buildings was passed in North Carolina but ultimately failed to make it into law when Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it. Two more similar bills are being considered in Pennsylvania and Michigan this year.\n\n“To me that’s what’s interesting about this new trend, it seems like states are trying to eliminate the possibility before cities try to catch onto this,” Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law, told CNN. “The natural gas industry realized this was in the water a while ago and has been very aggressive in getting this passed.”\n\nThe American Gas Association, the natural gas industry’s powerful trade group, told CNN it lobbies at the federal level but isn’t directly lobbying in any state.\n\nBut many of the association’s members, including gas utilities, have gotten involved at the state level, according to an analysis by independent climate think tank InfluenceMap for CNN.\n\nInfluenceMap “found high levels of engagement on preemption bills within the power sector, including its key trade associations.” The American Gas Association and its members “appears to have played an early role encouraging these bills,” according to the analysis.\n\nThere’s also evidence that suggests the AGA is running the playbook for its members to lobby state lawmakers for the preemptive laws.\n\nIn audio of a private AGA call obtained by watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and shared with CNN, the AGA’s Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Sue Forrester discussed the group’s strategy modeling “preemptive legislation” in certain states.\n\n“We launched in partnership with Southwest [Gas]. Well, they launched it, but we were helping on the back end: Energy choice language in Arizona that was passed and signed by the governor at the beginning of the year,” Forrester said in the recording.\n\nWhen asked about Forrester’s comments, an American Gas Association spokesperson reiterated the trade association doesn’t get involved in state-level legislation.\n\n“Sue’s comments make it sound that way, and that’s unfortunate, but the American Gas Association is not set up with lobbyists on the ground in the states,” the spokesperson said, adding the “we” Forrester was referring to is “we as the industry and all who have an interest in gas.”\n\nCEO of the American Gas Association Karen Harbert told CNN in a statement that “AGA is educating policymakers at every level about the supportive policy frameworks necessary for natural gas and our infrastructure to help achieve our nation’s ambitious environmental goals.”\n\nWhile the AGA and other industry groups are messaging that they are advocating for more fuel choices for consumers, climate advocates say the preemption laws are having the opposite effect.\n\n“I’d say the industry has put decades of effort and resources into fine tuning their messaging to the American public – and they do it well,” NRDC’s Mejia Cunningham told CNN.\n\nSome cities in the US want to ban natural gas hookups in new homes and buildings, to reduce their fossil fuel emissions and meet their climate targets. Natural gas is primarly made of methane, an extremely potent planet-warming gas. Rosmarie Wirz/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nMost cities and towns in the US that are pursuing natural gas reforms are not shooting for stringent bans like what Berkeley passed – many are trying to find a middle ground that incorporate and encourage electrification and heat pumps as an alternative to gas.\n\nBroadly written state laws can discourage that transition, Mejia Cunningham said.\n\n“We don’t expect Berkeley to be the right model for most of America,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we should completely slash out a whole bucket of policies that could work for communities across America.”\n\nAn attempt to electrify gets quashed\n\nIn 2019, officials in Flagstaff, Arizona, were working on their city’s plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2030. Building emissions were an obvious target; the built environment is the largest contributor to Flagstaff’s greenhouse gas emissions, Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s sustainability director, told CNN.\n\nFlagstaff’s plan didn’t include an explicit ban on natural gas; instead, it said the city would promote “aggressive building electrification,” thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThat was still enough to get the attention of members of the Republican-controlled Arizona state legislature, which in 2020 passed a bill preventing cities and towns from passing their own natural gas bans.\n\n“It was a huge setback, in a nutshell,” Antonopoulos told CNN. “The state preemption threw a huge kink in our efforts towards carbon neutrality. This isn’t the first time the state has preempted things that have made us go back to the proverbial drawing table and figure out how we get creative and innovative in a space where we don’t have funding.”\n\nArizona’s 2020 law – the first natural gas preemption law of its kind – was a harbinger of what was to come. Since then, 19 other states have adopted them. These laws have largely been concentrated in red states in the Rust Belt and Southwest, a cluster of southwestern states including Utah and Wyoming, and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd currently, there’s not much favoring cities’ ability to sue states. The 1907 US Supreme Court case Hunter v. Pittsburgh favored states’ authority to craft laws for their cities, and gave cities little legal recourse to sue.\n\n“It’s not a very coherent line of case law, but that’s the official stance,” said Fox, who added she’d be very surprised if the current conservative Supreme Court majority allowed a challenge to the current law from progressive cities.\n\n“There’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” Foster said, adding that there’s not much current litigation to speak of around natural gas bans and preemption laws.\n\nIn Flagstaff, Antonopoulos said her office is trying to find ways around Arizona’s law.

One is set to be considered by the Sarasota County Planning Board on Aug. 19 and another will be on that board’s Sept. 2 meeting.\n\nCombined, the four proposals would see the addition of 560 hotel rooms and result in buildings as tall as eight stories, despite longstanding density and height limits imposed on the island.\n\nTopping residents’ fears is that approval of these hotels would open a floodgate for even more hotel development, adding to traffic woes and eroding Siesta Key’s distinct character that has helped its public beach win the title of No. 1 in America.\n\nPrevious coverage of Siesta Key Hotels:Sarasota County to press ahead with review of hotel proposals on Siesta Key\n\nFourth hotel to Siesta Key?:Could more hotels be coming to Siesta Key? Fourth developer submits proposal\n\nSiesta Promenade holds workshops:Siesta Promenade hosts workshops seeking rezone of two parcels in mixed-use development\n\nImposing scale\n\nThe four developments are proposed by Mike Holderness, Robert Anderson, Gary Kompothecras and Dave Balot.\n\nHolderness’ plan would transform Siesta Key Beach Resort and Suites at 215 Calle Miramar and 5311 Ocean Blvd. from the current 55-room hotel built in stages from 1942 to 1972 into a 170-room hotel with two floors of parking and three floors of hotel rooms.\n\nAnderson’s plan would create a 170-room, eight-story hotel in place of single-story buildings on roughly an acre of land near Siesta Key Beach Resort and Suites on Calle Miramar.\n\nThat project also calls for a 223-space parking garage, a restaurant and a rooftop pool and bar. Traffic is proposed to come and go along Calle Miramar. This project will be discussed at the Aug.19 planning board meeting.\n\nKompothecras’ plan would place a seven-story, 120-room hotel near Siesta Key’s south entry on Old Stickney Point and Peacock Roads, at the site of a restaurant that has been demolished. The proposed structure would sit on a little over one acre.\n\nBalot wants to build a 100-room hotel on a 2.15-acre parcel at a vacant bank building site at 5810 Midnight Pass Road. This structure would see two levels of parking below three floors of hotel rooms.\n\nCoalescing opposition\n\nMark Spiegel, president of the Siesta Key Coalition, had never been involved in any effort to stop a development, until hearing rumors about the potential hotels. He saw the plans and decided that something had to be done to stop “high density” hotels and prevent Siesta Key from turning into Clearwater or Fort Lauderdale.\n\nA little more than a year ago, Spiegel and a group of concerned Siesta residents formed the Siesta Key Coalition that has now incorporated into a nonprofit organization with the goal of stopping the proposed changes to zoning that would allow the hotels to be built.\n\nThe coalition now represents 70 neighborhood and condominium associations and more than 6,500 households on the key, Spiegel said.\n\n“I have yet to meet anyone on Siesta Key that does not oppose these upcoming hotel proposals,” he said.\n\nOne of the organization’s first acts: ordering 250 of the yard signs now adorning Higel Avenue. Demand for the signs exceeded supply, prompting an order for 250 more.\n\nSpiegel is a developer.\n\nHe has done senior living projects all over the country and he maintains that he isn’t against any hotel development – just any development that doesn’t comply with current regulations.\n\nHe’s raised issues regarding inconsistencies with how county staff have applied the current zoning codes to the projects, and was incensed after officials allowed one developer to withdraw a growth plan amendment after the developer’s lawyer contended that it was not needed.\n\nAnother of the projects has followed suit and also withdrawn a similar proposed amendment.\n\nA change to Sarasota County’s long-range growth plan would require an affirmative vote by four of the five county commissioners.\n\n“It would be comical if it wasn’t so serious,” Spiegel said. “I’ve never seen county staff work so responsive to developers instead of the community.”\n\nDan Lobeck, president of Control Growth Now, has lived in Sarasota for nearly 32 years and has been a frequent foe of development interests in the county.\n\n“I’ve never seen that strong of a coalescence of a community around a single issue,” he said of the effort to prevent hotel development on Siesta Key.\n\nLobeck figures the proposed developments could currently pass on a 3-2 vote.\n\nFollowing the golden rule\n\nDave Balot has proposed the most modest room count on the largest property of the four proposed hotel developments.\n\nThe Sarasota Herald-Tribune reached out to each of the developers or their representatives of these hotel projects and only Balot returned the phone calls.\n\nBalot lives in Sarasota and says he wants to be a good neighbor with any development that eventually moves forward.\n\n“I made it a point to reach out and speak to as many key people as I could, both in person and over the phone, to listen to concerns and answer as many questions as possible,” he said. “I want to treat people the way I would want to be treated.”\n\nHe said that since the county’s guiding regulations, through the Siesta Key Overlay District, were implemented roughly two decades ago, commercial development of the island has stopped.\n\n“There’s been no development and there needs to be,” he said.\n\nWhile Balot has proposed the Midnight Pass hotel development, he’s also a silent partner in the existing Siesta Key Beach Resort and Suites on Calle Miramar.\n\nHe said that if he and his partners demolished the 55-room property today, they could only build a 27-room hotel on the site using current zoning regulations.\n\nHe also says most, if not all, of the hotels on Siesta Key fail to meet current building requirements and federal guidelines for access by people with disabilities.\n\nBalot argues that the density he seeks at 100 rooms is the minimum economically viable given rising construction costs and the surge in real estate values.\n\n“The numbers simply do not work with keeping the current density limits,” he said.\n\nBalot also does not believe that hotels will significantly increase traffic, contending the traffic issues stem from Sarasota County’s growth and the increased attention Siesta Key has gained by being recognized as one of the world’s best beaches.\n\nHe argues traffic isn’t from commercial development on the island, but instead is people going to the beach.\n\n“I’m sorry, but Siesta Key is no longer a hidden, unknown beach and village,” Balot said.\n\nHotel demand\n\nThe underlying fundamentals for hotel development in Sarasota County are strong, said Jag Grewal, a partner in Ian Black Real Estate.\n\nGrewal is a commercial broker for a hotel that’s currently under contract in Sarasota.\n\nVisit Sarasota County reports that more than 1 million people visited the county from October 2020 to June 2021, spending more than $1 billion in the local economy.\n\nHotel occupancy rates have increased from 63.8% in June 2019 to 81.3% in June 2021. The average room rate has increased from $157.19 in June 2019 to $204.55 in June 2021.\n\n“I think there is currently a need for more hotel development,” Grewal said. “People are looking to buy hotels and people are looking to build hotels. The demand is here.”\n\nBut island residents feel one way to fight satisfying that demand with new and bigger Siesta hotels is to create Sarasota County’s newest municipality, so islanders can govern themselves.\n\nSave Siesta Key has held three public meetings since March on the topic and is nearing completion of a feasibility report that would have be be supported by state Sen. Joe Gruters and Rep. Fiona McFarland in the Florida Legislature for the idea to move forward.\n\nIf the group can convince the local state legislators that their idea could actually work, it would then have to be passed by the both the House and Senate, be signed by the governor and, finally, gain more than 50% of the registered island voters’ approval in a referendum.\n\nThe most recent municipality created in Florida is the village of Indiantown in Martin County, which incorporated in 2017. There have only been a dozen new municipalities incorporated in Florida since 2000.\n\nTracy Jackson, a board member of Save Siesta Key, said the organization has collected 1,166 signed petitions from registered voters on Siesta Key since the movement started in March.\n\nRick Munroe, a board member and owner of Sun Garden Cafe on Siesta Key, said the goal would be to have a “government lite” approach with as few as seven or eight employees. Other services like police and fire would be contracted out.\n\nBecause Siesta Key has such high property values, Munroe said that a proposed millage rate as low as 0.25 mills – or 25 cents for every $1,000 of taxable property value – would allow for funding the proposed government structure. Munroe said Siesta Key has $7.3 billion worth of real estate representing 11% of the entire county’s assessed property value.\n\nStill, the issue could be a tough sell in the Legislature. The fact that the idea has gotten this far is a barometer of residents’ frustration.\n\nJackson said the group has surveyed island residents and high density hotels top the list of concerns, followed by traffic and enforcing rules against hotel houses.\n\nSince she’s lived on Siesta Key, Jackson said she’s seen residents mobilize, but ultimately fail in opposing other issues. She points specifically to the dredging of Big Pass off Siesta Key and the approval for a 24-acre Benderson Development project near the key’s south entrance Stickney Point and U.S. 41.\n\n“So many people have organized to stop things,” she said. “I’m tired of watching Siesta Key lose.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/santa-rosa/2022/10/11/santa-rosa-county-apartment-complexes-ten-housing-projects-horizon/8138884001/", "title": "Santa Rosa County apartment complexes: 10 housing projects on ...", "text": "It's well established that Santa Rosa County is growing fast.\n\nCensus data indicates between 2010 and 2020, the population grew roughly 25% — from just over 150,000 residents to about 188,000 — and there is no indication that growth is slowing.

It led to an exoneration of a Manitowoc County man who spent 18 years in prison for a crime he did not commit.\n\nThen there was a murder and human remains found on the Avery property. Avery and his nephew were convicted of her murder. If you've watched the Netflix documentary, \"Making a Murderer\" here's your guide to key events that shaped the fate of Steven Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey.\n\nAug. 2, 1983: Gregory A. Allen suddenly comes up over the sand dunes along the Lake Michigan shoreline in Two Rivers and starts stalking a woman walking in front of him. He pulls his shorts down. begins masturbating and then lunges at the woman, who gets away. Allen later calls the woman twice at her home and asks her to drop the charges against him. The prosecutor against Allen is Denis Vogel. The charges were reduced from indecent exposure to disorderly conduct.\n\nJuly 17, 1985: The City of Manitowoc Police Department assigns officers to conduct daily surveillance on Gregory A. Allen. Allen was identified as a suspect in several complaints of prowling, window peeping, indecent exposure and sexual assault dating back to January of 1985 through July 14. \"He is a dangerous individual with a potential for violence,\" the report stated.\n\nJuly 29, 1985: On a hot summer day with temperatures in the mid 80s, Penny Ann Beerntsen is attacked around 3:50 p.m.while jogging alone along the Lake Michigan shoreline north of Two Rivers by a scraggly haired man in a leather jacket. The man pulled out a knife and forced her into a wooded area. He sexually assaults her, beats her and leaves her bloodied. At the hospital, Beernsten describes her rapist. Deputy sheriff Judy Dvorak makes a comment that the attacker sounded like Avery. Because of this statement, Manitowoc County Sheriff Tom Kocourek asks for Avery's photo to be included in a photo line up.\n\nFrom her hospital bed, the victim reviews nine photos. Avery's photo was in the middle. After she identifies Avery, the sheriff tells her he was going to arrest him. (The photo line up did not include her attacker Gregory Allen.)\n\nAug. 1, 1985: Beerntsen identifies Avery a second time after watching a live line-up of suspects assembled by the sheriff's office. (Allen, the real rapist, is not included in this line up.)\n\nDec. 14, 1985: Avery maintains his innocent. At trial, he produces 16 alibi witnesses. Receipts and employees at the ShopKo store in Green Bay confirmed Avery was inside the store at 5:13 p.m., - 75 minutes after the vicious rape occurred north of Two Rivers. Still, District Attorney Denis Vogel and Sheriff Tom Kocourek told sheriff's investigators they were convinced Avery raped Beernsten. The jury finds Avery guilty of attempted first-degree murder, first-degree sexual assault and false imprisonment.\n\nMarch 10, 1986: Manitowoc County Circuit Judge Fred Hazlewood sentences Avery to 32 years in prison.\n\nAug. 5, 1987: A Wisconsin appeals court rejects Avery's bid to overturn his convictions.\n\nSept. 23, 1996: Judge Hazlewood denies Avery's bid for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence that show scrapings taken from under the rape victim's fingernails did not contain Avery's DNA.\n\nAug. 5, 1997: An appeals court upholds Hazlewood's 1996 decision.\n\nApril 3, 2002: Hazlewood grants the Wisconsin Innocence Project permission to conduct new DNA testing, citing scientific advances made in DNA testing.\n\nSept. 10, 2003: The Wisconsin crime lab tests 13 hairs recovered from the victim back in 1985. None match Avery. One matches Allen, who is now serving a 60-year prison sentence in Green Bay for a rape that occurred in Brown County. Incidentally, a copy of the criminal complaint against Allen for the Aug. 2, 1983 beach incident was contained in Vogel's file for the 1985 case against Avery.\n\nSept. 11, 2003: Avery is freed from prison after spending 18 years locked away for a rape he did not commit. Back in society, Avery moves into a trailer near Two Rivers with a new girlfriend. He also works at his family's local salvage yard.\n\nSept. 19, 2003: Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager assigns the Wisconsin Department of Justice to investigate the Avery case.\n\nDec. 19, 2003: A DOJ report finds no basic for bringing criminal charges or ethics violations against those Manitowoc County Sheriff's officials and prosecutors involved in securing Avery's wrongful conviction.\n\nOct. 12, 2004: Attorney Walt Kelley of Milwaukee files a federal lawsuit in Milwaukee on behalf of Avery. The suit seeks $36 million from Manitowoc County, former sheriff Tom Kocourek of Two Rivers and former district attorney Denis Vogel of Madison. The lawsuit states that both men ignored Allen, who should have been their obvious prime suspect in the 1985 rape along the Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nOct. 11-13, 2005: Several Manitowoc County Sheriff's officials gave sworn testimony related to Avery's $36 million lawsuit against Manitowoc County. The group included Lt. James Lenk, Sgt. Andrew Colborn and Sheriff Ken Petersen. Avery's civil lawyers were weighing whether to add Lenk, Colborn or Petersen as co-defendants to their still-developing civil rights lawsuit against Manitowoc County. Petersen testified he decided there was no need to investigative his agency's role in botching the Avery rape case that put an innocent man in prison for 18 years. \"None of the people that were involved in the case in the investigative part were there.\" As the incoming sheriff, Petersen was alerted by his predecessor Tom Kocourek to a letter being kept in a small safe that helped validate Avery's wrongful rape conviction. \"There was a letter from some inmate from Brown County Correctional I believe that went in there. I don't know who, but he said that Steve (Avery) admitted to the crime, and I know the sheriff had left that when he left office,\" Petersen testified.\n\nOct. 31, 2005: Free-lance photographer Teresa Halbach of St. John in Calumet County, vanishes. That day, she had three appointments to photograph vehicles for sale for Auto Trader magazine. The Avery Auto Salvage was slated to be her last stop of the day.\n\nNov. 3, 2005: Tom and Karen Halbach report their 25-year-old daughter missing.\n\nNov. 5, 2005: Volunteer searchers discover Halbach's SUV inside the Avery Auto Salvage yard west of Mishicot, which was operated by Avery's brothers, Earl and Charles. Police impound Halbach's vehicle and take it to the State Crime Lab in Madison.\n\nNov. 6, 2005: As many as 200 police officers are combing the Avery salvage yard.\n\nNov. 8, 2005: On the fourth day of the investigation at Avery's, authorities find a number of clues to shore up their case targeting Avery for Halbach's murder: a spare key for Halbach's RAV4 is found on the carpet near Avery's bed by Manitowoc County sheriff Sgt. Andrew Colborn and Det. Lt. James Lenk; Halbach's missing license plates turn up inside an abandoned station wagon that had its windows broken out; a couple of charred human bones are spotted by Manitowoc County Sheriff's Sgt. Jason Jost near Avery's burn pile pit. Manitowoc and Calumet County authorities decide not to alert Manitowoc County Coroner Deb Kakatsch to the discovery of the human bones. No photographs or videotape is made showing where the human bones were found.\n\nNov. 9, 2005: Authorities arrest Steven Avery for being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n\nNov. 10, 2005: Calumet County Sheriff Jerry Pagel announces that Halbach was murdered at the salvage yard.\n\nNov. 15, 2005: Calumet County special prosecutor Ken Kratz charges Steven Avery with first-degree intentional homicide, mutilation of a corpse and possession of firearms by a felon. Kratz announces that Avery's blood was found inside of Halbach's vehicle and that Avery was the last person to see her alive.\n\nJan. 17, 2006: Avery pleads not guilty and insists he is innocent.\n\nJan. 19, 2006: An FBI laboratory determines that the remains found at the Avery salvage yard were Halbach.\n\nMarch 3, 2006: Four months after Halbach vanished, authorities arrest Avery's 16-year-old nephew Brendan Dassey as a co-conspirator. Dassey, the son of Avery's sister, is charged with being party first-degree intentional homicide, sexual assault and mutilating a corpse. Dassey had lived on the Avery family property near Mishicot.\n\nMarch 8, 2006: Special prosecutor Kratz also charges Avevy with kidnapping, false imprisonment and sexual assault with a dangerous weapon.\n\nDec. 20, 2006: Avery's defense attorneys Dean Strang of Madison and Jerome Buting of Brookfield find an 11-year-old vial of Steven Avery's blood inside an unsecured area of the Manitowoc County Clerk of Courts office. The downtown courthouse is next to the sheriff's Office. The vial was not sealed. It was inside an unsealed Styrofoam box, inside an unsealed cardboard box.\n\nJan. 29, 2007: As part a pretrial ruling, Manitowoc County Circuit Judge Patrick Willis dismisses two of the criminal charges against Avery, first-degree sexual assault and kidnapping.\n\nJan. 30, 2007: Willis rules that Avery's lawyers are free to tell the jury about the old vial of Avery's blood.\n\nFeb. 2, 2007: Willis denies a request by Avery's lawyers to delay the trial to allow testing on the 1996 sample of Avery's blood to bolster the defense's theory that Avery is being framed by the Manitowoc County Sheriff's Office for Halbach's murder.\n\nFeb. 9, 2007: A jury of Manitowoc County residents is seated to hear the Avery jury trial. The trial is held in Chilton at the Calumet County Courthouse. The trial included 19 days of testimony from 59 witnesses. Avery's lawyers contend that Manitowoc County sheriff's officers planted evidence against him in retaliation for a lawsuit Avery filed against the county seeking $36 million for the wrongful conviction. After being charged with murder, Avery settled the $36 million lawsuit for about $400,000. He needed the money to pay for private defense lawyers in Halbach's case.\n\nMarch 18, 2007: The Manitowoc County jury of six men and six women deliberate for nearly 22 hours over three days. The jury finds Avery guilty of intentional homicide and being a felon in possession of a firearm. The jury acquitted Avery of mutilation of a corpse.\n\nApril 25, 2007: A Dane County jury finds Dassey, then 17, guilty in the rape, murder and mutilation of Halbach.\n\nJune 1, 2007: Avery, then 44, is sentenced at the Manitowoc County Courthouse to life imprisonment with no chance for parole in connection with Halbach's death.\n\nAug. 2, 2007: Manitowoc County Circuit Judge Jerome Fox sentenced Dassey to life in prison but made him eligible for parole in 2048 after serving 41 years.\n\nAug. 24, 2011: Avery's murder conviction is upheld by the 2nd District Court of Appeals.\n\nJan. 30, 2013: A state Court of Appeals rejected a request from Dassey, Avery's nephew, to get a new trial.\n\nAug. 1, 2013: The Wisconsin Supreme Court denied Dassey's bid to review the case.\n\nDec. 18, 2015: Netflix releases a 10-episode documentary about Steven Avery called, \"Making a Murderer.\"\n\nJan. 8, 2016: Kathleen Zellner, a prominent suburban Chicago attorney, announces that she and Tricia Bushnell, legal director of the Midwest Innocence Project, will be taking over Avery's appeals in the hopes of overturning his conviction. Zellner notes that she has won exonerations for at least 16 other people who were wrongfully convicted.\n\nJan. 11, 2016: From prison, Avery files a motion seeking his release. Avery wrote that the \"true controversy was never tried\" and wrote how the search of his property on Nov. 5, 2005 was warrantless because multiple properties were searched. Investigators therefore collected evidence illegally, Avery argued.\n\nJan. 19, 2016: Manitowoc County Sheriff's Lt. Andrew Colborn sends an email berating a USA TODAY NETWORK reporter's ongoing coverage of the Halbach murder case. In 2005, Colborn was a sergeant during the murder investigation of Avery. Lawyers Jerry Buting and Dean Strang had accused Colborn and Lenk of planting and fabricating evidence to ensure Avery's conviction for Halbach's murder. \"I know the truth doesn’t sell newspapers as much as lies and controversy, but for once try thinking about the consequences of the slander and defamation that you are authoring and participating in. A word of caution, be careful what you wish for. If Steven Avery is ever freed, he may just become your neighbor, and he may want to bring his nephew with him,\" Colborn wrote.\n\nJan. 25, 2016: Kratz discloses he's in the process of writing a book because the voice of the murder victim, Teresa Halbach, has been forgotten. Kratz said he's grateful for the chance to tell the \"whole story.\" Avery's new appeals lawyer Kathleen Zellner tweeted a letter Kratz sent to Avery last year stating, \"the difference between you and famous convicted murderers from the past is they told their whole truthful story to someone who then wrote a book about what actually happened and people got to understand both sides. I was willing to help you do that ... if you change your mind and want to tell your honest story someday, please contact me.\"\n\nJan. 29, 2016: About 60 supporters of Avery and Dassey gathered outside the Manitowoc County Courthouse for a peaceful rally. The event lasted more than four hours despite temperatures in the teens. A few counter-protesters and several onlookers also showed up. The demonstrators chanted \"Manitowoc County take a stand. Don't imprison an innocent man.\" Their signs included: \"Poor people lose,\" \"Let's get even, Steven,\" \"Can't you see? Set Brendan Dassey free!\"\n\nFeb. 1, 2016: Earl Avery, Steven's younger brother, granted his first-ever media interview, with Access Hollywood's Stephanie Bauer after Friday's Dateline special. Earl contends his brother is innocent of Halbach's murder. \"And (investigators) say they cleaned up in the garage,\" Earl Avery told Access Hollywood. \"But there's dust and everything all over. How do you clean up and put the dust back?\" Halbach was last seen alive on Oct. 31, 2005. During the interview, Earl Avery said he drove right past the spot on the Avery Salvage Yard where the RAV4 was found five days later. \"It wasn't there on the 31st,\" he said.\n\nApril 4, 2016: Calumet County Sheriff's Lt. Mark Wiegert, one of the lead investigators on the case, declines to discuss specifics about the Halbach case in an interview with USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin, but says \"we stand by the integrity of the investigation. Mr. Avery was judged by a jury of his peers and was found guilty,\" Wiegert said. \"The case has been looked at ... by the appeals court and they have upheld everything that was done.\"\n\nMay 11, 2016: One of the \"Making a Murderer\" filmmakers, Laura Ricciardi, tells Time Out London that she and co-filmmaker Moira Demos has been talking to Steven Avery's post-conviction attorney Kathleen Zellner \"about the potential of filming with her and continuing to follow the story.\"\n\nJune 11, 2016: Nearly 50 people attend a weekend rally outside the Manitowoc County Courthouse in support of Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey. \"I don't know how people can sleep at night for doing this to my son,\" Dassey's mother Barb Tadych told reporters. People at the rally carried signs and chanted \"Free the innocent, jail the guilty.\"\n\nAug. 12, 2016: Federal magistrate William Duffin of Milwaukee, in a 91-page ruling, granted Dassey's petition for writ of habeas corpus. Duffin's ruling gave Wisconsin prosecutors 90 days to decide whether to retry Dassey or release him. Duffin criticized investigators Mark Wiegert and Tom Fassbender and the state courts that handled Dassey's case. Duffin determined that Dassey's constitutional rights were violated and found that investigators made false promises to Dassey during questioning. “Based on its review of the record, the court acknowledges significant doubts as to the reliability of Dassey’s confession,\" Duffin wrote. \"Crucial details evolved through repeated leading and suggestive questioning and generally stopped changing only after the investigators, in some manner, indicated to Dassey that he finally gave the answer they were looking for.”\n\nAug. 26, 2016: Kathleen Zellner, Avery's lawyer, made her long-awaited visit to the Manitowoc County Courthouse proclaiming \"We are going to get to the bottom of who killed Teresa Halbach.\" Amid a crush of reporters and onlookers, Zellner filed an inch-thick court motion to support her request for additional scientific testing on behalf of Avery. She said they are requesting to test dozen of items from the crime scene. Zellner said she thought her motion would be \"the most comprehensive testing motion ever filed in the state of Wisconsin and probably one of the most comprehensive motions ever filed in the United States.\" Zellner said the testing could be done within the next few months.\n\nSept. 26, 2016: The judge overseeing the post-conviction appeal of Steven Avery determined that she did not see the need to hold a status conference at the courthouse to discuss the case. The hearing had been requested by assistant attorney general Tom Fallon, one of the original prosecutors of Avery and Brendan Dassey. \"It is the court's understanding that the state needs a reasonable amount of time to locate and inventory the items which are the subject of the defendant's motion (for additional scientific testing) and to determine which items are covered by the April 4, 2007 order of Judge (Patrick) Willis,\" wrote Shebogyan County Judge Angela Sutkiewicz, who is overseeing Avery's case.\"As required by statute, the court is giving the state an opportunity to respond to the defendant's motion.\"\n\nOct. 3, 2016: Steven Avery's short-lived engagement to Lynn Hartman has officially ended, according to a letter sent by Avery's attorney Kathleen Zellner. \"Please let this letter act as formal notice that Mr. Avery terminated his engagement with you effective yesterday, October 2,\" Zellner wrote Hartman in a letter dated Oct. 3. Hartman appeared on two episodes of the \"Dr. Phil\" show professing her love for Avery. Hartman told television viewers that she accepted Avery's proposal for marriage before ever meeting him in prison. \"The more we wrote and talked, the more he told me that he truly did love me,\" Hartman told Dr. Phil McGraw.\n\nOct. 4, 2016: State prosecutors for Wisconsin filed court documents opposing Dassey's motion for release from prison. The Wisconsin Department of Justice argued it was in the interest of public safety for Dassey to remain in custody, citing the nature of his convictions. \"His release must be viewed as a serious threat to public safety, regardless of his recent conduct in a controlled prison setting,\" state prosecutors argued in its motion. Prosecutors also argued that the family of murder victim Teresa Halbach would be \"irreparably harmed\" by his release.\n\nOct. 19, 2016: The Wisconsin Department of Justice filed court documents arguing that Dassey's overturned murder conviction be reversed, contending that Dassey's confession in the 2005 murder was legitimate and voluntary. \"As Dassey's surprising confession started to come into full focus, the investigators guessed at details that seemed unlikely but would be hard to admit. After Dassey confirmed their guesses, the investigators returned to open-ended questions,\" lawyers for the DOJ argued.\n\nNov. 14, 2016: Federal magistrate judge William Duffin of Milwaukee issues a 17-page ruling ordering that Dassey be released from prison as the Wisconsin Attorney General's Office tries to appeal Duffin's August ruling that overturned Dassey's murder conviction. \"Dassey's family is concentrated in northeastern Wisconsin. There is no indication much less the means to flee or will otherwise fail to appear as may be legally required,\" Duffin wrote in his ruling. Duffin also determined that the Wisconsin Attorney General's Office did not have a strong likelihood of success in trying to reinstate Dassey's murder conviction on appeal, which is before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago.\n\nSources: USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin archives, Associated Press, public records", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/01/09/kentucky-legislature-general-assembly-bills-to-watch-2024/72014842007/", "title": "LIST: Here's the latest on bills in the 2024 Kentucky legislature", "text": "The 2024 General Assembly will help shape the future of Kentucky, with a two-year budget and several other key pieces of legislation set to be heard in Frankfort before potentially going into law.\n\nTo help you follow the action, we've assembled this list of noteworthy bills.

It was from the city of Milwaukee. The owner of the duplex where she lived had failed to pay taxes. The city was taking ownership of the property near 90th Street and Silver Spring Drive.\n\nThe news was jarring. Alexander, her husband, and son had rented the lower level of the duplex for 11 years. But city housing officials didn’t want the Alexanders to leave. They wanted them to buy the duplex.\n\nAfter thinking it over, the couple said “Yes.” Today, that decision to own instead of rent is paying off.\n\n“I’m saving a couple hundred dollars every month,” Phoebe told us. “It’s cheaper in the end. There are just so many great benefits to being a homeowner.”\n\nThis is a story of what’s possible in Milwaukee: the prospect of owning your own home while saving money at the same time. But it’s also a story about a new kind of home buyer in Milwaukee — one who has little in common with families like the Alexanders and is increasingly in competition with them.\n\nThe full consequences of the pandemic on Milwaukee’s housing market have yet to be felt. A predicted surge in evictions is almost certain to be one of them. But another trend worth watching is what some have characterized as a legal “land grab” — the acquisition of thousands of affordable city homes and duplexes by real estate investors who do not live in Wisconsin.\n\nPrevious research by Marquette Law School’s Lubar Center for Public Policy Research and Civic Education documented the plummeting number of owner-occupied residential properties in Milwaukee since the Great Recession. From 2005 to 2020, the owner-occupied percentage fell from 80% to 69% . Parts of the north and west sides saw declines double that.\n\nRELATED:Thousands of Milwaukee homes are no longer owned by city residents in a massive transfer of wealth since the Great Recession\n\nEqually noteworthy is who is buying these residential properties. A new breed of distant, investment landlord has emerged. Since 2005, the number of residential properties owned by out-of-state landlords has quadrupled, from 1,300 to 6,000. Most of the properties are single-family homes or duplexes.\n\nInitially, these out-of-state buyers mainly purchased properties that were recently owner-occupied. But when the number of foreclosures finally declined, the out-of-state landlords pivoted and began buying more properties from local landlords, often in bulk deals. Some are conventionally bank financed. Others are paid for strictly with cash. Most of the properties are valued at less than $100,000, often considerably less.\n\nThese are not the “flips” made famous by HGTV, where tens of thousands of dollars in improvements leads to profitable re-sales. A check of work-permit and property records for the last four years shows that out-of-state landlords applied for considerably fewer work permits than owner occupiers and even local landlords.\n\nInstead, these properties are used to produce a steady stream of income for distant investors, with landlords often charging rents hundreds of dollars higher than what it would cost for someone — with just a small down payment — to own the home. The result is that that for some who can least afford it, Milwaukee is a more expensive place to live.\n\nAs part of the Milwaukee Area Project at Marquette Law School’s Lubar Center, we compiled and analyzed public records and data with the hope of answering several key questions: Why are these out-of-state investors doing business in Milwaukee? Have they continued to purchase homes during the pandemic? And how do the costs of renting vs. owning compare?\n\nFirst, the backdrop. The Great Recession produced a nationwide housing reset. In the years following the housing crisis, Wall Street backed investment groups purchased large numbers of foreclosed properties in cities such as Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Las Vegas.\n\nDuring a program at the Law School’s Lubar Center last fall, we talked with the author of \"Homewreckers,\" journalist Aaron Glantz, who detailed the business model for these new housing investment LLCs. Glantz said they typically purchased newer homes in suburban areas with warm climates and significant job growth. And then they rented them, sharply raising monthly rents.\n\nMilwaukee offers a different spin on the housing-as-investment model. Investors buy older, inexpensive properties, hold them, and earn steady income from renting them.\n\n“You not only need to be worried about a land grab with homeowners losing their homes,” Glantz told us. “But you also need to be worried about mom-and-pop landlords, people who live in the community and have a stake in the community, losing their rental property and having it sucked up by people who live far away.”\n\nThe impact of the pandemic\n\nThe increasing number of out-of-state landlords in Milwaukee reflects a nationwide trend. Single-family home rentals are a rapidly growing business model. In Milwaukee, their number has more than doubled since 2005. Currently 18,800 single-family homes are being rented inside the city limits. About half are valued at $75,000 or less. About 5,000 homes are valued at $50,000 or less.\n\nFor now, ownership of Milwaukee’s rented single-family homes and duplexes remains diffuse, spread among many different owners. But there are signs of consolidation. We estimate that a decade ago, the top 10 landlords owned a total of fewer than 900 houses. Now they own more than 1,800. Part of that consolidation is being fueled by the growing presence of out-of-state landlords. Ten years ago, none of the 20 largest landlords in the city was from outside Wisconsin. Today, six are from out-of-state.\n\nOur analysis shows that one of every seven landlord-owned homes in Milwaukee is now owned by people living out of state, and that trend could accelerate further. Some smaller, local landlords have lost significant rental income during the pandemic and are now looking to sell their properties. Out-of-state investment funds often pay with cash.\n\nIn collaboration with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigative reporter Cary Spivak, we identified the nine largest out-of-state owners of houses and duplexes in Milwaukee. Again, these are landlords whose businesses are headquartered outside of Wisconsin. They include individuals from California, Texas, Ohio, and Illinois. Details about their operations can sometimes be difficult to discern, with investors often using multiple LLCs with different names for their acquisitions.\n\nThere are exceptions. Three of the most prolific buyers of residential properties in Milwaukee in recent years have polished websites, touting their business models and success.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the nine out-of-state landlords we identified owned 989 properties in Milwaukee, holding more than 1,500 units. They owned 670 single-family homes, 268 duplexes, 34 apartment buildings, and 17 other residential buildings, valued in total at $79 million. We estimate that in a normal year, city residents will pay these out-of-state landlords more than $16 million in rent. All the landlords entered the Milwaukee market after the worst of the housing crisis.\n\nFor this story, we took a closer look at five of the landlords.\n\nBulldog Ridge is led by a Chicago-area real estate investor and has a suburban Chicago mailing address. Along with a handful of associated LLCs, it owned 178 Milwaukee properties at the end of 2020, including 108 single-family homes, 54 duplexes, and 11 apartment buildings. Most of these properties are in the near south side, north side, and Sherman Park areas. The median price of the homes and duplexes owned by Bulldog Ridge is $57,400. Its lowest price home is valued at $21,600. Its most expensive is $187,800.\n\nMilwaukee Capital, along with sister company SCV Ventures, is led by a real estate investor based in Houston and Florida. Milwaukee Capital’s properties are found in some of the city’s most impoverished neighborhoods, primarily on the near north and near west sides. It ended 2020 with 115 properties in Milwaukee, including 66 single-family homes and 45 duplexes. The median value of the properties it owns is $42,050. That includes a home assessed at $2,800. Many of the properties had been owned by a real estate investment business once associated with former professional basketball player and Milwaukee native Devin Harris.\n\nSFR3, started by two technology company executives in the San Francisco area, began buying homes in Milwaukee in 2017. Along with an associated LLC, SFR3 owned 95 properties in the city entering 2021. Eighty-seven of those are single-family homes; eight are duplexes. SFR3 operates largely on the far north and northwest sides. Its median price house is valued at $89,700, but it owns homes ranging in value from $20,100 to $167,800. Its website touts “affordable homes for America’s workers,” and says its mission is “to renovate old houses in disrepair” and make them “like new.”\n\nVineBrook Homes is based in Dayton, Ohio, and was started by a successful venture capitalist. The company operates in other Midwestern cities, including Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Memphis. It began purchasing homes in Milwaukee in 2019, mostly on the west and northwest sides, using an LLC named “VB One.” It entered 2021 owning 250 properties: 235 single-family homes and 15 duplexes. The median value of its homes is $84,400, with its least valued property assessed at $33,400 and its most expensive valued at $201,800.\n\nAs the Journal Sentinel’s Spivak has reported, the economic fallout from the virus has caused both tenants and landlords to struggle. Property records indicate that most out-of-state investors we identified have paused their purchases of Milwaukee properties during the pandemic and subsequent eviction moratoriums. But several have continued to aggressively buy.\n\nRELATED:'Everyone is suffering': Landlords and tenants struggling alike in anticipation of $25 billion in rental assistance\n\nFrom mid-March to December 2020, VB One purchased 147 homes in Milwaukee with cash. It bought 29 in just the month of December. Virtually all the properties were on the north and northwest sides of the city. In one two-day period in early May 2020, VB One purchased seven single-family homes.\n\nFrom mid-August to December, SFR3 purchased 39 properties in Milwaukee. Most were single-family homes. Most were paid for in cash. On a website, a representative of SFR3 identifies himself as a “Cash Buyer for Milwaukee,” and writes, “I’ve been tasked with buying 20 house(s) per month. Please reach out if you have any properties that might work.”\n\nA fifth landlord, based in southern California, was also busy buying Milwaukee duplexes last year, most on the near north side. The investment firm, which purchased 95 homes last year, has acquired properties here using names including “Copper Kettle” and, more recently, “Residential Properties Resources Fund ll LLC (RPRF).”\n\nThe LLCs are connected to a real estate investment fund called Highgrove Holdings Management LLC, of Torrance, Calif., which maintains a website with an entire page describing investment opportunities in Milwaukee. The website states that the price of a property purchased for investment purposes, including rehabilitation costs, averages $35,000. Our data analysis shows the firm’s average property is worth $32,600.\n\nIn addition to promising investors “12%-18% returns annually,” Highgrove’s website says the firm “focuses on cleaning up communities where purchases are made. Focus will always remain on safety, clean environment and good service for our tenants.”\n\nThe website also describes Highgrove’s aspirations, saying, “Highgrove has been working closely with real estate professionals in Milwaukee to seek out and acquire properties in the area at discounted prices up to and in some cases exceeding 50% off of fair market value. The goal of HHM is to amass 1,100 properties in Milwaukee.”\n\nWhy Milwaukee?\n\nWhat makes investing in Milwaukee, an older Midwestern city with stagnant population growth, lucrative?\n\nFirst, thousands of homes in the city are valued at less than $100,000, in some cases much less. They are easily affordable to investors looking to buy. Second, in a normal year, they generally offer an excellent return on their investment.\n\nHow do we know that? While we have not seen balance sheets for out-of-state landlords, we created a model using publicly available records and data that help explain what's happening:\n\n• We estimated rents by collecting market-rate estimates of each property’s value. Our analysis found that these estimates typically vary from actual rental listings by 10 percent or less.\n\n• We estimated average management expenses by comparing the rates of eight local management companies to estimate a typical total management fee of 10.9% of rent. This includes tenant placement fees.\n\n• Based on a formula used by the real estate data firm CoreLogic, we estimate maintenance fees as 17.5% of rent and insurance as 0.35% of the assessed property value.\n\n•​​​​​​ We examined city records, to include taxes and assessments, but did not account for extra expenses such as legal fees and loan payments, which vary from landlord to landlord.\n\nUsing this model, we calculated potential financial returns for all nine of the larger out-of-state investors. We will focus on two of them.\n\nMilwaukee Capital, the Houston-based LLC, owns properties in some of the poorest sections of Milwaukee. From 2018 to 2020, it spent $4.3 million acquiring 115 properties in the city. Those properties are now assessed at $4.8 million. Most were acquired in bulk, bank-financed purchases. The company’s history of accumulating building code violations at a pace five times the citywide average for landlords suggests it has invested little in rehabbing its properties.\n\nIf Milwaukee Capital charges market value rates for its units and matches the citywide occupancy average, that would bring in $1.7 million each year. Subtract estimated management expenses of $182,000, property taxes of $124,000, maintenance costs of $291,000, and insurance premiums of $17,000 and you would have net annual revenue of approximately $1.1 million. That is, in just one year, 25% of the amount spent to purchase these properties. Again, this represents a more typical, non-pandemic year.\n\nThe leading out-of-state buyer of Milwaukee residential properties in recent years has been VB One, which lists a Dayton address. In 2020, it purchased 173 houses. No one else bought more than 95.\n\nIn less than two years, VB One has spent $21 million acquiring 250 properties currently assessed at a total of $21 million. Charging market-rate rents at the city’s occupancy rate would bring in annual gross revenues of $3.4 million. We estimate property management expenses of $369,000, property taxes of $554,000, maintenance costs of $590,000, and insurance premiums of $74,000, leaving net revenue of $1.8 million, or 8.7% of the entire amount spent to purchase these properties. All were paid for with cash.\n\nAs of June 2020, VineBrook reported an average rehab cost of $16,000 per property across its entire portfolio. Assuming it invested the same amount in Milwaukee would lower its profit rate here to 7.2% of its total investment. VineBrook Homes is a vertically integrated real estate firm that provides construction and property management services in-house, likely for a lower cost than that of local contractors.\n\nThe advantages of owning vs. renting\n\nWhat also makes Milwaukee lucrative is that rental rates for cheaper properties remain relatively high. We compared annual rent to total property value for residential properties owned by out-of-state landlords. For properties under $100,000, we found only a small relationship between home values and rents. Typical rent for a $40,000 single-family home is only about 10% cheaper than rent for an $80,000 house.\n\nAccording to Mike Gosman, the president and CEO of the nonprofit Acts Housing in Milwaukee, owning instead of renting is a better deal for many low- to moderate-income working families.\n\n“The math is very compelling. A lot of people are just unaware of the fact that they might be able to save $300 or $400 a month through homeownership,” Gosman said.\n\nIn the last year, Acts has helped more than 160 low- to moderate-income families purchase homes. The nonprofit provides services needed to transition from renter to homeowner, including home-buyer counseling, its own real estate agents, and guidance for repair projects. In addition, Acts is often the lender, with an active portfolio of 100 loans made to families fixing up and purchasing distressed homes.\n\n“Typically, families who purchase one of the distressed homes have total costs of $650 per month,” Gosman said. “It is very common for us to have families spending $900, $1,000, $1,100 a month to rent. And frankly, they’re renting places that are not decent.”\n\nGosman’s estimate of savings is supported by data analysis done for this story.\n\nWe estimated ownership costs by assuming a 5% down payment, a mortgage with an annual percentage rate of 4%, and a 30-year loan. We included other ownership costs of $1,000 a year: homeowner’s insurance, 1% private mortgage insurance, property taxes at 2.6%, city utilities at $200 per quarter, and monthly maintenance expenses calculated as 17.5% of the housing unit’s total rent.\n\nOur analysis found a dramatic difference between ownership and rental costs. We estimate that the average renter of a $75,000 single-family home pays about $227 more a month than it would cost to own the property. And the average renter of a $50,000 home pays $360 more per month than it would cost an owner with normal expenses.\n\nGosman said there is huge demand from working families to fix up and purchase homes, but he acknowledged there are challenges that must be overcome.\n\nPhoebe Alexander, whom we met earlier, knows those challenges first-hand.\n\n“I always wanted to buy a house,” she said. “But we knew there were some things in our past that we needed to clean up financially. We kept asking ourselves, how are we going to do this?”\n\nThe Alexanders had gotten into financial trouble when Phoebe had not one, but two jobs eliminated through corporate downsizing. While she said the purchase price for their northwest side duplex was “very reasonable,” the property required more than $30,000 in repairs. The couple also needed a down payment.\n\nIt took nearly five years of working with Acts Housing for the Alexanders to repair their credit history, save money, and become eligible for financing. Finally, in July 2019, the Alexanders’ perseverance paid off. They closed on their property. Now in their 50s, with steady jobs, the family is living their version of the American Dream.\n\nGosman told us that the Alexanders’ story illustrates the obstacles that often stand in the way of ownership. Families may have debt and credit issues or not enough money for a down payment. That can discourage institutions from lending. Other families are simply living on the margins. Previous Lubar Center reporting found median income for Black households in Milwaukee is just $30,000 a year.\n\nRELATED:By one key measure, household income, metro Milwaukee is worse off than it was in 1980\n\nStill, Gosman said many issues can be resolved through financial counseling. Of his organization’s 100 outstanding loans, only 1% are delinquent, even during the pandemic.\n\nBut the growing presence of out-of-state investors has created another challenge.\n\n“This is the most competitive market for low- and moderately-priced homes that our organization has ever seen,” he said. “It means that every single additional entrant in the market is competition for our families, who are not in a position to make cash offers.”\n\nOur analysis did not look at the impact of these purchases on Milwaukee neighborhood values or at how properties are maintained. On their websites, the investment groups say they are meeting a need for single-family rental housing.\n\nBut at last fall’s housing program at the Lubar Center, Milwaukee Common Council President Cavalier Johnson expressed concern that out-of-state ownership can make it harder to address issues with a troubled property. “That ultimately affects the stability and cohesiveness of neighborhoods, and that’s trouble,” Johnson said.\n\nCity Development Commissioner Lafayette Crump told us that Milwaukee is not alone in seeing a growing number of out-of-state landlords. With interest rates at historically low levels, he said individuals are seeking alternatives for investment.\n\nCrump said that out-of-state landlords and investment funds still own only about 5% of the city’s single-family homes and duplexes. He said the increased out-of-state investment is “worth keeping an eye on but not necessarily a cause for alarm at the moment.\n\n“We do believe local ownership is important and that people who live in and have a vested interest in the city are more likely to do a good job of being responsible owners,” Crump said.\n\n“We do not want to cede portions of the city to external investors or control.”\n\nThe city is taking steps to increase and maintain owner-occupancy, Crump noted. That includes working with local partners, including emerging developers and nonprofits, to provide city-owned properties, financial resources, and support for the development of one- and two-family properties. Some will eventually be turned over to homeownership.\n\nCrump said that when the city sells properties, preference is given to owner-occupiers. It is about to launch a pilot program that does the same for existing city homeowners interested in buying properties near their home.\n\nCrump said Mayor Tom Barrett’s 2021 budget also includes a new down payment assistance program. “Our goals in this area are not only to increase owner occupancy, but to preserve it,” Crump added.\n\nGosman’s organization hopes to help 220 more families purchase homes this year and plans to lend an additional $2 million, almost doubling its portfolio. Still, creating awareness of what is possible remains a challenge.\n\n“The biggest obstacle is that people just don’t believe that homeownership can be for people like them,” Gosman explained.\n\nPhoebe Alexander agreed.\n\n“I think there are more people out there that would love to own homes, but they need help in getting started,” she said.\n\nAs she described her home’s most recent improvements, Alexander’s excitement spoke to one of the key differences between local and long-distance home ownership. For her, it’s more than just a financial investment. It’s personal.\n\n“I told my husband I don’t want anything for Christmas because I’ve got my stainless-steel sink,” she said. “You can make a house your own. That’s what I love about it. When I turn the key, I’m turning the key to my home.”\n\nEpilogue\n\nVineBrook Homes continued to expand rapidly in the early months of 2021. In early February, it announced the acquisition of 1,866 more single-family homes across “seven new markets in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.” From January through mid-March, it purchased about 90 more houses in Milwaukee. SFR3 and Highgrove Holdings have also continued their Milwaukee acquisitions, though at a slower pace than VineBrook.\n\nMike Gousha is a distinguished fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University Law School.

Theranos promised patients the ability to test for conditions like cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. She attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, a board of well-known political figures, and key retail partners.\n\nBut a Wall Street Journal investigation poked holes into Theranos’ testing and technology, and the dominoes fell from there. Holmes and her former business partner, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, were charged in 2018 by the US government with multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. (Both pleaded not guilty.)\n\nHere are the highlights of the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos.\n\nMarch 2004: Holmes drops out of Stanford to pursue Theranos\n\nHolmes, a Stanford University sophomore studying chemical engineering, drops out of school to pursue her startup, Theranos, which she founded in 2003 at age 19. The name is a combination of the words “therapy” and “diagnosis.”\n\nSeptember 2009: Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani joins Theranos as Holmes’ right-hand man\n\nBalwani joins as chief operating officer and president of the startup. Balwani, nearly 20 years her senior, met Holmes in 2002 on a trip to Beijing through Stanford University. The two are later revealed to be romantically involved.\n\nSeptember 2013: Holmes opens up about Theranos; announces Walgreens partnership\n\nA decade after first starting the company, Holmes takes the lid off Theranos and courts media attention the same month that Theranos and Walgreens announce they’ve struck up a long-term partnership. The first Theranos Wellness Center location opens in a Walgreens in Palo Alto where consumers can access Theranos’ blood test.\n\nThe original plan had been to make Theranos’ testing available at Walgreens locations nationwide.\n\nSeptember 2014: Holmes named one of the richest women in America by Forbes\n\nHolmes is named to the magazine’s American billionaire list with the outlet reporting she owns a 50% stake in the startup, pinning her personal wealth at $4.5 billion.\n\nElizabeth Holmes speaking onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt on September 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California.

It counts Oracle’s Larry Ellison among its investors.\n\nJuly 2015: Theranos gets FDA approval for Herpes test\n\nThe FDA clears Theranos to use of its proprietary tiny blood-collection vials to finger stick blood test for herpes simplex 1 virus – its first and only approval for a diagnostic test.\n\nOctober 2015: Theranos is the subject of a Wall Street Journal investigation; Holmes hits back\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports Theranos is using its proprietary technique on only a small number of the 240 tests it performs, and that the vast majority of its tests are done with traditional vials of blood drawn from the arm, not the “few drops” taken by a finger prick. In response, Theranos defends its testing practices, calling the Journal’s reporting “factually and scientifically erroneous.”\n\nA day later, Theranos halts the use of its blood-collection vials for all but the herpes test due to pressures from the FDA. (Later that month, the FDA released two heavily redacted reports citing 14 concerns, including calling the company’s proprietary vial an “uncleared medical device.”)\n\nOne week after the Journal report, Holmes is interviewed on-stage at the outlet’s conference in Laguna Beach. “We know what we’re doing and we’re very proud of it,” she says.\n\nHolmes speaking at a Wall Street Journal technology conference in Laguna Beach, California on October 21, 2015. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAmid the criticism, Theranos reportedly shakes up its board of directors, eliminating Henry Kissinger and George Shultz as directors while moving them to a new board of counselors; the company also forms a separate medical board.\n\nNovember 2015: Theranos and Safeway partnership falls short\n\nSafeway, which invested $350 million into building out clinics in hundreds of its supermarkets to eventually offer Theranos blood tests, reportedly looks to dissolve its relationship with the company before it ever offered its services.\n\nJanuary 2016: Federal regulators take issue with Theranos’ California lab; Walgreens pulls back\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sends Theranos a letter saying its California lab has failed to comply with federal standards and that patients are in “immediate jeopardy.” It gives the company 10 days to address the issues.\n\nIn response, Walgreens says it will not send any lab tests to Theranos’ California lab for analysis and suspends Theranos services at its Palo Alto Walgreens location.\n\nMarch 2016: CMS threatens to ban Holmes, Balwani from lab business\n\nCMS threatens to ban Holmes and Balwani from the laboratory business for two years after the company allegedly failed to fix problems at its California lab. Theranos says that’s a “worst case scenario.”\n\nMay 2016: Balwani steps down; Theranos voids two years of blood tests\n\nBalwani departs. The company also adds three new board members as part of the restructuring: Fabrizio Bonanni, a former executive vice president of biotech firm Amgen, former CDC director William Foege, and former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich.\n\nTheranos voids two years of blood test results from its proprietary testing devices, correcting tens of thousands of blood-test reports, the Journal reports.\n\nJune 2016: Holmes net worth revised to $0; Theranos loses its largest retail partner\n\nForbes revises its estimate of Holmes’ net worth from $4.5 billion to $0. The magazine also lowers its valuation for the company from $9 billion to $800 million.\n\nWalgreens, once Theranos’ largest retail partner, ends its partnership with the company and says it will close all 40 Theranos Wellness Centers.\n\nJuly 2016: Holmes is banned from running labs for two years\n\nCMS revokes Theranos’ license to operate its California lab and bans Holmes from running a blood-testing lab for two years.\n\nAugust 2016: The company unveils ‘miniLab’ device\n\nHolmes tries to move past recent setbacks by unveiling a mini testing laboratory, called miniLab, at a conference for the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. In selling the device, versus operating its own clinics, Theranos seeks to effectively side-step CMS sanctions, which don’t prohibit research and development.\n\nOctober 2016: Theranos investor sues the company; Theranos downsizes\n\nTheranos investor Partner Fund Management sues the company for $96.1 million, the amount it sunk into the company in February 2014, plus damages. It accuses the company of securities fraud. Theranos and Partner Fund Management settled in May, 2017, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nThe company also lays off 340 employees as it closes clinical labs and wellness centers as it attempts to pivot and focus on the miniLab.\n\nNovember 2016: Walgreens sues Theranos\n\nWalgreens sues the blood testing startup for breach of contract. Walgreens sought to recover the $140 million it poured into the company. The lawsuit was settled August, 2017.\n\nJanuary 2017: More layoffs, followed by a failed lab inspection\n\nTheranos downsizes its workforce yet again following the increased scrutiny into its operations, laying off approximately 155 employees or about 41% of staffers.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Theranos failed a second regulatory lab inspection in September, and that the company was closing its last blood testing location as a result.\n\nApril 2017: Theranos settles with CMS, and Arizona AG\n\nTheranos settles with the CMS, agreeing to pay $30,000 and to not to own or operate any clinical labs for two years.\n\nTheranos also settles with the Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich over allegations that its advertisements misrepresented the method, accuracy, and reliability of its blood testing and that the company was out of compliance with federal regulations governing clinical lab testing. Theranos agrees to pay $4.65 million back to its Arizona customers as part of a settlement deal.\n\nMarch 2018: Holmes charged with massive fraud\n\nThe SEC charges Holmes and Balwani with a “massive fraud” involving more than $700 million from investors through an “elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance.”\n\nThe SEC alleges Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos’ proprietary analyzer could perform only 12 of the 200 tests it published on its patient testing menu.\n\nTheranos and Holmes agree to resolve the claims against them, and Holmes gives up control of the company and much of her stake in it. Balwani, however, is fighting the charges, with his attorney saying he “accurately represented Theranos to investors to the best of his ability.”\n\nMay 2018: “Bad Blood”\n\nReporter John Carreyrou, who first broke open the story of Theranos for the Wall Street Journal, publishes “Bad Blood,” a definitive look at what happened inside the disgraced company. Director Adam McKay (who directed “The Big Short”) secures the rights to make the film, starring Jennifer Lawrence as Holmes, by the same name.\n\nJune 2018: Holmes and Balwani indicted on criminal fraud charges\n\nHolmes and Balwani are indicted on federal wire fraud charges over allegedly engaging in a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud investors, as well as a scheme to defraud doctors and patients. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMinutes before the charges were made public, Theranos announced that Holmes has stepped down as CEO. The company’s general counsel, David Taylor, takes over as CEO. Holmes remains chair of the company’s board.\n\nFormer Theranos COO Ramesh \"Sunny' Balwani leaves the Robert F. Peckham U.S. Federal Court on June 28, 2019 in San Jose, California.

Later, in August 2021, unsealed court documents reveal Holmes is likely to claim she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Balwani. The allegations led to the severing of their trials. His trial is slated to begin in 2022.\n\nDecember 2020: Holmes’ criminal trial delayed til 2021\n\nInitially set to begin in July 2020, Holmes’ criminal trial is further delayed til July 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMarch 2021: Holmes’ pregnancy further delays trial\n\nNews surfaces that Holmes’ is expecting her first child, once more further delaying her criminal trial.

Ethan Swope/Getty Images\n\nAugust 2021: Holmes’ criminal trial begins with jury selection\n\nMore than 80 potential jurors are brought into a San Jose courtroom for questioning over the course of two days to determine if they are fit to serve as impartial, fair jurors for the criminal trial of Holmes. A jury of seven men and five women is selected, with five alternatives.\n\nDecember 2021: Jury begins deliberating her fate\n\nAfter three months of testimony from 32 witnesses, the criminal fraud case of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes makes its way to the jury of eight men and four women who will decide her fate. The jury would go on to deliberate for more than 50 hours before returning a verdict.\n\nJanuary 2022: Holmes found guilty on four of 11 federal charges\n\nHolmes is found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud investors as well as three wire fraud counts tied to specific investors. She is found not guilty on three additional charges concerning defrauding patients and one charge of conspiracy to defraud patients. The jury returns no verdict on three of the charges concerning defrauding investors. Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000 plus restitution for each count.\n\nMarch 2022: After Hulu miniseries debuts, Balwani’s criminal trial kicks off\n\n“The Dropout,” a scripted miniseries about Theranos produced by ABC, debuts on Hulu. Amanda Seyfried stars as Holmes and Naveen Andrews plays Balwani. Their romantic and professional relationship features prominently in the show.\n\nFollowing delays due to Holmes’ prolonged trial then a surge of Covid-19, jury selection for Balwani’s trial gets underway. On March 22, opening arguments are held and the government’s first witness, a former Theranos employee turned whistleblower, is called to the stand.\n\nJuly 2022: Balwani guilty of federal fraud\n\nAfter four full days of deliberations, a jury finds Balwani guilty of ten counts of federal wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Like Holmes, Balwani faces up to 20 years in prison as well as a fine of $250,000 plus restitution for each count of wire fraud and each conspiracy count.\n\nSeptember 2022: Holmes asks for new trial, says a key witness expressed regrets\n\nHolmes asks for a new trial after claiming that a key witness visited her house unannounced and allegedly said he “feels guilty” about his testimony.\n\nIn a court filing with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Holmes’ attorneys said Adam Rosendorff, a former Theranos lab director who was one of the government’s main witnesses, arrived at her home on August 8 asking to speak with her. According to the filing, Rosendorff did not interact with Holmes but did speak to her partner Billy Evans, who recounted the exchange in an email to Holmes’ lawyers shortly after.\n\n“His shirt was untucked, his hair was messy, his voice slightly trembled,” Evans wrote about Rosendorff. According to Evans’ email, Rosendorff “said when he was called as a witness he tried to answer the questions honestly but that the prosecutors tried to make everybody look bad.”\n\nThe former Theranos lab director also “said he felt like he had done something wrong,” Evans wrote.\n\nOctober 2022: Rosendorff takes the stand again\n\nRosendorff takes the stand again to address concerns from Holmes’ defense team and their claims he had shown up at her home after the trial concluded asking to speak with her and expressed regrets about his testimony.\n\nAt the hearing, Rosendorff reaffirmed the truthfulness of his testimony at Holmes’ trial and said that the government did not influence what he said.\n\nNovember 2022: Request for new trial is denied\n\nA federal judge denies Elizabeth Holmes’ request for a new trial, according to court filings, paving the way for the founder of failed blood testing startup Theranos to be sentenced later in the month.", "authors": ["Sara Ashley O'Brien"], "publish_date": "2022/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/politics/why-liz-cheney-lost/index.html", "title": "How Liz Cheney lost Wyoming's lone seat in the House | CNN Politics", "text": "Jackson, Wyoming CNN —\n\nRep. Liz Cheney’s supporters say her reelection hopes were doomed on January 13, 2021, when a week after the insurrection at the Capitol, she and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach former President Donald Trump.\n\nEverything since that day – Cheney’s role on the House select committee investigating the insurrection; her ads featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, eviscerating Trump; her speeches attempting to steer the GOP away from Trump’s influence – only served Harriet Hageman’s victory in Wyoming’s primary for its lone House seat on Tuesday.\n\nCheney’s ouster caps a summer in which Trump has purged the GOP of many of his critics, while elevating candidates – including Hageman – who have parroted his lies about widespread election fraud. Trump-aligned candidates have won primaries for governor in swing states such as Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and Senate in Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Candidates backed by the former President have positioned themselves to take over the election machinery in a series of key states if they win in November.\n\nPrimaries in recent months have also brought into focus the role a handful of prominent Republicans, including Cheney and former Vice President Mike Pence, are seeking to play in moving the GOP beyond Trump and his election denialism.\n\nBut Wyoming’s results on Tuesday demonstrated the long odds those Trump critics face in a party in which the former President remains the most dominant figure and is teasing a third run for the White House in 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Cheney following her primary loss, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to divulge the contents of the conversation. Bloomberg was first to report the call.\n\nCheney attempted to assemble a coalition of Democrats, independents and moderate and anti-Trump Republicans – many of them ideological opponents of the neoconservative congresswoman before the last 19 months – to save her seat. Her campaign sent information to registered Democrats in Wyoming about how to change their party registration, and in interviews across the state in the lead-up to the election, a number of Democrats did say they were voting for Cheney.\n\nBut the Cowboy State’s electorate is almost entirely Republican. Wyoming has more than 215,000 registered Republicans compared to just 36,000 registered Democrats, according to data from the secretary of state’s office. That’s a drop of about 15,000 registered Democrats from early 2021, but the pool of party-switchers, along with a fall-off of more than 3,000 independent voters who likely became Republicans, was nowhere near large enough to save Cheney from defeat in a Republican Party that had turned against her.\n\n“I think she stood up for what she believes in,” said John Grant, a Republican who cast his ballot for Cheney, even though he suspected she would fall short. “It took a lot of courage to stand against the Republican Party and Donald Trump.”\n\n‘Uneasy from the beginning’\n\nThe roots of Cheney’s loss were planted long before Tuesday’s primary. And in some cases, the seeds were planted during the factional battles within the Wyoming GOP that date back to the tea party era, when Cheney was still a resident of Virginia.\n\nThe state’s GOP, with no real competition from Democrats, has divided into two factions, with a more moderate establishment wing butting heads with a more conservative faction that has increasingly wrested away control.\n\nThe establishment wing retains some power in Wyoming. Gov. Mark Gordon, a part of that wing, won Tuesday. But the conservative faction has seized control of the state Republican Party and many of its local organizations.\n\n“In Wyoming, we don’t necessarily embrace the idea of a big tent,” Wyoming GOP Chairman Frank Eathorne said on Fox earlier this year.\n\nWyoming Republicans’ reservations about Cheney were first evident in 2016, when she won her House seat after winning just 39% of the vote in the GOP primary against a fractured field. She was cast as too close to the establishment by some rivals, and as a carpetbagger by others – including Tim Stubson, a former state lawmaker who now supports Cheney.\n\nBut, she was by far the best-known candidate in the race thanks to the decade her father spent representing Wyoming in Congress prior to becoming secretary of defense and later, vice president.\n\nCheney had coasted to reelection since then, largely because she had not broken with conservatives on major issues. Stubson said she was on course to do so again, until the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, when Cheney became a leading critic of Trump’s actions and defender of the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nThe makings for a divorce from Cheney were immediately evident. Though Wyoming’s GOP has been fractured by warring factions, one thing that has broadly united those factions is support for Trump. He won Wyoming in 2020 by 43.3 percentage points over Biden – Trump’s largest margin of victory anywhere in the nation.\n\n“Yes, there may have been an undercurrent there of anti-Liz sentiment, but there is no way she would have had any trouble getting elected,” Stubson said.\n\n“Her relationship with that portion of the party has been uneasy from the beginning, and they probably never totally embraced her because she has been the definition of an establishment Republican. But she was right on the policies,” he said. “In my mind, it’s a sort of binary issue: If she votes for impeachment, it doesn’t matter what she does afterward.”\n\nVoters say Cheney was too focused on Trump\n\nWhile Trump’s shadow loomed large over the race, conversations with voters across Wyoming over the last week often came across with a sense of disappointment in Cheney, more than a burning sentiment of anger. Several people said they felt Cheney devoted far more time on national issues – to the detriment of her focusing on energy and natural resource priorities of critical importance to the state.\n\n“I want Wyoming to be protected and I don’t feel Liz is doing that job,” said Jenille Thomas, who lives in the coal-mining town of Rock Springs in southwestern Wyoming.\n\nFor many Republican voters in Wyoming, though, it was Cheney’s vote to impeach Trump that spurred them to action.\n\nEsther Egan, a 68-year-old who cleans houses and lives in Jackson, said she voted for Hageman because Cheney “bailed on us when we need her the most.”\n\n“They can say whatever they want about Trump, but he did a damn good job. And then she turns tail,” Egan said. “She’s with Nancy Pelosi.”\n\nCatherine Norsworthy, a 68-year-old homemaker in Jackson, said she switched from being an unaffiliated voter to a Republican to vote for Hageman, citing Trump’s endorsement of her.\n\n“I’m not in favor of the January 6 hearings at all,” she said. “I didn’t like her voting against Trump. I’m very pro-Trump. I listen to him.”\n\nU.S. Representatives Liz Cheney (R-WY), Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) and Elaine Luria (D-VA) listen during a public hearing of the U.S. House Select Committee to investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol, on Capitol Hill, in Washington, U.S., July 21, 2022. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nGoing down swinging\n\nCheney was by far the most prominent of the 10 House Republicans to vote in January 2021 for Trump’s impeachment. She revealed her decision to do so the day before the House vote, saying in a statement that Trump “summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.”\n\nThe retribution she faced within the GOP built over the following months. In May 2021, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy publicly endorsed removing Cheney from her position as the No. 3 spot in the party’s leadership team.\n\nThat same month, the House GOP removed Cheney from her leadership post on a voice vote.\n\nShe followed the ouster by telling reporters, in a preview of how she would approach the following year and her reelection campaign: “I will do everything I can to ensure that the former President never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office.”\n\nIn July 2021, Cheney accepted a position as one of two Republicans, along with retiring Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, on the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nAs the committee conducted its probe, Trump set his sights on revenge, endorsing challengers to most of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him.\n\nTrump’s biggest target was Cheney. He endorsed Hageman, a former Republican National Committee member and lawyer who had once been a Cheney ally, on the day she entered the race in September 2021.\n\nFor the most part, Trump’s efforts have succeeded. Four of the 10 have retired. Three more, in addition to Cheney, lost their primaries. Only two survived their primaries, and California Rep. David Valadao and Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse did so in part because their states hold all-party open primaries.\n\nAs those retirements piled up and those primaries unfolded, Cheney was busy playing a leading role on that committee, in its interviews of former Trump administration officials and in its public hearings in which the panel has revealed some of its findings.\n\nShe has also sought out opportunities to confront the GOP’s direction. She delivered a searing rebuke of Trump and her party’s leadership in a late June speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\n“We are confronting a domestic threat that we have never faced before – and that is a former President who is attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional Republic,” Cheney said then. “And he is aided by Republican leaders and elected officials who have made themselves willing hostages to this dangerous and irrational man.”\n\nWeeks after that speech, Cheney was elusive when asked about the possibility of running for president in 2024. She told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview that she will “make a decision on 2024 down the road.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt earlier this month, Cheney made clear she would not temper her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father once held and that she has held since 2017.\n\n“We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.”\n\nEven as polls showed Cheney was on her way to a resounding defeat, she stuck to a message focused squarely on Trump.\n\nHer campaign bought ad time on Fox for a spot featuring Dick Cheney, in which he called Trump a “coward” who lies to his supporters and “tried to steal the last election” using violence.\n\nRepublican candidate U.S. Representative Liz Cheney speaks during her primary election night party in Jackson, Wyoming, U.S. August 16, 2022. David Stubbs/Reuters\n\nWhat’s next\n\nIt didn’t take long for the outcome of Tuesday’s primary to become clear. Cheney had been badly defeated, and conceded the race to Hageman quickly.\n\nShe told supporters that she’d won the primary with 73% support two years ago, and “could easily have done the same again.” But doing so, she said, would have required embracing Trump’s lies about election fraud.\n\n“That was a path I could not and would not take,” Cheney said.\n\n“No House seat, no office in this land, is more important than the principles that we are all sworn to protect. And I well understood the potential political consequences of abiding by my duty,” she said.\n\nAfter a primary that Cheney and her allies knew she was set to lose, the question is, what’s next for the Wyoming congresswoman who had in a short time rocketed up the House Republican ranks?\n\nShe did not answer that question Tuesday night, at her election night event on a ranch in Jackson Hole. But overnight, her campaign filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission creating a leadership PAC to be called “The Great Task” – a nod to Abraham Lincoln, who spoke at Gettysburg of the “great task” facing the country.
