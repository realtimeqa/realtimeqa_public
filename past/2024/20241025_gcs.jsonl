Given countries’ current promises, Earth’s temperature will climb to between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius by 2100.\n\nUltimately, the world needs to cut its fossil fuel emissions nearly in half by 2030 to avoid 1.5 degrees, a daunting prospect for economies still very much beholden to oil, natural gas and coal.\n\n“No country has a right to be delinquent,” US Climate Envoy John Kerry told reporters in October. “The scientists tell us that what is happening now – the increased extreme heat, extreme weather, the fires, the floods, the warming of the ocean, the melting of the ice, the extraordinary way in which life is being affected badly by the climate crisis – is going to get worse unless we address this crisis in a unified, forward-leaning way.”\n\nHere are the top issues to follow at COP27 in Egypt.\n\nA fight over ‘loss and damage’\n\nPeople in Pakistan take refuge from flooding in a makeshift camp on August 31 in the Jaffarabad district of Balochistan province. Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDeveloping and developed countries have for years tussled over the concept of a “loss and damage” fund; the idea which suggests countries causing the most harm with their outrageous planet-warming emissions should pay poorer countries, which have suffered from the resulting climate disasters.\n\nIt has been a thorny issue because the richest countries, including the US, don’t want to appear culpable or legally liable to other nations for harm. Kerry, for instance, has tiptoed around the issue, saying the US supports formal talks, but he has not given any indication of what solution the country would sign on to.\n\nMeanwhile, small island nations and others in the Global South are shouldering the impact of the climate crisis, as devastating floods, intensifying storms and record-breaking heat waves wreak havoc.\n\nThe deadly flooding in Pakistan this summer, which killed more than 1,500 people, will surely be an example the countries’ negotiators point to. And since September, more than two million people in Nigeria have been affected by the worst flooding there in a decade. At this very moment, Nigerians are drinking, cooking with and bathing in dirty flood water amid serious concerns over waterborne diseases.\n\nLoss and damage will have space on the official COP27 agenda this year. But beyond countries committing to meet and talk about what a potential loss and damage fund would look like, or whether one should even exist, it is unclear what action will come out of this year’s summit.\n\n“Do we expect that we’ll have a fund by the end of the two weeks? I hope, I would love to – but we’ll see how parties deliver on that,” Egypt’s chief climate negotiator Ambassador Mohamed Nasr recently told reporters.\n\nFormer White House National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy told CNN she thinks loss and damage will be the top issue at the UN climate summit this year, and said nations including the US will face some tough questions about their plans to help developing nations already being hit hard by climate disasters.\n\n“It just keeps getting pushed out,” McCarthy said. “There’s need for some real accountability and some specific commitments in the short-term.”\n\nA tense US-China relationship\n\nXi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China, left, and John Kerry, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. Getty Images/AP\n\nPeople will be watching to see if the US and China can repair a broken relationship at the summit, a year after the two countries surprised the world by announcing they would work together on climate change.\n\nThe newfound cooperation came crashing down this summer when China announced it was suspending climate talks with the US as part of broader retaliation for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.\n\nKerry recently said the climate talks between the two countries are still suspended and will likely remain so until China’s president Xi Jinping gives the green light. Kerry and others are watching to see whether China fulfills the promise it made last year to submit a plan to bring down its methane emissions or updates its emissions pledge.\n\nThe US and China are the world’s two largest emitters and their cooperation matters, particularly because it can spur other countries to act, too.\n\nCan the world raise enough money?\n\nThis year's UN climate summit is being held in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, where thousands of climate negotiators and advocates will gather to raise their ambitions on the climate crisis. Mohamed el-Shahed/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSeparate from a potential loss and damage fund, there is the overarching issue of so-called global climate finance; a fund rich countries promised to push money into to help the developing world transition to clean energy rather than grow their economies with fossil fuels.\n\nThe promise made in 2009 was $100 billion per year, but the world has yet to meet the pledge. Some of the richest countries, including the US, UK, Canada and others, have consistently fallen short of their allocation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden promised the US would contribute $11 billion by 2024 toward the effort. But Biden’s request is ultimately up to Congress to approve, and will likely go nowhere if Republicans win control of Congress in the midterm elections.\n\nThe US is working on separate deals with countries including Vietnam, South Africa and Indonesia to get them to move away from coal and toward renewables. And US officials often stress they want to also unlock private investments to help countries transition to renewables and deal with climate effects.\n\nCountries are straight up off-track\n\nShips carry coal outside a coal-fired power plant in November 2021 in Hanchuan, Hubei province, China. Getty Images\n\nCOP27 is intended to hold countries’ feet to the fire on fossil fuel emissions and gin up new ambition on the climate crisis. Yet reports show we are still off-track to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nA UN report which surveyed countries’ latest pledges found the planet will warm between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius. Average global temperature has already risen around 1.2 degrees since the industrial revolution.\n\nRecords were set last year for all three major greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nThere is a spot of encouraging news: the adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles is surging and helping to offset the rise in fossil fuel emissions, according to a recent International Energy Agency report.\n\nBut the overall picture from the reports shows there is a need for much more clean energy, deployed swiftly. Every fraction of a degree in global temperature rise will have stark consequences, said Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program.\n\n“The energy transition is entirely doable, but we’re not on that pathway, and we have procrastinated and wasted time,” Andersen told CNN. “Every digit will matter. Let’s not say ‘we missed 1.5 so let’s settle for 2.’ No. We must understand that every digit that goes up will make our life and the life of our children and grandchildren much more impacted.”\n\nThe clock is ticking in another way: Next year’s COP28 in Dubai will be the year nations must do an official stocktake to determine if the world is on track to meet the goals set out in the landmark Paris Agreement.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/health/what-is-monkeypox-virus-explainer-update-wellness/index.html", "title": "What is monkeypox and its signs and symptoms? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn extremely rare disease called monkeypox, a much less severe cousin of smallpox, is spreading around the world. More than 250 cases have been reported in at least 16 countries, according to the World Health Organization. Experts say it is spread by close and prolonged contact with an infected individual.\n\n“The countries that are reporting monkeypox now are countries that do not normally have outbreaks of monkeypox,” Rosamund Lewis, head of the smallpox secretariat, WHO Emergencies programme, said Tuesday during a news briefing at the United Nations in Geneva.\n\nMonkeypox is endemic near tropical rainforests in central and west Africa, but it has increasingly been seen near urban areas, according to WHO.\n\n“This is an emerging disease. It has been emerging for the last 20 to 30 years, (so) it’s not unknown, it’s very well described,” Lewis told reporters. “The risk for the general public, therefore, appears to be low, because we know that the main modes of transmission have been as described in the past.”\n\nIn the United States, the first case of monkeypox in 2022 was diagnosed in a patient hospitalized in Massachusetts who had recently traveled to Canada in private transportation. In 2021, two people traveling from Nigeria to the US were diagnosed with the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCases in other parts of the world than Africa are typically linked to international travel or imported animals infected with the pox, the CDC said.\n\nSeveral cases of monkeypox reported in the UK have been among people who had no known travel or contact with others, but there is no cause for alarm, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Thursday on CNN’s “New Day.”\n\n“At this time, we don’t want people to worry,” Murthy said. “These numbers are still small; we want (people) to be aware of (the) symptoms, and if they have any concerns to reach out to their doctor.”\n\nWhat are the initial symptoms of monkeypox?\n\nThere is an incubation period of some seven to 14 days, the CDC said. Initial symptoms are typically flu-like, such as fever, chills, exhaustion, headache and muscle weakness, followed by swelling in the lymph nodes, which help the body fight infection and disease.\n\n“A feature that distinguishes infection with monkeypox from that of smallpox is the development of swollen lymph nodes,” the CDC said.\n\nNext comes a widespread rash on the face and body, including inside the mouth and on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\n\nThe painful, raised poxes are pearly and fluid-filled, often surrounded by red circles. The lesions finally scab over and resolve over a period of two to three weeks, the CDC said.\n\nIn the current outbreak, there appear to be a higher number of cases causing rash in the groin area of patients, according to the WHO and CDC.\n\n“In some cases, during the early stages of illness, the rash has been mostly in the genital and perianal area,” Dr. John Brooks, chief medical officer for the CDC’s Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention said Monday in a news briefing.\n\n“In some cases, it has produced anal or genital lesions that look like other diseases like herpes or chickenpox or syphilis,” he said.\n\nA “notable fraction of cases” in the current outbreak have been seen among gay and bisexual men, “but by no means is the current risk of exposure to monkeypox exclusively to the gay and bisexual community in the US. Anyone, anyone, can develop [and] spread monkeypox,” Brooks said.\n\nOverall, monkeypox risk is moderate for people with multiple sexual partners and low for the broader population, according to a rapid risk assessment report published Monday by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nHowever, monkeypox is not considered a sexually-transmitted disease.\n\nHow is monkeypox spread?\n\nClose contact with an infected individual is required for the spread of the monkeypox virus, experts say.\n\nInfection can develop after exposure to “broken skin, mucous membranes, respiratory droplets, infected body fluids or even contact with contaminated linen,” Neil Mabbott, personal chair in immunopathology at the veterinary school of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, said in a statement.\n\n“When the lesions have healed, the scabs (which might carry infectious virus) can be shed as dust, which could be inhaled,” said Dr. Michael Skinner, who is on the faculty of medicine in the department of infectious disease at Imperial College London, in a statement.\n\nTransmission between people can occur through large respiratory droplets, and because such droplets typically travel only a few feet, “prolonged face-to-face contact is required,” the CDC said. This puts healthcare workers and household members caring for or living with someone who is actively infected at greater risk, according to WHO.\n\nMonkeypox creates fluid-filled poxes that are contagious until scabs fall off, experts say. www.visualdx.com\n\nSmallpox, which was eradicated worldwide in 1980, was also spread primarily by direct and prolonged face-to-face contact between people, as well as objects contaminated by infected fluids, such as bedding or clothing.\n\n“Smallpox patients became contagious as soon as they developed sores spread the virus though droplets with coughing or sneezing. They remained contagious until their lesions resolved,” said Dr. Paritosh Prasad, director of the Highly Infectious Disease Unit at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.\n\nHowever, based on available historical information, monkeypox appears to be less contagious than smallpox, Prasad said.\n\n“Monkeypox can be a serious infection, with mortality rates from this type of monkeypox virus having been around 1% in other outbreaks. These are often in lower-income settings with limited access to health care,” said Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton in the UK. There are no reported deaths from the current outbreak.\n\nHowever, in the developed world, “it would be very unusual to see anything more than a handful of cases in any outbreak, and we won’t be seeing (Covid)-style levels of transmission,” Head said in a statement.\n\nCommon household disinfectants can kill the monkeypox virus, according to the CDC.\n\nHow is monkeypox treated?\n\nThere are no specific drugs available to treat the symptoms of monkeypox, so “treatment is generally supportive,” Jimmy Whitworth, professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said in a statement.\n\n“However, a vaccine is available that can be given to prevent the development of disease,” Whitworth said.\n\nIn the US, a two-dose vaccine called Jynneos is currently licensed to prevent monkeypox and can also be used for smallpox. The vaccine has been stockpiled by the US government in case of a resurgence of the eradicated disease.\n\n“Right now, we have over 1,000 doses of that available and we expect that level to ramp up very quickly in the coming weeks as the company provides more doses to us,” Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology within the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told reporters during a call Monday.\n\n“We are hoping to maximize vaccine distribution to those that we know would benefit from it,” McQuiston said. “Those are people who’ve had contact with a known monkeypox patients, health care workers, very close personal contact, and those in particular who might be at high risk for severe disease.”\n\nWhere did monkeypox originate?\n\nMonkeypox got its name in 1958 when “two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research,” the CDC said.\n\nHowever, the main disease carrier of monkeypox is still unknown, although “African rodents are suspected to play a part in transmission,” the agency said.\n\nThe first known case of monkeypox in people was “recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo during a period of intensified effort to eliminate smallpox,” the CDC said.Since then, most cases have been concentrated in 11 African countries – with several outbreaks in the US and Europe related to travel or importation from endemic countries.\n\nA outbreak occurred in the US in 2003 after forty-seven people in six states – Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin – became ill due to contact with their pet prairie dogs, the CDC said.\n\n“The pets were infected after being housed near imported small mammals from Ghana,” the CDC said. “This was the first time that human monkeypox was reported outside of Africa.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/health/covid-reinfection-risk/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 reinfections may increase the likelihood of new health ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRepeatedly catching Covid-19 appears to increase the chances that a person will face new and sometimes lasting health problems after their infection, according to the first study on the health risks of reinfection.\n\nThe study, which is based on the health records of more than 5.6 million people treated in the VA Health System, found that, compared with those with just one Covid-19 infection, those with two or more documented infections had more than twice the risk of dying and three times the risk of being hospitalized within six months of their last infection. They also had higher risks for lung and heart problems, fatigue, digestive and kidney disorders, diabetes and neurologic problems.\n\nThe findings come as a fresh wave of coronavirus variants, notably Omicron’s BA.5, have become dominant in the United States and Europe, causing cases and hospitalizations to rise once again. BA.5 caused about 54% of cases nationwide last week, doubling its share of Covid-19 transmission over the past two weeks, according to data posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBA.5 carries key mutations that help it escape antibodies generated by both vaccines and prior infection, leaving many people vulnerable to reinfection.\n\nDr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, led the research, which was posted as a preprint ahead of peer review. He said he decided to do it after watching reinfections become more and more common among his own patients.\n\n“If you asked me about reinfection maybe a year and a half ago, I would tell you that maybe I have a patient here or there, but it’s really, really rare,” Al-Aly said. That’s not true anymore, though.\n\n“So we asked a simple question that if you got Covid before and now you’re on your second infection, does this really add risk? And the simple answer is that it does.”\n\nTallying the risks of reinfections\n\nAl-Aly and his team compared the health records of more than 250,000 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 one time with records from 38,000 others who had two or more Covid-19 infections documented in their medical records. More than 5.3 million people with no record of a Covid-19 infection were used as the control group.\n\nAmong those with reinfections, 36,000 people had two Covid-19 infections, roughly 2,200 had caught Covid-19 three times, and 246 had been infected four times.\n\nCommon new diagnoses after reinfections included chest pain, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, inflammation of the heart muscle or the sac around the heart, heart failure and blood clots. Common lung issues included shortness of breath, low blood oxygen, lung disease, and accumulation of fluid around the lungs, Al-Aly said.\n\nThe study found that the risk of a new health problem was highest around the time of a Covid-19 reinfection, but it also persisted for at least six months. The increased risk was present whether or not someone had been vaccinated, and it was graded – meaning it increased with each subsequent infection.\n\nAl-Aly said that’s not what people really think will happen when they get Covid a second or third time.\n\n“There is this idea that if you had Covid before, your immune system is trained to recognize it and is more equipped to fight it, and if you’re getting it again, maybe it doesn’t affect you that much, but that’s not really true,” he said.\n\nAl-Aly said that doesn’t mean there aren’t people who have had Covid and done just fine; there are lots of them. Rather, what his study shows is that each infection brings new risk, and that risk adds up over time, he said.\n\nEven if a person has half the risk of developing lasting health problems during a second infection than they did during their first infection, he said, they still wind up with 50% more risk of problems than someone who didn’t get Covid-19 a second time.\n\nThe study has some important caveats. Al-Aly says it was more common to see reinfections among people who had existing risks because of their age or underlying health. That shows that reinfection may not be random, andit could be that the health risks linked to reinfections aren’t, either.\n\n“It is possible that sicker individuals or people with immune dysfunction are at higher risk of reinfection and adverse health outcomes after reinfection,” Al-Aly said.\n\nHe wasn’t interested in trying to isolate the pure effects of reinfection but wanted to understand how repeated infections are affecting the people who get them.\n\n“The most relevant question to people’s lives is, if you get reinfected, does it add to your risk of acute complications and long Covid, and the answer is a clear yes and yes,” he said.\n\nThe study is observational, which means it can’t determine cause and effect.\n\nAl-Aly says the researchers saw these increased risks even after they weighted the data to account for the effects of age, sex, medication use and the person’s underlying health before they got Covid-19.\n\nCovid-19 continues to surprise\n\nExperts who were not involved in the research say it is compelling.\n\n“There is this idea that I think a lot of people have that ‘if I survived my first infection, that I’m really going to be just fine the second time. There really shouldn’t be any problem,’ ” said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an instructor in clinical medicine at Columbia University.\n\n“The popular wisdom, right, is that reinfections are mild, nothing to worry about, nothing to see here,” Griffin said of the study on the podcast “This Week in Virology.” But that’s not really being borne out, he said.\n\nThis is not how it’s supposed to work. Even when viruses shape-shift – as influenza does – our immune system generally retains its memory of how to recognize and fight off some part of them. They may still make us ill, but the idea is that our prior immunity is there to mount some of kind of defense and keep us from serious harm.\n\nWith coronaviruses, and especially SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, the hits just keep on coming.\n\n“A year later, you can get reinfected with the same coronavirus the second time. It is not clear that that second infection can be more mild, because coronaviruses intrinsically have the ability to interfere with long-lasting lifetime immunity,” Griffin told CNN.\n\nGriffin says he’s seen Covid-19 reinfections go both ways. Sometimes, the second or third is milder for his patients, but sometimes it’s not.\n\nHow does that compare with other respiratory infections?\n\nEarly in the pandemic, people would get Covid, and three months would go by when they were pretty well protected, he said. But now, those reinfections are happening more frequently, no doubt because of the rapid changes to the virus. He says he’s seen some people infected four times in the past two years.\n\n“We don’t really see much of that with the flu,” Griffin said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs for what people should be doing now with regard to this risk, Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says Americans are really done with the pandemic. That doesn’t mean that the pandemic is done with us, though.\n\nOsterholm said he has three close friends who recently went to a restaurant for the first time since the pandemic started. All of them tested positive within 72 hours of that restaurant visit.\n\nIf you’re at higher risk of serious illness or you just want to avoid getting sick, it’s a good time to be wearing an N95 mask in public places, he says.\n\n“People don’t want to hear it, but that’s the reality. We’re seeing this resurgence, and we’re seeing increasing numbers of vaccine failures. Clearly, that’s a major concern,” he said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/health/ba-2-dominant-us/index.html", "title": "BA.2: What we know about the dominant cause of Covid-19 in the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe highly contagious Omicron subvariant BA.2 is now the dominant coronavirus strain in the United States, causing more than half of all Covid-19 infections last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.\n\nThe new numbers come from the CDC’s genomic surveillance. Based on its models, the agency says that BA.2 caused between 51% and 59% of all new Covid-19 infections in the US the week ending March 26, up from an estimated 39% of all new infections the week before.\n\nThe hardest-hit region was the Northeast, where BA.2 caused more than 70% of all cases. The South and Mountain West saw the fewest cases. BA.2 caused slightly more than one-third of infections in those regions last week.\n\n‘We are not immune to what happens in Europe’\n\nThough BA.2 is still just taking the stage in the US, it has had prominent runs in many other parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, and is winding down its European tour.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, BA.2 is also the main cause of Covid-19 globally, out-muscling two other Omicron lineages, BA.1 and BA 1.1, to become the dominant strain. Since its takeover, international case counts – which had been declining since the first week of January – have been rising again.\n\nIn the UK, which has a more highly vaccinated population than the US, a combination of lifted restrictions, waning immunity and an even more contagious version of the virus have created a new BA.2 wave. Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have been trending upward since the end of February, and now, the weekly average of new cases stands about where it was at the end of January.\n\nBA.2 infections have not reached the peaks seen with BA.1, however. Case counts appear to be leveling off in the UK, though hospitalizations and deaths are still rising.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, the US has followed the UK by about three weeks, so when cases began rising there, health officials here took notice.\n\nIn America, BA.2 has been gaining steam since the end of January, and case numbers have plateaued. That flattening conceals regional differences, however. In 13 states, weekly average numbers of new cases are rising, and they have stopped falling in 14 others, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIt’s still not clear what this subvariant will do in the US. Even experts don’t exactly know what to expect.\n\n“We’re not immune from what happens in Europe,” said former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden, who is now president and CEO of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives.\n\n“In Europe, you see BA.2 becoming predominant and driving a resurgence, and the likelihood that will not happen in the US is pretty low, really,” Frieden said. “I do think part of the reason that we’re plateauing is that we’re about to start going up again.”\n\nFrieden doesn’t think it’s a coincidence that the US Food and Drug Administration authorized additional booster shots for Americans who are 50 and older on Tuesday, the same day the CDC estimated that BA.2 was dominant.\n\nBut it’s anyone’s guess how high cases will go, whether lots of people will need hospital care, and whether the nation will continue to see breathtaking numbers of deaths.\n\nFacing ‘a familiar uncertainty’\n\nMost predictions about BA.2 in the US haven’t been dire.\n\nThe University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s Covid-19 projections, updated last week, predict that BA.2 will not drive another surge in the US.\n\nBut they say we may see something like what happened in South Africa, where BA.2 quietly replaced its cousin BA.1 as the main cause of Covid-19 infections – without a rise in cases or deaths. Instead, it drew out Omicron’s descent, causing a long tail.\n\nMichael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, called the coronavirus waiting game we play every few months “a familiar uncertainty.” He dedicated his latest podcast to “all of us who remain confused about what the immediate or intermediate future looks like with Covid.”\n\nHow strong is our immunologic wall?\n\nThere are a host of reasons why it’s hard to know what BA.2 may do. The CDC estimates that 37 million Americans – about 1 in 11 – got Covid-19 over the winter, during the first Omicron wave. Many more have immunity from vaccination and boosters. So, based on random blood samples, the CDC says that 95% of Americans may now have some degree of immunity from Covid-19.\n\nDr. Jorge Salinas, an infectious disease expert at Stanford University, calls this an immunologic wall.\n\n“That gives us some protection against future surges,” he said. “However, that wall deteriorates with time. The longer it goes after a wave or after vaccination, the bigger the decay of the wall.”\n\nStudies have determined determined that BA.2 evades our vaccinations about as well as original Omicron did, so boosters are needed to restore protections against these variants. But less than half the US population 12 and older has had a recommended third dose.\n\nOf greatest concern are adults over 65, because they are mostly likely to become severely ill with Covid-19. One out of three people over 65 in the UShasn’t had a critical third vaccine dose.\n\n“The real problem is that so much of our population is undervaccinated seniors,” Frieden said. “That’s our Achilles heel.”\n\nQuestions about reinfection\n\nThe other variable is found in the virus itself.\n\nOmicron threw our immune defenses for a loop. It was so different from the coronavirus strains that came before that many people who’d gotten sick with Delta or other early strains found themselves infected again.\n\nBA.2 has about 40 amino acid changes from Omicron’s BA.1, making it about as different from its cousin as Alpha, Beta and Delta were from each other. Some have wondered whether BA.2 could reinfect people who’d had BA.1.\n\nA large study from Denmark suggests that these kinds of reinfections are possible but rare.\n\nThe research on more than 1.8 million infections found only 1,739 cases in which people tested positive for Covid-19 twice within a two-month window. Of those, 47 were BA.1 infections that were followed by BA.2.\n\nWhen researchers looked more closely, they found that these types of reinfections tended to happen to young and unvaccinated people, mostly children. And their symptoms tended to be mild.\n\nThe study was posted as a preprint, meaning that it has not yet been scrutinized by outside experts and published in a medical journal.\n\nStudies point to high viral loads\n\nBA.2 is exceedingly contagious. Some epidemiologists have said its basic reproduction number may be as high as 12, meaning each sick person infects an average of 12 others. That would put it on par with measles, which also spreads through the air. The basic reproduction number for BA.1 is estimated to be about 8.\n\nIn a preprint study from Sweden, researchers measured viral levels in swabs from the back of the nasal cavity. They found nearly twice as much viral RNA in samples from BA.2 patients than in those who tested positive for BA.1, “pointing to a substantial difference in viral load.”\n\nViral loads were about the same for Delta and BA.1 infections, they said, “whereas the increase in viral load in BA.2 cases was surprising.”\n\nAnother preprint study from Qatar picked up this difference, too.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLaith Abu-Raddad, a professor of population sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, has been studying the effectiveness of vaccines and boosters against BA.1 and BA.2. A major difference between the two infections is a person’s viral load, he said.\n\n“It’s definitely way higher” with BA.2 over BA.1, he said. His study found it to be “almost 10-fold higher.”\n\nInstead of going deeply into the lungs, the way Delta did, the Omicron strains seem much more focused on the upper respiratory tract, where the nose meets the back of the throat, Abu-Raddad said.\n\nHe thinks that because the infection concentrates there, that also helps it spread efficiently when people talk, cough or sneeze.\n\nA bright spot?\n\nPerhaps one bright spot in the BA.2 picture may be severity.\n\nAlthough studies in animals have suggested that BA.2 infection wasn’t entirely mild, data on human infections from the UK, Denmark and South Africa shows that BA.2 isn’t more likely to result in hospitalization when compared with BA.1.\n\nThis week, the UK Health Security Agency updated its data on vaccine effectiveness against BA.2.

And they need to be prepared.”\n\nEven health care workers are getting sidelined during the rapid rise of the Omicron variant, the most contagious strain of novel coronavirus to hit the US.\n\n“Our health system is at a very different place than we were in previous surges,” emergency medicine professor Dr. Esther Choo said.\n\n“This strain is so infectious that I think all of us know many, many colleagues who are currently infected or have symptoms and are under quarantine,” said Choo, associate professor at Oregon Health and Science University.\n\n“We’ve lost at least 20% of our health care workforce – probably more.”\n\nDon’t get a false sense of security with Omicron\n\nEarly studies suggest the Omicron variant may cause less severe disease than the Delta variant, which still makes up a considerable portion of US Covid-19 cases.\n\nBut because Omicron is much more contagious, the raw number of Covid-19 hospitalizations could get worse, Dr. Anthony Fauci said.\n\n“When you have so many, many cases, even if the rate of hospitalization is lower with Omicron than it is with Delta, there’s still the danger that you’re going to have a surging of hospitalizations that might stress the health care system,” said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nAnd Omicron might be more problematic for young children, said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\n“It does appear now, based on a lot of experimental evidence that we’ve gotten just in the last two weeks, that this is a milder form of the coronavirus,” Gottlieb told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.\n\n“It appears to be more of an upper airway disease than a lower airway disease. That’s good for most Americans. The one group that that may be a problem for is very young children – toddlers – who have trouble with upper airway infections,” said Gottlieb, a current board member at Pfizer.\n\n“This new strain could have a predilection, again, for the upper airway, which could be a bigger challenge in young kids, because of the way it binds to the airway cells.”\n\nSchool districts go remote after record-high child Covid-19 hospitalizations\n\nJust as millions of students prepared to return to school, new pediatric Covid-19 hospitalizations reached a record high.\n\nFor the week ending December 28, an average of 378 children were admitted to hospitals every day with Covid-19, according to CDC data.\n\nThat’s a 66% jump from the previous week. It also breaks the previous record of 342 set during the Delta variant surge at the beginning of the school year.\n\nWith the more transmissible Omicron variant, some schools might want to postpone in-person learning, pediatrician Dr. Peter Hotez said.\n\n“It may be the case in some school districts, where things are so raging right now in terms of Omicron for the next couple of weeks, and it may be prudent to delay things a couple more weeks,” said Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\n“It’s going to be a very challenging time,” Hotez said. “People are going to have to be patient.”\n\nIn Georgia, at least five large Atlanta-area school districts will be starting class remotely this week.\n\n“Due to the rapid rise in positive cases in the metro Atlanta area, students will begin virtual classes Tuesday, Jan. 4 through Friday, Jan. 7,” Atlanta Public Schools said Saturday.\n\n“Our current plan is to resume in-person instruction on Monday, Jan. 10,” the school district said.\n\n“All APS staff are required to report to their work location Monday, Jan. 3, for mandatory COVID-19 surveillance testing, unless they are ill. The data collected from staff testing will be used for future planning.”\n\nAPS said the goal is to allow students and staff to be tested and to isolate and quarantine as needed, according to CDC and health department guidelines.\n\nFour other nearby school districts – in Fulton County, DeKalb County, Rockdale County and Clayton County – announced they would have temporary remote learning following the holiday break.\n\n‘Omicron is truly everywhere’\n\nAcross the country, the rapid spread of Omicron variant has impacted businesses, transportation and emergency services.\n\n“Omicron is truly everywhere,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency medicine professor at Brown University’s School of Public Health.\n\n“What I am so worried about over the next month or so is that our economy is going to shut down – not because of policies from the federal government or from the state governments, but rather because so many of us are ill.”\n\nIn New York, staffing issues led to the suspension of several subway lines, New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced last week.\n\nAnd the city’s emergency medical services were instructed to not transport stable patients with influenza-like symptoms so they could prioritize those in emergencies, according to a directive issued New Year’s Eve by the fire commissioner, chief of department, chief of EMS and the chief medical director. The directive, which includes limited exceptions, applies to the New York Fire Department and voluntary hospital providers in the city’s 911 system.\n\nIn Ohio, the mayor of Cincinnati declared a state of emergency after a spike in Covid-19 infections led to staffing shortages in the city’s fire department.\n\nThe mayor said if the problem goes unaddressed, it would “substantially undermine” first responders’ readiness levels.\n\nAnd thousands of flights have been canceled or delayed as staff and crew call out sick.\n\nLong lines form for Covid-19 PCR tests December 28 in Stamford, Connecticut.

We’re inundated in the ER.”\n\nDespite a year of calls from public health experts to get vaccinated – and now boosted – only about 62% of the US population is fully vaccinated, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.\n\nAnd about 33.4% of those who are fully vaccinated have received their booster doses, the data shows.\n\n“If you’re unvaccinated, that’s the group still at highest risk,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “The adults that are being admitted to my institution, the vast majority continue to be unvaccinated.”", "authors": ["Christina Maxouris Holly Yan", "Christina Maxouris", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/health/long-covid-at-two-years-wellness/index.html", "title": "Long Covid 2 years after a diagnosis: What is the risk? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nGetting sick from Covid-19 is bad enough. What if you’re one of the unlucky people who experience what is called long Covid? It’s a medley of symptoms that can occur months – and even years – after recovering from Covid, according to a new study of more 1 million people from eight countries.\n\nAdult risk of developing seizure disorders, brain fog, dementia and other mental health conditions remain high two years after recovering from Covid-19, the study found.\n\n“These are important findings, but they shouldn’t lead to panic,” said coauthor Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford in the UK. “We’re not talking about things that are 10 or 100 times more common. I think the worst odds ratio is sort of two or three.”\n\nChildren had anincreased risk of being diagnosed with epilepsy or seizures, encephalitis and nerve root disorders, which can cause pain, weakness or loss of sensation in an arm or a leg. There was also a small, but worrisome risk of being diagnosed with a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or delusional thinking.\n\n“This is an extremely robust and well conducted study, using data from a large sample, and across multiple nations,” said Rachel Sumner, senior research fellow at Cardiff Metropolitan University in the UK, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“The findings are alarming and are critically important in our current context of unmitigated Covid spread,” she added via email.\n\nThe study’s conclusions match the clinical experience of Dr. Aaron Friedberg, a clinical assistant professor of internal medicine who works in the Post-Covid Recovery Program at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center in Columbus.\n\n“I just talked to someone who had been originally diagnosed more than two years ago with Covid, but they’re only seeing a post-Covid specialist today,” said Friedberg, who was not involved in the study. “That doesn’t necessarily mean they’re getting those symptoms two years later. It means they are just being diagnosed with them.”\n\nFriedberg also said he sees people suffering severe symptoms two years after diagnosis.\n\n“They can’t think, they can’t breathe. I have one person whose disease is so severe, they basically can’t get out of bed,” he said. “I saw a person recently who is still not working because of Covid symptoms two years later.”\n\nGood and bad news\n\nTwo years of hospital data for both adults and children pulled from the TriNetX electronic health records network was analyzed for the study, published Wednesday in the journal Lancet Psychiatry. TriNetX is an international network of data without any identifying factors from hospital, primary care and specialist providers. About 89 million patients are in the data pool.\n\nA woman gets tested for the coronavirus in June in Berlin. Christophe Gateau/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nThe study looked at 1.25 million patients two years after their Covid-19 diagnosis and compared them with a closely matched group of 1.25 million people who had a different respiratory infection.\n\n“We compared those two groups of patients in terms of 14 major neurological and psychiatric disorders in the two years after the Covid-19 or respiratory infection,” said coauthor Maxime Taquet, an academic clinical fellow in psychiatry at the National Institute for Health and Care Research’s Biomedical Research Centre in the UK.\n\nThe research team looked at the following conditions: anxiety disorders; mood disorders; psychotic disorder; insomnia; cognitive deficit (a composite of codes to capture so-called brain fog); dementia; epilepsy or seizures; encephalitis; intracranial hemorrhage; stroke; parkinsonism; Guillain-Barré syndrome; nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders; and neuromuscular and muscle disease. Researchers also looked at deaths from any cause.\n\nMost of the patients were from the United States, but the study also included people from Australia, the UK, Spain, Bulgaria, India, Malaysia and Taiwan.\n\nThe study could not tell if people had experienced ongoing symptoms for the full two years since a Covid-19 diagnosis: “That might be the case, it may not be the case,” Taquet said. “This data is only looking at the number of new diagnoses being made, not the persistence or the duration of the symptoms.”\n\nThe news was both good and bad.\n\nFor adults, the risk of developing “brain fog, dementia, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy and seizures remain elevated throughout the two years” when compared with people with other respiratory conditions, Taquet said.\n\nAdults over the age of 65 had a 1.2% increase in the risk of being diagnosed with dementia, the study said. While “it’s very clear that this is not a tsunami of new dementia cases, equally (I think) it’s hard to ignore it, given the severity of the consequences of dementia diagnosis,” he said.\n\nThere was some good news for adults, Taquet added: “Risk of some disorders – in particular anxiety and mood disorders – disappeared within two to three months, with no overall excess number of cases over the two years.”\n\nEffect on children\n\nThere was also good news for children: “The risk of brain fog in children was transient – there was no overall risk,” Taquet said. Nor were children at any greater risk of being diagnosed with anxiety and depression after Covid-19, “even in the first six months,” he said.\n\nBut there were disturbing findings when it came to other conditions. For example, children had a “twofold increased risk of epilepsy and seizures,” Taquet said, and a “threefold increased risk of a psychotic disorder diagnosis in two years after having Covid compared to those diagnosed with another respiratory tract infection.”\n\nIn the study of 10,000 children with a Covid-19 diagnosis, 260 had developed epilepsy and seizures within two years, compared with 130 out of 10,000 children diagnosed with another respiratory tract infection, which was a “twofold increased risk,” Taquet said,\n\nThere was a threefold increased risk of a psychotic disorder diagnosis in children two years after a Covid-19 infection, Taquet said. Yet “the absolute risk remains quite low,” he said, with 18 diagnosed cases of psychosis out of 10,000 children.\n\n“I think we need to be careful in the interpretation of the reported small increases in dementia and psychosis,” said Paul Garner, an emeritus professor in evidence synthesis in global health at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the UK. Garner was not involved in the study.\n\n“These are, in my opinion, more likely to be related to the societal upheaval and dystopia we have been living through rather than being a direct effect of the virus.”\n\nA long-term impact\n\nOverall, evidence from the study is “particularly worrisome,” Cardiff’s Sumner said, because even Covid-19 variants considered to be milder appear to have the same long-term consequences.\n\nIn addition, “some of these disorders will continue to have delay in diagnosis and treatment with healthcare systems that are struggling to deal with both Covid infections and backlogs of patient waiting lists,” Sumner added.\n\nThat reality matches the clinical experience of doctors such as Friedberg, who has been treating long Covid patients since not long after the pandemic began.\n\n“I’ve got severe post-Covid (patients) from the ancestral strain from March 2020, and I’ve got the same in people who developed it a few months ago.So I think it can be equally severe with any of these variants,” he said.\n\nYet Friedberg told CNN there have been “zero public policy decisions” about what happens after Covid-19.\n\n“The idea that maybe there’s this terrible thing that’s happening that we won’t appreciate until months or years later isn’t being addressed adequately,” Friedberg said.\n\n“Say kids just can’t run as much as they used to, or have seizure disorders now, or adults just can’t handle as many tasks of work or have trouble caring for their kids at home because they’ve just got brain fog, they’ve got chronic shortness of breath.\n\n“If that starts happening to, let’s say, 5% of the population each time there’s a Covid wave, that starts to add up.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/health/polio-paralysis-vaccine-health-wellness/index.html", "title": "Polio has reemerged in the US. Who should get a polio vaccine now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNew York’s governor has declared a state of emergency after health officials detected poliovirus in the wastewater of five counties – evidence the disease is circulating. The declaration also follows a report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of an unvaccinated person in Rockland County, New York, who was diagnosed with paralytic polio this summer – the first case identified in the United States in nearly a decade.\n\nUnderstandably, these events have sparked a lot of questions: Why does one case of polio worry officials? What does it mean to find poliovirus in wastewater? Who should be worried about contracting the disease? If someone had the vaccine years ago, are they still protected now?\n\nTo understand more about this disease, which most people alive today have never experienced, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.”\n\nCNN: So far, there has been only one documented case of paralysis due to poliovirus in New York. Why does one case worry health officials?\n\nDr. Leana Wen Bill Clark/AP\n\nDr. Leana Wen: An August report from the CDC said that “even a single case of paralytic polio represents a public health emergency in the United States.” This is for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, polio is a disease with the potential for very severe consequences. During its peak in the 1940s and 1950s, polio resulted in tens of thousands of children becoming paralyzed every year. Thousands died from the virus.\n\nThis changed with the introduction of vaccines that are highly effective – more than 99% effective at protecting against paralytic polio. Thanks to massive vaccination campaigns, the last incidence of wild-type polio occurred in 1979 – and it had been considered to be eliminated in the United States. The reemergence of such a disease, which can have such serious impacts, is a major threat.\n\nSecond, the one case of paralytic polio may be the tip of a large iceberg. Most cases of polio infection are asymptomatic and do not cause paralysis. Symptoms – which can include fatigue, fever and diarrhea – tend to be mild and can resemble those of other viruses. Public health officials are worried there are many other people who may be infected with polio and could be transmitting it unknowingly.\n\nThis is particularly concerning because Rockland County, where the recent paralytic case of the virus was diagnosed, has a polio vaccination rate of just 60%. In some parts of the county, the vaccination rate is as low as 37%. These numbers are far below the threshold needed for herd immunity, and that means there are a lot of individuals in the area who are vulnerable to polio infection and potential severe outcomes.\n\nCNN: What does it mean that poliovirus has been detected in the wastewater of five counties, including New York City?\n\nWen: Finding poliovirus in sewage means one of two things: That there are people actively infected with polio who are shedding the virus, or that the virus signal could be from people who recently received the oral polio vaccine (OPV). OPV is no longer given in the United States – since 2000, the version used in the US is the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is injected – but other countries are still using OPV, and it’s possible that travelers from those places are shedding virus from the vaccine.\n\nWastewater samples at a lab at Queens College on August 25 in New York City. Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn rare circumstances, the weakened virus from people who just received OPV could cause paralytic polio in unvaccinated individuals – which is a major reason why OPV is no longer used in the US.\n\nOne additional point of concern is that a wastewater sample from Nassau County on Long Island has been genetically linked to the paralytic polio case identified in Rockland County. (The two counties are not adjacent, rather approximately 40 miles apart.) This is further evidence of community spread that’s going largely undetected.\n\nCNN: How can people contract polio?\n\nWen: Polio is an infectious disease that can be transmitted in a number of ways. A primary route is fecal-oral, meaning someone could get polio if they come into contact with feces from an infected person. This could occur, especially in children, through putting objects like toys that have been contaminated with feces into the mouth.\n\nPoliovirus could also be transmitted through the respiratory route – for example, if someone who is infected coughs or sneezes and those droplets land around your mouth. It’s worth noting that people who are vaccinated could also contract polio and pass it on to others, though they are extremely well-protected from severe illness themselves.\n\nCNN: Should New Yorkers be worried about contracting polio?\n\nWen: Again, people who are vaccinated against polio are extremely well-protected from paralytic polio, and should not be concerned at this point. It should be pointed out, however, that while IPV is very good at preventing the most severe potential effects of the disease, people who received the vaccine could still be carriers of polio and could transmit it to others. Those at risk for serious outcomes are people who are unvaccinated and those who are incompletely vaccinated, including young children under 6 who have not yet completed their polio vaccine series.\n\nCNN: How many polio vaccines should someone receive?\n\nWen: The CDC recommends children receive four doses of IPV. The first is given at 2 months of age, the second at 4 months, the third between 6 and 18 months old and the fourth between 4 and 6 years old.\n\nAdults who have never been vaccinated against polio should receive three doses of IPV. The first should be given as soon as possible, the second one to two months after that and the third six to 12 months after the second.\n\nCNN: If someone had the vaccine years ago, are they still protected? Who should get a polio booster now?\n\nWen: The protection against severe disease remains strong for many years after immunization; it’s believed it probably lasts for a lifetime. There is no need for most vaccinated people to get more doses.\n\nHowever, if someone has not completed their original vaccine series, they should get their remaining doses. Some fully vaccinated people can also receive an additional lifetime booster of IPV under specific circumstances – for example, if they have direct contact with someone suspected of having polio or if they are health care workers with higher risk of exposure to people with the disease.\n\nCNN: What if you’re not sure whether you were vaccinated? Say you don’t recall getting the vaccine, and it’s been many years. Is there a blood test you can take to verify either way?\n\nWen: You could check with your primary care physician’s office or state health department to see whether they have records of your immunizations. If they don’t, and there is no other way for you to verify – for example, by asking parents or other relatives or caregivers – you should speak with your health care provider about getting the full vaccine series for polio now. There is no blood test that can reliably detect whether you’re fully vaccinated against polio.\n\nCNN: What if you or your family members haven’t yet gotten vaccinated against poliovirus?\n\nWen: People who have yet to receive any doses or are incompletely vaccinated should make sure to get their entire polio vaccine series right away. This is particularly important if they live in or around Rockland County in New York – but really everyone should get caught up with their routine immunizations.\n\nIt was a tragedy decades ago that so many children became permanently paralyzed and even died from polio.

It describes horrific and sometimes lethal acts including collective rapes and brutal public humiliation designed to sow chaos, enforce territorial boundaries and punish civilians for perceived disloyalty.\n\n“Rape has become a weapon,” said Arnaud Royer, director of BINUH’s human rights arm, in a press conference on Friday.\n\nAn anonymous victim of sexual abuse poses for a photo at the Doctors Without Borders' \"Pran men'm\" clinic in Delmas 33 comune, Port-au-Prince on November 19, 2021. Valerie Baeriswyl/AFP/Getty Images\n\nClashes between rival gangs have effectively isolated whole neighborhoods, trapped between “frontlines” of street warfare and unable to go to work or access food or water. Women who seek to cross those boundaries for daily survival risk attack. Even in their own neighborhoods, women and girls are coerced into sexual transactions by gang members controlling the area, the report finds.\n\nAnd although women have been the main focus of such attacks, the report notes that men and children of all sexes are also targeted, describing the attack of a 12-year-old boy during gang clashes in the Tabarre area in April 2022. “After being raped, the child was forcibly taken away by the assailants and, a few days later, his body was found, with a gunshot wound to the head, laying on a pile of garbage in an abandoned area,” it reads.\n\nStruggling with trauma and stigma – and likely aware that justice is out of reach – those who survive sexual attacks are reluctant to come forward. Haiti, therefore, lacks data to reflect the scale of sexual violence on its streets, the report notes.\n\nAs a cruel result, it adds, victims have not been prioritized by service providers.\n\n“We have to change our methodology,” Royer said.\n\nThe state calls for help\n\nHaiti has been thrown into chaos over the past year by relentless anti-government protests, financial crisis, rampant kidnappings and a recent resurgence of deadly cholera. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) this week reported there had been at least 35 deaths from the disease and hundreds of hospitalizations across the country since the start of the month.\n\nThe health care system is still struggling and hospital beds are filling up, PAHO said, adding that fuel shortages and ongoing civil unrest were “hindering emergency response operations.”\n\nLast week, the Haitian government took the notable step of requesting military assistance from the international community – a move condemned by the country’s main opposition coalition, the Montana Group.\n\nHaitian National Police have previously said that they are outgunned by criminals in the country. The flow of illicit weapons and ammunition into the country is “one of the main enablers of gang violence,” according to the UN report, which describes gang members in Port-au-Prince wielding military-grade sniper rifles, belt-fed machine guns and semi-automatic pistols.\n\nOn Friday, a US United Nations spokesperson told CNN that the US had circulated a draft UN Security Council resolution proposing an arms embargo, as well as financial and travel sanctions for those creating violence in Haiti.\n\n“Along with our close partner and co-penholder Mexico, the United States has circulated a draft resolution proposing specific measures to enable the Security Council to address the security challenges facing the people of Haiti, including a targeted arms embargo and financial sanctions and travel restrictions for those who foment violence in Haiti,” the statement read.\n\nEarlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also announced that the US is “working to increase and deploy in the coming days security assistance to the Haitian National Police to strengthen their capacity to counter gangs and re-establish a stable security environment under the rule of law.”\n\nThe US has already dispatched a high-level delegation to Port-au-Prince, and is sending a major Coast Guard cutter vessel to patrol the waters around the capital at the request of the Haitian government.\n\nFriday’s report calls on the Haitian state, led by embattled Prime Minister Ariel Henry, to recognize its responsibility to deliver basic health care and justice for victims.\n\n“Although the ongoing armed violence may reduce available resources, this does not exonerate the Haitian authorities from taking the necessary steps to achieving the realization of a minimum core obligations of the right to health and provide effective remedy and reparations for victims,” the report says.\n\nBut for now, as the nation flails, there appears to be little recourse for victims of sexual violence and no repercussions for perpetrators.\n\n“Given that state authorities are not here, the gang leader is the chief, the police and the judge,” the report says, quoting victims from gang-controlled areas in the capital.", "authors": ["Caitlin Hu"], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/health/paxlovid-rebound-contagious-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "Covid rebound: Coronavirus can be contagious during a Paxlovid ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story originally published on May 31, 2022.\n\nCNN —\n\nPeople who have a Covid-19 rebound after treatment with the antiviral drug Paxlovid can be contagious and may not know it because they might not have symptoms, researchers warn.\n\n“People who experience rebound are at risk of transmitting to other people, even though they’re outside what people accept as the usual window for being able to transmit,” said Dr. Michael Charness of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Boston.\n\nCharness and his colleagues recently collaborated with a team of researchers at Columbia University to look into cases of Covid-19 that return after Paxlovid treatment. He said they’ve found at least two instances in which people have transmitted to others when their infection recurs.\n\nIn one case, a 67-year-old man infected a 6-month-old after a half-hour near the child.\n\nThe man was 12 days past his first positive Covid-19 test. He had taken a five-day course of Paxlovid and was feeling better. He didn’t have any symptoms when he saw the baby, who was his grandson, but about eight hours later, he started to feel ill again.\n\nThe baby tested positive about three days later, as did both of his parents. Neither the baby nor its parents had any other close contacts before they got sick.\n\n“It indicates that you can transmit during rebound even before you develop symptoms,” Charness said. “And you know, we studied a small number of people. It’s certainly conceivable that there are other people out there who don’t have symptoms and still have a viral rebound.”\n\nIn another instance, a 63-year-old man infected two family members during three days of relapse after Paxlovid.\n\nTake precautions after Paxlovid\n\nBased on this research, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance last week for people experiencing Covid-19 rebound after Paxlovid.\n\nThe CDC said people who test positive again and whose symptoms come back after finishing their antiviral pills should restart their isolation period and isolate for five full days. The agency says people can end their isolation period after those five additional daysas long as their fever has been gone for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication and they’re feeling better. The agency also recommends that people wear a mask for 10 days after their symptoms come back.\n\nThe findings and guidance come as Paxlovid use has increased in the United States. According the White House, over the past two months, filled prescriptions for Paxlovid have climbed from about 27,000 a week to 182,000 a week.\n\nThe administration credits the increase to its test-to-treat program, which created one-stop hubs in grocery and drug stores where people could take a Covid-19 test and immediately receive and fill a prescription for antiviral medications. The antiviral drugs should be taken within the first few days of symptoms.\n\nThe drug works well. In clinical trials, Paxlovid reduced the odds that a person at risk of severe Covid-19 would need to be hospitalized by almost 90% compared with a placebo.\n\nFor that reason, the CDC says, early treatment with this medication is still recommended.\n\nAs helpful as it is, though, researchers say people should be aware the drug may not completely extinguish the infection.\n\nCharness and his co-authors have now collected at least 10 such cases of Covid-19 recurrence after Paxlovid. Half of them have come from just two families, leading the researchers to conclude that such cases are not all that rare.\n\nThe research is shared as a preprint. It has not been scrutinized by outside researchers or published in a medical journal.\n\nGenetic testing suggests that when people get a second round of Covid-19 after Paxlovid, it’s not because they’ve been infected by a different strain of the virus. There’s also no sign that the virus has changed or mutated to develop some kind of resistance to the drug.\n\nSo far, rebound cases have been mild. There haven’t been any reports of severe disease during a Covid-19 relapse. Because of this, the CDC says, there’s no reason to think that more treatment is needed.\n\nCause still not known\n\nWhy this might be happening is still a mystery.\n\nIn his studies, Charness said, the researchers watched the amount of virus in a person’s body – called their viral load – go down on Paxlovid treatment.\n\n“People take Paxlovid, and what we know it does very well is, it blocks viral replication,” he said. And so the levels of virus go down. But then in some people – no one knows how many, because not enough people have been studied – levels of the virus begin to climb again nine to 12 days after they first test positive, Charness said.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear that taht rebound is linked to Paxlovid. In studies of more than 2,200 Covid-19 patients, Pfizer, the company that makes the drug, said there were a few patients who had their Covid-19 come bouncing back after a negative test, but they were in the group that took Paxlovid as well as in those who got the placebo, suggesting that Covid just reappears in some people, even without treatment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nCharness’ team has done its own comparison study, however, and found something different. When researchers looked at 1,000 cases of Covid-19 diagnosed between December and March in players and support staff of the National Basketball Association who had not taken the drug, they didn’t find any cases of Covid-19 returning. This study is still unpublished.\n\nThey say more research is needed to understand whether there could be any connection to the drug.\n\nCharness said the fact that the infection can come back this way after treatment presents some questions. For one, would rebound be as common in people who started the drug later, maybe on day four or five after their first symptoms, after their immune systems have had longer to initially see the virus? Would a longer course of treatment – maybe taking the drug for six or seven days, rather than five – lower the risk that the virus would come back?\n\n“No one knows,” he said. “Somebody should be studying this.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/04/05/coronavirus-update-trump-surge-deaths-queen-pope-palm-sunday/5114188002/", "title": "Coronavirus update: President Trump hopeful; Boris Johnson in ...", "text": "The nation was bracing Sunday for its deadliest week in what the surgeon general called \"our Pearl Harbor moment\" as the trajectory of coronavirus cases continued its climb.

Earlier Sunday Surgeon General Jerome Adams said this week will be worse than last week, when almost 5,000 Americans died.\n\nWhen asked, Trump acknowledged the next two weeks will be \"very difficult.\"\n\n\"We all have to reach a certain point and that point is going to be a horrific point in terms of death,\" Trump said. \"But it's also a point at which things are going to start changing.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was also asked about the light at the end of the tunnel and if that message is incongruous with the message of the upcoming bad week. He said the messaging isn't contradictory.\n\n\"It has to do with what we explained before about the lag and when you look at the indications that Dr. Birx and the president we're talking about,\" Fauci said about the competing narratives. \"When you see a flattening out of cases. And you don't see the realizations of what that means until two weeks later.\"\n\nTrump blocks Fauci from answering hydroxychloroquine question\n\nA question about hydroxychloroquine resulted in a testy moment at Sunday's White House task force press briefing. A reporter asked Anthony Fauci his thoughts on the effectiveness of the anti-malaria drug in treating coronavirus patients, and Trump interrupted before the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases could answer.\n\n“He’s answered that question 15 times,” said Trump, who previously spent part of the press conference touting the potential of the drug.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Fauci did answer a question about hydroxychloroquine when he was on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n“The data are really, just, at best, suggestive,” he said. “There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect. So, I think in terms of science, I don't think we could definitively say it works.”\n\nThe differing opinions aren't new. Axios reported Saturday there was a contentious meeting among the coronavirus task force, with the benefits of hydroxychloroquine at the center.\n\nAccording to the CDC, “There are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.”\n\nThe FDA’s website also has an aswer for people who ask if they should take chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat coronavirus.\n\n“No,” an answer on the FDA’s FAQ about coronavirus says. “Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are available in the United States by prescription only for the prevention or treatment of malaria and certain inflammatory conditions such as lupus. The FDA is working closely with other government agencies and academic centers to determine whether chloroquine can be used to prevent COVID-19 or treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.\n\nSurgeon General Jerome Adams warns of 'Pearl Harbor moment'\n\nCOVID-19 has been blamed for almost 5,000 American deaths in the last week, but Surgeon General Jerome Adams says this week will be worse.\n\n“This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it’s not going to be localized,\" Adams said on Fox News Sunday. But Adams also noted that Spain and Italy began intensive mitigation efforts about a month ago, and that the U.S. was not far behind. Those countries are now starting to see a slowdown in cases, Adams said. In the U.S., Washington state and California are seeing indications that the crisis is leveling off, he said.\n\n\"As hard as this week is going to be, there is a light at the end of the tunnel if everyone does their part for the next 30 days,” Adams said.\n\nAmerican suspends most NYC flights\n\nAmerican Airlines is suspending most of its flights to the New York metropolitan area on Tuesday as travel demand evaporates to the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAmerican will operate just 13 daily flights to LaGuardia, JFK and Newark airports through May 6, compared with 271 a year ago.\n\n\"As coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in New York City and the surrounding region continue to increase, along with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for travel to the area, the demand for flights to the New York area is rapidly evaporating,'' David Seymour, American's senior vice president of operations, said in a statement late Sunday.\n\n-- Dawn Gilbertson\n\nBritish Prime Minister Johnson hospitalized\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose government has been accused of not reacting quickly enough to the coronavirus threat, was hospitalized on the day his country took over as Europe's deadliest hot spot.\n\nJohnson's office said he was admitted to a hospital because he still has COVID-19 symptoms -- including a fever -- 10 days after testing positive. A 10 Downing Street spokesperson called the move \"a precautionary step.''\n\nJohnson, 55, ordered a nationwide lockdown March 23, at least a week later that fellow European countries like Italy, Spain and France.\n\nBritain recorded 708 new coronavirus deaths Saturday, compared with 631 for Italy, which has the highest number of fatalities in the world with nearly 16,000. Britain had another 600-plus reported deaths Sunday, is now approaching 5,000 and continues to see its mortality rate increase. On Sunday it surpassed 48,000 cases.\n\nAfter 2 employees die near Chicago, Walmart steps up cleaning efforts\n\nTwo Walmart employees in the Chicago area died from the coronavirus, prompting the retailer to adopt additional safety measures in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nNeither of the workers had been at the store for at least a week, Walmart said in a statement on Sunday. It's unclear how long either of the employees had the virus. It's also unclear whether COVID-19 was contracted on the job.\n\nThe victims were Wando Evans, 51, and 48-year-old Phillip Thomas, Patch.com reported. Both had underlying health conditions, medical examiners told the online publication. The store in question passed a third-party safety and environmental compliance test as well as a health department inspection within the past week, according to the company.\n\nThe discount retailer also said it was changing the way it approaches sanitation following the deaths, including hiring a third-party company to clean and sanitize high-touch surfaces at the store.\n\n-- Dalvin Brown\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo: Deaths, hospitalizations dip in state\n\nThe number of deaths, hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions in New York state have dipped slightly in recent days, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Cuomo said it was too soon to determine whether the state had reached the \"apex\" of the patient curve. He also said a plateau might have been reached that could last an unknown length of time. The state's death toll of more than 4,000 represents close to half the U.S. deaths since the crisis began. Cuomo said 2,500 hospital beds being set up at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City will provide a crucial safety valve for hospitals.\n\n\"The system is over capacity all across the board,\" he said. \"That is putting a tremendous amount of stress on the healthcare system.''\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci worries about recurrence of coronavirus infection\n\nOne of the country’s leading experts on infectious diseases is already concerned about future recurrences of the coronavirus.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that “unless we get this globally under control, there’s a very good chance that it’ll assume a seasonal nature.”\n\nTo prevent that from happening, Fauci said, research and the development of treatments will be essential.\n\n“We need to be prepared that, since it will be unlikely to be completely eradicated from the planet, that as we get into next season we may see the beginning of a resurgence,” Fauci said.\n\n-- Lorenzo Reyes\n\nEmpty churches for Palm Sunday, even for Pope Francis at St. Peter's Basilica\n\nChristian churches around the world were mostly empty for Palm Sunday services. Pope Francis celebrated a service at St. Peter's Basilica in front of a few aides, prelates and nuns scattered at social distancing intervals. St. Peter's Square, which normally would be packed with tens of thousands of the faithful armed with palm fronds for the event, was virtually deserted. “The tragedy we are experiencing summons us to take seriously the things that are serious, and not to be caught up in those that matter less,” Francis said in his homily.\n\nPalm Sunday, which falls one week before Easter, marks the ceremonial entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem before a palm-waving crowd. In Jerusalem, a traditional procession from the Mount of Olives into the city that normally draws thousands was limited to small group of religious leaders.\n\nQueen Elizabeth gives historic address\n\nQueen Elizabeth II delivered a historic address to England on Sunday in a televised broadcast recorded from her isolation at Windsor Castle with one cameraman dressed in protective clothing. The queen, making only the fourth address in her 68-year reign, encouraged the country to rise to the challenge as the death toll from the coronavirus continues to rapidly climb. Almost 5,000 Brits have died, including more than 700 on Saturday. Her son and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, reportedly is doing well after himself battling COVID-19.\n\n\"I hope in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,'' said the queen, 93. \"And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.”\n\n-- Hannah Yasharoff\n\n2 Coral Princess passengers die as cruise ship docks at Port Miami\n\nTwo passengers from the Coral Princess cruise ship have died, although the cause of death has not been disclosed. The vessel docked in Miami on Saturday with at least a dozen people on board who have tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nDisembarkation of the Coral Princess at Port Miami is expected to span several days. Healthy passengers who are fit to fly will be transferred directly from the ship to Miami International Airport for flights home, a Princess Cruises spokesperson said.\n\nPassengers who are exhibiting any signs of respiratory illness or who are recovering from being ill will be kept on board until they're cleared by the ship's medical personnel.\n\nPrincess Cruises has been at the eye of the coronavirus storm with two of its ships, the Diamond Princess and the Grand Princess, experiencing major outbreaks of the virus in two months.\n\n-- Rasha Ali\n\nItalian officials warn about regression\n\nItaly has steadily showed progress that may suggest the apex of infections has passed, but officials are now pleading for residents to adhere to the national lockdown.\n\nThe country reported 525 deaths on Sunday, its lowest daily total since March 19, when 427 were recorded, according to the country’s civil protection agency.\n\nAfter photos were published that showed large crowds shopping in cities like Naples, Rome and Genoa, however, health minister Roberto Speranza said on RAI state television that Italians ran the risk of reversing positive momentum.\n\nAccording to Lombardy vice governor Fabrizio Sala, cellphone data indicated that 38% of the region’s residents were moving about, the highest that total has been since March 20.\n\nSpain, similarly, also has showed a steady decline in infections and deaths. According to the Ministry of Health, the rate of new deaths fell for the third consecutive day, with 674 on Sunday, down from 809 on Saturday. The country announced 6,023 new infections, a drop of 1,003 – or 14.3 % – from Saturday. There have been 130,759 cases in Spain, second-most of any country in the world.\n\n-- Lorenzo Reyes\n\nBronx Zoo tiger has COVID-19\n\nA tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for COVID-19 after multiple animals developed virus symptoms, federal officials confirmed. Nadia, a four-year-old Malayan tiger, was tested after her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions developed a dry cough. The animals are all expected to recover.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the tests Sunday and is working with the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC) along with state animal and public health leaders to determine if animals, at the zoo or in other areas, should be tested for cornavirus.\n\n\"This is the first case of its kind,'' the USDA said in a statement.\n\nPublic health officials believe the animals became sick after being exposed to an infected employee \"who was actively shedding virus.''\n\nThe statement said people with COVID-19 should limit contact with their pets and other animals until more is known about the virus.\n\n-- Jessie Gomez, Bergen Record\n\nMayor, Georgia governor clash over order opening beaches\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp was defending his shelter-in-place order that also opened the state beaches after a mayor ripped the \"reckless mandate.\"\n\nKemp's executive order allows exercise, with social distancing, on the beaches. Tybee Island officials had closed their beaches more than two weeks ago, citing the coronavirus pandemic. Mayor Shirley Sessions said beach parking lots will remain closed and that she will pursue legal options to upend Kemp's mandate.\n\nKemp responded on social media that officers \"report no issues as they patrol the beach and surrounding areas. Beachgoers are mostly locals and complying with social distancing orders.\"\n\nHow many cases of coronavirus in US?\n\nThe United States had more than 324,000 cases of coronavirus as of Sunday afternoon and more than 9,100 deaths. The graphic below shows the number of new cases each day.\n\nChild care centers dealing with 'devastating' blow\n\nThe pandemic could deal a death blow to swaths of the nation’s child care “system” that have survived on the brink since long before the crisis, experts say. Child care is expensive to operate and to provide, yet families are largely left to pay for it themselves while providers eke out a living on meager profits. “The economics are fragile in good times,” said Rhian Evans Allvin, chief executive officer at NAEYC, a professional association for child care providers. “When a crisis like this hits, it is devastating to the child care field.”\n\n– Lillian Mongeau, The Hechinger Report\n\nNew York getting ventilators from China, Oregon\n\nNew York is getting 1,000 ventilators from China to aid its battle against the virus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a press briefing. Another 500 of the breathing machines will be moved from upstate New York to downstate hospitals being hit hardest by COVID-19, Cuomo said. Oregon is also sending 140 ventilators to New York, where thousands of new infections are confirmed daily.\n\n\"We’re all in the same battle here, and the battle is stopping the spread of the virus,\" Cuomo said.\n\nThe Chinese government facilitated the effort connected to Alibaba, the massive online retailer in China, Cuomo said.\n\n– David Robinson\n\nMore news and information from USA TODAY\n\n• Track the coronavirus:Maps shows how outbreak spread across the US\n\n• Crime rates plummet amid the coronavirus pandemic, but not everyone is safer in their home, a USA TODAY investigation finds.\n\n• Free school lunch programs face terrible choice: Fight coronavirus or students' hunger\n\n• 'The damage was done': A huge Texas facility for disabled adults failed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, a warning to group care setting across the nation.\n\n• Coronavirus interrupted our lives.

Authorities have been criticized for allowing 2,700 passengers and crew to disembark when the ship docked March 19 in Sydney. Eleven passengers have died and the ship remains in Australian waters. Authorities in Australia have confirmed 342 cases of COVID-19 in passengers who got infected while on the ship or before boarding. Hundreds more infections have been linked to the ship. Not all crew members disembarked, and an unknown number are ill.\n\n– Curtis Tate and Rasha Ali\n\nCoronavirus: Symptoms and prevention\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as a fever and a dry cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover.\n\nTo avoid becoming infected and to help stop the spread of the disease, wash your hands frequently with soap and water, lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under fingernails before rinsing off.

Tobacco smoke can cause cancer, stroke and heart disease, with smoking-related illnesses costing the NHS £17 billion a year, according to campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (ASH).\n\nAn independent government-commissioned review, which last year recommended proposals similar to those announced by Sunak, argued that tackling tobacco use and supporting smokers to quit would help prevent 15 types of cancer – including lung cancer, throat cancer and acute myeloid leukaemia. Recent data showed that one in four deaths from all cancers were estimated to be from smoking.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's \"Today\" programme, the prime minister said his proposals represented the \"biggest public health intervention in a generation\", a claim backed up by England's chief medical officer, Sir Chris Whitty, who stressed how beneficial the health improvements would be.\n\nCon: black markets\n\nSimon Clark, of smokers' lobby group Forest, told the BBC that \"creeping prohibition won't stop young adults smoking\" but it will \"simply drive the sale of tobacco underground and consumers will buy cigarettes on the black market where no-one pays tax and products are completely unregulated\".\n\nThe illicit trade in tobacco products \"poses major health, economic and security concerns around the world\", according to the World Health Organization, which estimates 1 in every 10 cigarettes and tobacco products consumed globally is illicit.\n\nWriting for The Conversation, Dr Brendan Gogarty, of the University of Tasmania, argued that \"laws that rely on prohibition to reduce the prevalence and harm from drugs generally fail to achieve their aims\".\n\nPro: avoiding poverty\n\nSmoking causes a disproportionate burden on the most disadvantaged families and communities, last year's independent review found. The average smoker in the North East of England spends over 10% of their income on tobacco, compared to just over 6% in the South East.\n\nThis mirrors research from 2015 conducted by University of Nottingham, which found parents who smoke were \"plunging nearly half a million children into poverty\", The Independent reported.\n\nAs smokers quit, said Sudyumna Dahal for The Conversation, household budgets \"become easier, facilitating what a study in the British Medical Journal describes as an income transfer from male smokers to females and other family members\".\n\nTherefore, argue anti-smoking campaigners, banning smoking would bring greater benefits to the less well-off.\n\nCon: risk to civil liberties\n\nSmokers and the groups who advocate on their behalf argue that their habit is a civil right, even if it kills the smoker. In a report published in 2019, the smokers’ group Forest argued that \"smokers are the canaries for civil liberties\".\n\nIt added that the call for a ban \"directly violates the harm principle that assumes a person has autonomy over their own life and body as long as they do not hurt other people\".\n\nAs The Spectator editor Fraser Nelson pointed out on Twitter, plans to phase out the sale of cigarettes could lead to the absurd situation where pensioners will have to produce ID to prove which side of the ever-moving line of legality they are on.\n\n\"I'd love to live in a smoke-free world,\" wrote Rachael Bletchly in the Daily Mirror. \"I wish people would stop wrecking their health with cigarettes. But I don't think it's the job of politicians to police other grown-ups' filthy habits. And I fear that Rishi Sunak's new smoking ban is just well-meaning, populist puff.\"\n\nPro: environmental protection\n\nCigarette smoking has several negative environmental impacts and banning smoking would bring these to an end. Smokers release pollution into the atmosphere, cigarette butts litter the environment, and the toxic chemicals in the residues cause soil and water pollution.\n\nTobacco is commonly planted in rainforest areas and has contributed to major deforestation, said Conserve Energy Future.\n\nA 2013 report in the journal Tobacco Control found that cigarette manufacturing “consumes scarce resources in growing, curing, rolling, flavouring, packaging, transport, advertising and legal defence” and “also causes harms from massive pesticide use”.\n\nCon: losing tax revenue\n\nTaxation on smoking raises more than £8.8 billion per year for the Treasury, noted Politics.co.uk. The TaxPayers’ Alliance rejected the argument that smokers also cost the taxman more due to their health burden, arguing that smokers who suffer major health problems are more likely to die prematurely, reducing expenditure on state pensions and other age-related benefits.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Harold Maass", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/957924/why-might-uk-scrap-anti-obesity-drive", "title": "Why might UK scrap anti-obesity drive? | The Week", "text": "Liz Truss could cancel the government’s anti-obesity measures after ministers ordered an official review of policies deterring people from eating junk food.\n\nThe Guardian said the review could “pave the way” for the new PM to lift the ban on sugary products being sold at supermarket checkouts and “buy one get one free” multi-buy offers, and scrap restrictions on advertising certain products on TV before the 9pm watershed.\n\nIt may also lead to the scrapping of calorie information on cafe and restaurant menus, and could even lead to the abolition of the sugar tax, which was launched in 2018.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The Guardian reported that there “doesn’t seem to be any appetite” from Thérèse Coffey – the new health secretary and deputy prime minister – for “nanny state stuff”.\n\nTruss’s rumoured plans would be likely to “prompt major concerns from health campaigners”, said Sky News, and could “precipitate a clash with some MPs within the Tory party”.\n\nIt could also see the new PM face the “wrath of retailers who have already spent millions” making changes to displays in their stores based on Johnson’s plans, according to trade magazine The Grocer.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/china/960996/china-disillusioned-youth", "title": "China's Gen Z problem | The Week", "text": "One name, more than almost any other, has circulated on Chinese social media in recent months, said Laura He on CNN (New York): that name is Kong Yiji.\n\nA highly educated fellow, Kong sunk into poverty because he couldn’t forsake the “haughty manner of a scholar”, and refused to use manual labour to change his situation. Not that he ever existed. Kong Yiji was the main character in a 1919 short story by the celebrated Chinese writer Lu Xun. A century later, however, his story has begun to resonate with China’s disillusioned youth, who find themselves facing a similar dilemma: pursue a white-collar career and risk unemployment, or settle for the kind of blue-collar job they’d hoped to avoid by getting a good education.

The mismatch in expectations is doing real harm to China’s already sluggish economy. The jobless rate for 16- to 24-year-olds now exceeds 20%. In the cities, one in five are out of work. A huge number are college graduates. To make things worse, lots of small-and medium-sized businesses that usually hire graduates were destroyed by China’s harsh Covid lockdowns, said Cindy Yu in Foreign Policy (Washington). Yet demand for such positions keeps rising as more and more people go to university: a record 12 million will graduate in June. To delay their entry into the jobs market, many are now turning to postgraduate degrees.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

President Xi’s plan to combat this crisis is to send China’s brightest young minds to the countryside, said Katrin Büchenbacher in Neue Zürcher Zeitung (Zurich). Just as Mao Zedong once did, he is urging young urbanites to take on menial jobs to revitalise the Chinese economy in rural areas, where poverty is still widespread. And provincial governments such as Guangdong’s, which last month pledged to help 300,000 graduates and young entrepreneurs find work in villages, have responded to his call.\n\nBut it’s a strategy that could prove socially explosive. China’s urban youth have become accustomed to a degree of personal freedom in recent decades; they won’t take kindly to being “banished” from the cities that the new generation of middle-class Chinese overwhelmingly call home.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Rebekah Evans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/politics/liz-truss-xi-jinping-what-matters/index.html", "title": "A democracy stumbles, while an autocracy digs in | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

She couldn’t survive in power after pushing a fringe tax cut plan that roiled markets and spooked her Conservative Party colleagues. Read CNN’s full report.\n\nSo much drama\n\nIt’s a story of a leader’s failure to launch and a public humiliation that includes the sacking of her longtime ally, a blistering resignation letter from her Home Secretary and allegations of the literal manhandling of members of Parliament by Truss aides as they tried to block a ban on fracking.\n\nTruss had the shortest-ever run as prime minister, and she’s the second straight leader to fail since the last British election after the disgraced Boris Johnson announced his resignation back in July.\n\nBoris, anyone?\n\nTruss won the monthslong fight to succeed him, but now Johnson is among the Conservatives who could try to succeed her. He is weighing asking Conservative Party members for his job back. Meet the contenders.\n\nThe details of who exactly will choose her successor are not yet clear. It could be that Conservative MPs whittle the field to a few candidates and party members pick the next prime minister.\n\nFewer than 150,000 Conservative Party members voted when Truss was elevated to the top spot in September. That’s part of the British system, where the majority party and not the people pick the prime ministers.\n\nA new leader is expected to be announced on October 28. Many millions of British voters don’t get a say for years, until the next general election takes place in January 2025 at the latest.\n\nWhen will the British people get a say?\n\nThe Conservative prime minister, whoever it is, could call for a new election, but he or she is not likely to when faith in Conservatives is shaken. The British House of Commons could force an election, but that would require the majority Conservatives to turn on their own government.\n\nJohnson called for that last general election, in 2019, at a moment of power for Conservatives. To call for one now, before they have to, would likely hand over control of the government.\n\nThe opposition, led by the Labour leader Keir Starmer, can only gripe.\n\n“They do not have a mandate to put the country through yet another experiment,” he said. “Britain is not their personal fiefdom to run how they wish.”\n\nBut under the rules, the Conservatives could get another two-plus years before the people get their say.\n\nNo alternatives in China\n\nThe current British predicament might seem chaotic and messy, particularly to the vast majority of voters who may not have a say in picking the leader of the country until 2025 at the latest.\n\nBut the instability of not having a strong prime minister and the ugliness of open failure are certainly preferable to having a leader for life, which is what the Chinese people may be seeing in the autocrat Xi Jinping.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party’s ongoing 20th Party Congress is likely to install Xi as China’s leader for a third five-year term after he earlier engineered the changing of party rules to remove term limits.\n\nOne party. No dissent\n\nIn China’s hierarchical one-party system, nearly 2,300 delegates are chosen from more than 96 million party members to attend the Congress. CNN’s Simone McCarthy explains that their vote to select a leader is seen as a formality, and the real decision-making is done by an elite circle behind closed doors, long before the Congress begins. Read more from CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter.\n\nThere’s little doubt about the outcome of the Congress and little room for dissent in a country that strictly censors protest and speech.\n\nProtest is rare\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows rare protest in Beijing as Chinese leader is set to extend his reign 02:09 - Source: CNN\n\nCNN did report on banners protesting Xi’s continued Covid-19 lockdowns and authoritarian rule that were unfurled from overpasses in Beijing, according to postings on social media.\n\nFrom CNN’s report:\n\nPublic protest against the top leadership is extremely rare in China, especially in the run-up to important political meetings, when authorities turn Beijing into a fortress to maintain security and stability. … Xi, the most powerful and authoritarian Chinese leader in decades, has waged a sweeping crackdown to crush dissent, both within the party and in wider society.\n\nChinese stocks tumbled in New York and Hong Kong in part because Xi, in two-hour opening remarks, did not back down from the strict zero-Covid policy that has halted daily life in China, arrested growth in the country and continued to warp worldwide supply chains.\n\nThe expansion plans of autocrats\n\nXi also struck a more aggressive tone toward Taiwan, the democratically run island China views as its own.\n\nThe US has said it respects the One China policy whereby China views Taiwan as part of China, but President Joe Biden has also made clear the US would respond if China was to invade Taiwan.\n\nThe distinctions take on new importance given Russia’s war on Ukraine. Another country led by an autocrat – Vladimir Putin, who changed the rules to stay in power – Russia this week declared martial law in Ukrainian areas it claimed after sham referendums.\n\nThe alternatives\n\nLooking at China and Russia, which are not free, Americans can be thankful they have a say in their government at all.\n\nLooking at the UK, a free democracy where voters are likely locked out of choosing their leader for the next few years despite the tumult of multiple leadership changes that read like a farce, Americans might be thankful for their regular elections. There’s one coming up in November! Please vote and feel free to protest!\n\nMarkets calling BS on Reaganomics\n\nSpeaking of the US election, on Wednesday, I wrote about how Republicans would address inflation if they win control of the House or Senate.\n\nI did not speak to the University of Michigan professor and economist Justin Wolfers in time for that report, but I did catch him just after Truss announced her resignation. He saw some important economic lessons to draw from the spectacular failure of her tax cut plan, which was rejected before it could be enacted.\n\nHere’s what Wolfers said:\n\n“What I found most interesting is that she sort of tried to implement a – supply side would be one word, Reaganesque would be another word – set of policies. That, of course, is very much what certain wings of the Republican Party are very interested in. And one typically claims that markets will like that. You would expect markets to like it. But actually even financial markets thought that these claims that these big tax cuts pay for themselves was just absolute bollocks.\n\nI think it changes the terms of the debate around big tax cuts. The claim that you’ve often heard, particularly in the US, has been the more we give rich people tax cuts, it will spur so much entrepreneurship they’ll pay for themselves.\n\nWe heard that talk before with both the Bush and the Trump tax cuts.\n\nAnd you’ve got the actual people betting billions of dollars here saying that seems like BS.”", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Isobel Frodsham/AP\n\nStott’s transition from athlete to climate activist was a more gradual process, founded upon his lifelong love of the outdoors, similar to Pocock who initially worked as a conservationist following his retirement from rugby.\n\nBefore joining Extinction Rebellion, Stott co-founded a group called Champions for Earth composed of British athletes to advocate for climate action.\n\n“Sport has this incredible reach,” he tells CNN. “It gives people a shared emotional experience that kind of connects them in a really strong way.”\n\nSimilarly, Pocock’s senate campaign was not his first foray into the political world; his rugby career was marked by activism.\n\nIn 2014, he chained himself to mining equipment to protest a new coal mine at Maules Creek in New South Wales, while he and his now wife did not marry until same-sex marriage became legal in Australia.\n\n“I knew what it was like to be that young kid that idolized rugby players,” he says to CNN.\n\n“If I could use whatever platform I had while I was playing to actually talk about these issues that I thought were important and could further the conversation with young people, then I was willing to do that.”\n\n‘My athlete mindset kicked in’\n\nAs the climate crisis becomes more pronounced, Pocock, Stott and Baldwin have utilized these platforms and drawn upon all their sporting experience to intensify their campaigning.\n\n“You realize a bunch of skills that you’ve spent thousands of hours developing, you will never use again,” Pocock says wryly.\n\n“That’s sort of totally useless for the rest of your life.”\n\nAlthough tackling, jackaling and passing might not be useful in a senate campaign, other skills that Pocock developed in rugby proved key to his success such as working with people who hold different views to pursue the best interests of a team.\n\n“You come from different backgrounds, have different religious beliefs, political persuasions, but have some sort of shared goal. And that can be a really powerful thing,” he says.\n\nMastering this broad coalition allowed Pocock to win in a territory that was previously unwinnable for anyone other than Labor or the Liberals – the two largest parties in Australia.\n\nPocock held a series of forums he called 'Politics in the park.' Lincoln Magee\n\nPocock’s campaign was rooted in community organizing, with forums and events he named ‘Politics in the park’ offering opportunities for people to engage with policies.\n\n“It really was about connecting with people,” Pocock says. “Meeting with community organizations … finding out what the issues are and then actually sitting down and talking to experts.”\n\n“And you find for a lot of these problems, there are solutions. We really need the political will to actually do them.”\n\nLikewise, drawing upon his experience in canoeing has informed much of Stott’s activism. “My athlete mindset kicked in,” he says.\n\n“We’ve got a goal here; a really clear goal that we need to save our planet for future generations … and Extinction Rebellion had a really clear goal.”\n\nExtinction Rebellion has used public disruption and unlawful demonstrations to demand the UK government reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 and establish a citizens’ assembly to consult on climate justice.\n\n“Also then as an athlete, you look for the most effective methods that are going to send you towards your goal,” Stott adds, “and peaceful civil disobedience was proven in history to be the most effective method.”\n\nThis approach has given rise to the group’s trademark, disruptive tactics such as blocking traffic in London, blockading oil refineries and widely covered arrests of its peaceful protestors.\n\nStott was arrested after climbing on top of an oil tanker. Andrea Domeniconi\n\n“Most people, and I was absolutely the same, would never dream of breaking the law … But in this case, I believe, motivated entirely by care, the concern for others and a desire to do the right thing, it just makes so much sense,” says Stott.\n\nExtinction Rebellion’s extreme tactics have drawn attention to the urgency of the crisis.\n\nWeeks after the group’s first protest in 2019 which disrupted much of central London, the UK parliament declared a climate emergency.\n\nIts approach has also drawn criticism from many quarters: the British government, other activists for its lack of diversity and the British public of whom just 15% approve, according to a YouGov poll.\n\nREAD: Why climate activists aren’t buying the FIFA World Cup’s ‘green’ claims\n\n“I’ve been asked multiple times by journalists, ‘Are you not worried about your reputation,’ but really I’m just worried about safeguarding a future for my son,” Baldwin says.\n\n“It seemed like the morally right thing to be doing in this instance was literally to step out in front of the system itself.”\n\n‘Telling the more hopeful story’\n\nCampaigning inside and outside the system produces different effects.\n\nPocock’s goals, constrained by acting within government, are somewhat more modest than those of Extinction Rebellion, aiming for a net zero Australian economy by 2050 with a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 – but this is a trade-off worth making for him.\n\nPocock also led The Cool Down campaign which saw over 470 Australian athletes call for more climate action. Lincoln Magee\n\n“When it comes to the big problems we face, individual choices and actions are important, but ultimately they have to be scaled by government to be able to respond in the timeframe needed,” he says.\n\nBy marshaling government policy, Pocock aims to tell “the more hopeful story about what our future could look like.”\n\nFor Australia – a country rocked by wildfires and floods – the dangers of the climate crisis are all too evident but action that tackles these risks could also unlock new opportunities in industries like green steel and green hydrogen, Pocock says.\n\nWorking in government has its own drawbacks too; its wheels move slowly and there are limited resources.\n\n“The climate crisis is happening right now,” Baldwin says of her decision to campaign outside the system. “And we absolutely have to act now in order to stop it.”", "authors": ["Issy Ronald Cnn Video Amy Li", "Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/956933/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-1-june-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 1 June 2022 | The Week", "text": "1. Pressure mounts on PM\n\nLord Geidt, Boris Johnson’s ethics adviser, has threatened to quit over the lockdown parties scandal, saying there are “legitimate” questions over whether the PM broke the ministerial code. Johnson and his allies have launched an emergency effort to lobby wavering MPs as senior Conservatives believe the PM could imminently face a vote of confidence in his leadership.

The transport secretary said the government had “done its part”, including giving £8bn to the aviation industry during the pandemic. Travel bosses said they wanted ministers to change employment rules so they could validate people for jobs using records held by HMRC, to speed up the process.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Brit in Ukraine speaks out\n\nBritish citizens who travelled to Ukraine to fight are being treated as “cannon-fodder”, according to a teenage volunteer. Ben Atkin, 18, the youngest-known Brit to join the war, told Channel 4 News: “You can’t trust these people to look after you. It’s disorganised mayhem, you are ill-equipped, you’re poorly armed… You will be used as cannon-fodder.” The Times said there have been claims that 20 British citizens have died in the conflict, but the Foreign Office believes the figure to be much lower.\n\nThe foreign fighters joining the war in Ukraine\n\n4. Starmer sent questionnaire\n\nKeir Starmer and Angela Rayner have been sent questionnaires by detectives investigating whether they broke lockdown laws with a gathering which featured beer and curry last year. The Labour leader, who has promised to resign if he is fined for breaching the law, said he and his team were working on the night in question when they stopped for something to eat. Social distancing rules were in place at the time, including a ban on indoor mixing between households, but there was an exemption for work purposes.\n\nWill ‘beergate’ spell last orders for Keir Starmer?\n\n5. Welby calls for Andrew forgiveness\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury has said that the Queen was “fully entitled” to have been accompanied by Prince Andrew to Prince Philip’s memorial service earlier this year. Speaking to ITV, Justin Welby called on people “to step back a bit” and said the Queen’s second son was seeking to make amends having settled his sexual abuse lawsuit, adding: “I think that’s a very good thing.” Andrew stepped down from public life earlier this year after agreeing to settle with Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexual abuse.\n\nWhat next for Prince Andrew after sex abuse case settlement?\n\n6. Violence at GP surgeries rises\n\nCriminal acts of violence at GP surgeries across the UK have almost doubled in five years and police are now recording an average of three violent incidents at general practices every day, said The Guardian. Workers are facing unprecedented assaults, abuse and aggression by patients, amid a perfect storm of soaring demand and staff shortages. Security measures such as CCTV, panic buttons and screens at reception areas are now more common at GP surgeries.\n\n7. Bradford wins City of Culture race\n\nBradford has won the contest to be named the UK’s City of Culture for 2025. The Yorkshire city will follow Coventry, the current holder of the title, and those behind the successful bid believe it will generate £700m and create 3,000 jobs. The leader of Bradford council said the win will bring “so many opportunities” to the area. The final shortlist for the honour comprised of Bradford, County Durham, Southampton and Wrexham County Borough.\n\n8. PM ‘failing to level up’\n\nNew data has led to claims that Boris Johnson has failed in his “defining mission” to level up Britain, said The Telegraph. GDP in London surged by 2.3% in the third quarter of 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in contrast to a 1.2% slump in the North East. Regional data published by the ONS also showed GDP falling in the West Midlands, East Midlands and East of England – regions the PM had pledged to “level up” as part of his efforts to address regional inequality.\n\n9. Three jabs best for Covid\n\nA major study has found that three doses of the same Covid vaccine or a combination of jabs work equally well in preventing infections. A global analysis of data from more than 100m people has confirmed that the number of doses is the key to boosting immunity rather than jab combinations. Meanwhile, Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, has told The Guardian that Covid infection rates “are not going to get down to very low numbers again in our lifetimes”.\n\nWhat South Africa can tell us about the future of Covid\n\n10. Polls find Sussexes are unpopular\n\nThe popularity of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex is at an all-time low, according to two new polls. A survey by JL Partners found just 27% of British adults had a positive opinion of Prince Harry while just 22%, thought well of Meghan Markle. Another study, by YouGov, found the couple’s favourability rating has never been worse, with almost two-thirds holding a negative view of them.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nWhen Russian President Vladimir Putin dials into the virtual BRICS summit hosted by Beijing on Thursday, it will be his first time attending a forum with the heads of major economies since launching an invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.\n\nFor Putin, this could offer a welcome picture: his face beamed onscreen alongside other leaders whose countries make up this acronymous grouping: China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, and South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa – a signal that Russia, though battered by sanctions and remonstrations for the invasion, is not alone.\n\nIt’s a message that may resonate even more clearly as China and Russia, weeks before the invasion, declared their own relationship to have “no limits,” and as each of the BRICS leaders have avoided condemning Russia outright, even as they hold varying levels of interest in not being seen to endorse its actions – and run foul of Western friends.\n\nBelow the surface, Putin’s invasion is likely to throw another complication into BRICS, a more than a decade-old grouping of major emerging economies, which already suffers from mistrust between members and mismatched ideologies.\n\nBut the decision by the group to press ahead with its 14th annual summit does reflect a view held by BRICS countries on the global order and, by extension, the situation in Ukraine, that departs from that of the West, experts say.\n\n“We’re talking about some very major economies whose leadership is willing to be seen with Putin, even if it is only on a virtual platform,” said Sushant Singh, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research (CPR) in New Delhi.\n\n“The fact that Putin is welcome, he’s not a pariah, he’s not being pushed out – and this is a normal engagement, which has taken place every year and it’s still taking place – that is a big plus for Putin,” he said.\n\nWhile the countries may argue that engaging Russia is better than not, the optics only become sharper in contrast. The BRICS summit is followed days later by the meeting of a bloc of the world’s leading advanced economies, the Group of Seven, which have been united in their voice against Russian aggression, and kicked Moscow out of their bloc following its annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nTurbulent times\n\nUnlike the G7, BRICS is expected to tread carefully when it comes to Ukraine at Thursday’s summit, likely speaking in favor of peaceful resolution, even as its members may carefully call for Western countries to examine the impact of their sanctions on the global economy, observers say.\n\nBeijing – this year’s host and by far the most economically powerful of the five nations, which together make up around a quarter of worldwide GDP – appears set to focus on its own agenda: promoting its new global development and security initiatives and pushing back on what it sees as “bloc”-building by the United States.\n\nBRICS countries should “strengthen political mutual trust and security cooperation,” coordinate on major international and regional issues, accommodate each other’s core interests, and “oppose hegemonism and power politics,” Xi said in a speech to BRICS foreign ministers last month, where he called on the group to ​​promote development in this “period of turbulence and transformation.”\n\nSome of the crises of this period, like food insecurity and a rising debt crisis in the developing world, are those that the group – established in 2009 as a means to “serve common interests of emerging market economies and developing countries” – was ostensibly formed to address.\n\nSince its inception, BRICS, which added South Africa in 2011, has been united in calling for more representation of major emerging economies on the world’s stage – and against what it views as a disproportionate dominance of the Western powers. That has meant pushing for reforms at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and, on occasion, making a veiled jab at NATO actions.\n\nIt’s also seen the countries discussing issues like how to settle trade in their own currencies – outside the US dollar system – an issue that could now take more relevance for BRICS following Western sanctions on Russia, according to Shahar Hameiri, a professor and political economist at the University of Queensland in Australia.\n\nThose penalties have cut off Russia’s central bank from most US dollar transactions, sanctioned banks and removed major institutions from international banking systems. That’s left countries that continue to do business with Russia scrambling for ways to avoid violating sanctions. Both India and China remain heavy buyers of Russian fuel.\n\n“There’s not going to be any full-throated embrace of Russia (at this summit), there’s no doubt about it, and I’m sure there’s gonna be plenty of awkwardness there … but behind the awkwardness (de-dollarization) is one area where these governments do have a shared interest,” Hameiri said.\n\n“Any kind of meaningful steps away from (a US dollar-denominated system) are potentially significant.”\n\nCross-purposes\n\nDespite some common interests, the BRICS group has long been plagued by questions of cohesion, given outsized differences in its members’ political and economic systems, and their divergent geopolitical interests.\n\nIn addition, the complexities of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may tone down any major outcomes of this week’s summit, even as – with the exception of Brazil – the BRICS nations other than Russia abstained from voting in a United Nations General Assembly resolution supported by 141 countries that called on Moscow to withdraw from Ukraine.\n\nChina, for its part, has accused NATO of provoking Russia to attack Ukraine, while similar rhetoric has circulated in public debate in India. In South Africa, Ramaphosa earlier this year told lawmakers the war could have been avoided if NATO had “heeded warnings” over considering Ukraine’s membership of its bloc.\n\nAnd although Brazil voted to condemn Russia’s aggression against Ukraine at the UN, its leader Bolsonaro has hedged – saying days earlier the country would remain “neutral.”\n\nUnder normal circumstances, China would take the usual steps – touting BRICS as “a kind of soft alternative to the G7” and seeking to “portray BRICS as a leader for the developing world … against the club of wealthy capitalist democracies,” according to Sino-Russia relations analyst Alexander Gabuev. This would include members endorsing each others’ key projects, he added.\n\n“Now it’s just harder to do because of Putin in the room,” said Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping welcomes Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a banquet dinner during the BRICS Summit in Xiamen, Fujian province in September 2017. The meeting followed a months-long standoff between the countries' troops in the Himalayas. Fred Dufour/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nMeanwhile, a longstanding source of internal friction within BRICS remains unresolved: tensions between India and China, which in 2020 spiraled into a violent border clash.\n\nOn the one hand, BRICS has been a “way of ensuring some form of engagement with China” for India, according to CPR’s Singh. And this remains critical, as New Delhi is wary of provoking Beijing, especially as it has partnered with the United States, Japan and Australia on their Quad security grouping and is increasingly viewed by the US as part of its strategy to counter China, he said.\n\nBut these ties also make India more reticent to back major outcomes from a BRICS summit.\n\n“I would be surprised if any substantive initiative is announced, because India would then be sending a message to the Quad and to its Western partners that it is willing to work very closely with China and Russia,” he said. “That would make India’s position very complicated.”\n\nAnother question is how other nations in the bloc will view a drive, long under discussion and expected to be spearheaded by China at Thursday’s summit, to expand the bloc to include more developing countries.\n\nIn a meeting with his BRICS counterparts last month, China’s foreign minister Wang Yi called for the group to start a member country “expansion process.”\n\nSuch an enlargement could play into perceptions from some parts that the West has shown a double standard in how it upholds international norms, according to Carnegie Endowments’s Gabuev, who says this has fueled an argument that the developing world, instead, should formulate those norms.\n\n“Bringing more countries on board is something that gives it more legitimacy, but again, whether that will go beyond symbolism for now, I’m not so sure,” he said.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/world/g7-summit-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "World leaders are facing crises on all fronts.

Enormous challenges, some of them barely imaginable when the G7 leaders last met 12 months ago, are bearing down on the world’s most prosperous democratic nations as they prepare to meet in Germany.\n\nOptimism was in the air at the Cornish beach resort of Carbis Bay in 2021 as the G7’s presidents, prime ministers and chancellor met face-to-face for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began.\n\nTogether they vowed to “beat Covid-19 and build back better,” to “reinvigorate economies,” to “protect our planet” and to “strengthen partnerships.”\n\nBut global events have since overtaken their best efforts, and it is far from clear if they will be able to build on those goals this year. Russia’s unprompted invasion of Ukraine is a large and singular cloud, but other thunderheads are gathering too.\n\nOver the next few days, the leaders of Japan, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the European Union and host Germany will meet amid the seclusion of Bavaria’s luxurious Schloss Elmau retreat.\n\nThe spa resort, nestled in a peaceful valley, usually offers well-heeled visitors a brief chance to escape from the cares of the world – but even Schloss Elmau can’t shield the world’s leaders from the problems gathering on their horizon.\n\nRussian President Vladmir Putin’s officials are hinting at nuclear Armageddon, China has become increasingly assertive, a global food crunch is on the way, oil prices are spiking, and a global economic slowdown and a cost-of-living crisis are looming. Climate change aspirations are also being confounded and supply chain problems are hobbling hopes of a post-pandemic return to normality.\n\nAnd on top of all that, last year’s summit host, the UK, is threatening to break international laws over its Brexit agreement with the EU – not to mention its controversial plan to deport asylum-seekers to Rwanda – despite the risk of rocking the world order it helped build, and diluting the G7’s already limited effectiveness.\n\nAlthough G7 leaders can look back with some satisfaction at their unity in the face of Russia’s unprecedented aggression – as seen in that “strengthening partnerships” goal set in Carbis Bay – the scale of looming crises dwarfs even that.\n\nPutin is not entirely to blame for the coming storm but his unjustified war in Ukraine is inextricably linked to many of the crises that are brewing. Without it, the fixes required would be easier and fewer, their impact less pernicious.\n\nG7 leaders pose for the official welcome and family photo during the UK-hosted G7 Summit in Cornwall's Carbis Bay in June last year. Leon Neal/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nFood crisis\n\nThe global food crunch is a case in point. It can be blamed, in part, on worldwide post-pandemic supply chain issues, but Russia’s theft of Ukrainian wheat and its blockade of Ukrainian shipping in the Black Sea, which is stopping Ukraine’s wheat and other farm products from reaching international markets, is also playing a major role.\n\nAccording to the UN’s World Food Program (WFP), Ukraine normally supplies 40% of its wheat; the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says Ukraine supplies 16% of the world’s corn exports and more than 40% of the world’s sunflower oil.\n\nUkrainian farmers harvest barley fields in Odesa region, Ukraine, on June 22, 2022. Stringer/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nThe global NGO International Rescue Committee (IRC) said recently that “98% of Ukraine’s grain and wheat exports remain under blockade,” adding that “food prices worldwide have rocketed by 41% and a further 47 million people are projected to experience acute hunger this year.”\n\nTraditionally Ukraine’s wheat and grain exports go to some of the world’s neediest nations: Libya, Lebanon, Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, Eritrea and Ethiopia.\n\nTo improve the situation, the G7 will need to get Putin to back down on some of his war aims, for example by ending the conflict, or restoring Kyiv’s control over all Donbas – but so far there is no indication he is anywhere near doing that.\n\nEnergy crisis threatens climate commitments\n\nRising oil prices are another by-product of Putin’s war – albeit one complicated by the fact that oil production is not matching up to post-pandemic increases in consumption. To fix this, the G7 will need to convince Russia’s OPEC+ partners, including Saudi Arabia, to turn their back on Putin and increase oil output.\n\nUS President Joe Biden’s trip to Jeddah, planned for mid-July, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s trip to Riyadh back in March offer hints that the G7 may be making some headway on this, but there are no guarantees yet. Saudi Arabia – like Russia – benefits massively from high oil prices; their gain is pain for the billions stuck with the bill of getting food to market.\n\nLast year’s G7 was all about net zero and a green pandemic recovery, but this year’s scramble by Western nations to wean themselves off Russian oil and gas has given a boost to the biggest single contributor to the crisis – coal.\n\nG7 host Germany is now in crisis mode as Russia reduces its gas supplies to the country, weaponizing energy for influence as feared – it is now saying it will fire up more coal plants. That’s a U-turn from last November, when Germany brought forward its deadline to phase out coal to 2030, eight years earlier than planned. After Russia’s invasion, it also expedited plans to transition its power sector to 100% renewables by five years.\n\nJohnson – who said last year the world had reached a point of no return in phasing out coal – just this week suggested the UK start mining the fossil fuel again for steelmaking. The country will also delay a plan to shut down more existing coal plants ahead of winter.\n\nAnd to address the oil crisis, Biden is suggesting a tax holiday on fuel as prices at the pump soar.\n\nFuel prices are displayed on a sign at a gas station in Berlin, Germany, on June 17, 2022. Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nEconomic pressures\n\nIn their Carbis Bay goal to “build back better,” the G7 nations never got their heads around the stuttering return to a pre-Covid normality. Canceled flights and travel chaos across Europe and beyond this summer are just the visible tip of an iceberg-sized problem that is defying quick fixes.\n\nChina’s insistence on continuing to enforce a “zero Covid” strategy is confounding not only its return to business as usual, but also rippling through global supply chains, with lockdowns keeping workers from factories and in the worst cases halting production. Despite growing tensions with the G7 nations, China shows no signs of aligning with their new post-Covid norms.\n\nA medical worker takes a swab sample for Covid-19 from a citizen on June 22, 2022 in Beijing, China. Fu Ding/Beijing Youthh Daily/VCG/Getty Images\n\nIn G7 nations and beyond, inflation is rising, central banks are raising lending rates and a global economic slowdown seems far more likely this year than last. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, predicts that a US recession is “inevitable.”\n\nProblems are layering in a way that is somewhat reminiscent of the global economic downturn in 2008.\n\nBack then, central bankers rallied and stopped the economic rot, but the geopolitical repercussions rippled on for years.\n\nThe Arab Spring signaled that economic pain had passed a threshold. When impoverished Tunisian street trader Mohamed Bouazizi set fire to himself in December 2010, he ignited passions across the Middle East; protesters took to the streets, toppling two governments and rattling many more, before calm was partially restored in the region later the following year.\n\nIt is not impossible that another global economic crisis could trigger an even wider wave of unrest. In recent months, Sri Lanka has seen economic turmoil spill on to the streets. Rising prices have also sparked popular unrest in Pakistan and Peru.\n\nPutin banks on faltering consensus\n\nWhat G7 leaders can do to head off a season of despair could well be limited by the global rifts which Russia is intentionally exploiting.\n\nJust weeks before Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine he went to China and met President Xi Jinping; the pair promised deeper cooperation and, despite warnings from G7 nations and others, Xi has doubled down on that commitment and become more assertive over the future of Taiwan.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin attends a ceremony at the Grand Kremlin Palace on June 12, 2022, in Moscow, Rusia. Contributor/Getty Images\n\nConsensus at the UN and the G20, two other deep-pocketed global crisis firefighters, is in tatters. Votes at the UN Security Council show veto-wielding Russia and China will prevent any censure of Putin’s invasion; meanwhile, the US has suggested it won’t attend the G20 Leaders’ summit in Indonesia this November if Russia goes, and the UK has done the same.\n\nChina has refused to denounce Russia over its invasion of Ukraine and both have become bellicose towards what they see as the vested interests of the world’s leading democracies – the G7 nations – against them.\n\nThey know developing world problems impact G7 nations before them – as most migrants choose to go to developed countries that will protect their rights – and seem willing to leverage world crises to their advantage, leaving the G7 to weather the coming storm alone.\n\nBut so far, despite differing relations with Russia, the G7 is holding together.\n\nFrance’s Emmanuel Macron has talked to Putin more than any other G7 leader over the past year, and insists that Russia “should not be humiliated,” while Biden accuses Russia of having “fueled a global energy crisis,” by invading Ukraine and his defense chief Lloyd Austin says Putin should be “weakened.”\n\nWhat’s clear is that this G7 has more riding on it than past meetings: Success will come in mitigating the crises, not stopping them.

The fire's cause has not been revealed.\n\n∎ Samantha Power, head of the United States Agency for International Development, said it will seek another $230 million to help Ukraine’s economy and reconstruction, on top of the $250 million announced Tuesday for the country's agricultural sector.\n\n∎ The Russian Foreign Ministry denied Western reports that Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held back-channel talks in April with U.S. officials to lay the groundwork for when Ukraine is ready to negotiate.\n\nRussian calls for 'quite inhumane'Russian calls for 'quite inhumane' retaliation after Crimean bridge blast: Live updates\n\nPutin 'cut a deal to save his skin,' British spy chief says\n\nThe failed Wagner insurrection has put Russian President Vladimir Putin \"under pressure'' and exposed the \"inexorable decay\" of his power, the head of British intelligence said Wednesday.\n\nAt a rare public address in Prague hosted by Politico, MI6 chief Richard Moore said Putin's support among the Russian elite is crumbling and pointed out the usually ruthless autocrat did not confront Prigozhin − a former ally who had betrayed him − and instead \"cut a deal to save his skin.''\n\n“Prigozhin started off that day as a traitor at breakfast, he had been pardoned by supper and then a few days later he was invited for tea,” Moore said. “So there are some things that even the chief of MI6 finds a little bit difficult to try and interpret, in terms of who’s in and who’s out.”\n\nMoore also made a call for Russians dissatisfied with the country's leadership to share their secrets with Britain, and he defended the slow-starting Ukrainian counteroffensive, saying Kyiv's forces are facing entrenched Russian defenses and proceeding cautiously to preserve their troops' lives.\n\n\"They have still recovered more territory in a month than the Russians managed to achieve in a year,” Moore said.\n\nPutin won't go to summit in South Africa 'by mutual agreement'\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin will not attend next month's BRICS summit in Johannesburg in person, instead relying on a video link, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday. Peskov said Lavrov would go to the summit, which brings together the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.\n\nSouth Africa recognizes the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March.

The Agriculture Ministry said it would take a year to restore the damaged facilities. On Monday, the Kremlin pulled out of an agreement that had allowed Ukrainian grain shipments, many of them intended for impoverished Asian and African nations.\n\n\"Everyone is affected by this Russian terror,'' Zelenskyy said on Twitter. \"Everyone in the world should be interested in bringing (Russia) to justice for its terror.''\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said the overnight Tuesday and Wednesday assaults were \"retribution” after Monday’s explosions that damaged part of the roadway on the Kerch Bridge, a key span from Russia to occupied Crimea used for military and civilian supplies. Moscow blamed that attack on Kyiv, which has hinted but not acknowledged involvement.\n\nNew $1.3 billion in Ukraine aid focuses on air defense\n\nThe Pentagon announced $1.3 billion in contracting orders for military aid to Ukraine on Wednesday, including anti-aircraft systems designed to counter the barrages of Russian missiles and drones.\n\nThe aid package comes from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which the Pentagon uses to order weapons and ammunition from contractors, a process that can take months. A different pot, the Presidential Drawdown Authority, taps the Pentagon’s existing stocks to supply Ukrainian forces more quickly.\n\nWednesday’s aid includes four National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems and munitions to destroy attacking aircraft and missiles.

The 36-year-old resident of Odesa, a key target in Russia’s invasion of the country, simply wanted to show his parents he was fine.\n\n“I’m coming back from buying groceries,” he said in a video posted to Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, on February 24, the first day of the invasion. Wang, a programmer originally from Beijing, described buying meat and fruit in the video, remarking that some food stores were still open.\n\nBut his mood darkened as the days passed and the Russian assault escalated. When he logged onto Douyin, he said he would see Chinese videos praising Russian troops or supporting the invasion.\n\n“I was very angry, then I thought I would record videos for them, and I’ll tell them what the real battlefield is,” he told CNN.\n\nHis daily videos, posted across various platforms including YouTube and the Chinese messaging app WeChat, quickly gained traction as a rare voice offering Chinese audiences a glimpse into war-torn Ukraine – a stark contrast from Chinese state media, which has promoted Russian disinformation such as unfounded claims Ukrainian soldiers are using “Nazi” tactics.\n\nWang Jixian holding his Chinese passport in a video posted to Douyin, China's version of TikTok. Courtesy Wang Jixian\n\nIn one widely-watched video, Wang held up his Chinese passport and said, “These Ukrainian guards are not Nazis, they are IT programmers, common people, barbers – these are the people.”\n\nBut in doing so, he had waded into the middle of a messy controversy, with China facing international pressure as it refuses to condemn Russia’s invasion, and an outpouring of pro-Russia sentiment on China’s highly restricted and censored social media – something Wang is hoping to change.\n\nBacklash of critics\n\nWang had studied art in college, and enjoyed dance, music and painting – so when he moved to Odesa four years ago for work, the city’s “artistic atmosphere” immediately appealed to him. One video on his Douyin account last year showed a man playing piano in a colorful room filled with books and paintings.\n\nHis videos look very different now. Several are filmed late at night, with the sound of explosions and air raid sirens in the background. Other clips show snapshots of daily life – quiet streets, Ukrainian flags hung outside buildings and painted onto walls.\n\n“Are those air raid alarms? Those bastards are coming again,” he said in one video. “People are doing their own business, my neighbor is out walking his dog again. This is our Odesa.”\n\nOther times, he’s more impassioned. “Someone told me nowadays, society has the laws of the jungle, where power comes from the barrel of a gun,” he said, referencing a famous quote by Communist leader Mao Zedong. “Where is the sense in that?”\n\nAs these videos began garnering attention, sometimes racking up more than 140,000 views, the number of critics rose too, with comments calling him a national traitor.\n\n“You don’t need this Chinese passport anymore, you have already forgotten which country you are from,” one popular comment on Douyin read. “The official position of the country should be the position of all Chinese people.”\n\nChina has tried to stake out a neutral position, choosing not to condemn Russia or even call it an invasion while frequently saying “all countries’ legitimate security concerns” should be addressed.\n\nIn a call with US President Joe Biden on Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said both countries have a responsibility for ensuring peace. But the White House said afterward it was still concerned China could provide Russia assistance.\n\n“I don’t understand how I ‘betrayed’ the country,” Wang told CNN. With limited access to news broadcasts and widespread online misinformation, he said he doesn’t understand China’s or Russia’s position – all he knew was that “every day the city is under fire, many were killed.”\n\nThe comments of anonymous online strangers don’t bother him – but they do when it’s from people he cares about, such as a Chinese Embassy staff member he knew from his previous residence in North Macedonia.\n\nHe said the staffer reached out to him recently, insinuating Wang was being paid to post his videos, and asking: “Who sent you?” When Wang insisted he wasn’t doing it for money, the staffer replied: “Your current behavior is not in line with national interests. I want to cut off relations with you, let’s block each other.”\n\nThat “really hurt my heart,” Wang said.\n\nDetermined to stay\n\nChinese censors have also cracked down on his videos online, he said. While all his videos have stayed up on YouTube, which is blocked in China except for those with VPNs, only about 80% of his videos have been left on WeChat, and fewer than 20% on Douyin.\n\nHe doesn’t know what rules he has broken. He got so frustrated that in one video on March 7, he stuck black tape in an X over his mouth, silently gesturing to the camera to convey that he was safe and still in Odesa.\n\nAfter speaking with CNN, his Chinese social media accounts were banned, leaving him unable to contact his family back home.\n\nHe has received “countless” messages from contacts, placing pressure on him to stop posting, he said. But he has no intention of doing so.\n\n“I want to (provide) some voice for the people in Ukraine, for the heroes, for my neighbors. Because in my eyes they are all heroes,” he said. “I see people being calm, I see people brave … I want to remind you to see who is dying, who has been killed.”\n\nThere are signs his message may be landing. Under his videos, hate comments are interspersed with well wishes from viewers, urging him to stay safe and evacuate. A handful of comments express support for Ukraine.\n\nBut for now, Wang has no intention of leaving – not until “Odesa is too destroyed for humans to stay,” he said. Apart from his affection for the city, it was a matter of principle, he added: “I can’t stand the act of bullying people in front of my face.”\n\nWhen he isn’t filming videos, Wang provides volunteer support in repairing people’s cell phones and assisting the displaced.\n\n“(If) I turned back and left, it would be enough to make me regret for the rest of my life,” he said. “I have no interest or desire to leave Ukraine until the war is ended and Ukraine has won.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Yong Xiong", "Jessie Yeung", "Yong Xiong"], "publish_date": "2022/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/business/elon-musk-ian-bremmer-putin-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk denies claim he spoke to Vladimir Putin about the war in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has denied a claim that he spoke directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent weeks about the war in Ukraine and a proposed “peace plan” to end the conflict.\n\nSpeaking to CNN on Tuesday, American political scientist Ian Bremmer, president of political consulting firm Eurasia Group, claimed Musk told him directly about his conversation with Putin last month.\n\nIn a tweet Tuesday, however, Musk said he hadn’t spoken with Putin in over a year.\n\n“I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago,” Musk tweeted. “The subject matter was space.”\n\nBremmer initially declined to comment further on his conversation with Musk – but later reiterated his claim on Twitter.\n\n“Elon Musk told me he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine. He also told me what the Kremlin’s red lines were,” Bremmer wrote.\n\nMusk tweeted a succinct response: “Nobody should trust Bremmer.”\n\nEurasia Group is a political risk research and consulting firm that reports on emerging and developed economies. Bremmer, who is often cited by mainstream media, has also been involved with international organizations including the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe exchange comes after Musk tweeted a “Ukraine-Russia peace plan” last week that reflected demands Kremlin officials have made repeatedly in recent months, including that Kyiv commit to military neutrality, acknowledge that Crimea is formally part of Russia, and ensure continued water supply to the peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014.\n\n“Ukraine-Russia Peace: Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people. Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake). Water supply to Crimea assured. Ukraine remains neutral,” Musk tweeted.\n\n“This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then,” he added. “Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war.”\n\nMusk’s tweet was welcomed by the Kremlin – but sparked outrage among Ukrainian government officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, who suggested in a tweet that Musk was expressing support for Russia with his proposal.\n\n“F— off is my very diplomatic reply to you,” Ukraine’s Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk wrote in response to Musk’s Twitter thread.\n\nA lawyer for Musk did not immediately return CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday night, Bremmer strongly defended his claim, saying: “I have been writing my weekly newsletter on geopolitics for 24 [years]. I write honestly without fear or favor and this week’s update was no different.\n\n“I’ve long admired Musk as a unique and world-changing entrepreneur, which I’ve said publicly. He’s not a geopolitics expert.”\n\nMusk on peace proposals\n\nMultiple sources told CNN separately that in recent weeks, Musk had floated a similar “peace plan” proposal in conversations with attendees at think tanks and conferences, and hinted at having contact with Kremlin officials.\n\nIn a conversation at “The Weekend” festival in Aspen, Colorado, last month, Musk told attendees, “I really would encourage Ukraine – because Ukraine’s had some victories recently – really encourage them to seek peace. This is the time to do it. They don’t want to do it, that’s for sure. But this is the time to do it. Cause you know everyone wants to seek peace when they’re losing but they don’t want to seek peace when they’re winning. For now.”\n\nAccording to one attendee, Musk added that “in my view the nature of that peace would be: recognizing Crimea as Russia, allowing Luhansk and Donetsk to be independent, quasi-independent republics, and don’t block the water to Crimea like they did last time. Russia would accept those terms.”\n\nBased on the ideas Musk put forward, according to another source who heard them, it seemed “clear” he had been “in communication with the Kremlin.” A third source echoed that, telling CNN Musk had suggested in late September that his proposals for a peace deal were endorsed by the Kremlin.\n\nMusk made similar suggestions for a resolution to tensions between China and Taiwan, telling the Financial Times that some control over the self-governing island could be handed to Beijing in a bid for peace.\n\n“My recommendation…would be to figure out a special administrative zone for Taiwan that is reasonably palatable, probably won’t make everyone happy,” Musk told the Financial Times in an interview published last week. “And it’s possible, and I think probably, in fact, that they could have an arrangement that’s more lenient than Hong Kong.”\n\nIn a note to Eurasia Group subscribers on Monday, Bremmer expanded upon his conversation with Musk, which he said took place about two weeks ago.\n\n“I spoke with Elon two weeks ago, and he told me Putin (in a direct conversation with him) was “prepared to negotiate” (much as I had heard from Shanghai Cooperation Organization members the week before) and had outlined the minimum the Russian President would require to end the war,” Bremmer wrote.\n\n“There were three components: (1) Crimea remains Russian, (2) Ukraine accepts a formal status of neutrality, and (3) recognition of Russia’s annexations of Luhansk and Donetsk, Kherson control for the water supply to Crimea, and Zaporizhzhia for the land bridge.”\n\nBremmer wrote that Musk told him Putin said he would accomplish those goals “no matter what,” and was prepared to retaliate with a nuclear strike should Zelensky try to take back Crimea by force.\n\n“Elon said everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome,” Bremmer wrote.\n\nMusk has been providing Starlink systems to Ukraine since early on in the war, allowing Kyiv to maintain internet and communications access in areas cut off by Russian attacks on infrastructure. But according to Bremmer, Musk was spooked in recent weeks by a Ukrainian request to activate Starlink systems in Crimea – suggesting a potential ground operation – and refused the request.\n\n“Musk also appeared concerned about more direct threats from Putin,” Bremmer wrote. “While he didn’t surface anything explicit with me, he did talk about Russian cyber capabilities and Russia’s potential to disrupt his satellites.”\n\nAsked on Tuesday about the reported Musk-Putin discussion, US National Security Council official John Kirby told reporters that Musk does not speak on behalf of the Biden administration in any conversations he may have with the Russian President.\n\n“I’ll let Mr. Musk speak for his conversations. Obviously, he’s not representing the United States government in this conversation. So I think I’ll let him characterize this. And we’ll avoid commenting on the particulars,” Kirby said.\n\nKirby reiterated that Russia started its war in Ukraine “in an unprovoked and illegal way” and “can end it today simply by taking their troops out.”\n\nAbsent that, Kirby said the United States plans to continue to support Ukraine with capabilities and tools to succeed on the battlefield.\n\nZelensky, Kirby added, “will get to determine for himself when is the right time to negotiate, and Mr. Zelensky will get to determine for himself and for his country what terms he’s willing to consider, what success looks like.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the name of the festival at which Elon Musk told attendees Ukraine should seek peace.

Dozens of men were paid by Jeffries and Smith to travel abroad and within the U.S., including to their homes in the Hamptons and New York City, for sex with them and others. Prosecutors say the victims were often recruited under the guise of a modeling opportunity.\n\nHere are five key allegations from the indictment:\n\nJeffries and Smith spent millions of dollars building an infrastructure to support their international organization that included a security staff to operate it. Much of the money paid for the victims' domestic and international travel as well as hotel rooms.\n\nVictims and witnesses were required to sign non-disclosure agreements to prevent them from disclosing information about the events and to keep them from seeking help. On occasions when witnesses threatened to expose or sue them, a security company was used to surveil and intimidate those individuals to secure their silence.\n\nThe indictment says Jeffries and Smith hosted \"sex events\" where men were pressured to consume alcohol and drugs.\n\nProsecutors said Jacobson recruited and interviewed men for the events by holding \"tryouts\" in which he would have sex with the men before they were invited. Jacobson also paid men who successfully referred others who were eventually invited to the events.\n\nThe victims, including one as young as 19, say they engaged in sex acts under the guise of receiving a modeling opportunity with Abercrombie. Prosecutors said victims also believed declining an invite to the parties \"could harm their careers.\"\n\nJeffries' tenure at Abercrombie & Fitch was filled with controversy\n\nMike Jeffries became president and CEO of Abercrombie in 1992 and soon morphed the small, struggling retailer into a must-have brand. But his tactics also set the company on a path to becoming widely scorned, gaining a reputation as “America’s most-hated retailer.\"\n\nJeffries fueled Abercrombie’s meteoric rise with sexualized marketing, including a hybrid magazine-catalog that featured images of barely clothed models alongside articles about sex, drinking and pop culture. The brand became synonymous with shirtless male models, some of whom worked in Abercrombie's dimly lit stores that were filled with the scent of its signature cologne.\n\nAbercrombie notably went years without selling larger sizes of clothes to cultivate its exclusive image.\n\n“We go after the attractive, all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends,\" Jeffries told Salon in 2006. \"A lot of people don't belong (in Abercrombie clothes) and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.\"\n\nAfter more than two decades at the helm, Jeffries stepped down as CEO in 2014 amid mass criticism of the company’s performance and workplace culture. Abercrombie suffered 11 straight quarters of negative comparable-store sales. Former employees protested and sued over allegations of race and age discrimination, complaints detailed in a recent Netflix documentary.\n\nIn the years since Jeffries' exit, the company has since been able to rebrand itself, now catering to an older, more diverse demographic.\n\nRead the indictment\n\nWarning, the following document contains graphic descriptions of an alleged prostitution ring.\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)\n\nContributing: Sheridan Hendrix and Mark Williams, Columbus Dispatch", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/22/former-abercrombie-ceo-mike-jeffries-charges/75790462007/", "title": "Mike Jeffries, ex-Abercrombie CEO, charged with sex trafficking ...", "text": "Michael Jeffries, the former CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch, was arrested and is being charged with two others in the operation of a secretive, international sex trafficking scheme that lasted for years, cost millions of dollars and involved dozens of victims, prosecutors said Tuesday.\n\nJeffries, who served as CEO of the clothing company from 1992 to 2014, and Matthew Smith, 61, of West Palm Beach and James Jacobson, 71, of Wisconsin, were charged with sex trafficking and engaging in interstate prostitution, Breon Peace, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said at a news conference.\n\nThe operation involved transporting young, aspiring male models to events in New York and other places around the world and coercing them into having sex. The men believed participating in the events would lead to modeling opportunities and further their careers.\n\n“To anyone who thinks they can exploit and coerce others by using this so-called casting couch system this case should serve as a warning, prepare to trade that couch for a bed in federal prison,” Peace said.\n\nMike Jeffries allegations:Ex-CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch accused of sexually exploiting young men\n\nBrian Bieber, Jeffries' attorney said in a statement to USA TODAY that they will respond to the allegations \"after the Indictment is unsealed, and when appropriate, but plan to do so in the courthouse – not the media.\"\n\nLegal representation for Jeffries, 80, has previously \"vehemently denied\" any wrongdoing, according to the BBC.\n\nAbercrombie said last year it was \"appalled and disgusted\" and hired a law firm to investigate allegations in a BBC report that Jeffries recruited young men for sex. The company declined to comment on Jeffries' arrest and did not immediately respond to questions about the status of the independent investigation into the allegations against him.\n\nJeffries and Smith appeared in federal court in West Palm Beach on Tuesday and face extradition to the Eastern District of New York. U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart apprised them of the charges and potential penalties they face.\n\nPer an agreement between federal prosecutors and Jeffries’ attorneys, Reinhart set Jeffries' bond at $10 million, secured by a New York property he owns with his wife, Susan Hansen Jeffries. The bond secured, Jeffries will remain under house arrest in his property in Palm Beach. The judge ordered Jeffries to wear a GPS monitor and limit his travel strictly to South Florida and eastern New York.\n\nProsecutors made no such bond agreement with Smith, referred to once during the hearing as Jeffries’ “life partner.” Reinhart instead ordered Smith to remain in custody, a decision the judge said can be revisited later by attorneys in New York. Neither Smith nor his lawyers objected. Peace noted at his news conference that Smith is a dual citizen of the United States and the United Kingdom, making the risk of flight \"particularly acute\" with him.\n\nJacobson, who was taken into custody in Minnesota, was released on a $500,000 bond. Jacobson also will be arraigned in New York on Friday.\n\nIf convicted of the sex trafficking charge, the defendants each face a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, according to a John Marzulli, a spokesperson for Peace's office. The interstate prostitution charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment.\n\nJeffries sex trafficked men around the world, indictment alleges\n\nPeace said the indictment alleges in graphic and disturbing detail that while Jeffries was CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch he used “his power, his wealth and his influence to traffic men for his own sexual pleasure and that of his romantic partner, Smith.” The 16-count indictment lays out a sprawling investigation and charges the three defendants with exploiting young men in New York City, the Hamptons and at hotels around the world, including in England, France, Italy, Morocco and St. Barts.\n\nJeffries and Smith employed Jacobson as a “recruiter” to find men and pay them to engage in sex acts, Peace said. Smith would personally select men to be flown to the couple’s homes or hotels “to engage in commercial sex,” Peace said.\n\nHeterosexual men were intentionally recruited, some of whom had previously worked for Abercrombie, according to the indictment. The indictment alleges the defendants tricked some of the men into believing they were meeting Jeffries and Smith for the purpose of receiving a modeling opportunity with Abercrombie.\n\n\"Many of the victims, at least one of whom was as young as 19 years old, were financially vulnerable and aspired to become models in the fashion industry, a notoriously cutthroat world,\" the indictment said.\n\nPeace said there was no indication that Jeffries used Abercrombie resources for his alleged crimes and the incidents did not occur on company grounds.\n\nThe defendants allegedly employed a “secret staff” to operate events where victims would be supplied with drugs and alcohol and coerced into sexual activity. The staff allegedly helped keep the events secret by ensuring the men handed over their phones and signed nondisclosure agreements.\n\nPeace said they led the men to believe not complying with their demands would hurt their careers, and when they did not or could not consent, Jeffries and Smith would forcefully subject them to violent sexual contact.\n\nPeace said the illegal operation lasted from at least from 2008 to 2015 and required millions of dollars to support its massive infrastructure and maintain secrecy. In addition to paying the men for sex, they allegedly spent prolific amounts on the staff to run it.\n\nThough only 15 men are identified in the indictment as John Does, Peace said prosecutors believe “dozens and dozens” of victims were involved. He thanked the victims for coming forward and encouraged any others to contact the FBI.\n\n“Prosecutions like this are really impossible without the bravery of victims who are willing to report what happened to them to law enforcement,” Peace said.\n\nJeffries, Abercrombie also facing lawsuit\n\nThe news comes after a group of once-aspiring Abercrombie & Fitch male models filed a class-action lawsuit last year against Jeffries and Abercrombie alleging the retailer looked the other way while Jeffries ran a sex-trafficking ring and sexually assaulted numerous young men.\n\nBrad Edwards, an attorney who represents the men in the case, said \"all four of the defendants, including Abercrombie and Fitch, have tried everything possible to delay our lawsuit from proceeding, presumably because they knew it would lead to criminal arrests.\"\n\nThe proposed class action filed by former model David Bradberry in Manhattan federal court claims Jeffries forced models to take drugs and engage in sexual acts with him and others for the chance to be featured in Abercrombie's provocative catalogs. The lawsuit alleged that company officers knew about the conduct and Abercrombie paid settlements to people who accused Jeffries of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\n\"In exchange for providing the position of power and unfettered access to corporate funds necessary for Jeffries to sexually terrorize aspiring male models, Abercrombie knowingly and intentionally benefited and received things of value from Jeffries and his sex-trafficking operation, including the value Jeffries himself brought to the brand,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nBrittany Henderson, another attorney representing some of the aspiring models, called Tuesday's arrests \"monumental\" in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\n\"Their fight for justice does not end here,\" Henderson said. \"In addition to supporting the criminal prosecution, our clients look forward to holding Abercrombie and Fitch liable for facilitating this terrible conduct and ensuring that this cannot happen again.\"\n\nLate last year, Jeffries sued his former employer because it refused to cover his costs from the lawsuit. A judge earlier this year ruled that the allegations were tied to Jeffries' corporate role and the retailer must cover the cost of his legal defense, the BBC reported.\n\nWho is Michael Jeffries?\n\nJeffries became president and CEO of Abercrombie in 1992 when the small, money-losing chain formerly known for selling sporting equipment and clothes was part of Leslie H. Wexner's retail empire called The Limited at the time. Jeffries became chairman in 1996 and The Limited spun off the chain into an independent company in 1998.\n\nJeffries was credited with turning around the retailer into a successful teen apparel maker known for its cologne-filled stores and ads featuring semi-nude models. Jeffries became one of the highest paid CEOs in the U.S., earning a pay package estimated at more than $140 million at one point.\n\nBut the company stirred up controversy under his leadership.\n\nAbercrombie produced a hybrid magazine-catalog with partially nude models that featured articles such as \"Drinking 101,\" made T-shirts with phrases that insulted various groups, and went years without selling larger-size clothes as a way to cultivate an image.\n\nAn age-discrimination lawsuit in 2012 revealed the existence of an aircraft-standards manual dictating how the models and actors serving Jeffries on the company jet were to dress and behave. The men were to be clean-shaven and wear boxer briefs, flip-flops and a spritz of the chain’s signature cologne.\n\nHe abruptly retired in 2014 at the age of 70, after seemingly losing his touch with the retailer's teen audience amid several years of weakening sales.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2024/10/23/abercrombie-ceo-mike-jeffries-indictment-prostitution-ring-sex-trafficking/75794797007/", "title": "Former Abercrombie CEO Mike Jeffries indicted: What we learned", "text": "The former CEO of New Albany-based retailer Abercrombie & Fitch, along with two co-defendants, were arrested Tuesday and accused in a 16-count indictment of operating an international prostitution ring that exploited men.\n\nMichael Jeffries, 80, was arrested in West Palm Beach, Florida.

USA TODAY could not find attorneys who represent them.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Abercrombie & Fitch said the company is \"appalled and disgusted by the behavior described in the allegations against Mr. Jeffries.\"\n\nThe company said they've hired a law firm to independently investigate the alleged sexual misconduct, adding that current company leadership was not aware of the allegations.\n\nJeffries spent 22 years at Abercrombie before stepping down as CEO in 2014 with a retirement package worth around $25 million, according to the BBC. He's still receiving annual payment as part of that package.\n\nMore:Abercrombie & Fitch ditches plan to consider selling itself amid retail woes\n\nReport: Middle men recruited young men with modelling promises\n\nAs the CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch, Jeffries built the company's brand with advertisements that drew on sex-appeal, specifically those of shirtless men.\n\nIt was promises of modeling in those ads that helped middlemen recruit young men to the sex events hosted by Jeffries and Smith, the BBC reported.\n\nDavid Bradberry told the BBC that met a middleman who recruited him to an event through an agent in 2010. Bradberry, who was 23 at the time, told the BBC that his initial meeting with the middleman did not involve anything relating to sex. The conversations later shifted.\n\n\"Jim made it clear to me that unless I let him perform (a sex act) on me, that I would not be meeting with Abercrombie & Fitch or Mike Jeffries,\" Bradberry told the BBC, referring to James Jacobson, who the outlet identified as middleman for Jeffries and Smith.\n\nStatewide roundup:6th-grade teacher, college professor among 160 arrested in Ohio human trafficking bust\n\nMore:Russell Brand's assault, rape allegations being investigated: What his accusers say happened\n\nFame is at the 'price of compliance'\n\nEight of the men interviewed by the BBC said they were either abused or witnessed misconduct. The men described the person who recruited them for the events as a man missing part of his nose, which was covered with a snakeskin patch. That man was Jacobson, according to the BBC.\n\nIn a statement through his lawyer, Jacobson told the BBC that he was offended by any claims of \"any coercive, deceptive or forceful behavior on my part\" and had \"no knowledge of any such conduct by others.\"\n\nThe men were allegedly also paid to attend events and signed non-disclosure agreements. Half of them were unaware that the events involved sex, and the other half knew sex was part of the events but it wasn't clear what was expected of them, the BBC reported.\n\nThe vast majority of the men interviewed described the events as harmful.\n\n\"I was paralyzed,\" Bradberry said. \"It was like he was selling fame. And the price was compliance.\"\n\nHe said he had been made to believe \"this is where everybody gets their start.\"\n\nTwo former U.S. prosecutors who reviewed the BBC investigation and the men's first-hand accounts have called on prosecutors to investigate whether Jeffries should face charges, the outlet reported.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/07/08/walmart-class-action-lawsuit-price/74330103007/", "title": "Walmart faces class-action lawsuit over 'deceptive' pricing in stores", "text": "Walmart must face a class-action lawsuit claiming the multinational retail giant used inaccurate price labels, according to a ruling to a federal appeals court on July 3.\n\nThe court order, issued by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, opens the door for consumers to prove that the company has violated multiple consumer protection laws.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is that the inaccurate prices in Walmart stores constitute a “bait-and-switch” pricing scheme in which purchase prices are higher than those posted on store shelves.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by an Ohio resident named Yoram Kahn. In August, 2022, Kahn purchased multiple items from a Walmart location in Niles, Illinois, and found a 10-15% markup above the listed priced. Kahn’s subsequent lawsuit alleged that similar price discrepancies were found at Walmart locations in Florida, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey and New York.\n\nThe lawsuit also noted that a 2012 California court ruling fined the company $2 million for “violating a 2008 ruling requiring it to resolve pricing errors at checkout,” as well as two North Carolina-based locations being fined in 2021 for “repeated and excessive scanning charges” that caused excessive charges on purchased items.\n\nStart your new business: Best LLC services\n\nIn June 2024, Walmart agreed to pay a $1.64 million settlement to customers from its New Jersey locations for “allegations that the chain repeatedly engaged in unlawful unit pricing practices.”\n\nKahn’s legal team argued it was unreasonable for the average consumer to keep track of the discrepancies between the prices listed on shelves and potentially adjusted checkout prices.\n\n“Who does that?” Judge David Hamilton wrote in the ruling. “For obvious reasons consumers will not undertake such audits.”\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Walmart for comment.\n\nWalmart testing new digital labels\n\nLast month, Walmart announced it was testing new digital shelf labels that would manage pricing of the store’s products.\n\nWalmart to change price displays:What to know about digital shelf labels\n\nAccording to a company spokesperson, the digital labels would allow Walmart “to update prices at the shelf using a mobile app, reducing the need to walk around the store to change paper tags by hand and give us more time to support customers in the store.”\n\nMax Hauptman is a Trending Reporter for USA TODAY.

Combs, 54, has been denied bail on the grounds that he is both a flight risk and could coerce witnesses.\n\nThe uneventful arrest of the mogul at New York's Park Hyatt hotel was hardly a surprise. While consistently protesting his innocence, Diddy in recent months has been hit with an avalanche of lawsuits, including from his ex-girlfriend singer Cassie Ventura, former Danity Kane member Dawn Richard and model Crystal McKinney.\n\nBut combing through the past three decades of the New York-born former altar boy's life finds a steady stream of legal entanglements that seem to presage his current predicament. These run from chaos at concerts and demands for child support, to threats with baseball bats and legal entanglements with corporate giants.\n\nAlthough 1999 was a particularly troublesome year for Diddy, his saga truly begins in the early '90s, when the 22-year-old upstart producer at Uptown Records organized an event that quickly went off the rails.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n1991: NYC celebrity basketball event results in stampede, killing 9\n\nBilled as a charity event to benefit AIDS education, the celebrity basketball game organized in the final days of 1991 promised fans paying $20 each a hoops battle featuring the likes of Boyz II Men, Run-DMC, Jodeci, Heavy D and Big Daddy Kane.\n\nThe event, held in a basement college gym in Manhattan, quickly got out of control, with 5,000 people, many without tickets, pushing their way into a space meant for half those numbers. The ensuing stampede resulted in nine deaths. Although no criminal charges were ever brought against Combs for mishandling the event, he was fired by Uptown Records and was part of civil suits related to the incident.\n\n1999: Assault and harassment of record exec Steve Stoute\n\nNas' 1999 \"Hate Me Now\" music video featured a cameo by Diddy, who appeared Christ-like on a cross. But Combs suddenly decided he did not want that scene in the video, and took that complaint to Interscope executive Steve Stoute. What followed was a beatdown, Stoute said.\n\n\"One minute I'm in the middle of a meeting,\" Stoute told the Los Angeles Times, \"and the next minute I'm down on the floor and Puffy and his guys are kicking and pounding me.\"\n\nCombs pleaded guilty to a minor charge of harassment and then made a $500,000 payment to Stoute for so-called management fees.\n\n1999: NYC nightclub shooting involving JLo and Shyne\n\nIn perhaps the most alarming Diddy incident of 1999, the rapper was at a Manhattan club with then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez. Diddy and his bodyguard Anthony \"Wolf\" Jones allegedly got into a disagreement with rapper Moses \"Shyne\" Barrow, and the resulting gunfight left three people injured. One was Natania Reuben, who has consistently claimed Diddy was one of the men shooting.\n\nAfter a police chase, Diddy, Lopez, Jones and Barrow were all briefly arrested. The ensuing jury trial found only Barrow serving prison time — nine years — for charges that included criminal possession of a weapon.\n\nFormer Bad Boy artist Shynesays Diddy 'destroyed' his life: 'I was defending him'\n\n2001: Alleged assault of Michigan TV host\n\nIn 2001, Michigan television host Roger Mills sued Combs after an alleged attack following a 1999 interview. Mills' then-attorney claimed Combs approached the host about an interview at WCHB-TV in Detroit but became angry when, during the interview, Mills asked Combs about claims the producer contributed to the death of The Notorious B.I.G.\n\nThe New York rapper, born Christopher Wallace, was gunned down in Los Angeles in 1997, just six months after a similar drive-by shooting death of West Coast rapper Tupac Shakur. After WCHB host Mills asked Combs about his ties to the incident, Combs' representative requested the tape of the interview and, when Mills refused, Combs' entourage attacked the host and took the tape, the host claimed. A spokeswoman for Combs denied the claims and accused Mills of extorting the rapper. At a 2004 civil trial, the jury ruled in favor of Combs.\n\n2001: Kim Porter sues for child support\n\nAfter a multi-year dispute over child support for their son Christian, Diddy settled the case by agreeing to pay model Kim Porter a reported five-figure monthly sum to provide for their child's education and medical expenses until the then-3-year-old turned 21.\n\nDiddy has fathered six children by four different women. His children also include adopted son Quincy, 33, whom Porter shared with Al B. Sure; Justin, 30, whose mother is Misa Hylton; Christian, now 26; Chance, 18, born to Sarah Chapman; D'Lila and Jessie, 17, born to Porter; and Love, 1, born to Dana Tran.\n\n2003: Diddy allegedly threatens business partner with baseball bat\n\nKirk Burrowes, a former executive at the successful '90s hip hop label Bad Boy Entertainment, which Combs founded in 1993, sued his former boss in 2003 claiming that in 1996 the rapper had used a baseball bat to intimidate Burrowes into signing away his rights to company stock.\n\nIn his $25 million lawsuit, Burrowes claimed that although he was fired in 1997, Combs had promised him a share in company profits. Lawyers for Combs responded by calling the suit \"pure fantasy.\" The lawsuit was thrown out in 2006.\n\n2007: Alleged assault of man outside nightclub\n\nIn 2007, Gerard Rechnitzer sued Combs for punching him after a night out at a Hollywood club. He claimed the incident happened after he approached Combs while he was talking to Rechnitzer's girlfriend.\n\n\"It is just another example of an opportunist seeking to fabricate a lawsuit based on a flat-out lie to try to take advantage of Mr. Combs' celebrity status,\" Combs' lawyer said at the time. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount in 2008.\n\n2010: Bad Boy music exec sues for age discrimination\n\nFormer Bad Boy Records music executive Francesca Spero filed a $12 million lawsuit against Combs for age discrimination in 2010, alleging the rapper fired her because of her age and disability. Spero, then 51, claimed the longtime relationship between the two soured after her hip surgery in 2008. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount in 2011.\n\n2015: Alleged assault of UCLA coach\n\nIn 2015, then-University of California, Los Angeles coach Sal Alosi claimed the rapper attacked him with a kettlebell after Alosi kicked his son Justin Combs, then a redshirt junior on UCLA's football team, out of practice. Combs was charged on multiple counts for the headline-making incident, including assault with a deadly weapon. Felony charges against Combs, who claimed self-defense, were dropped shortly after.\n\n2017: Personal chef sues for sexual harassment\n\nCombs' former personal chef, Cindy Rueda, sued the rapper for sexual harassment in 2017. Rueda claimed in two separate 2015 incidents that, after he berated her for being late, she walked in on Combs having sex while attempting to serve him breakfast and that the rapper and her other boss made sexual comments about the size of her lips. She also claimed she was not properly paid for overtime hours or travel. The lawsuit was settled in 2019 for an undisclosed amount.\n\n2023: Diddy sues Ciroc owner, severs ties\n\nCombs' ties with former business partner and liquor powerhouse Diageo went left when the label head sued the spirits brand for racial discrimination in 2023, months before the recent wave of civil suits against him.\n\nCombs claimed the London-based company didn't make vowed investments in the liquor brands Cîroc and DeLeon Tequila which he promoted and co-owned, respectively. Combs claimed the company treated the brands as second-rate \"urban\" products and that leadership told him race was a factor in limiting distribution to certain neighborhoods. Diageo claimed the relationship soured after Combs failed to make investments in DeLeon.\n\nCombs dropped his lawsuit and severed ties with the company in January.\n\nPresent-day: Sexual assault lawsuits, raids, trafficking indictment\n\nCombs' latest wave of legal trouble was spurred by a bombshell lawsuit filed by ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in November. The singer accused the mogul of rape, sex trafficking and physical abuse, with both settling for an undisclosed amount the next day. Other lawsuits include one filed by \"The Love Album\" producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones Jr. in February, accusing Combs of orchestrating \"a sex-trafficking venture.\"\n\nOther recent lawsuits have come from former model Crystal McKinney, an unnamed 17-year-old girl, then-fashion student April Lampros and then-college student Joi Dickerson-Neal. Law enforcement raided Combs' homes as part of a federal investigation in March.\n\nAnd earlier this month, Dawn Richard, formerly of the trio Diddy Dirty Money, sued Combs on 21 counts of sexual assault and battery, sex trafficking and copyright infringement.

Despite a proposed $50 million bail, Combs was ordered to remain in custody at the Special Housing Unit in Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center ahead of his upcoming May 5 trial — a ruling his legal team has challenged in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe criminal charges arrive nearly a year after Combs' ex-girlfriend and \"Me & U\" singer Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura accused Combs of rape, sex trafficking and physical abuse in November 2023. The lawsuit spurred multiple civil suits leveled against him with allegations of rape, sexual assault and similar claims as the ones listed in the Sept. 17 indictment unveiled by investigators.\n\nCombs and Ventura settled for an undisclosed amount a day after her lawsuit filing last year, but the unsealed indictment marked the first criminal charges against the Bad Boy Records founder. Combs, 54, has denied all accusations against him, although he publicly apologized in May after surveillance video leaked of him physically assaulting her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.\n\nWhile Combs' legal trouble has mounted over the past year, he has faced a plethora of controversy since Bad Boy Entertainment positioned him as one of the most powerful in music.

Golubski entered a plea of not guilty, said his attorney, Chris Joseph.\n\n“Roger maintains his innocence and looks forward to clearing his name from these decades-old and uncorroborated allegations,” Joseph said in an email to CNN.\n\nThe sex trafficking operation, which was run out of an apartment complex in the 1990s by a local crack dealer named Cecil Brooks and two other men, victimized girls as young as 13, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn exchange for his protection, Golubski collected cash from Brooks and was allowed to “choose girls to provide him sexual services,” the indictment alleges.\n\nGolubski, who retired from the police department in 2010, was charged in September with sexually assaulting a woman and a teenage girl two decades ago “while acting under color of law,” meaning he used his position as a police officer to commit the crimes. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges as well.\n\nAs he awaited trial under home confinement in that case, prosecutors unveiled a second indictment on Monday charging him with “conspiracy against rights” and two counts of “involuntary servitude” in connection with the alleged sex trafficking ring. Both cases stem from a years-long grand jury probe first reported by CNN last year.\n\nAccording to Monday’s indictment, Brooks recruited “young girls who were runaways” or came from broken homes and kept them locked in a room at an apartment complex where he and co-defendants LeMark Roberson and Richard “Bone” Robinson used threats and physical beatings to force them to engage in sex acts. The indictment refers to two unidentified victims who allege they were held captive and forced into sex.\n\nOne of the victims told authorities she was just 16 years old when Golubski pulled her hair, choked her and raped her.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Golubski’s co-defendants appeared in court and, if so, how they pleaded to the charges. None were immediately available for comment.\n\nGolubski first came under public scrutiny in 2016 for his work in the double murder conviction of a man named Lamonte McIntyre. McIntyre, who had served 23 years in prison, was freed in 2017 when the district attorney for Wyandotte County, which includes Kansas City, Kansas, concluded he no longer had faith in the conviction and asked a judge to dismiss the case.\n\nFollowing his release, McIntyre and his mother filed a civil lawsuit in federal court against multiple officers involved in his arrest, taking particular aim at Golubski. The suit accused Golubski of using his badge to terrorize the Black community for decades. It alleged a wide array of crimes and misconduct, including sexually preying upon vulnerable Black women and of having an illicit association with Brooks, who allegedly paid Golubski for information and protection.\n\nThe case settled over the summer for $12.5 million but neither Golubski, nor the other defendants, which included fellow officers and the county government, acknowledged any wrongdoing.\n\nThe allegations centered around Golubski garnered national attention last year when Team Roc, the social justice and philanthropic arm of rapper Jay-Z’s entertainment company Roc Nation, took out a full-page ad in the Washington Post calling the alleged police corruption in Kansas City “one of the worst examples of abuse of power in U.S. history” and urged the Department of Justice to investigate Golubski and the Kansas City Kansas Police Department.", "authors": ["Scott Glover Daniel A.

These rubbish dumps are comprised of clothes from all over the world, and cannot be disposed of in a safe manner as it is “not biodegradable and has chemical products”.\n\nThe United Nations warned the result is an “environmental and social emergency”. But in the place where “fast fashion goes to die”, the matter continues to spiral out of control – and the “scale is breathtaking”, National Geographic added.\n\n‘High human cost’\n\nThe fast fashion problem extends globally. Ghanaian clothes traders have visited Brussels to warn of the “‘environmental catastrophe’ of dumping vast amounts of textiles in the west African country”, said The Guardian.\n\nIt is estimated that approximately 100 tonnes of second-hand clothing is discarded every day in the nation’s capital, Accra, the newspaper added, and fast fashion producers are being urged to shoulder the blame.\n\nThe fashion industry is “responsible for 8-10% of global emissions”. There are growing fears about how fast fashion could impact climate change, the BBC reported, with the use of raw materials being the number one culprit.\n\nCotton is estimated to use “about 2.5% of the world’s farmland”, while the production process for clothing requires “43 million tonnes of chemicals a year”, the broadcaster said.\n\nWith clothes produced at a faster rate, companies are churning out waste and using valuable resources in larger quantities.\n\nSimilar landfill mountains have been observed in Nairobi, Kenya, reported the Daily Mail, as exporting junk clothes to less developed countries “has become an ‘escape valve’ for ‘systemic overproduction’”. Investigators said the “stealth waste stream should be illegal”.\n\nA lack of workers’ rights and poor working conditions have also been cited as a symptom and side effect of fast fashion, with sweatshops and textile factories under the spotlight.\n\n“My fingers were bleeding, but they forced me to work gruelling hours for less than two dollars a day,” Nasreen Sheikh, a Nepalese former child labourer, told El País. The then nine-year-old “slept, ate and worked in the same room”, and now “denounces the high human cost of fast fashion in the Global North”.\n\nFast fashion’s ‘curious comeback’\n\n“If consumers want to keep up with the Jones’, or the Kardashians, who is anyone to say them nay?” argued Walter Block in an article for the Foundation for Economic Education.\n\nFor Block, fast fashion is not “an example of capitalism gone wild”, despite the “present hissy fit” to the contrary. Instead, criticisms of fast fashion “often crumble in the face of basic economics”.\n\nThose who spearhead so-called fast fashion brands have also defended their processes. John Lyttle, CEO of Boohoo, told BBC Radio 5 Live’s “Wake Up to Money” in 2021 that immediacy is the “biggest trend”.\n\nIt is a “curious comeback” for fast fashion, said The Wall Street Journal, but one that can be attributed to the online apparel retailer Shein. The store brought in “$23 billion of revenue” last year, making it “worth more than H&M and Zara combined”, the paper reported.\n\nThe demand for these brands remains high, as Shein plans to “open 30 stores this year to rival Primark”, said the Daily Mirror. “The temporary stores will open across the EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) region as Shein looks to increase its high street presence”, the newspaper added.\n\nShein, though, is also under the microscope “for its alleged reliance on supply chains that run through the Xinjiang region of China, the site of widespread human rights abuses against the Uyghur minority”, said Politico.", "authors": ["Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Devika Rao", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Peter Weber", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/06"}]}

The complaint obtained by USA TODAY claims that during the debate, Trump falsely said that the \"Central Park Five\" members killed someone and pled guilty to the crime in 1989.\n\nThe former president's comments came after Vice President Kamala Harris said he \"took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five,\" according to a news release from the men's attorneys, Shanin Specter and Alexander Van Dyke. In response to Harris, Trump allegedly said the men \"admitted – they said, they pled guilty.

The Plaintiffs seek to correct the record and clear their names once again,” Specter said in the release.\n\nElection 2024 live updates:Trump, Harris to hit crucial swing states; latest polls\n\nTrump took out scathing advertisement in 1989 calling for death of Central Park assaulters\n\nThe \"Central Park Five,\" who are now all between the ages of 50 and 52, were wrongly convicted for a series of assaults that occurred in Central Park in New York City on April 19, 1989, according to the lawsuit. At the time of their convictions, the members were between 14 and 16 years old.\n\nWhen initially interviewed by police in 1989, the teenagers denied having any knowledge of the Central Park assaults, including that of Patricia Meili. But after hours of \"coercive interrogation,\" four of the boys agreed to provide written and videotaped statements admitting to being present during the assaults, the lawsuit reads.\n\nOn May 1, 1989, 11 days after the assault and rape of Meili in Central Park, Trump published a full-page advertisement in four New York City newspapers alluding to the crimes. The advertisement did not identify the suspects, but called for the city of New York to \"[s]end a message loud and clear to those who would murder our citizens and terrorize New York—BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY AND BRING BACK OUR POLICE!”\n\n“I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer... I want to hate these murderers and I always will... I am looking to punish them... I want them to understand our anger. I want them to be afraid,\" Trump wrote in the advertisement, per the lawsuit.\n\nTrump did not apologize for comments in post-debate spin room\n\nImmediately following the debate on Sept. 10, Trump passed through the spin room to answer questions from attendees, including Yusef Salaam, the lawsuit reads. During this post-debate event, the Republican presidential nominee was asked, \"Will you apologize to the Exonerated Five?” and “Sir, what do you say to a member of the Central Park Five, sir?”\n\nTrump allegedly did not respond to the question, which prompted Salaam to say, \"President Trump, I’m Yusef Salaam, one of the Exonerated Five. How are you doing?” Trump responded, “Ah, you’re on my side then.” Salaam then said, \"No, no, no, I’m not on your side.”\n\nTrump would then wave his hand at Salaam, smile and walk, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"Plaintiff Salaam was attempting to politely dialogue with Defendant Trump about the false and defamatory statements that Defendant Trump had made about Plaintiffs less than an hour earlier, but Defendant Trump refused to engage with him in dialogue,\" the lawsuit alleges.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/", "title": "Exclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential ...", "text": "Nick Penzenstadler, and Susan Page\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDonald Trump is a fighter, famous for legal skirmishes over everything from his golf courses to his tax bills to Trump University. But until now, it hasn’t been clear precisely how litigious he is and what that might portend for a Trump presidency.\n\nAn exclusive USA TODAY analysis of legal filings across the United States finds that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and his businesses have been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions in federal and state courts during the past three decades. They range from skirmishes with casino patrons to million-dollar real estate suits to personal defamation lawsuits.\n\nThe sheer volume of lawsuits is unprecedented for a presidential nominee. No candidate of a major party has had anything approaching the number of Trump’s courtroom entanglements.\n\nJust since he announced his candidacy a year ago, at least 70 new cases have been filed, about evenly divided between lawsuits filed by him and his companies and those filed against them. And the records review found at least 50 civil lawsuits remain open even as he moves toward claiming the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in seven weeks. On Tuesday, court documents were released in one of the most dramatic current cases, filed in California by former students accusing Trump University of fraudulent and misleading behavior.\n\nThe legal actions provide clues to the leadership style the billionaire businessman would bring to bear as commander in chief. He sometimes responds to even small disputes with overwhelming legal force. He doesn’t hesitate to deploy his wealth and legal firepower against adversaries with limited resources, such as homeowners. He sometimes refuses to pay real estate brokers, lawyers and other vendors.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nAs he campaigns, Trump often touts his skills as a negotiator. The analysis shows that lawsuits are one of his primary negotiating tools. He turns to litigation to distance himself from failing projects that relied on the Trump brand to secure investments. As USA TODAY previously reported, he also uses the legal system to haggle over his property tax bills. His companies have been involved in more than 100 tax disputes, and the New York State Department of Finance has obtained liens on Trump properties for unpaid tax bills at least three dozen times.\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes, tied to Trump and his companies\n\nAnd despite his boasts on the campaign trail that he “never” settles lawsuits, for fear of encouraging more, he and his businesses have settled with plaintiffs in at least 100 cases reviewed by USA TODAY. Most involve people who say they were physically injured at Trump properties, with settlements that range as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nAlan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said in an interview that the number and tenor of the court cases is the “cost of doing business” and on par with other companies of a similar size. \"I think we have far less litigation of companies of our size,\" he said.\n\nHowever, even by those measures, the number of cases in which Trump is involved is extraordinary. For comparison, USA TODAY analyzed the legal involvement for five top real-estate business executives: Edward DeBartolo, shopping-center developer and former San Francisco 49ers owner; Donald Bren, Irvine Company chairman and owner; Stephen Ross, Time Warner Center developer; Sam Zell, Chicago real-estate magnate; and Larry Silverstein, a New York developer famous for his involvement in the World Trade Center properties.\n\nTo maintain an apples-to-apples comparison, only actions that used the developers' names were included. The analysis found Trump has been involved in more legal skirmishes than all five of the others — combined.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis included an examination of legal actions for and against Trump and the more than 500 businesses he lists on the personal financial disclosure he filed with the Federal Election Commission. USA TODAY also reviewed five depositions in which Trump sat for 22 hours of sworn testimony. This report is based on those legal filings as well as interviews with dozens of his legal adversaries.\n\nA handful of the ongoing cases involve local or state government entities, with the possibility of personal legal disputes between the president of the United States and other branches of government if Trump is elected. For instance, the Trump team has filed a lawsuit seeking a state ethics investigation of the New York attorney general. The suit was filed in response to an ongoing fraud investigation into Trump University by the attorney general, an elected state official.\n\nTrump, New York attorney general spar again over Trump U.\n\nAnd at a campaign rally in San Diego last Friday, Trump railed against a federal judge overseeing an ongoing lawsuit against Trump University. Trump said Judge Gonzalo Curiel \"happens to be, we believe Mexican,\" and called him a \"hater of Donald Trump\" who \"railroaded\" him. Born in Indiana, Curiel was appointed to the federal bench by President Obama. The judge on Tuesday unsealed hundreds of pages of documents in the case.\n\nThe trial is set for November — just after Election Day.\n\nTrump’s history of legal actions provides clues about his style as a leader and manager. While he is quick to take credit for anything associated with his name, he is just as quick to distance himself from failures and to place responsibility on others. In one lawsuit — filed against him by condo owners who wanted their money back for a Fort Lauderdale condo that was never built — he testified in a sworn deposition: “Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers.”\n\nAt times, he and his companies refuse to pay even relatively small bills. An engineering firm and a law firm are among several who filed suits against Trump companies saying they weren't paid for their work. In a 2011 deposition tied to a dispute over his deal with Van Heusen menswear, he said he abruptly decided not to sign a check to a firm that helped broker the deal, after 11 consecutive quarterly payments, because \"I don't feel that these people did very much, if anything, with respect to this deal.”\n\nThe number of lawsuits raises questions about potential conflicts and complications if Trump does win the White House. Dozens of cases remain unresolved, about half in which he is the plaintiff. It raises the possibility of individuals being sued by the president of the United States, or suing him, in non-governmental disputes.\n\nUnder the law, Trump wouldn’t get special advantages as the plaintiff — or protections as a defendant. Under long-standing conflict-of-interest rules, as a plaintiff he couldn’t improperly benefit from governmental knowledge. He also wouldn’t get immunity from civil litigation that stemmed from events prior to taking office.\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK gathered Trump court files\n\nTogether, the lawsuits help address this question: How would Trump’s record in business translate into leading the most powerful government on the globe — a task that involves managing a $4 trillion annual budget, overseeing 1.8 million civilian federal employees and commanding the most powerful armed forces in the world?\n\nWhile leaders who had business careers sometimes have been elected to the White House — oilmen George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, for instance, and mining engineer Herbert Hoover — the jobs have some fundamental differences, political scientists and presidential historians say. A president can't rule by fiat, as some CEOs do. And getting things done in government often involves building coalitions among legislators and foreign leaders who have their own priorities and agendas.\n\n“He’s operating as his own boss and a CEO-on-steroids mentality, where you snap a finger and things get done,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who has written biographies of Franklin Roosevelt and Teddy Roosevelt and edited Ronald Reagan’s diaries. “But a lot of good governance is on learning how to build proper coalitions and how to have patience with the glacial pace of government, and you’re forced to abide by laws at all times. \"\n\nBrinkley sees \"a lot of warning signs about having someone of Trump’s temperament and professional disposition being the commander-in-chief.”\n\nTo be sure, likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has had her own legal challenges, including an ongoing FBI investigation and civil lawsuits into her exclusive use of an email server while secretary of State. When husband Bill Clinton was president, she was involved in investigations by special counsels looking into the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas and other controversies. None resulted in legal charges against her.\n\nDuring her time as first lady, U.S. senator from New York and secretary of State, Clinton has been named in more than 900 lawsuits, mostly as a defendant, a review of state and federal court records finds. More than a third of the lawsuits were filed by federal prisoners, political activists or other citizens seeking redress from the government by suing a list of high-ranking officials.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis identified at least 3,500 legal actions involving Trump. Reporters reviewed thousands of pages of records collected electronically and in person from courts in 33 states over three months, read more than 20 hours of depositions and interviewed dozens of litigants.\n\nAmong those cases with a clear resolution, Trump's side was the apparent victor in 451 and the loser in 38. In about 500 cases, judges dismissed plaintiffs' claims against Trump. In hundreds more, cases ended with the available public record unclear about the resolution.\n\nClose to half the court cases — about 1,600 — involved lawsuits against gamblers who had credit at Trump-connected casinos and failed to pay their debts. About 100 additional disputes centered on other issues at the casinos. Trump and his enterprises have been named in almost 700 personal-injury claims and about 165 court disputes with government agencies.\n\nDozens dealt with the bankruptcy proceedings of Trump's companies, and dozens more involved plaintiffs' lawsuits against Trump businesses that judges terminated because the Trump companies targeted had gone bankrupt.\n\nThey include Trump's ongoing suit against the town of Palm Beach over airplane noise near his Mar-a-Lago Club and an earlier lawsuit against the town over an 80-foot flag pole. Trump's team argued in court that a smaller flag would understate his patriotism, but he eventually settled with town officials, agreeing among other concessions to lower the pole by 10 feet.\n\nThere also are disputes with local governments from New York to Florida to Nevada over the size of his property-tax bills.\n\nThe terms of most of the 100 settlements that Trump and his businesses reached with plaintiffs have not been disclosed. In about 60 additional cases, those sued by the Trump side have settled with him.\n\nA few have become fodder on the campaign trail, including two breach-of-contract lawsuits he filed against restaurateurs in connection with Trump's development of the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. The businesses said they backed out of deals with Trump because of his derogatory comments about Mexicans. Both lawsuits are pending.\n\nThe luxury Trump hotel will have a prime view of the Inaugural Parade next January.\n\nReview of thousands of legal actions show that Trump is fiercely protective of his brand, quick to distance himself from deals that struggle, willing to deploy outsized resources against adversaries and sometimes prone to micro-management, even in disputes that involve relatively small amounts of money. Those approaches, however appropriate in a business setting, may not translate to a political one, especially at the level of the White House.\n\nAmong the details:\n\n• Trump distances himself from deals that sour.\n\nWhen projects struggle, Trump doesn’t hesitate to cut ties, even those that relied on his name to secure investments. That was the case in condo projects that were never completed in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Panama and Baja, Mexico.\n\nCondo buyers who sued to get their deposits back often said they believed Trump was a full partner in the buildings. Trump was shielded by disclaimers in sales agreements explaining his branding-only role, though plaintiffs and their lawyers argued in court that fine print didn’t sync with marketing materials that made it appear these were Trump properties.\n\nIn depositions and court filings in the condo cases and similar branding deals, Trump's team appears to try to have it both ways in depicting his involvement. On one hand, Trump contends deep influence over even the smallest details to ensure Trump-branded products and developments are up to his standard, and he places high importance on the influence of his marketing muscle in such deals — usually as the lead name, face and voice behind a project.\n\nOn the other hand, his team argues in court that he's not liable for the deals that fail because he's simply lent his name.\n\nTrump himself walked lawyers through the difference between a brander and a developer in a 2013 deposition in one of the Fort Lauderdale condo cases.\n\n“Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers,” Trump said, arguing he’s not accountable when a project he lends just his name to goes under. “We worked on the documents, we worked on the room sizes and the things, but we didn't give out the contracts, we didn't get the financing, we weren't the developer, but we did work with the developer.”\n\nIn lawsuits over his Trump University, he testified that he had never met instructors who were described in the university’s promotional materials as being “handpicked” by him. “It depends on the definition of what that means, handpicked,” Trump said during an exchange with a lawyer in a sworn deposition last December.\n\nWhen attorneys representing plaintiffs pointed out some instructors had criminal pasts and had been accused of berating seniors who signed up for the program, Trump replied: “In every business, people slip through the cracks.”\n\nFlorida attorney Sherri Simpson, who defends homeowners in foreclosure actions, said she signed up for Trump University classes because she hoped to capitalize on low prices during the housing downturn. She wanted to turn to a trusted real-estate name to learn how.\n\n“I’m aggravated that I lost all that money,” she said in an interview. “He promised to hire the best, to handpick the instructors, make sure everyone affiliated with the program was the best. But he didn’t do that.”\n\n• Trump is willing to spend large sums on small claims.\n\nNo detail is too small for a Trump suit, and he often brings to bear overwhelming legal resources that enable him to outlast his adversaries.\n\nIn February, he filed five lawsuits against eight neighbors of his Doral golf club in Miami for $15,000 in damages to reimburse him for \"vandalizing\" or \"destroying\" expensive areca palms and other plants his groundskeepers installed between their homes and the course. Trump's staff says the foliage was planted to block golfers' views of the houses; the homeowners say the trees blocked their views of the course. All five cases are pending.\n\n“No other developer put so many resources in trying to fight claims brought by the plaintiffs,” said Jared Beck, a Miami attorney who has represented dozens of clients in lawsuits against developers in South Florida. He said none has fought with the tenacity of Trump, citing a “mismatch of resources” that often works in Trump’s favor.\n\nBeck is now appealing to the Florida Supreme Court a case that dates to 2008 in which he represented a group of people who invested in condos in a failed development in Fort Lauderdale to which Trump licensed his name. “He is willing to go to the mat and has practically unlimited resources.”\n\n• Trump fiercely protects the monetary value of “Trump” as a brand name.\n\nTrump publicly has placed the value of his licensed real estate and other branding deals at $3.3 billion, though Forbes and other analysts question whether the figure is inflated. His moniker drives the value of his licensing deals, which now make up an important arm of his business model.\n\nIn one case, a South Florida developer hired experts who testified that having Trump's name attached to their proposed condominium development boosted the condos' value by at least $200 per square foot. The swanky seaside complex was only partially built, prompting some condo buyers to file a lawsuit against Trump and the developers seeking to recover their deposits. The developers had paid to license Trump’s brand, allowing them to use Trump’s name, his image and his reputation to help them sell units.\n\nTrump has attempted to pull out or distance himself from similar licensing deals, real estate and otherwise, if he feels the situation is hurting his brand. He also goes to court to collect royalties and other fees he says he's owed on those same kinds of deals.\n\n“Anything I put my name to is very important,” Trump said in a 2010 deposition tied to a failed real-estate development in Tampa licensed to carry Trump’s “mark,\" as he calls it. \"If I allow my name to be used, whether it’s a partnership or whether it is a licensing deal, they are all very important to me.”\n\nTrump sued for $4.5 million over unpaid royalties after a company that had been paying him to call its liquor Trump Vodka fell on hard times during the economic downturn, hurting sales of pricier spirits. The company stopped making its licensing payments, and Trump terminated the deal and sued to recoup what he was owed. He won a judgment for the amount, though it's unclear whether he ever collected from the troubled company.\n\nAnd he has been aggressive in suing unrelated companies that were using his name without permission. He won rulings over attempts to market Trump’s Best Coffee, a series of websites with names like trumpabudhabi.com and trumpbeijing.com, and a marketing agency calling itself Trump Your Competition.\n\nTrump’s general counsel, Garten, defended the number of lawsuits. “Our philosophy is that we are a company of principle,” he said. “When we believe we are in the right, we are going to pursue the matter to the end. If that requires that we go to trial and present evidence to a jury, we are prepared to do so. We are not going to cave to pressure.”\n\nBut experts in the presidency and business say Trump’s record, including in courtroom disputes, raise questions about whether he has exhibited the leadership qualities that have distinguished the nation’s most successful presidents.\n\n“Somebody like Lyndon Johnson was a guy who woke up in the morning studying the decisions and the hopes and the strengths and the weaknesses of all the people he had to influence,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and author of Leadership BS: Fixing Workplaces and Careers One Truth at a Time. “For that, you need two traits I think Trump lacks: Number one, an attention to detail, and number two, you have to subordinate your own ego. I’ve seen nothing from Trump that suggests he has that capacity, and government is the art of compromise.”\n\nTrump’s lack of government experience was a political advantage during the GOP primaries, reinforcing his status as an outsider vowing to shake up a dysfunctional Washington. But it threatens to be a liability in the general election. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week, six in 10 voters said they had reservations about or were uncomfortable with Trump’s lack of experience in government or the military.\n\nEven so, some of those who have sued Trump, been sued by him or otherwise been caught up in his legal wake, say they still may vote for him in November.\n\nPhilip Monnin represented his daughter, Miss Pennsylvania contestant Sheena Monnin, in a defamation suit Trump filed after she posted on Facebook that she thought the 2012 Miss USA Pageant was “rigged.” An arbitration ruling upheld by a federal judge ordered her to pay $5 million in damages, although she and Trump eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed lesser amount. Monnin, who lives in Michigan, said the suit demonstrated Trump’s bullying tactics and attempts to intimidate legal opponents.\n\nBut he doesn’t rule out voting for Trump for president. “Both sides have failed to bring satisfactory candidates,” he said in an interview. “I don’t think any of us in the family has decided what to do, and we have a lot of time to consider how to cast our votes.”\n\nContributing: David McKay Wilson, Karen Yi, John Kelly and Kevin McCoy\n\nExclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee\n\nUSA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills\n\nTrump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes over taxes tied to Trump and his companies\n\nDive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits\n\nTrump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City\n\nAs campaign rolls on, so do Trump's lawsuits in Florida\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK is tracking Trump court files\n\nTrump and the Law", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/01/16/donald-trump-e-jean-carroll-defamation-damages-trial/72204395007/", "title": "'Pay dearly for what he's done': Donald Trump in court for ...", "text": "Damages expert witness for Carroll helped two election workers get $148 verdict against Rudy Giuliani.\n\nCarroll asked judge to consider avenues to prevent Trump from turning trial \"into a circus.\"\n\nE. Jean Carroll's lawyer told a New York federal jury that \"self-proclaimed billionaire\" Donald Trump needs to \"pay dearly\" for defaming her after he denied assaulting her in the mid-1990s.\n\nTrump, whose 2024 presidential campaign is colliding with a crowded schedule of criminal cases and lawsuits, sat attentively Tuesday in Judge Lewis Kaplan's Manhattan courtroom, glaring and scowling at times as about six-dozen prospective jurors answered questions posed by the judge over everything from their prior involvement with the judicial system to their political beliefs.\n\nWhen Kaplan asked if any members of the jury pool felt they'd been mistreated by the court system, Trump subtly raised his hand, to laughter from the gallery. “We know how you stand,” the judge said.\n\n'The biggest microphone on the planet'\n\nNine jurors were selected for the trial, which Kaplan said is likely to last three to five days. Jurors will remain anonymous, even to Trump, Carroll, lawyers and judicial staff, and will be driven to and from the courthouse from an undisclosed location for their safety, the judge said.\n\nIn their opening statements, lawyers for Carroll and Trump painted each other's client as the true villain of a case with potentially millions of dollars at stake.\n\nCarroll's lawyer Shawn Crowley told the jury that Trump, as president, had used \"the biggest microphone on the planet\" to defame the writer after she first publicly accused him of rape in 2019. Trump \"unleashed his millions of followers\" to threaten and terrorize Carroll, who now sleeps with a gun nearby, Crowley said. \"It's time to make him stop. It's time to make him pay dearly for what he's done.\"\n\nTrump attorney Alina Habba said Carroll was anything but a victim of Trump's comments. \"Her career has prospered and she has been thrust back into the limelight like she always wanted,\" Habba said, telling jurors that Carroll \"wanted status.\" \"She wanted the attention,\" Habba said.\n\nTrump leaves court to campaign in New Hampshire\n\nEarlier Tuesday, with the New Hampshire primary looming, Trump attacked the trial and his accuser.\n\n\"It is a giant Election Interference Scam, pushed and financed by political operatives. I had no idea who this woman was,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"PURE FICTION!\"\n\nTrump, 77, and Carroll, 80, were both in court for the trial's first day. Protesters stood outside the courthouse Tuesday morning holding signs that said “We believe E. Jean Carroll” and “Justice Matters.”\n\nWith a campaign speech scheduled in New Hampshire, Trump left before opening statements.\n\nTrump has said he plans to attend the the Manhattan federal trial and \"to explain I don't know who the hell she is.\" However, he won't be allowed to argue that he didn't sexually assault Carroll, Kaplan ruled last week. That's because a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in a separate civil trial in May, although it didn't find him liable for rape.\n\nTrump chose not to attend the previous trial, where he was also found to have defamed the bestselling author in 2022 by calling her a \"con job.\"\n\nAssault, defamation and damages\n\nCarroll first publicly accused Trump of rape in 2019, describing in a book excerpt how, sometime around 1996, the real estate magnate attacked her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store. After Trump denied the charge, Carroll sued him, first for defamation and, in 2022, for battery and defamation under a New York state law that temporarily put the statute of limitations on hold for alleged sexual assault victims. The cases were moved to federal court.\n\nThe current trial will focus on what Trump should have to pay for defaming Carroll after she first accused him of rape. The allegedly defamatory statements at issue include: ''Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity.\" Jurors will be asked whether those statements harmed Carroll and, if they did, how much she should get in damages.\n\nTrump was ordered to pay $5 million in combined damages for sexual abuse and a 2022 incident of defamation in the May 2023 trial.\n\nMore:Trump trials: Why former president faces ‘extraordinary’ challenges\n\nWhat is this trial about?\n\nThe trial is only focused on any potential damages Trump might have to pay for his 2019 statements. A jury will be tasked with determining whether his remarks harmed Carroll and, if so, how to quantify that harm in dollars. The jury will also decide if Trump should be hit with punitive damages to deter him from continuing to defame Carroll.\n\n\"I'll say it with great respect: Number one, she's not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?\" Trump told reporters in the White House. Carroll said she confided in two friends soon after the attack but chose not to go to the police at the time, and didn't come forward publicly until numerous other women accused Trump of assault during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nViolent threats vs. mean tweets\n\nTrump's statements \"unleashed his followers to go after her online\" and \"to threaten her life,\" Crowley said in her opening statment. \"Donald Trump used the most famous platform on Earth to lie about what he had done.\"\n\nIn a video presentation, Crowley showed jurors some of the threats Carroll had recieved from Trump supporters, including messages that read, \"I will rape u, e jean carroll\" and \"I hope you die soon. I hope someone really does attack, rape and murder you.\"\n\nHabba said that, after the publication of her allegations in New York Magazine, Carroll had been the target of critical social media posts for hours before Trump first commented. \"She wants President Trump to pay for the risks she took,\" Habba said. \"Her career was dwindling and it needed a spark.\"\n\nCarroll wanted the jury to \"give her a windfall because some people on social media said mean things about her,\" Habba said.\n\nTrump had tried to argue that he is protected from the lawsuit by presidential immunity because the statements responded to allegations that threatened his ability to govern effectively. But Kaplan and an appeals court both ruled he had waived that argument by waiting too long to raise it.\n\nWill Trump testify, and what could he say?\n\nTrump's lawyer said in a Sunday letter to the court that there is \"considerable testimony\" Trump can offer in his defense while respecting the court's restrictions, including an argument that he shouldn't be punished with extra damages because he didn't act maliciously.\n\nKaplan on Friday denied a Trump request to delay the trial to allow him to attend his mother-in-law's funeral. Trump also raised the death in a failed request to delay closing arguments in a New York civil fraud trial last week. Funeral preparations didn't prevent Trump from campaigning in Iowa over the weekend ahead of the state's presidential nomination caucuses on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Kaplan again refused to suspend the trial for the funeral, in a fiery exchange between the judge and the former president’s lawyers.\n\nTrump attorney Michael Madaio argued that the judge had made “inconsistent and unfair” rulings that “drastically changed our ability to defend this case and largely stripped us of our defenses.”\n\nHabba then requested that the trial be adjourned on Thursday for the funeral of former first lady Melania Trump’s mother, Amalija Knavs.\n\n“I am not stopping him from being there,” Kaplan replied.\n\nHabba responded: “No, you’re stopping him from being here.”\n\nKaplan agreed to let Trump testify on Monday if he wants, even if the trial is otherwise finished by Thursday.\n\nPotential juror worked for Ivanka Trump\n\nDuring jury selection, Trump twisted in his chair to look at a prospective juror who said she had worked in a communications capacity for his daughter Ivanka Trump’s company in 2017 and 2018. Another potential juror said he’s a lawyer who has worked on unrelated issues with the firm representing Carroll. Both said they could be fair and impartial.\n\nAfter several dozen prospective jurors were sworn in, Trump shook his head as Kaplan described the case and explained that for purposes of the trial, it had already been determined that Trump “did sexually assault Ms. Carroll.”\n\nLast week, Carroll's lawyer asked Kaplan to consider measures to prevent Trump from turning the trial \"into a circus.\" The lawyer cited Trump's attacks on both a judge and the New York attorney general when he was given a brief opportunity to make a personal closing argument alongside his attorneys in the civil fraud case. The judge in that case urged an attorney to \"control\" the former president.\n\nTrump's lawyer shot back Sunday that Trump is \"well aware\" of restrictions on his testimony, and that it would be unjust to try to force him to say he is guilty of acts he denies.\n\nKaplan was circumspect in a written opinion about what he might do to ensure his rulings and the law are followed, saying he will take measures he \"finds appropriate.\"\n\nHow much could it cost Trump?\n\nDamages expert Ashlee Humphreys, a Northwestern University professor who helped two election workers win a $148 million defamation judgment against former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, is set to testify for Carroll as well. Trump's legal team tried to get her booted from the case, but the judge said their request was late and their criticisms of her methodology are fair game for cross-examination.\n\nHumphreys estimated it would take between $2.1 million and $12.1 million to repair damage to Carroll's reputation. Carroll wants not just compensation for the alleged harm she suffered, but also punitive damages, arguing that Trump's ongoing statements against her since her victory in May \"show the depth of his malice\" and the need for a hefty verdict to punish and deter him.\n\nThe verdict against Giuliani included $40 million for intentionally inflicting emotional distress and about $108 million more in compensation for defamation and punitive damages.\n\nThat's a likely reason Trump wanted Humphreys gone from the case, according to Carroll's legal team. \"That Professor Humphreys recently testified in another case that resulted in a $108 million defamation verdict likely adds to Trump’s sense of urgency,\" they told the court.\n\nGiuliani, who is also facing criminal charges for allegedly conspiring with Trump to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, has since filed for bankruptcy.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/alabama/2019/02/05/proud-boys-founder-gavin-mcinnes-sues-splc-over-hate-group-label/2775847002/", "title": "Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes sues SPLC over hate group label", "text": "The Associated Press\n\n\n\nMONTGOMERY — The founder of a far-right men's group filed a defamation lawsuit Monday against the Southern Poverty Law Center for labeling the organization as a hate group, in the latest attempt to use litigation to fight the extremist label.\n\nGavin McInnes, founder of the Proud Boys — an organization that describes its members as \"Western chauvinists\" — contends in the lawsuit that he was banned from social media platforms and saw his livelihood suffer after getting the designation from the SPLC.\n\nMore:SPLC sues to stop suspension of driver's licenses over unpaid traffic tickets\n\n\"What they do is they cast this wide net of 'everyone's a Nazi' and they start destroying lives,\" McInnes said during a news conference in front of the SPLC building in Montgomery. \"This is a free speech nation, and this is not a free speech organization.\"\n\nFacebook and Instagram announced in October that they were banning the Proud Boys and McInnes from their platforms because of policies against hate groups.\n\nRichard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a statement Monday that the lawsuit is meritless.\n\n\"Gavin McInnes has a history of making inflammatory statements about Muslims, women and the transgender community.

McInnes lives in Westchester, a New York City suburb.\n\nThe lawsuit is at least the third filed against the Southern Poverty Law Center or its leaders since June, when the organization apologized to a British group and its founder and agreed to pay $3.4 million after labeling them as anti-Muslim extremists.\n\nUnder the out-of-court settlement, the Southern Poverty Law Center issued written and video statements saying it was wrong to include the London-based Quilliam and Maajid Nawaz in a \"Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists\" in 2016.\n\nLast month, the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies sued Richard Cohen, the law center's president, and Heidi Beirich, the director of its intelligence unit, in federal court claiming the organization had wrongly labeled it as an anti-immigrant hate group. The suit seeks an unspecified amount, court records show.\n\nMaryland attorney Glen K. Allen filed a lawsuit in December seeking at least $6.5 million from the law center, Beirich and Mark Potok, a former senior fellow with the organization.

Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger – continues its investigation into everything leading up to, and involving, the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters that interrupted the certification of Joe Biden’s election win.\n\nOf special interest, according to CNN reporting, are Trump’s activities on January 6 and the efforts to use the levers of government to overturn the election.\n\nThe committee has issued at least 80 subpoenas requesting testimony or phone records from close Trump advisers, including Rudy Giuliani and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, “Stop the Steal” rally organizers and former White House staffers. It’s also asked some GOP lawmakers to cooperate as well.\n\nThe panel has obtained over 2,000 of Meadows’ text messages, including exchanges with GOP lawmakers, the Trump family, Fox host Sean Hannity, and conservative activist Ginni Thomas, among others.\n\nMultiple sources previously told CNN that the committee is planning to produce a multimedia presentation and hire a writer as part of its effort to turn its largely secretive work into a compelling narrative.\n\nJanuary 6: Lawsuits by Democratic lawmakers and police officers\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers and members of the US Capitol Police and Washington, DC Metropolitan Police are suing Trump, saying his words and actions incited the riot. Various cases accuse Trump of directing assault and battery; aiding and abetting assault and battery; and violating local Washington, DC, laws that prohibit incitement of riots and disorderly conduct.\n\nA federal judge in February said Trump’s statements to his supporters before the riot “is the essence of civil conspiracy,” Judge Amit Mehta wrote in a 112-page opinion, because Trump spoke about himself and rallygoers working “towards a common goal” of fighting and walking down Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n“The President’s January 6 Rally Speech can reasonably be viewed as a call for collective action,” Mehta said, allowing the civil cases to go forward.\n\nMehta, however, has dismissed the challenges against Giuliani, Donald Trump Jr. and GOP Rep. Mo Brooks.\n\nTrump and his top advisers have not been charged with any crimes. Trump and others who are sued have argued they are not responsible for the actions of the people who stormed the Capitol.\n\nWhite House documents: Moved to Mar-a-Lago? Classified? Flushed?\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, says at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort – including records that may have been classified.\n\nIt’s been widely reported that Trump would also rip up documents in the White House, but The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman has reported that that some may have been flushed down toilets. (Trump has denied this.)\n\nAny unauthorized retention or destruction of White House documents raises a red flag under a criminal law that prohibits the removal or destruction of official government records, legal experts tell CNN.\n\nThe FBI and federal prosecutors are investigating.\n\n2020 Election: Efforts to overturn Georgia results\n\nFulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis launched a special grand jury on Monday investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn Biden’s victory in Georgia.\n\nThe probe was launched last year following Trump’s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to “find” votes to overturn the election results.\n\n“This is a criminal investigation. We’re not here playing a game,” Willis told CNN’s Sara Murray. “I plan to use the power of the law. We are all citizens.”\n\nAs part of the investigation, Willis has been digging into Trump’s calls with Raffensperger and another official in the Secretary of State’s office; presentations Giuliani made before state lawmakers that were riddled with election falsehoods; a phone call between South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Raffensperger; and the sudden departure of Byung “BJay” Pak, the US attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\nWillis has been the target of racist threats and has asked the FBI for security assistance.\n\n2020 Election: Fake electors in Michigan\n\nThe Justice Department is looking at one aspect of a plot to put forward fake electors from seven states after a referral from the Michigan state attorney general.\n\nFake certificates were created by Trump allies in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Mexico, who sought to replace valid presidential electors from their states with a pro-Trump slate.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said forgeries of public records and election records could bring nearly 20 years in jail, according to state law. While nobody has been charged with a crime, Nessel said she has referred her investigation into the effort in Michigan to the US Justice Department.\n\nOne fake elector from Michigan boasted at a recent event hosted by a local Republican organization that the Trump campaign directed the entire operation.\n\n“We fought to seat the electors. The Trump campaign asked us to do that,” Meshawn Maddock, co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party, said at a public event last week that was organized by the conservative group Stand Up Michigan, according to a recording obtained by CNN.\n\nTrump Organization: NY AG criminal and civil investigation\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is investigating Trump’s namesake business, and recently detailed what her office believes are “misleading or fraudulent” financial statements.\n\nJames says her office has uncovered “significant” evidence “indicating that the Trump Organization used fraudulent or misleading asset valuations to obtain a host of economic benefits, including loans, insurance coverage and tax deductions.”\n\nShe recently broadened her civil investigation to include the role of the company’s long-time appraiser Cushman & Wakefield.\n\nIn April, a state judge moved to hold Trump in civil contempt in a fight over James’ subpoena for documents.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and has repeatedly said James’ investigation is politically motivated.\n\nTrump Organization: NY DA criminal investigation\n\nManhattan DA Alvin Bragg inherited that office’s probe into Trump’s businesses, but charges seem more unlikely as the grand jury has expired.\n\nProsecutors were focusing on the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s financial statements when seeking financing, people familiar with the matter have told CNN.\n\nBut in February, Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz, two senior prosecutors on the team, resigned last month – one day after Bragg informed them that he wasn’t prepared to move forward with criminal charges, CNN’s Kara Scannell reported.\n\nPersonal finances: Litigation with niece Mary Trump\n\nTrump and his niece Mary are in court over her cut of a 2001 family settlement.\n\nIn 2020, Mary Trump sued Trump, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired judge, and the executor of her late uncle Robert Trump’s estate, alleging “they designed and carried out a complex scheme to siphon funds away from her interests, conceal their grift, and deceive her about the true value of what she had inherited.”\n\nMeanwhile, the former President is suing his niece and The New York Times in New York state court over the disclosure of his tax information.\n\nDefamation: Suit over denial of rape claims by E. Jean Carroll\n\nMagazine writer E. Jean Carroll alleged Trump raped her in a New York department store dressing room in the mid 1990s and defamed her when he denied the rape, said she was not his type and alleged she made the claim to boost sales of her book.\n\nTrump and the Justice Department say Trump was a federal employee and his statements denying Carroll’s allegations were made in response to reporters’ questions while he was at the White House. They argue the Justice Department should be substituted as the defendant, which, because the government cannot be sued for defamation, would end the lawsuit.\n\nA federal judge denied that effort. DOJ and Trump appealed the ruling, and no decision has been made.\n\nTrump lost an attempt to countersue earlier this year. A judge called Trump’s motion “futile.” He agreed with Carroll’s argument that Trump’s effort was “at least in part for a dilatory purpose and thus at least in part in bad faith.”\n\nMichael Cohen: Claims of retaliation against Trump and Barr\n\nTrumps’ former lawyer, Michael Cohen, is suing Trump, former Attorney General William Barr and others, alleging they put him back in jail to prevent him from promoting his upcoming book while under home confinement.\n\nCohen was serving the remainder of his sentence for lying to Congress and campaign violations at home, due to Covid-19 concerns, when he started a social media campaign in summer 2020, Courthouse News reported.\n\nIn retaliation, Cohen says he was sent back to prison and spent 16 days in solitary until a federal judge intervened.", "authors": ["Dan Berman"], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/07/trump-rnc-purge/72856982007/", "title": "Trump RNC 'purge' has some committee members nervous about ...", "text": "Former President Donald Trump’s impending takeover of the Republican National Committee could give him access to a big new pile of cash at a time when he is beset by legal bills, making some committee members nervous.\n\nLimiting Trump's access to the RNC's coffers is a touchy subject, and an effort to pressure his team on spending restrictions failed. But it serves as another example of the pockets of Trump resistance that persist within the GOP.\n\nTrump pushed RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel to resign from the job after seven years, and wants his daughter-in-law Lara Trump and another loyalist, North Carolina Republican Party Chair Michael Whatley, to serve as co-chairs. Top Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita would be chief operating officer.\n\nRNC members are meeting in Houston on Friday to consider the leadership change.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for the RNC to be tightly integrated with the campaign of the Republican presidential nominee, a title Trump clinched after Nikki Haley dropped out of the race Wednesday. But there are some unusual aspects of Trump’s campaign that continue to worry some Republicans.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nA top concern is Trump’s mounting legal bills, and whether he could try and get the party to pay for them. Some committee members supported a failed resolution that aimed at prohibiting the RNC from picking up Trump’s legal tab.\n\nThe overhaul of RNC leadership also has critics.\n\n“I’ve been told by other people that it’s fairly common for a presidential candidate and the RNC to integrate but I feel right now what’s happening is not an integration, it’s something between a purge and a takeover and that’s a concern for me,” said RNC member and Vermont GOP Chair Paul Dame.\n\nTrump moves to put Lara Trump, other loyalists in key roles\n\nTrump is known to surround himself with family members: in business and in politics. One of the ways that Trump managed his first term at the White House was by appointing family to key roles, including daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nFor Trump, it's the only way to guarantee the utmost loyalty.\n\nHaving the party’s national organization dominated by one personality bothers Dame, who said he worries about what happens once Trump’s gone, and about the RNC taking on some Trump characteristics he finds troubling, such as vindictiveness.\n\n“One of my concerns is that Trump’s cooperation with the other Republicans has been very dependent on his perception of their loyalty to him and that’s an element if it makes its way into the RNC becomes very difficult,” he said.\n\nAs for not paying Trump’s legal bills, that should be a “slam dunk,” Dame said.\n\nDame said the RNC traditionally pays for a lot of things that help all Republican candidates, such as turning out “low propensity” voters, adding he believes that’s what most donors want. Paying for Trump’s legal bills only helps Trump, he said.\n\nTrump is facing 91 felony charges across four criminal cases, along with multiple civil lawsuits. His campaign and associated political committees already have spent tens of millions paying the lawyers defending Trump. He also was ordered to pay $83.3 million in a defamation case brought by the writer Jean Carroll, and $453.5 million including interest in a business fraud case.\n\nLaCivita has said repeatedly that RNC money won’t be used to pay Trump’s legal bills.\n\n\"I've made it perfectly clear... we would not be paying legal bills,\" LaCivita said Tuesday at Trump's Super Tuesday election night party in Palm Beach.\n\nSome RNC members wanted the commitment in writing, though.\n\nHenry Barbour, the Republican national committeeman from Mississippi, sponsored the resolution prohibiting the RNC from paying a candidate’s legal bills. He said it would've helped reassure donors.\n\n“I suspect if people thought a contribution to the RNC was going to legal bills that have nothing to do with the 2024 cycle they might be less likely to contribute to the RNC,” Barbour said.\n\nRNC discussion of legal bills 'still very much alive'\n\nBarbour's resolution needed support from 10 states, each with two co-sponsors, to force a vote Friday but only obtained eight. It was non-binding. A formal rule change would need to be approved at the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nWhile the resolution failed, Barbour said \"the discussion is still very much alive.\"\n\n“The RNC has one job and that’s to win elections,\" Barbour said, adding that paying a candidate's legal bills. “Has nothing to do with winning elections.”\n\nThe concerns surrounding Trump’s RNC takeover are another sign of the discomfort his campaign has elicited in some corners of the party, as evinced by Nikki Haley drawing a significant slice of the GOP primary vote through Super Tuesday despite polls showing for months that Trump was almost certain to be the nominee.\n\nTrump’s campaign continues to give plenty of Republicans heartburn, and they registered their discontent with protest votes in primary after primary. Haley won two primaries - Vermont and the District of Columbia - and topped 30% of the vote in a number of other states. Some states are still counting votes from Super Tuesday.\n\nThe majority of Republicans feel differently, though, and Trump's picks for RNC leadership are expected to easily win the election.\n\nMany Trump supporters are cheering on his RNC takeover. McDaniel has been under fire for years from GOP activists.\n\nSteve Bannon, a longtime Trump ally who served as his chief strategist in the White House, said on his podcast this week that Barbour's resolution was \"spitting in President Trump's face.\"\n\n\"This is another outrage at the RNC and we thought the whole thing was dealt with,\" Bannon said. \"We gotta see the building purged... all the building's gotta be purged - 100% purged.\"\n\nBill Palatucci, the Republican national committeeman from New Jersey, said he doesn’t have a problem with the nominee “putting their imprint on the committee.”\n\n“The important factor is senior staff, and Chris LaCivita in my experience is a pro and understands the role of the RNC in the presidential cycle,” Palatucci said in an email. “From there, it is the responsibility of the Executive Committee and the Budget Committee to insure that the spending is appropriate. “\n\nStan Pate, a Trump supporter from Alabama who gave six figure contributions to the main super PAC supporting Trump, said that McDaniel’s departure will make him more likely to support the RNC, and he’s fine with his money being used to pay Trump’s legal bills.\n\n“I’m fixing to write him another big check quite frankly,” said Pate, a real estate developer and investor. “I can tell you this: If he don’t win we’re all in trouble so I’ve got an opportunity to hopefully have some impact in that.”\n\nZac Anderson is Campaign 2024 reporter covering Donald Trump and Republicans for USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/09/donald-trump-trial-news-hush-money-case-live-updates/73621342007/", "title": "Trump trial replay: Stormy Daniels wraps combative cross-examination", "text": "Stormy Daniels finished hours of combative cross-examination by Donald Trump's lawyer Thursday in the former president's New York hush money trial, while lawyers said former Playboy model Karen McDougal would not testify.\n\nTrump attorney Susan Necheles raised minor inconsistencies in how Daniels has told the story of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump over the years. Necheles has also pressed Daniels on the ways she has profited from her story.\n\nStay posted with the latest newsTrump trial live updates: Ex-Oval Office aide who testified on checks returns to stand\n\nDaniels' story of that 2006 evening formed the basis for a $130,000 hush money payment she got from Trump lawyer Michael Cohen less than two weeks before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors allege the payment violated federal campaign finance laws and that Trump falsified records to cover it up.\n\nAfter Daniels' defiant testimony wrapped, prosecutors called less controversial witnesses, including Madeleine Westerhout, who was Trump's White House special assistant before she was fired in 2018 for dishing on the Trump children with reporters. Judge Juan Merchan also rejected the former president's request for a mistrial.\n\nCatch up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nProceedings end for Thursday\n\nThe jury was sent home early today, but proceedings for everyone else ran late. After denying for a second time the Trump team's request for a mistrial based on Stormy Daniels' testimony, the judge sent everyone home. Proceedings will start again at 9:30 a.m. EDT on Friday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge uses Trump lawyer's words against him, denies motion for mistrial\n\nJudge Juan Merchan said he went back to the transcript of opening statements at the trial after the Trump team asked for a mistrial on Tuesday. He said Trump lawyer Todd Blanche denied Trump and Daniels ever had sex.\n\nThat denial was, indeed, clear and emphatic: Blanche said Daniels was paid for her agreement not to publicly spread \"false – false – claims\" about Trump, placing emphasis on the first word.\n\n\"Your denial puts the jury in a position of having to choose who they believe,\" Merchan said Thursday. The prosecution, he said, had the right to rehabilitate Daniels' credibility after that opening statement, which had \"immediately attacked it.\"\n\nMerchan also disputed the Trump team's claim that they didn't object earlier in Daniels' testimony because they believed Merchan had ruled in advance that it was permitted. He said, looking back at the record, Trump lawyer Susan Necheles objected very early on, and so she can't say she didn't object because of his ruling. He said there were many times when she could have objected and didn't, and he pointed to specific page numbers in the transcript.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump lashes out at judge over gag order preventing him from talking about Stormy Daniels\n\nDonald Trump stormed out of the courtroom on Thursday blasting Judge Juan Merchan, who refused to modify his gag order so that Trump could respond to the testimony from porn actress Stormy Daniels.\n\n“Everybody saw what happened today,” Trump told reporters in a one-minute statement. “I don’t think we have to do any explaining. I’m not allowed to anyway because this judge is corrupt.”\n\nMerchan refused Trump lawyer Todd Blanche’s request to change his order prohibiting Trump from talking about witnesses or jurors in the trial.\n\nDaniels had detailed a sexual encounter that Trump has denied outside court ever happened. But Merchan said if Trump wanted to rebut her testimony, he should do so in court rather than outside.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nProsecutor says Stormy Daniels' story is why Donald Trump 'tried so hard to prevent the American people from hearing about this'\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass argued that the bad light Daniels' story puts Trump in is core to the entire election interference case, alleging that Daniels' story was Trump's \"motive\" for the hush money arrangement.\n\nThe fact that \"the testimony is prejudicial and messy, according to Mr. Blanche – that is why Mr. Trump tried so hard to prevent the American people from hearing about this.\"\n\nSteinglass added that the prosecution kept out many embarrassing details about Trump. He said he could submit a private document to the court on those details, and he specifically referenced details of the alleged sexual encounter. He characterized the earlier alleged dinner as a \"relatively harmless conversation,\" by comparison.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nStormy Daniels used a 'dog whistle for rape,' Trump lawyer says\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche − who is urging Judge Merchan to both allow Trump to respond publicly to Stormy Daniels' testimony and to declare a mistrial based on it − said portions of her testimony were a \"dog whistle for rape.\" He complained about her saying she forgot aspects of the alleged sexual encounter and describing a power imbalance between her and the real estate mogul.\n\nBlanche also said \"it almost defies belief that we're here about a records case\" and the government is asking about Daniels rolling up a magazine while at dinner with Trump and \"spanking him.\" He questioned the relevancy of the testimony, compared to what he described as its prejudicial nature.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump visibly displeased as judge indicates he will maintain gag order\n\nTrump shifted from leaning forward to sitting back in his chair, making a face of visible displeasure, as the judge responded to defense lawyer Todd Blanche's argument for modifying the gag order.\n\nMerchan said: \"I don't see what you're referring to as a new set of facts.\"\n\nWhile Merchan continued talking to Blanche, whom the judge asked to sit down, Trump turned to his right and started simultaneously quietly speaking to Blanche for a short time.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:Here's what to know about Donald Trump's lead lawyer in his hush money trial\n\nJudge signals he won't modify gag order, citing Trump's 'track record'\n\nJudge Juan Merchan and defense attorney Todd Blanche are still in a back-and-forth, but Merchan has indicated he's not inclined to modify Trump's gag order.\n\n\"My concern is not just with protecting Ms. Daniels or a witness who has already testified,\" he said. \"My concern is with protecting the integrity of these proceedings as a whole.\"\n\n\"Witnesses who have not testified will see what happens,\" Merchan added. He said potential witnesses will see Trump assailing people who have testified and infer they could be next.\n\n\"I can't take your word for it\" that Trump's comments, if permitted, would be \"low key,\" Merchan added. \"Because that's just not the track record.\"\n\nTrump has been found in contempt for violating Merchan's gag order on 10 occasions, and the judge has threatened jail time for future violations.\n\nMerchan referred to past attacks Trump has made in his legal cases, which the judge referenced when he issued the gag order, describing them as \"vitriol.\"\n\n\"Your client's track record speaks for itself,\" Merchan said.\n\nNonetheless, Blanche is continuing to plead about the issue.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecutor paints potential gag order changes as a threat to witnesses\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy is pushing an argument Judge Juan Merchan has already expressed some sympathy for: That Donald Trump's gag order doesn't just protect the potential and actual witnesses that Trump would be inclined to attack, it also protects other potential witnesses who haven't yet been named.\n\n\"The gag order doesn't just protect the potential and actual witnesses that Trump would otherwise target, but also other potential witnesses who see the attacks,\" Conroy said.\n\nMerchan made that point when he previously addressed the Trump team's complaint that Trump can't attack Michael Cohen's likely participation in the hush money trial, even though Cohen regularly attacks Trump on public platforms.\n\nModifying the gag order \"would signal to future witnesses that they could be at risk as well,\" Conroy said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:Under threat of jail, stakes for Trump gag order violations climb. What can he still say?\n\nTrump lawyer targets gag order over Stormy Daniels testimony\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche is asking for accommodation when it comes to Judge Merchan's gag order so that Trump can respond to porn star Stormy Daniels' testimony.\n\nBlanche said the press has been reporting over the past 24 hours on the \"current version\" of Daniels' story, which \"we believe is completely false.\" Blanche characterized Daniels' story as \"completely different in kind\" from her past accounts of a purported 2006 sexual liaison with Trump. Blanche also characterized Trump's ability to respond as an election-related issue.\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy has begun responding.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:Trump's trial, Stormy Daniels and why our shifting views of sex and porn matter right now\n\nFormer Playboy model Karen McDougal will not testify, Trump lawyer says he's been told\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche said the prosecution told him they don't plan to call former Playboy model Karen McDougal to testify.\n\nMcDougal received a $150,000 payment form the National Enquirer's parent company to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump. Trump denies he had a relationship with the December 1997 Playmate of the Month.\n\nFor that reason, the Trump team is no longer renewing a motion to exclude her testify, Blanche said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJury sent home for evening\n\nJudge Juan Merchan sent the jury home for the evening, indicating we will start back up tomorrow. However, Merchan is still holding a hearing now about issues Trump lawyer Todd Blanche raised earlier.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'He was a really good boss': Westerhout praises former president\n\nFormer presidential aide Madeleine Westerhout said Trump never once made her feel like she didn't deserve her job in the White House, or that she didn't belong there, which she found especially notable since she was in an office filled with \"older men.\"\n\n\"He was a really good boss,\" she said, adding she hopes he respected her and her job. She found him \"really enjoyable to work for.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWesterhout praises Trump as she describes book, seeing Trump at fundraiser\n\nMadeleine Westerhout testified about writing her 2020 book, Off the Record, about her experience in the White House. She said she wanted to document the \"incredible experience\" she had in the Trump administration, and that it was important to her to share with the American people \"the man that I got to know.\"\n\nWesterhout was fired from the White House in 2018, but her allegiance to Trump endured. \"I don't think he's treated fairly and I wanted to tell that story,\" she said.\n\nWesterhout said she has spoken to Trump since the publication of her book. She saw he was having a fundraiser near her home and called one of his aides to ask if she could come to say hello. The aide said yes, so she got to see him then.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAide admired relationship between Melania and Donald Trump\n\nBefore speaking about getting fired, former Trump White House aide Madeleine Westerhout said she had admired the relationship between Melania and Donald Trump. She characterized it as \"really special\" and a relationship of \"mutual respect.\"\n\n\"I know he cares a lot about her opinion,\" Westerhout added.\n\nWesterhout also said of the couple's relationship: \"There was really no one else who could kind of put him in his place.\" She also said the couple \"laughed a lot.\" She described Melania Trump sometimes texting her to say it was after dinner time and asking about her husband.\n\n\"I just really respected their relationship,\" she said.\n\nAsked whether the relationship changed after news of the Stormy Daniels hush money deal broke, Westerhout said: \"Not that I saw.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:Former President Trump, senators attend Palm Beach funeral for Melania Trump's mother\n\nTrump 'upset' by Stormy Daniels story\n\nBefore she began crying as she described getting fired, Westerhout was asked how Trump reacted when a story about the hush money deal with porn star Stormy Daniels came out. Westerhout said: \"I remember he was very upset.\" She said she believes Trump and Michael Cohen spoke at that time.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:Stormy Daniels spills details about alleged Trump affair. How will they spin this one?\n\nWesterhout begins crying on witness stand\n\nMadeleine Westerhout began crying on the witness stand when prosecutor Rebecca Mangold asked about how Westerhout got fired. She described getting fired after she said things she now regrets saying to a reporter.\n\nWesterhout, Trump's White House gatekeeper and personal assistant, abruptly resigned in August 2019 after making what Trump then described as \"hurtful\" remarks about his children during an off the record session with reporters.\n\nOn the stand on Thursday, she said she's learned a lot from that experience and \"I've grown a lot since then.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nFormer aide Westerhout involved in checks awaiting Trump's signature\n\nMadeleine Westerhout appears to have been involved in the process of Trump signing his checks while he was in the White House. This is important because the checks form part of the allegedly falsified business records at the heart of the case.\n\nEarlier today, Trump Organization bookkeeper Rebecca Manochio described Westerhout as a contact she used at the White House when Manochio was sending checks via FedEx for Trump's signature. Westerhout has now been asked about an email she sent to Trump assistant Rhona Graff, which stated:\n\n\"R - can you have someone send me a fedex label to send back the checks the President just signed?\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'First time boarding Air Force One!': Trump shared photo with Weisselberg\n\nProsecutor Mangold asked former Trump White House aide Westerhout about an email she sent to Rhona Graff at the Trump Organization, asking Graff to send a photo of Trump boarding Air Force One to Allen Weisselberg.\n\n\"First time boarding Air Force One!\" the email said. The email stated that Trump had sent the photo to his family, and wanted Weisselberg to see it as well.\n\nProsecutors seem to be pointing to that as well as statements by Trump about Weisselberg to try to show the two were close and had a relationship built on loyalty.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:Tiny cell, toilet and a bench: what Trump might face if jailed for violating gag order\n\nProsecutor homes in on contacts for Trump family, David Pecker and Allen Weisselberg\n\nFrom a list of contacts Graff sent Westerhout, assistant district attorney Rebecca Mangold noted a handful in her questioning. She asked Westerhout about contacts for Trump's sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, his brother, Robert Trump, and his daughter, Tiffany Trump.\n\nMangold also highlighted David Pecker from the list. Pecker was the head of the parent company for the National Enquirer. Pecker already testified to participating in an arrangement with Trump and Michael Cohen to identify stories about Trump that could damage his 2016 campaign and prevent them from coming out.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump contact list included Serena Williams, Tom Brady and Jerry Falwell\n\nThe jury was shown a list of contacts Trump Organization executive Rhona Graff sent Trump's White House special assistant Madeleine Westerhout. The phone numbers were partially redacted.\n\nIt included a host of famous names, among them former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, NFL coach Bill Belichick, and tennis superstar Serena Williams.\n\nOthers were major media names, including Mika Brezinski, Sean Hannity, Bret Baier, Bill O'Reilly, Joe Scarborough, and Jeanine Pirro.\n\nOther prominent names included Jerry Falwell of Liberty University, Mark Burnett of Mark Burnett Productions, Steve Wynn of Wynn Resorts, and investor Tom Barrack.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump liked to use the Oxford comma, former aide says\n\nWesterhout said Trump \"liked to use the Oxford comma,\" referring to putting a comma before \"and\" when more than two things are listed in a sentence. It's unclear if and how prosecutors plan to use that testimony in their case.\n\nWesterhout also said Trump \"was attentive\" when it came to \"things brought to his attention.\"\n\nThe Oxford comma, or serial comma, is often a point − or comma − of contention among writers and publishers.\n\n“There are people who embrace the Oxford comma and people who don’t,” author Lynne Truss wrote in her bestselling book on punctuation, Eats, Shoots & Leaves. \"And I’ll just say this: Never get between these people when drink has been taken.”\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWesterhout asked Trump Organization for Trump's frequent contacts\n\nTrump's former White House aide Madeleine Westerhout said Rhona Graff, Trump's long-time assistant was Westerhout's main Trump Organization contact in 2017.\n\nThe jury was shown an email in which Westerhout asked for a list of \"the people\" Trump frequently talk to. The email, read, \"Could you have the girls put together a list for me of people that he frequently spoke to? I don't want to have to bug you all the time − even though I will still call often :)\"\n\nWesterhout explained to the jury that Trump would often ask to call someone, and Westerhout didn't have those people's phone numbers, so her email to Graff was an effort to collect the contact information for people he might ask to speak to.\n\nGraff responded over email: \"I'm working on it. Hope to have it to you in a little while.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nRNC mulled dumping Trump as 2016 candidate after Access Hollywood tape release, ex-Trump aide says\n\nMadeleine Westerhout, Trump's presidential special assistant, described working for the Republican National Committee before joining the White House at the beginning of Trump's presidency. She said she recalls the release of the Access Hollywood tape in early October of 2016 – in which Trump crudely boasted about groping women – \"rattling\" the RNC's leadership.\n\nThere were conversations about \"how it would be possible to replace him as a candidate if it came to that,\" she said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWesterhout describes Trump liking to read while president\n\nWesterhout said Trump liked hard copy documents while he was president, and liked to read. She confirmed to prosecutor Rebecca Mangold that his role required a lot of reading. She also confirmed she can recognize Trump's signature.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMadeleine Westerhout, who sat outside Trump's Oval Office, testifying\n\nMadeleine Westerhout, who was Trump's special assistant and director of Oval Office operations during Trump's presidency, has been called by the prosecution. She has described sitting in a room just outside the Oval Office after she joined the White House in January of 2017.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nBrief cross-examination of Menzies ends\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche only had a brief cross-examination for Menzies, in which he asked her about Trump's relationship with a ghostwriter.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump quoted on getting even\n\nMenzies read aloud two more quotes from Trump's book, one instructing that when somebody screws you, \"screw them back in spades.\" The other said: \"Getting even is not always a personal thing. It's just part of doing business.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump: 'I just can't stomach disloyalty'\n\nMenzies read aloud another Trump quote stating: \"I just can't stomach disloyalty. I put the people who are loyal to me on a high pedestal and take care of them very well.\" He added that he goes out of his way to do bad things to a woman who was disloyal.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump quoted on value for loyalty, including loyalty of ex-CFO Weisselberg\n\nMenzies read aloud a quotation from Trump stating: \"I think the reason we have so many loyal people is that we reward loyalty, and everybody knows this.\"\n\nTrump went on to say: \"People like Allen Weisselberg and Matt Calamari are great and have proven themselves over many years.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'(Get) the best people, and don't trust them': Trump quotes being used against him\n\nProsecutor Rebecca Mangold is introducing quotations from Trump's book, \"Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life.\" Prosecutors appear to be using Trump's quotes to help prove their case. This is the second book publisher to testify about Trump's remarks in books.\n\nThe first quote Menzies read stated: \"I used to say, 'go out and get the best people, and trust them.' Over the years I have seen too many shenanigans, and now I say, 'get the best people, and don't trust them.'\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nBook publishing executive testifying\n\nA senior vice president of production and creative operations at book publisher HarperCollins, Tracey Menzies, is testifying. Prosecutor Rebecca Mangold is asking her questions about Donald Trump and Bill Zanker's book, \"Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life.\"\n\nUSA TODAY previously featured quotations from that book in a story on memorable Trump quotes. Those quotes, per Eliza Collins' reporting, include: “If someone attacks you, do not hesitate. Go for the jugular.\" and \"Always fight back and get even.\"\n\nMenzies just said Trump's and Zanker's statements in the book are delineated in the book.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nBookkeeper cross-examination done within minutes\n\nNecheles's cross-examination of Manochio ended almost as soon as it began. Necheles got Manochio to confirm she doesn't know if it took the White House a long time to process Trump's personal mail.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer cross-examining bookkeeper who sent Trump's checks\n\nTrump Organization junior bookkeeper Rebecca Manochio is back on the witness stand after lunch. Trump lawyer Susan Necheles is cross-examining her.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Karen McDougal?\n\nKaren McDougal is a former Playboy model.\n\nNational Enquirer parent company American Media Inc. (AMI) paid McDougal $150,000 in 2016 for the rights to her life story, including an alleged 10-month affair with Donald Trump starting in 2006. (Trump denies the allegation.)\n\nFormer Trump lawyer and convicted felon Michael Cohen negotiated the payment she received as part of a \"catch and kill\" strategy to block negative stories about Trump while he ran for president.\n\nShe is expected to take the stand, though the prosecutors have not shared the official witness list.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley\n\nWho are Donald Trump's lawyers?\n\nTrump's defense team is led by Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles.\n\nBlanche was a federal prosecutor for nine years in the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan. As a prominent white-collar defense lawyer he has defended Trump advisor Boris Epshteyn and Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\n\nNecheles is ranked among the top criminal defense lawyers in New York by the legal rating and head-hunting firm Chambers and Partners. She was also a former counsel to Venero Mangano, the former Genovese crime family underboss known as Benny Eggs.\n\n-Josh Meyer\n\nWho is Michael Cohen?\n\nMichael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer and fixer, will be a key witness in the New York hush-money trial that could send the former president to prison.\n\nCohen is expected to testify that Trump directed him to engineer payments to two women who alleged in the runup to the 2016 presidential election that they had affairs with the married candidate.\n\nWhile Cohen is Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's star witness, he may also be the prosecution's greatest vulnerability, given his history of perjury and a felony conviction.\n\n-Josh Meyer\n\nWho is Stormy Daniels and what is her real name?\n\nStormy Daniels, born Stephanie Clifford, is an adult film star.\n\nDaniels says she had an affair with Trump in 2006, months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump. Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen paid her $130,000 to stay quiet about the alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump's lawyers tried to block Daniels from being called to the witness stand, but New York Judge Juan Merchan ruled that Daniels can testify because her allegations are \"inextricably intertwined\" with the criminal allegations.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley, Bart Jansen\n\nCourt breaks for lunch\n\nProceedings have officially broken for lunch. They are expected to re-start at 2:15 p.m. EDT.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump makes requests on mistrial, former Playboy model Karen McDougal's testimony, and gag order\n\nProsecutor Rebecca Mangold finished asking Manochio about her role in getting Trump's signature on checks when he was president. The judge dismissed the jurors for lunch, with a plan for Manochio to be cross-examined after lunch.\n\nJust before the rest of the courtroom broke for lunch, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said his team wants to raise three issues with the judge:\n\nRenewing the motion they made yesterday for a mistrial based on Stormy Daniels' testimony. Merchan denied that request yesterday, although he agreed some of Daniels' testimony had gone too far.\n\nRenewing a motion to exclude former Playboy model Karen McDougal's testimony. Merchan ruled before trial that prosecutors may call McDougal to the witness stand. She also received a hush money payment to stay silent about an alleged affair with Trump.\n\nRaising an issue around the gag order.\n\nJudge Merchan indicated he plans to hear the issues after the lunch break.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHow Manochio's testimony completes a link in the prosecution's case\n\nManochio testified about using Fed Ex to send checks from the Trump Organization to the White House for Trump's signature. That completes a link in the prosecution's story about the falsification of business records.\n\nProsecutors say some of those falsified records were checks that falsely indicated their purpose was to pay former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen for legal expenses, rather than reimburse him for sending hush money to Stormy Daniels. We heard testimony already from a Trump Organization employee, Deborah Tarasoff, that Trump's signature was on those checks, and that a Fed Ex process was used to get the signatures.\n\nManochio is saying she was the one to send those checks, with a return envelope to get them back signed. We heard her describe being in contact with Keith Schiller, Trump's former bodyguard who went on to have roles in the White House, and then needing to find a different contact point after Schiller left the White House.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nThe bodyguard whose presence Stormy repeatedly invoked later became a top White House official\n\nStormy Daniels has named Keith Schiller as Donald Trump's bodyguard who invited her to dinner with Trump in 2006 and stood outside the door to Trump's hotel suite the evening of the alleged sexual encounter.\n\nSchiller later became a deputy assistant to the president and the director of Oval Office operations, but left the position in 2017, reportedly to get a job with a better salary.\n\nSchiller is a former NYPD detective and started working for Trump in 1999. He was part of Trump's inner circle and came under extra scrutiny during the 2016 campaign. He was caught on camera apparently hitting a protester in the face and has physically escorted a journalist out of a Trump news conference.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump Organization bookkeeper testifying on Trump's checks\n\nTrump Organization junior bookkeeper Rebecca Manochio has been called by prosecutors.\n\nShe said she worked at a supermarket before getting a job at the Trump Organization in August of 2013.\n\nManochio said previously worked at the Trump Organization as an administrative assistant and then an executive assistant to Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney. Weisselberg is the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. He is currently incarcerated after pleading guilty to committing perjury in Trump's New York civil fraud trial. McConney was the Trump Organization's financial controller. He testified earlier that he retired from the organization in 2023.\n\nManochio is being asked about her role in sending Trump checks to sign when he was in the White House.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nStormy Daniels testimony ends with suggestion Trump inspired harassment\n\nStormy Daniels' testimony ended Thursday with a suggestion by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger that Trump had inspired one of his followers to go after Daniels. Hoffinger displayed a social media post jurors have previously seen from Trump, in which he described Daniels as \"Horseface\" and a \"sleaze bag.\"\n\nProsecutor Susan Hoffinger got Daniels to confirm a harassing March 18, 2023 Twitter post from someone else who called her a \"disgusting degenerate prostitute\" came soon after Trump's post.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nNecheles shows Stormy Daniels fighting back\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles again showed Daniels fighting back against someone who sent her a harassing tweet. The person said on Twitter: \"Aging harlot Stormy Daniels is trying to recoup her losses from her countless unsuccessful lawsuits.\"\n\n\"Jealous? I don't need to recoup anything. Made 1 million in book deal...\" Daniels said in her response.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'I'll dance down the street when he is \"selected\" to go to jail': Daniels\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles returned to the lectern for some final questions to Daniels. Necheles displayed a tweet that prosecutor Susan Hoffinger showed earlier, which began with the Twitter poster saying about Daniels: \"A disgusting degenerate prostitute accepts money to Frame an innocent man!\"\n\n\"It's a nasty post, right?\" Necheles asked Daniels. \"Yes,\" Daniels agreed.\n\nNecheles then showed Daniels' response to the person who posted the tweet: \"Sooo...tiny paid me to frame himself? You sound even dumber than he does during his illiterate ramblings. And I won't walk, I'll dance down the street when he is 'selected' to go to jail.\"\n\n\"You were attacking them right back, right?\" Necheles asked. \"I was defending myself,\" said Daniels.\n\nDaniels added: \"Same with Mr. Trump.\" She said she has also been defending herself against him, as opposed to attacking him.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDaniels says telling her story has hurt her\n\n\"On balance, has your publicly telling the truth about your experiences with Mr. Trump been net positive or net negative in your life?\" prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Daniels to close out her \"re-direct\" questioning, an opportunity to ask a witness more questions after cross-examination has ended.\n\n\"Negative,\" Daniels responded.\n\n\"Nothing further, thank you,\" Hoffinger said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I'M COMING AFTER YOU': Trump post displayed to jurors\n\nJurors were shown a social media post by Trump in which he said in all caps: \"IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I'M COMING AFTER YOU.\" Daniels said she believed the post was directed at her because it was posted around the time Trump sued her in Florida to recoup legal fees that a California judge ordered her to pay.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'A disgusting degenerate prostitute': Tweet to Daniels displayed\n\nProsecutor Susan Hoffinger showed the jury a tweet that Daniels confirmed receiving on March 18, 2023, referring to Daniels as a \"disgusting degenerate prostitute.\" The Twitter poster added: \"Good luck walking down the streets after this!\"\n\nDaniels described that tweet and another as \"tame\" compared to others she's received.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDoes Stormy Daniels owe Trump money?\n\nStormy Daniels acknowledged on Tuesday that a California judge ordered her to pay Trump's legal fees after she filed a defamation lawsuit against him. She said her former lawyer, Michael Avenatti, who is now in prison for embezzlement and other crimes, wanted to file the lawsuit. The defamation claim wasn't based on her and Trump's dispute over whether they had sex in 2006.\n\nTrump has sued Daniels in Florida to get the money, but she still hasn't paid, she testified.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecutor asks Daniels about safety concerns driving hush money deal\n\nProsecutor Susan Hoffinger is again asking Daniels questions. Hoffinger said that the defense questioned whether fear was any part of Daniels' motivation in entering into the non-disclosure agreement, and that Daniels had testified she entered the deal because of some advice from an attorney friend about \"hiding in plain view.\"\n\nDaniels responded that it wasn't the attorney representing her, but instead a friend giving her advice: \"Get high, stay high.\" The meaning of that was something won't happen to you \"if everyone is looking at you,\" Daniels explained.\n\nDaniels agreed she was happy to get money from the deal, but maintained that wasn't the core motivation: \"We're all happy to take money. It was just a bonus.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nNecheles ends cross-examination of Daniels\n\nSusan Necheles finished her cross-examination of Daniels with a final question about the alleged sexual encounter with Trump. Necheles suggested that Daniels' story has changed, and the reason it has changed is that it didn't happen. Daniels predictably denied that was true.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDaniels says she doesn't know if Trump falsified business records\n\nNecheles appears to be moving on from questioning Daniels about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, and getting to the heart of the prosecution's case. She just asked Daniels to confirm she doesn't have personal knowledge about whether Trump falsified business records, which is the central charge in this case. Daniels agreed she didn't.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDaniels says she doesn't know about Trump's involvement in hush money deal\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles asked Stormy Daniels to confirm she doesn't have any \"personal knowledge\" about his involvement – or lack thereof – in her hush money deal. \"Not directly, no,\" Daniels agreed.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'I maintain that he did not put his hands on me'\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles asked Daniels about aspects of her account suggesting she felt lightheaded or pressured when she came out of the bathroom and saw Trump in his underwear. Daniels described on Tuesday a power imbalance between her and Trump, and described her awareness that Trump bad a bodyguard nearby, but also maintained she wasn't physically threatened.\n\nI maintain that he did not put his hands on me,\" Daniels responded to Necheles Thursday. Daniels added that Trump didn't give her any sort of drugs or alcohol, and didn't threaten her physically.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDaniels asked how she, as a porn star, could have almost 'fainted' from Trump in underwear\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles asked Stormy Daniels to confirm she has acted and had sex in over 200 porn movies. Daniels said it was about 150.\n\nNecheles asked Daniels to confirm that, despite that sexual history, she is now saying that seeing Trump sitting on a bed in a t-shirt and boxer shorts was \"so upsetting\" that she \"got lightheaded\" and almost \"fainted.\"\n\nDaniels responded that she sees her husband naked almost everyday, but if she came out of the bathroom and saw someone who wasn't her husband naked, it would be shaking.\n\nAsked if the alleged incident with Trump was the first time someone made a pass at her, Daniels said it wasn't, but it was the first time a bodyguard was nearby.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSusan Necheles challenging details in Daniels' story\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles has been asking Daniels about details across her descriptions of her history with Donald Trump. Necheles noted Daniels once described in an interview Trump approaching her to ask about having dinner, whereas in court Daniels described his bodyguard approaching her. Daniels responded that Trump and his bodyguard are a unit.\n\nNecheles asked about details in Daniels story on whether she took a car or walked to Trump's hotel, and whether she found Trump \"all sprawled out on the couch\" when she arrived at his suite.\n\n\"Details of your story keep changing, right?\" Necheles asked. \"No,\" Daniels said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n\"If that story was untrue, I would have written it to be a lot better.\"\n\nAfter Trump lawyer Susan Necheles suggested Daniels made up her story of having sex with Trump, Daniels shot back: \"If that story was untrue, I would have written it to be a lot better.\"\n\n\"I didn't have to write this one,\" Daniels added.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nStormy Daniels online store: \"Stormy Daniels Political Power comic\"\n\nNecheles is continuing to ask Daniels about merchandise Daniels sells and to suggest the adult film star is motivated by money. Daniels confirmed she sells a $30 comic book titled: \"Stormy Daniels Political Power comic.\" An image of the comic book was shown to the jury, with a blonde female character standing boldly on the front cover.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nStormy Daniels merchandise: 'Stormy Saint of Indictments candle'\n\nJurors just saw a photo of a \"Stormy Saint of Indictments candle,\" which Daniels confirmed she sells on her website. Trump lawyer Susan Necheles asked Daniels to confirm she makes $40 on those. Daniels said she actually makes about $7 per candle.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDaniels confirms she tweeted she made $1 million from book and reality show\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles asked Daniels if she tweeted that she made $1 million from her book as well as participating on a reality TV show, \"The Surreal Life.\" Daniels confirmed that was true, and that she made $200,000 from appearing on the show.\n\nDaniels 2018 book, \"Full Disclosure,\" was a telling of Daniels' life story, including her experience with Trump.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDaniels confirmed she signed two denials in early 2018\n\nDaniels confirmed signing two statements in early 2018 denying having had an affair with Trump. One was dated Jan. 10, 2018 and one was dated Jan. 30, 2018.\n\nThe jury already saw these statements when Daniels' former lawyer, Keith Davidson, testified.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nStormy Daniels referred to election as 'leverage,' her ex-lawyer said on recording\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles played a recording for the jury in which former lawyer to Daniels Keith Davidson was talking with former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. Davidson said Daniels told him that if \"he\" – presumably Donald Trump – loses the election, \"we lose all f-----g leverage,\" \"so settle this f-----g case.\"\n\nNecheles asked Daniels if that refreshed her recollection on what she said to Davidson. \"I never yelled at Keith Davidson on the phone,\" Daniels said. Daniels added that it sounds like a threat from Davidson.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDaniels says hush money deal created 'paper trail,' was 'perfect solution'\n\nNecheles has continued to press Daniels on whether she wanted to publicize her story in 2016 or was instead after money. Necheles asked Daniels about conversing with a reporter at Slate Magazine about potentially going public. Necheles suggested Daniels wanted money from that reporter, when she could have just had him publish the story.\n\nThe better alternative was to protect my story with a \"paper trail,\" Daniels said. \"It was a perfect solution.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nBarron Trump selected as Republican National Convention delegate\n\nDonald Trump's youngest son Barron Trump is making his big political debut as an at-large delegate at the Republican National Convention this year.\n\nBarron, now 18 years old, was still a kid during Donald Trump's presidency. But now he appears to be joining Trump's other family members on the political scene. Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner have all been intimately involved in Donald Trump's campaigns and administration.\n\nThe hush money trial is on a break on May 17 so Donald Trump can attend Barron Trump's high school graduation.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nNecheles challenges Stormy Daniels claim that she wanted to share story in 2016\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles has begun cross-examining Daniels again. Necheles is focusing her opening questions today on Daniels' claim that she wanted to share her story about Trump in 2016, before she took a hush money deal to keep quiet.\n\nDaniels explained she took the deal because she chose to be \"safe.\"\n\n\"You chose to make money, right?\" Necheles shot back.\n\n\"I chose to take the non-disclosure,\" Daniels replied.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump decries security outside courthouse ‘like Fort Knox’\n\nFormer President Donald Trump complained again about the security outside the New York courthouse for his hush money trial, arguing police were needed more for protests at Columbia and New York universities.\n\n“Outside of this building it’s closed down like Fort Knox,” Trump told reporters in a hallway statement outside the courtroom. “This is like an armed camp down here.”\n\nTrump argued that college protests were organized by people on the left side of the political spectrum rather than the right, and that those protests were a bigger threat to the country than China or Russia.\n\n“You have nothing to worry about. The problem is from the left, not the right,” Trump said. “In my opinion, it’s a bigger danger than China or Russia.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump predicts ‘revealing’ testimony from Stormy Daniels\n\nFormer President Donald Trump predicted “some very revealing things” as his New York hush money trial continues Thursday with testimony from porn actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nDaniels testified Tuesday about having sex with Trump in 2006 while he was married, which he has denied. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid Daniels $130,000 to silence her claim before the 2016 election, which prosecutors contend was election interference.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Daniels acknowledged hating Trump and refusing to pay him hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees from an unsuccessful defamation suit against him.\n\n“I think you’ll see some very revealing things today,” Trump said in the hallway Thursday.\n\nTrump entered the courtroom after reading a series of statements from lawyers, academics and Republican lawmakers criticizing the case.\n\n“No evidence of any crime,” Trump said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nStormy Daniels arrives for more cross-examination\n\nPorn star Stormy Daniels was brought into the courtroom at 9:32 a.m. EDT to continue testifying in the hush money case. The judge has now asked for the jury to be brought in.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge arrives for Day 14 of trial\n\nJudge Juan Merchan entered the courtroom at about 9:30 a.m. EDT.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump team arrives in the courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump entered the courtroom at 9:24 a.m. EDT, flanked by his legal team. He is wearing a blue tie.\n\nAlina Habba, who represented Trump in his recent E. Jean Carroll and civil fraud trials and is a big personality defending him on television shows, is here again today in one of the benches behind the defense trial team's table. I haven't seen Eric Trump, the former president's middle son, who was present for Stormy Daniels' testimony on Tuesday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecution arrives in the courtroom\n\nThe prosecution team began arriving in the courtroom at 9:16 a.m. EDT and is getting set up. So far, prosecutors Joshua Steinglass, Matthew Colangelo, Rebecca Mangold, Christopher Conroy, and Susan Hoffinger are here. Hoffinger is handling the prosecution's questioning of Stormy Daniels.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhen does the Trump trial resume?\n\nTrump's criminal trial starts back up at 9:30 a.m. EDT on Thursday, after having a day off on Wednesday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n‘A bad experience’: Donald Trump threatened with jail if he violates gag order again\n\nAfter Judge Juan Merchan threatened Donald Trump on Monday with possible jail if he violates a gag order in his New York hush money trial again, experts said the detention could range from a holding cell behind the courtroom to infamous Rikers Island.\n\nRonald Kuby, a veteran New York defense lawyer who has visited clients in city jails and also spent time in them for various acts of protest, said Trump is unlikely to enjoy any detention because the cells can be tiny, the metal doors loud and the food unappetizing.\n\n“It’s a bad experience,” Kuby told USA TODAY. “Trust me. I've been there.”\n\nFor overnight detention, Rikers Island is an option, although experts called it unlikely. City jails on Rikers Island have been criticized for decades for violence and unsanitary conditions.\n\nJames Oleson, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Auckland’s school of social sciences, who previously served as a staffer on the U.S. Judicial Conference’s committee on criminal law, said the theater of putting Trump behind bars for a few hours might not be more effective than fines in curbing Trump’s comments. Merchan has fined Trump $10,000 for 10 violations of the gag order, for commenting on witnesses and jurors participating in the trial.\n\n“It is terra incognita: unknown land, off the existing maps,” Oleson said of potentially jailing a former president.\n\n– Bart Jansen and Josh Meyer\n\nWhat has the Stormy Daniels cross-examination focused on?\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles began cross-examining Stormy Daniels on Tuesday. Necheles focused on challenging Daniels' credibility and suggesting Daniels is a person motivated by money.\n\nNecheles noted that Daniels publicly denied she had sex with Trump before she said they did have sex. The jury has already seen evidence of that. Daniels' former lawyer Keith Davidson testified to his own involvement in preparing a denial by Daniels in early 2018.\n\nNecheles also painted Daniels' hush money deal in 2016 as extortion. \"False,\" Daniels shot back emphatically.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n2 House GOP chairmen urge DOJ to charge Michael Cohen – again\n\nTwo House Republican chairmen urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to consider criminal charges against Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for allegedly lying to Congress.\n\nCohen, a key witness in Trump’s New York hush money trial, has already pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a Trump real estate project in Russia. But Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., urged Garland to consider more charges against Cohen because he is a key witness in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s criminal trial against Trump, where his credibility will be at stake.\n\nThe lawmakers accused Cohen of lying at least six times, including by denying he committed fraudulent acts that he’d already pleaded guilty to and by testifying he didn’t seek a job in Trump’s White House.\n\nThe accusations are based on Cohen’s testimony to Comer’s committee in February 2019, which outlined the current criminal case against Trump. Trump is charged with falsifying business records to hide his reimbursement to Cohen, who paid porn actress Stormy Daniels to remain silent before the 2016 election about her claim she had sex with Trump while he was married.\n\nTrump denied having sex and said he was paying Cohen for legal expenses, not to pay off Daniels.\n\n“In short, to prosecute President Trump, Bragg has revived this 'zombie' case relying on a known – and convicted – liar and his testimony at a congressional hearing in which he lied at least six times,” the lawmakers wrote.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhat is Trump on trial for?\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors allege Trump falsified records to cover up unlawfully interfering in the 2016 presidential election through a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. The payment was made by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen less than two weeks before Election Day.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy wasn't there testimony on Wednesday?\n\nThe trial is generally off on Wednesdays. Judge Juan Merchan designated those days to preside over special court programs for criminal defendants who have mental health issues or are veterans, according to the Associated Press.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump caught cursing as Stormy Daniels testified\n\nJudge Juan Merchan said in a private conversation at his bench Tuesday that he heard Trump cursing during Daniels' testimony and he \"won't tolerate that.\"\n\n\"I understand that your client is upset at this point, but he is cursing audibly, and he is shaking his head visually and that's contemptuous,\" Merchan said, according to a transcript that has now been released. \"It has the potential to intimidate the witness and the jury can see that.\"\n\nMerchan said he saw Trump shake his head and look down when Daniels described lightly spanking him with a magazine at dinner before their alleged sexual encounter.\n\nWhen there was discussion about The Apprentice, Trump \"again uttered a vulgarity,\" the judge said, according to the transcript.\n\n\"I am speaking to you here at the bench because I don't want to embarrass him,\" Merchan told Blanche, who said he would talk to his client and later confirmed having done so.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/10/22/central-park-five-sue-trump-debate-defamation/75779685007/", "title": "Opinion: 'Central Park 5' sue Trump. But he'll never admit he lied", "text": "Donald Trump’s notorious inability to acknowledge a mistake – even when everyone else can clearly see how wrong he is – will now probably cost him a big bundle of money in yet another court case.\n\nIt should cost him support from Black and Latino voters, too.\n\nYou may recall the names Antron Brown (formerly known as Antron McCray), Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and Korey Wise by the undeserved moniker slapped on the Black and Latino teenagers 35 years ago ‒ \"The Central Park Five.\" They now prefer to be known as the \"Exonerated Five\" since their convictions for a pair of attacks and a rape in 1989 were vacated in 2002.\n\nThey sued Trump in federal court in Philadelphia on Monday for defamation after he falsely claimed during a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris last month that they pleaded guilty after being charged and had killed someone. They pleaded not guilty and nobody died in the attacks that sparked the controversy.\n\nNew York acknowledged the travesty in the treatment of the five, who were ages 14-16 when they were arrested, by paying them $41 million to settle a lawsuit in 2014. In a statement, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio said: \"The City had a moral obligation to right this injustice.\"\n\nTrump could never muster the kind of character it takes to meet any notion of moral obligation. It is now and always has been far outside the range of his ego-driven, narcissistic personality.\n\nDonald Trump can't stop accusing the Central Park Five of a crime\n\nTrump, who used the 1989 Central Park attacks to draw attention to himself, ran full-page ads in New York newspapers in the weeks after with the banner headline, \"BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY.\" Trump has a long history, laid out in the complaint filed Monday, of continuing to accuse the five men of criminal behavior even after they were exonerated.\n\nHarris made that point during the Sept. 10 debate hosted by ABC News during a segment on \"race and politics.\" Her opponent, of course, turned defensive and then said a bunch of things that were not true.\n\n\"They admitted ‒ they said, they pled guilty. And I said, well, if they pled guilty they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately,\" Trump lied from the debate stage.\n\nThe complaint filed against him Monday notes that Trump has attacked a documentary about how the men were exonerated, which means he had the facts at his disposal and could have told the truth.\n\nOpinion:In an unpredictable election, one thing is certain – Trump will lie about it\n\nBut this would require Trump to acknowledge he was wrong. He lacks the character for that.\n\nShanin Specter, a lawyer for the five men, said they didn't bother to give Trump a chance to apologize for what he said in the debate or issue a retraction because they knew, given his history since their exoneration, that \"there was no chance of that happening.\"\n\n\"He has been single-minded about this for the last 35 years,\" Specter told me. \"And he has not let the facts get in the way of his narrative.\"\n\nTrump challenged to respond to lawsuit by lawyer who filed it\n\nTrump's reelection campaign was oh so eager to prove the attorney's point, responding to the complaint by dismissing it as \"just another frivolous, Election Interference lawsuit, filed by desperate left-wing activists\" while trying to connect it to Harris and her campaign.\n\nSpecter told me the complaint, written in a way that avoids any extraneous political language, was about seeking \"redress in the courts.\"\n\n\"It would have been nice if Mr. Trump would have had his lawyer respond to it to say whether it was true or false,\" Specter said.\n\nOpinion:Michigan and Wisconsin are key for Harris. GOP groups want to help her win them.\n\nTrump does have plenty of lawyers and he keeps them very busy.\n\nSome of them lost the May 2023 civil case where Trump was held liable for sexually assaulting the writer E. Jean Carroll, who was awarded $5 million by a New York jury. Trump's lawyers also lost the follow-up defamation case Carroll filed against Trump, who was hit in January with an additional $83 million judgment.\n\nSo Trump, whom a jury found had sexually assaulted Carroll, has spent years falsely accusing the Exonerated Five of sexual assault and other violence. He is exactly the kind of person he claims to despise.\n\nWill Trump ever be held accountable for this?\n\nTwo things can be true at the same time. This lawsuit can be unrelated to the election. But it can have consequences as Trump attempts to expand his support among Black and Latino voters.\n\nTrump's appeal to hate in his 1989 newspaper ads always had the stench of racism, an undercurrent in his bid for attention just below the surface. His public pronouncements were bait for racists, the beginnings of his base.\n\nMaybe the time has finally come for him to be held accountable for that, after 67 million debate viewers saw Trump repeat his lies about the Exonerated Five.\n\n\"It's devastating for them,\" Specter said. \"They have to clear their name all over again. Now it's been defamed to 67 million people. And it just never stops.\"\n\nSalaam, now 50, is a New York City Council member. He came to Philadelphia for last month's debate and tried to speak with Trump afterward in the \"spin room,\" asking whether he would \"apologize to the Exonerated Five.\"\n\n\"Ah, you're on my side then,\" Trump responded, in what feels like the one millionth moment of proof that his mind has turned to mush. He then waved and wandered away as Salaam repeated his request for an apology.\n\nI hope we get the whole Trump show here ‒ a trial with an elderly defendant unable to remain awake until a jury holds him responsible in the only way that gets his attention: by squeezing him for cash.

They did not rob a bank at gunpoint. Donald Trump is not Bernard Madoff.

WITCH HUNT.\"\n\n\"We will appeal,\" Trump told reporters Friday night at his private Florida club. \"We'll be successful.\"\n\nTrump’s lawyer, Alina Habba, also assailed the ruling on social media.\n\n“This verdict is a manifest injustice – plain and simple,” Habba said. “It is the culmination of a multi-year, politically fueled witch hunt that was designed to ‘take down Donald Trump,’ before Letitia James ever stepped foot into the Attorney General’s office.”\n\nHabba added that “if this decision stands, it will serve as a signal to every single American that New York is no longer open for business.”\n\nA massive financial blow to Donald Trump\n\nFriday's decision − penalizing Trump more than a third of a billion dollars − comes three weeks after a federal jury ordered the former president to pay $83.3 million to writer E. Jean Carroll for civil defamation.\n\n“Judge Engoron levied the financial death penalty on Trump,” Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, told USA TODAY. “Even for someone with Trump’s net worth, this decision inflicts a serious blow to Trump’s financial health, especially when he has to spend more and more money on legal fees in his many criminal cases.”\n\nEngoron had already ordered the business halted by ruling last year that the Republican presidential frontrunner committed fraud from 2011 through 2021 through \"pure sophistry\" and a \"fantasy world\" of real-estate valuations that \"can only be considered fraud.\" But an appeals court put the order on hold while Engoron presided over a fall trial to determine damages.\n\nThe judge found Trump and his Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust liable for $354.9 million, his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. liable for $4 million each and former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg for $1 million − for a total of $364 million in penalties. Engoron also barred Trump from doing business in New York State for three years.\n\nEngoron also ordered Trump and his trust to pay interest on the damages, which started from different times for different properties. The total with interest that Trump owes is $453.5 million and the total for all the defendants is $463.9, according to the attorney general’s office.\n\nTrump still faces a plethora of cases while campaigning again for the White House.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty in an unprecedented four criminal cases: a federal election interference trial pending in Washington, a federal trial alleging he mishandled classified documents, an election racketeering trial in Georgia and a trial over falsifying business records in New York.\n\nOutbursts, gag orders, and a question of perjury\n\nThe civil fraud trial in Engoron’s courtroom featured fiery testimony by Trump, attacks by the former president on the judge and his chief law clerk, and $15,000 in fines levied on the 2024 Republican frontrunner for violating gag orders.\n\nTrump complained during the trial and while testifying that Engoron wasn’t listening to him. But the judge described in his decision how he weighed the testimony of Trump and Weisselberg, who is reportedly in plea negotiations with the Manhattan district attorney over possible perjury on the witness stand.\n\n“This Court listened carefully to every witness, every question, every answer,” Engoron wrote. “Witnesses testified from the witness stand, approximately a yard from the Court, who was thus able to observe expressions, demeanor, and body language.\"\n\n\"The Court,\" Engoron wrote, referring to himself, \"has also considered the simple touchstones of self-interest and other motives, common sense, and overall veracity.”\n\nEngoron said he found Trump an unreliable witness.\n\n\"Overall, Donald Trump rarely responded to the questions asked, and he frequently interjected long, irrelevant speeches on issues far beyond the scope of the trial,\" Engoron wrote. \"His refusal to answer the questions directly, or in some cases, at all, severely compromised his credibility.\"\n\nJames celebrated the ruling. \"Today we proved that no one is above the law − no matter how rich, powerful, or politically connected you are,\" the state attorney general said. \"Donald Trump may have authored 'The Art of the Deal', but he perfected the art of the steal.\"\n\nMore:Lawyers on both sides in Donald Trump fraud case urge judge to ignore reported perjury inquiry\n\nJudge singles out Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.\n\nTrump’s sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., were also barred from doing business in New York State for two years. The sons testified several times that they would have relied on their accountants to find any errors in financial statements they signed.\n\nBut Engoron found that “Eric Trump’s credibility was severely damaged when he repeatedly denied” knowing about his father’s financial statements “until this case came into fruition.”\n\nWhen confronted with “copious documentary evidence,” Eric Trump conceded he knew about the paperwork, Engoron wrote.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., who helped run the company with Eric when their father became president, was confronted in March 2017 by Forbes magazine about the size of Trump’s penthouse being reported as three times too large. Donald Jr. testified he couldn’t recall doing “anything” in response.\n\nAt another point, he testified: “I don’t recall who I relied on,” when certifying management documents.\n\nMore:Who is Lara Trump? Trump's daughter-in-law and nominee for new RNC co-chair.\n\nJudge: Trump's valuations 'a fantasy world'\n\nTrump companies often valued properties far higher than appraisers or tax assessors, Engoron found. Trump testified that a disclaimer on property values given to lenders meant the banks knew the estimates were “worthless.\"\n\n“This is a fantasy world, not the real world,” Engoron wrote in September.\n\nThe judge outlined several glaring disputes over Trump property values:\n\nA 200-acre Westchester County property called Seven Springs LLC was appraised by Royal Bank of Pennsylvania in 2006 at $30 million if converted to residential homes. A Cushman & Wakefield appraiser estimated the value in 2014 at $30 million. Trump reported the value at $261 million to $291 million during that period.\n\nTrump Park Avenue, a residential building, had rent-controlled apartments that Engoron ruled had been overvalued by 700%. Trump’s lawyers argued the units could eventually become market-rent units, but Engoron ruled the numbers are supposed to represent “current\" values, not “someday, maybe” values.\n\nA lease at 40 Wall St. in New York was appraised in 2010 by Cushman & Wakefield as worth $200 million. But the Trump Organization valued the property at $525 million in 2011 and at $735 million in 2015. Trump said the differences were irrelevant because his lender, Ladder Capital, made $40 million in interest on a loan for the property. Trump has maintained throughout the trial that James is persecuting him for a victimless crime.\n\nMar-A-Lago, Trump’s Florida resort, had a market value ranging from $18 million to $27.6 million during the decade ending 2021, according to the Palm Beach County assessor. Trump valued the property at up to $612 million during that period.\n\nTrump’s own apartment in Trump Tower is 10,996 square feet, but he submitted claims it was 30,000 square feet, according to Engoron. The difference resulted in an overvaluation of between $114 million and $207 million, the judge wrote.\n\n“A discrepancy of this order of magnitude by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,” Engoron wrote of the Trump Tower apartment.\n\nContributing: David Jackson, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/24/politics/doj-memo-school-board-threats-dismiss-lawsuit/index.html", "title": "Judge dismisses lawsuit over DOJ memo on school board threats ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA federal judge threw out a lawsuit on Friday from parents that accused Attorney General Merrick Garland of stifling their free speech, saying the group misunderstood a memo addressing increased harassment against schools.\n\nIn 2021, Garland released a memo addressing the “disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence” levied at schools. The memo sparked months of backlash and false claims that the attorney general believed parents who were concerned about education policy were “domestic terrorists.”\n\nIn an attempt to stop the Justice Department from enforcing the memo, a group of parents from Virginia and Washington sued Garland, claiming the memo tried to silence parents who were lawfully protesting the “harmful, immoral, and racist policies of the ‘progressive’ Left” at their local schools.\n\nFederal Judge Dabney Friedrich, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, ruled that the memo did little more than announce a “series of measures” that directed federal authorities to address increasing threats targeting school board members, teachers and other school employees.\n\n“The alleged AG Policy is not regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory in nature because it does not impose any regulations, requirements, or enforcement actions on individuals,” Friedrich wrote. “None of the documents that the plaintiffs allege establish the policy create an imminent threat of future legal actions against anyone, much less the plaintiffs.”\n\nFriedrich noted the memo only addressed threats of violence, and explicitly stated that parents have the right to “spirited debate about policy matters.” The memo also “does not label anyone a domestic terrorist,” Friedrich said.\n\nThe ruling is the latest development in an unrelenting campaign, supported by some right-wing media and Republican politicians, complaining the Justice Department wanted to punish parents for attending or protesting at school board meetings.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee’s Republicans asked Garland last October to withdraw the memo, and pushed him to explain the memo during public hearings.\n\n“I do not believe that parents who testify, speak, argue with, complain about school boards and schools should be classified as domestic terrorists or any kind of criminalism,” Garland testified at the time, saying that “true threats of violence are not protected by the First Amendment,” and that “those are the things we’re worried about here. Those are the only things we’re worried about here.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Justice Department and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit for comment.", "authors": ["Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}]}

Auburn University professors Richard Burt and Keith Hebert, working with a group of honors college students, have established a Facebook page where people can look through photographs from March 7, 1965, and identify themselves or others in the black-and-white images. Online since August, the page titled “Help us identify the Selma Bloody Sunday Foot Soldiers” features multiple images of marchers who are labeled with red numerals, and users can add the names of people they recognize in the comments section. Some people already have been identified, and the creators hope more will join them as word spreads about the page, particularly in Selma, where the effort is being promoted. A class at Selma High School is helping as students enlist relatives to help identify marchers. The project “highlights the need for additional historical research and documentation for one of the most famous moments in American history,” Hebert said in a statement released by the university.\n\nAlaska\n\nStevens Village: For the first time in memory, both king and chum salmon on the Yukon River have dwindled to almost nothing, and the state has banned salmon fishing there, even the subsistence harvests on which Alaska Natives rely to fill their freezers and pantries for winter. The remote communities that dot the river and live off its bounty – far from road systems and easy, affordable shopping – are desperate and doubling down on moose and caribou hunts in the waning days of fall. “Nobody has fish in their freezer right now. Nobody,” said Giovanna Stevens, 38, a member of the Stevens Village tribe who grew up harvesting salmon at her family’s fish camp. “We have to fill that void quickly before winter gets here.” Opinions on what led to the catastrophe vary, but those studying it generally agree human-caused climate change is playing a role as the river and the Bering Sea warm, altering the food chain. Many believe commercial trawling operations that scoop up wild salmon along with their intended catch, as well as competition from hatchery-raised salmon in the ocean, have compounded global warming’s effects on one of North America’s longest rivers. Many Alaska Native communities are outraged they are paying the price for generations of practices beyond their control, and many feel state and federal authorities aren’t doing enough to bring Indigenous voices to the table.\n\nArizona\n\nLake Havasu City: The city is playing up its roots with a month of celebratory events marking the 50th anniversary of the dedication of the London Bridge after its piece-by-piece rebuild in the western Arizona resort town along the Colorado River. Scheduled October events include a parade, powerboat racing, theater and musical performances, a costume contest and sports competitions. Lake Havasu City founder Robert McCulloch bought the stone bridge in 1968 for approximately $2 million and had it transported by ship and truck from London in pieces across the Atlantic Ocean and via the Panama Canal and Los Angeles. That process and reconstruction took three years, leading to the October 1971 dedication. The city of London had decided to replace the bridge because it was sinking and unfit to withstand increased automobile traffic. In Lake Havasu City, which has population of about 57,000, the bridge spanning a channel between the shoreline and an island in the river has become a major tourist attraction. Following a Friday ribbon-cutting, the 50th anniversary celebratory events got underway in earnest over the weekend with a candlelit feast and ball Saturday evening, followed by a Sunday morning garden brunch and tea leading into a costume contest, the Today’s News Herald reports.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday said it wouldn’t allow the state to enforce its ban on mask mandates by schools and other government bodies, while lawmakers clashed over efforts to prohibit businesses from requiring employees get COVID-19 vaccines. In a one-page order, justices denied the request by the state to stay the August decision blocking enforcement of Arkansas’ mandate ban. More than 100 school districts and charter schools have approved mask requirements since the ruling against the law. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who signed the law but later said he regretted it, had asked the court to deny the request to stay the ruling. Meanwhile, the GOP-led Senate voted to send eight bills limiting or prohibiting employer vaccine mandates back to a committee following complaints that they were rushed through a day earlier without public comment. The bills proposed include one that would allow employees to be exempted from vaccine mandates if they have philosophical or religious objections or have medical contraindications. Another would allow employees to be exempted from vaccine mandates if they’re tested weekly for the coronavirus or can prove they have antibodies, even though health officials say antibody tests should not be used to assess immunity from COVID-19.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Black women in the state are more likely to die within a year of pregnancy than women of other races, prompting a wave of policy changes this year that culminated Monday with Gov. Gavin Newsom signing a new law aimed at reducing the disparity. The law, among other things, creates a new committee within the Department of Public Health to review maternal deaths throughout the state by interviewing family members and doctors while exploring records and other reports. The law is the the last piece of what’s been nicknamed the “Momnibus” bill – a reference to the legislative term “omnibus” that generally means one bill that combines multiple pieces of legislation on a number of topics. Most of the “Momnibus” changes this year happened in the state budget, which Newsom signed into law over the summer. California now will give lower-income women health insurance for up to one year after pregnancy instead of for only two months. The state’s Medicaid program, a government-funded health insurance plan for the poor, will also now pay for doulas – trained professionals who support mothers before, during and after childbirth. And the state is spending $35 million to help pay for programs that give low-income pregnant women monthly cash payments with no restrictions on how they can spend it.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver Zoo has apologized more than a decade after a Black man died after a confrontation with police on zoo grounds. Zoo President Bert Vescolani publicly apologized to Gail Waters on Friday for her son Alonzo Ashley’s July 2011 death, The Denver Post reports. The 29-year-old was visiting the zoo when he reportedly started acting strangely and ran to find a water fountain. A zoo volunteer called for police, who tackled Ashley and shocked him with a stun gun. According to a coroner’s report, Ashley was placed face down on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back and his legs crossed and pressed toward his buttocks. He began convulsing and stopped breathing before paramedics arrived. The coroner ruled Ashley’s death was caused by cardiorespiratory arrest brought on by heat, dehydration and exertion during the struggle. The district attorney’s office cleared the eight officers involved, but the city paid Ashley’s family $295,000 in 2016 to settle a lawsuit. For years, the zoo refused to acknowledge any responsibility. The death led to protests and calls for accountability for staff and volunteers for failing to recognize Ashley was in distress and no danger to the public. Many in the Denver’s Black community boycotted the zoo. On Friday, a water fountain and cooling station were dedicated in Ashley’s honor.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The city’s Civilian Review Board plans to investigate the actions of an officer who punched a man in the head three times during a trespassing arrest and was later cleared of wrongdoing by the police department. Police officials said the use of force by officer Justin Cole during the January arrest was “reasonable and not excessive” as the man fought with officers, and the finding was reviewed by an independent use-of-force expert, Hearst Connecticut Media reports. Richard Crouse, a member of the Civilian Review Board, said the panel has decided to look into the police department’s internal affairs investigation, which cleared two other officers involved in the arrest, and will report its findings to the public. Acting Police Chief Renee Dominguez said the officers were found to have complied with policies and procedures, but the outcome of the call was not ideal. Police responded to an office building Jan. 29 for a harassment complaint made by the man who authorities said struggled with officers and was punched by Cole. Another person at the scene complained the man was disruptive and trespassing, which he denied. Police officials say officers tried to de-escalate the situation for about an hour before arresting the man.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A civil rights organization is calling for the firing and arrest of a police officer seen on video repeatedly slamming a man’s head during an arrest last month at a Southbridge convenience store. During a Monday afternoon press conference, NAACP members said they will also call for the resignation of Wilmington Police Chief Robert J. Tracy and for a federal investigation of the incident. “This is another example of police brutality and police disrespect for the Black community,” Delaware NAACP President Richard Smith said. “The attorney general of the United States really needs to come in and take over the police department or come in and help us with the Wilmington Police Department, New Castle County Police Department and other police departments that abuse us in the Black community.” The officer involved in the incident has not been identified, but Wilmington police have said the three-year member of the force has been placed on administrative duty. The pressure on Wilmington Police Department to be forthright about what happened during the Sept. 21 incident in which a 44-year-old man’s head was repeatedly slammed into plexiglass is increasing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The weekend saw the return of live music with two outdoor festivals in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. On Saturday, dozens of people gathered on front lawns and in front of commercial buildings in the Adams Morgan neighborhood for the popular Porchfest festival. More than 60 local bands participated on makeshift stages throughout the area. Then on Sunday, the third annual Southeast D.C. Porchfest returned to the Penn Branch neighborhood. The seven-hour festival featured dozens of performers and local vendors. A similar event happened earlier this year in Petworth, with bands performing on front porches of volunteer houses down a 3-mile stretch of the neighborhood.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Miami Beach wants to turn down the volume in the South Beach party neighborhood, citing increasingly raucous crowds, public drinking and growing violence, but efforts to curb the carousing have raised complaints about racism, classism and business practices along one of the nation’s most glamorous waterfronts. The 10-block stretch of Ocean Drive known for art deco hotels, restaurants and bars is sandwiched between two areas that cater to more affluent tourists. The tension has been bubbling for years as party crowds grew from a few weekends a year into a year-round presence. The situation worsened during the pandemic as city officials closed the main drag to vehicles and allowed restaurants to offer more outdoor seating, which invited a carnival atmosphere on the street. More than 1,000 people were arrested during this year’s spring break, when the city imposed a rare 8 p.m. curfew. Authorities sent military-style vehicles to disperse predominantly Black crowds with rubber bullets, prompting criticism from Black activists and spawning a parody on “Saturday Night Live.” Last month, the city increased the number of law enforcement officials covering the neighborhood to a record high. Mayor Dan Gelber, who called it a stopgap measure, has proposed rebranding the blocks known as the entertainment district by hosting higher-end concerts and fairs, focusing on family-friendly events, and marketing the city’s often-overlooked museums and symphony. He also wants to limit loud music and halt alcohol sales at 2 a.m.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Four parents are suing the Cobb County school district on behalf of their children, saying its failure to require masks means their students cannot safely attend in-person classes because of their disabilities. The suit filed Friday in federal court in Atlanta says the 107,000-student suburban district is violating federal law, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Those laws govern how students with disabilities are treated in public schools. “Rather than using the known and available tools to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and protect plaintiffs’ access to school services, programs, and activities, the district has acted with deliberate indifference to plaintiffs’ rights to inclusion, health, and education,” the complaint alleges. Last week, when the Southern Poverty Law Center threatened the lawsuit on behalf of the students, Cobb schools told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that “as is the case with any issue, individual student needs are supported on a student-by-student basis, and we actively encourage any student or family to discuss their needs with their local school.” The lawsuit asks that U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten Sr. order the district to follow guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventionn on masks, ventilation, physical distancing and contact tracing.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: An invasive plant species that is toxic to cattle and highly flammable has been found on the Big Island. Chromolaena odorata, also known as “devil weed,” was found on the east side of the island earlier this year, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Officials worry the invasive plant, first detected in the state on Oahu in 2011, could harm the cattle industry and fuel future wildfires on the Big Island. Devil weed has small, sticky seeds that can be transported easily, said Franny Brewer, spokeswoman for the Big Island Invasive Species Council. “Right now, we’re actually lucky that it’s just on the east side of the island,” Brewer said. “It usually likes the warmer and drier areas, so if it gets over (to the west side), that could be very bad.” An additional concern for cattle ranchers is an invasive species of insect that is also invading local pastures. Brewer said the two-lined spittlebug is attracted to nutrient-rich grass on which cows graze and can devour a pasture, leaving the land open to the introduction of devil weed. The plant’s leaves contain a substance that is highly flammable, Brewer said, which could increase the threat of increasingly common wildfires in Hawaii.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A partial recount of ballots cast during the 2020 presidential election has validated the accuracy of the results, state officials say, despite manipulation claims by Trump ally and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. The Idaho secretary of state’s office said Wednesday that a hand inspection of ballots in Camas and Butte counties found margins of error of less than 1% – far below what Lindell had claimed in saying votes for former President Donald Trump went to President Joe Biden. Lindell has made unsubstantiated claims and floated conspiracy theories about last year’s election in multiple states in an attempt to undermine voter confidence in the outcome. That has extended even to Idaho, where Trump easily won the deep-red state with nearly 64% of the vote. “The office of the Idaho Secretary of State takes free, fair, and accurate elections seriously,” Republican Secretary of State Lawerence Denney said in a statement. “So when we are presented with allegations that come with specific details which we can examine, we want to do so.” The secretary of state’s office said a document questioning Idaho’s vote count appeared on a website with a copyright belonging to Lindell. It claimed votes cast for Trump were electronically switched to Biden in every county. Denney’s office recorded video of both counties’ recount processes.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A new relief fund launched by city officials could give a boost to hundreds of artists and entertainment industry workers who have lost income during the pandemic. The $2.3 million Chicago Creative Worker Assistance Program will benefit members of the arts and entertainment industry with grants ranging from $2,000 to $5,000, the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events announced Thursday. Arts administrators, teaching artists, artisans, curators, independent cultural producers and technicians who lost income over the past 18 months because of coronavirus restrictions will be eligible for the aid, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement that she hopes the funding can provide relief for creatives, as many of them are gig workers whose pandemic unemployment insurance benefits have expired. DCASE Commissioner Mark Kelly said he’s looking forward to the city’s talented artists returning to the spotlight this fall along with the resurrection of entertainment venues, which are gearing up for a busy end of the year. The relief fund’s announcement comes nearly a week after Navy Pier hosted “Chicago LIVE Again!” – a two-day outdoor festival that celebrated the return of live performances.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A longtime Democratic state senator from northwestern Indiana has decided to leave her seat in frustration over iron-fisted Republican control of the Legislature. Sen. Karen Tallian of Ogden Dunes submitted a letter Thursday to Senate leaders that she would be resigning effective Nov. 1, about a year before her term ends. Tallian was sharply critical of Senate Republicans, saying that “after 16 years I’ve had enough.” “The process has become degraded. Every bill is vetted, in secret, by the Republican caucus,” Tallian told The (Northwest Indiana) Times. “So it becomes impossible to have real debate on the floor most of the time because they’ve already decided what gets to be heard and what won’t.” Tallian has been a longtime advocate of legalizing marijuana, an issue that’s been blocked from debate by Republicans who have a 39-11 Senate majority. Tallian raised that issue as she spoke on the Senate floor Friday. “Some time in the future, maybe near, maybe nearer than you think, Indiana will join the rest of the country and address the marijuana question,” Tallian said. “And when you do, think of me.” Democratic precinct committee members in Tallian’s district will select a new senator for the 2022 legislative session.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The city has canceled a contract with a private security company more than two months after reports revealed troubling remarks by its CEO, who referred to local racial justice protests as “terrorism.” The city’s contract with the Conley Group was to end at midnight Monday. City Manager Scott Sanders said in a statement that both parties reached an agreement to end the contract, while an attorney for company CEO Tom Conley said the Conley Group asked the city to end its contract early, citing “high customer demand.” The company was set to see its $250,000 city contract more than double in July, until Conley’s remarks surfaced in a Des Moines Register investigative report. It had been providing security services to the city since early 2020 at locations including City Hall, the Argonne Armory, the municipal services center and the former Dico Superfund site. The city launched an internal investigation in July after Conley sent inflammatory emails to Des Moines officials, including some that made disparaging remarks about George Floyd and members of the central Iowa-based Black Liberation Movement.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Some counties are seeing youth vaccination rates for COVID-19 far below the national average, according to state data released last week. A school pandemic workgroup established by Gov. Laura Kelly received data from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment showing that in about a quarter of the state’s counties, less than 20% of vaccine-eligible children ages 12 to 17 had received at least one dose as of Sept. 24. U.S. regulators in May expanded the use of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to children as young as 12. The national vaccination rate for youth is 57%, according to a presentation by Marci Nielsen, a special advisor to Kelly. Most of the low-vaccine counties are in western Kansas or other rural areas. By comparison, no Kansas county has less than 20% of its total eligible population fully inoculated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Johnson, Douglas and Riley counties exceed the national rate for youths, Nielsen said. Decatur County in northwest Kansas reported the lowest rate with 3% of youths receiving a first dose. Parents have commented on social media that they won’t get their kids vaccinated because they value free choice or think kids are less likely to become severely ill, said Derek Chambers, lead pharmacist at Ward Drug in Oberlin.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A deteriorating bridge that was home to thousands of endangered gray bats has been repaired in way that makes the span safer for motorists and wildlife, officials said. A project team from the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make a habitat-focused design as crews replaced the bridge superstructure with new beams, deck and railing and made repairs to the existing abutment and piers, state officials said in a statement. Repairs on the rural, two-lane span were made in a way that provides more roosting space for the bats. After construction, officials estimated more than 1,000 bats had returned to the bridge. Officials didn’t release the span’s exact location in an effort to prevent interference with the bat habitat. “This bridge project is the first of its kind in Kentucky, using an innovative and collaborative approach to mitigate the effects of much-needed bridge repairs on an important endangered species,” Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: Southwest Louisiana leaders say the disaster assistance approved by Congress will be too little to solve the lingering housing crisis and other needs caused by Hurricane Laura, which struck the region more than a year ago. Billions of dollars in federal disaster aid were included in legislation passed by Congress on Thursday that also helped avoid a government shutdown. Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter said the package has $1.6 billion in disaster block grant aid to split among states for all the 2020 disasters, with southwest Louisiana anticipated to get $600 million for Laura and the follow-up blow of Hurricane Delta. “When you look at other singular hurricanes over the last 20 years and the billions of dollars that have flowed down to those communities, $600 million is crumbs,” he said. Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration has estimated the unmet needs for Hurricanes Laura, Delta and Zeta at roughly $3 billion. Calcasieu Parish Police Jury President Brian Abshire said in a statement that while the parish has waited patiently for federal aid, “Washington politics has diluted the relief bill,” which he called a “feel-good bill” that “makes no one but the federal politicians actually feel good, and it will do very little for Calcasieu Parish.”\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: A Canadian company plans to bring ferry service back to Bar Harbor next year, restoring service between Maine and Nova Scotia. Bay Ferries operated ferry service from Bar Harbor to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, for more than a decade before moving to Portland and ending service in 2009. Bay Ferries tried to return for the 2019 season but failed to get the ferry terminal renovated and approved in time. Then came the pandemic that scuttled service in 2020 and 2021. Now the company is ready to try again with a high-speed catamaran-style ferry called “The Cat.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Officials say the state will again spray pesticide Permanone 30-30 to control mosquito populations, after EPA testing determined it does not contain dangerous PFAS. The Baltimore Sun reports the Maryland Department of Agriculture temporarily halted use of the pesticide in the state this year “out of an abundance of caution” after testing by an outside lab found 3,500 parts per trillion of one type of PFAS and 630 parts per trillion of another, said MDA spokesman Jason Schellhardt. But testing by EPA scientists at Fort Meade returned a different result. PFAS, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, are also known as “forever chemicals” because they can linger in the human body for long periods of time. Laboratory tests have shown that accumulated PFAS can cause tumor growth in animals, in addition to problems with kidney, liver and reproductive function. Ruth Berlin, executive director of the Maryland Pesticide Education Network, one of the groups that commissioned the earlier test of Permanone 30-30, said she wasn’t satisfied by the new results from EPA scientists.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A former police union boss in the city has pleaded guilty to collecting more than $16,000 in fraudulent overtime pay while working at the department’s evidence warehouse, federal prosecutors said Monday. Thomas Nee, 64, of Quincy, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit theft concerning programs receiving federal funds and embezzlement from an agency receiving federal funds. A plea hearing has not yet been scheduled. Nee submitted false and fraudulent overtime slips from at least January 2015 through February 2019 and personally collected about $16,642 for overtime hours he did not work, prosecutors said. He’s the 15th former or current officer charged in connection with the investigation into overtime abuse at the police department’s evidence warehouse. Nine officers have so far pleaded guilty. Federal officials say more than $250,000 was embezzled. Nee was a longtime president of the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association who served until 2014. The embezzlement charge carries a sentence of up to ten years in prison and the conspiracy charge up to five years.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed several Republican-sponsored election bills, saying they would have perpetuated falsehoods to discredit the 2020 presidential election and made it tougher for people living in large senior facilities and apartment complexes to vote. Two measures would have codified existing practices by limiting access to Michigan’s voter database and keeping electronic pollbooks and voting systems from being connected to the internet on Election Day. The bills implied that outside parties had access to the files and that electronic pollbooks were connected online when neither was the case, the governor wrote to lawmakers. She also blocked a measure that would have expanded the types of buildings that can be polling places to include private conference centers and recreation clubhouses. It included a provision to let municipalities put polling places at senior facilities and apartment complexes with at least 150 residents, as they can now, but only if public buildings like schools were “not reasonably available for use or convenient to use.” Whitmer vetoed the legislation Sunday night at the NAACP Detroit branch’s annual Fight For Freedom Fund Dinner. The bills, she said, “attempt to suppress the vote or perpetuate the ‘Big Lie’ – the calculated disinformation campaign to discredit the 2020 election.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Renville County must conduct an environmental review to determine whether a proposed drainage ditch improvement could harm one of the last free-flowing creeks in the heavily agricultural western county, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled Monday. The appeals court reversed a decision by the county board, which concluded the study wasn’t necessary. The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, which challenged the county’s decision, said the court’s ruling sets a precedent that means any drainage project across the state that affects public water will require an environmental review. The dispute involves proposed improvements to a century-old ditch that empties into the upper reaches of Limbo Creek. Backers say the project would lead to better drainage of farmland. The Renville County Board declined in 2020 to order an environmental assessment worksheet because the creek’s upper reaches didn’t appear on an official inventory of “public waters” kept by the state Department of Natural Resources. But the Court of Appeals ruled that upper Limbo Creek nevertheless meets the state’s definition of public waters, so the review is mandatory. Limbo Creek flows directly into the Minnesota River, which has long been a major contributor of silt and farm chemicals to the Mississippi River.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: The city is planning to spend most of its federal pandemic relief money on parks and recreation, and critics say elected officials are ignoring people who need housing. Starkville is receiving $6.2 million from the American Rescue Plan Act. Aldermen voted Sept. 21 to spend $5.5 million of it for parks and recreation, $500,000 to hire police officers and $200,000 to improve water infrastructure in a subdivision, the Commercial Dispatch reports. Cate Van Hurdle, a representative with the Starkville Strong community action group, said homelessness and evictions are increasing in Starkville. “Because there is no money going to help these people, the city may be forcing people to possibly live in the parks or sleep in those parks,” Van Hurdle said. Federal guidelines say the pandemic recovery money may be spent on things including tourism; water, sewer and broadband infrastructure; assistance to businesses and families disproportionately affected by COVID-19; and premium pay for public employees. Mayor Lynn Spruill developed Starkville’s spending plan with the help of city attorney Chris Latimer, focusing heavily on tourism. While Spruill acknowledged homelessness and other infrastructure needs, she said other sources of money can be used to address those issues.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Pope Francis has joined the chorus of people calling on Gov. Mike Parson to grant clemency to a death row inmate who is set to be executed for killing three people during a 1994 convenience store robbery. In a letter last week, a representative for Pope Francis wrote that the pope “wishes to place before you the simple fact of Mr. Johnson’s humanity and the sacredness of all human life,” referring to Ernest Johnson, who is scheduled to be executed at 6 p.m. Tuesday at the state prison in Bonne Terre, about 50 miles south of St. Louis. Parson, a Republican, has been considering whether to reduce the 61-year-old Johnson’s sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Johnson’s attorney, Jeremy Weis, has said executing him would violate the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits executing intellectually disabled people. He said multiple IQ tests and other exams have shown that Johnson has the intellectual capacity of a child. He also was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and in 2008 lost about 20% of his brain tissue to the removal of a benign tumor. Racial justice activists and two Missouri members of congress – Democratic U.S. Reps. Cori Bush of St. Louis and Emmanuel Cleaver of Kansas City – have also called on Parson to show mercy to Johnson, who is Black.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A district judge has denied a request by several parents to halt mask mandates in city schools while a legal challenge of the mandates is underway. The parents sued several Missoula schools in August over their mask requirements, arguing they violated the state’s constitution, which guarantees individuals the right to make their own medical decisions. Missoula District Judge Jason Marks denied the request for a preliminary injunction Friday, saying in his decision that such an injunction could lead to increased spread of COVID-19 and quarantining of children and school staff. The decision came the same day dozens of Montana residents gathered at the state Capitol on Friday to decry mask mandates for schoolchildren. The rally was led by Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen, a Republican. Lawyer Quentin Rhoades, who represents several parents suing Missoula public schools over their mask requirements, said in August that there isn’t sufficient scientific evidence that children wearing masks prevents the spread of the coronavirus for the government to override parents’ rights to make decision about their children’s’ health. But several studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found school districts without a universal masking policy in place were more likely to have COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A woman believed by many to be the oldest living American has celebrated her 115th birthday. The Omaha World-Herald reports Thelma Sutcliffe marked her birthday quietly at the facility where she lives in Omaha. Sutcliffe was born Oct. 1, 1906, in Benson, Nebraska, which is now part of Omaha. Her parents owned a farm. At age 17, she married Bill Sutcliffe, who worked for the Postal Service. He died in the early 1970s. The Gerontology Research Group said Sutcliffe became the nation’s oldest living person April 17 when Hester Ford died in North Carolina at age 115. The oldest person in the world is believed to be 118-year-old Kane Tanaka of Japan, who was born Jan. 2, 1903.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: A flurry of laws passed by the Legislature this year took effect Friday, ushering in reforms that Democratic lawmakers who have majorities in the state Senate and Assembly have long campaigned to implement. Five years voters approved legalizing recreational cannabis in Nevada, business owners can now apply for licenses to establish on-site consumption lounges, where adults can smoke, “dab” or eat THC-laced edibles that they buy. Once licensed, the lounges will become the first public places in Nevada where pot products can be consumed recreationally. The state’s emerging cannabis industry has promoted the lounges for their economic development potential and pitched them as a draw for the millions of tourists who visit Las Vegas annually but can’t legally use the products in places like hotels. The permitting system created under the new law prioritizes Black and Latino applicants who have been “adversely affected by provisions of previous laws which criminalized activity relating to cannabis.” A points-based system to score applicants was introduced after data showed the state’s cannabis industry to be disproportionately white and male – a finding that concerned lawmakers and advocates who said it pointed to the racial disparities in how drug offenses were prosecuted.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Granite State filmmakers have explored the life of composer Amy Beach in a newly released documentary, highlighting her success story of the early 1900s as a widely recognized female pianist and composer. Beach was a New Hampshire native who taught herself how to compose symphonies while performing with world-renowned orchestras, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. John Grfoerer, the documentary maker, said that options for Beach were quite limited in the 1900s and that she might otherwise have gone on to appearing in more performances instead of composing. Grfoerer said even though she was denied the proper education to become a trained composer, she found a way to teach herself. The film premiered Friday on the Bank of New Hampshire stage.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The nation’s most expensive Superfund cleanup to remove cancer-causing pollution from the Passaic River will be expanded to include 9 more miles in Bergen, Passaic and Essex counties under a plan approved Monday by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But the $1.84 billion project to clean all 17 miles of the lower Passaic is still several years away from launching, officials said Monday. The $441 million expansion plan would excavate 387,000 cubic yards of contaminated river mud and place a barrier over the rest in a stretch of the river from North Arlington to the Dundee Dam, which spans the waterway between Clifton and Garfield. The plan comes more than seven years after the EPA unveiled an ambitious $1.4 billion “bank to bank” cleanup of the lower 8 miles of the Passaic from Newark Bay to Belleville where much of the pollution is concentrated. That dredge and cap project has not yet begun. “We know we can’t turn around a century of pollution overnight, but today as part of the solution we’re taking a very important step,” EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said during a virtual news conference Monday. EPA officials have wanted both projects on the river to be done concurrently to minimize disruptions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: New Mexico State University says less than a third of its students submitted proof of vaccination for COVID-19 by a Thursday deadline to otherwise undergo weekly coronavirus testing or leave the university. While 72.3% of the school’s employees provided proof of vaccination, only 30% of students did, officials said Friday. It’s not clear how many students who didn’t submit proof of vaccination by the deadline plan to submit weekly test results, officials said. “We’re not where we want to be with our vaccinated students,” said Jon Webster, the school’s COVID-19 project manager. “We want to make sure we’re protecting all of our students.” Failure to submit vaccination information or weekly test results can result in student suspension or staff termination, officials said. Students can get inoculated at any point in the semester and cease the weekly required testing once achieving full vaccination, Webster said. “We are seeing new submissions continue to come in, so we expect our final verified total to be significantly higher than what we’re seeing today and to continue to rise over the next several weeks as some students and employees receive their second dose and update their cards,” Webster said. Several students said Friday that they were unaware of the mandate’s details.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A statue honoring George Floyd in Union Square Park was vandalized Sunday, police said. According to police, a video showed an unidentified man on a skateboard throwing paint on the statue about 10 a.m. then fleeing. Sunday’s act wasn’t the first example of vandalism to the statue memorializing Floyd, whose killing at the hands of police in Minneapolis last year galvanized a racial justice movement across the country. The statue was unveiled on Juneteenth on Flatbush Avenue, in Brooklyn, and was vandalized five days later with black paint and marked with an alleged logo of a white supremacist group. Members of the group that installed the statue cleaned it, and local residents and one of Floyd’s brothers gathered in July as it was prepared to move to Manhattan. Meanwhile, city officials have suspended nine firefighters without pay in connection with a string of racist messages and memes they shared on their phones, including ones mocking Floyd’s death, The New York Times reports. A spokesperson called the suspensions the most severe punishments ever handed down in the history of the Fire Department of the City of New York, according to the paper. Black firefighters told the Times they believed the suspensions fell far short of deep-rooted problems in the department, where leaders have acknowledged that racism, sexism and harassment have been tolerated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSmithfield: A school board has passed a policy barring critical race theory in its classrooms after county commissioners threatened to withhold nearly $8 million in funding. The Johnston County school board on Friday unanimously approved an updated policy on how history and racism will be taught, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Under the new policy, teachers could be disciplined or fired if they teach that American historical figures weren’t heroes, undermine the U.S. Constitution in lessons or describe racism as a permanent part of American life. The all-Republican Johnston County Board of Commissioners was withholding $7.9 million until the school board passed a policy keeping critical race theory out of local classrooms. A revised code of ethics policy includes new wording such as “the United States foundational documents shall not be undermined,” and “all people who contributed to American Society will be recognized and presented as reformists, innovators and heroes to our culture.” April Lee, president of the Johnston County Association of Educators and an eighth grade social studies teacher, said the school system is “selling our souls to the devil for $7.9 million” and called the new policy “basically extortion.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Progress is being made on making the state Capitol more accessible to those who are physically disabled. State leaders have approved constructing new bathrooms and making other renovations to better accommodate wheelchairs. Over the next year, a meeting room will be made into three larger family restrooms that will be handicap accessible. “Just thinking about what it’s like to walk around here if I were visiting the Capitol with little kids, there are not accommodating spaces to take kids to the bathroom, other than to take them all into the women’s restroom or whatever,” said Sen. Erin Oban, D-Bismarck, KFYR-TV reports. There will also be wider doors installed for some meeting rooms. Contractors will be hired in the coming months, and construction will start shortly thereafter.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio State University has now tallied more than 2,800 instances of alleged, decades-old sexual misconduct by the late team doctor Richard Strauss, according to its latest campus crime data. The school says more than 170 total instances of rape and more than 2,600 instances of fondling attributed to Strauss came to light between 2018 and 2020, much of that through a law firm investigation for the university and lawsuits filed against OSU. The crime statistics are disclosed under the federal Clery Act, and incidents are counted in the year they’re reported, not the year they occurred. The 2020 data in the report adds dozens of instances of rape and about 470 instances of fondling attributed to Strauss. Hundreds of men allege he abused them at campus athletic facilities, a student health center, his home and or an off-campus clinic, and some of those men reported multiple instances. They say the school failed to stop Strauss despite students raising concerns during his 20 years at the university. Ohio State has apologized, and it announced settlements with 185 plaintiffs totaling nearly $47 million and with dozens more people for amounts not yet disclosed. A judge recently dismissed some of the biggest unsettled lawsuits, citing legal time limits. Plaintiffs in those plan to appeal. Still other cases are pending.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: A retired Army colonel is helping the city prepare to host dozens of refugee families from Afghanistan. U.S. Army Col. Mike FitzGerald, a 20-year veteran and current operations manager for Catholic Charities of Eastern Oklahoma, said the first families are expected to start arriving Nov. 1. “These are people that are asking for our help,” he told the Tulsa World. “They are young families with small children. These aren’t the bad guys.” Accommodations are being provided by Oklahoma State University and private landlords, FitzGerald said. “Stillwater is a very welcoming community and home to a lot of international students as part of OSU and has been a very diverse community because of our status as a university town,” Mayor Will Joyce said. “I would expect that any new refugee or other international visitors will find it to be a very welcoming place.” Organizers have also set up a committee structure to help with transportation, adult and children’s education, jobs, household supplies, furniture and groceries. The children may enroll in Stillwater Public Schools, FitzGerald said, and English language classes will be available. The U.S. Department of State is also providing $1,225 per person in a family, and work authorizations are being expedited so family members can find work quickly.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Three neighborhoods will soon be home to the city’s first “safe rest villages.” Commissioner Dan Ryan is leading the effort to construct six city-sanctioned outdoor homeless villages by the end of the year, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. He announced the downtown, Brentwood-Darlington and Hazelwood locations Thursday, saying the sites are a critical response to the “humanitarian crisis” unfolding on Portland’s streets. While there hasn’t been an official count of the city’s homeless population since 2019, encampments appear to have proliferated during the pandemic. These villages will be outdoor shelters where people experiencing homelessness can safely stay and receive basic services. Showers, beds, bathrooms, and support services including case management and mental health support will be offered. Ryan, who oversees the city-side of the Joint Office of Homeless Services, emphasized that each village will be fenced, with each individual possessing their own “sleeping pod.” Combined, the city expects the three sites to host about 120 people. “We can’t wait for affordable housing to be ready for every houseless person,” Ryan said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Powerful labor leader Johnny “Doc” Dougherty went on trial Monday in a City Hall corruption case that accuses him of keeping a City Council member on the union payroll to push his agenda. Dougherty, 61, who has steered more than $30 million in union funds to political candidates, faces a later extortion trial over other union activities. He expressed confidence that he would clear his name as he arrived for jury selection Monday at the federal courthouse, The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. “I have had zero crimes,” Dougherty said outside the courthouse, making a zero with his hand for emphasis. “So this is a relief. I can’t wait to get in and get this done.” Dougherty had been in the FBI’s sights for years before the 2019 indictment charged him with more than 100 crimes, including keeping City Council member Bobby Henon in a $70,000-a-year union job while he worked full time in the $140,000-a-year City Council post. Dougherty has held a tight grip on construction jobs in the Philadelphia region during more than two decades at the helm of Local 98 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which has nearly 5,000 members. He also leads the city’s Buildings Trades Council, an umbrella group of local unions with 70,000 members.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: Researchers at the University of Rhode Island and their colleagues at Penn State have been awarded a four-year, $1.5 million grant to study the effects of sea level rise and how it may worsen the impact of extreme weather, URI said in a statement. The goal is to help communities, the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service adapt and improve their resilience as the climate continues to change and hurricanes and nor’easters continue to increase in frequency and severity, the statement said. The grant is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which says the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. Sea level plays a role in flooding, shoreline erosion and other hazards, affecting nearly 40% of the U.S. population. Yet there is a lack of research available when it comes to how the impacts of nor’easters and hurricanes may be amplified as a result. “There are a number of studies that have been done looking at just sea level rise or just extreme weather, but what we’re really lacking in terms of clear understanding is the combined impact of these two phenomena,” said oceanography professor Isaac Ginis, who is leading the study.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Dylann Roof wants an entire appellate court to reconsider a decision to recuse itself from hearing his case, as the appeal of his death sentence and conviction in the 2015 racist slayings of nine members of a Black congregation winds its way through the judicial system. Last week, Roof’s attorneys made that request of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, writing that the judges who opted to sit out his case should reinstate themselves to consider his petition for a new hearing before the court. Without that move, or changing a court rule prohibiting judges visiting from other circuits from considering such requests, Roof’s lawyers wrote that “no judges exist to consider” his rehearing petition, depriving him of “a critical level of appellate review.” All of the judges from the 4th Circuit, which covers South Carolina, have recused themselves from hearing Roof’s case. No explicit reason was given in the court’s notice of that move in May, although one of the judges, Jay Richardson, prosecuted Roof’s case as an assistant U.S. attorney in 2017, when Roof became the first person in the U.S. sentenced to death for a federal hate crime. Authorities have said Roof, then 21, opened fire during the closing prayer of a Bible study at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, raining down dozens of bullets on those assembled.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Dozens of National Guard members from the state will answer a call from the Pentagon to help at the country’s southern border, with 125 members of the 1742nd Transportation Company being deployed for 9 to 12 months. Gov. Kristi Noem, Sens. John Thune and Mike Round, and Rep. Dusty Johnson were on hand for an activation ceremony Sunday at the University of Sioux Falls Stewart Center, KELO-TV reports. “So they’re going to go down there, try and reinforce the border, bring some order and stability, and obviously do it in a humanitarian and compassionate way,” Thune said. “We want them to know that we have their back,” Johnson said. “We understand that they’re going to be sacrificing a lot; their families are going to be sacrificing a lot over the next year. But we’re going to do the kind of things that we can do in Washington to make sure that they have the proper training, the proper equipment, but also in our communities to make sure their families are taken care of during the difficult time.” In July, Noem sent 50 South Dakota soldiers to the border following Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s request for help.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: In the first case of a new session, U.S. Supreme Court justices heard allegations that the city is essentially stealing groundwater from underneath Mississippi. That argument faced skepticism from members of the court Monday in Mississippi’s effort to get millions in damages for what officials say is Tennessee’s trampling over its sovereignty when it comes to water. At issue is whether Memphis city government, city-owned utility Memphis Light, Gas and Water, and the state of Tennessee have been pumping water in a way that has harmed Mississippi and siphoned off the water that was underneath it in the Claiborne Aquifer, of which the Memphis Sand aquifer is a region. Mississippi argues that, essentially, the water underneath the state belongs to it and no other state despite the fact that the aquifer in question is under eight states, not just Mississippi. It wants its northern neighbor and Memphis to pay millions in damages for past pumping of water – damages, that, if awarded, would be a huge financial liability for the city. Mississippi’s argument is one that it has made for years and that several courts have found lacking. A special master, a term for an official appointed by a court to oversee a case and hear arguments, also disagreed with Mississippi’s take.\n\nTexas\n\nLeague City: Police have arrested a man who was accused of stabbing a restaurant manager with a pocketknife after being told he needed to wear a mask. The stabbing happened in March at a Jack in the Box restaurant in League City, just southeast of Houston. Authorities had issued an arrest warrant for James Schulz Jr. shortly after the stabbing occurred, but he wasn’t taken into custody until last week, police said. At the time, police said Schulz refused to follow the restaurant’s policy requiring him to wear a mask to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. Police said he then attacked the manager. The manager had three stab wounds in the arm and upper torso, police said. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated and released. Schulz was arrested Wednesday on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct. Jail records did not list an attorney who could speak on his behalf.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Hundreds of maskless people packed a legislative hearing Monday to urge lawmakers to fight President Joe Biden’s plan to require most workers to get either vaccinated against COVID-19 or regularly tested for the coronavirus that causes it. The vast majority of people who attended the hearing in person criticized Biden’s plan, saying they fear it will infringe on personal freedom and cripple Utah’s economy. Sen. Curt Bramble said about 600 to 700 people attended the hearing in person, with another 200 who attended virtually. Last week, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox threatened to veto any legislation that blocks businesses from mandating employees to get the vaccines. He has said he opposes government mandating vaccines but supports businesses implementing their own mandates. Biden’s Sept. 9 announcement is expected to cover as many as 100 million Americans – private-sector employees as well as health care workers and federal contractors. Some mandates seem to have converted hesitant workers, but employers are still dealing with holdouts. The COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. were tested on tens of thousands of people and have proven to be both safe and effective at dramatically reducing the risk of serious disease and death.\n\nVermont\n\nVergennes: The state’s earliest known Black sheriff and police chief has been commemorated with a historical marker. The marker for Stephen Bates, who served as sheriff and police chief from 1879 until his death in 1907, was unveiled in Vergennes on Sunday at an event attended by at least 100 people, WCAX-TV reports. “Stephen Bates’ life and service represents immense perseverance overcoming enslavement to become a prominent member of the community in Vermont and dedicating his life to serving the people of Vergennes,” Gov. Phil Scott stated in a proclamation deeming Oct. 3, 2021, Sheriff Stephen Bates Day in the state. Bates was born in 1842, was enslaved in Virginia and gained his freedom through serving with Union soldiers during the Civil War, according to the governor’s proclamation. A team of community members and historians have been researching Bates’ life for the past year. “People started to join us from historical areas,” said Alicia Grangent of the Historical Marker Team. “Conversations about who to reach out to started to happen, and people just started to naturally gravitate towards this process.” Team members found and talked with some of Bates’ descendants, including great-grandchildren Larry and Nicholas Schuyler, who attended Sunday’s ceremony.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A medical glove manufacturing facility promising to employ nearly 2,500 people is coming to southwest Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday, calling the news the biggest job-creation announcement in the struggling region in a generation. Backed by significant federal spending, the project in Wythe County, 250 miles west of the state capital, is expected to create a number of jobs per capita equivalent to Amazon’s new headquarters in Arlington, according to the governor’s office. Northam called the project a big win for southwest Virginia and said the pandemic and associated supply chain problems had shown the need for more domestic production of personal protective equipment. Two companies, Blue Star Manufacturing and American Glove Innovations, have agreed to form a joint venture and invest $714 million to create both a nitrile butadiene rubber manufacturing facility and a nitrile glove production operation, according to a news release. The facilities are expected to occupy more than 200 acres at an industrial park near the junction of interstates 77 and 81. The project will increase the raw material production and manufacturing of gloves now primarily made in Asia, Northam’s office said.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: An invasive fungus that causes white-nose syndrome in bats continues to spread in the state, after the fungus was detected in late spring near Rimrock Lake. During spring and summer field work this year, scientists with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and U.S. Forest Service detected the fungus or disease in Yakima, Chelan and Mason counties, according to a news release. Scientists collected samples in the spring from a bat colony on Forest Service land near Rimrock Lake. Testing confirmed the presence of the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome, the Yakima Herald-Republic reports. The syndrome is harmful to hibernating bats but does not affect humans, livestock or other wildlife. The disease is caused by a fungus that attacks the skin of hibernating bats and damages their wings, making it difficult to fly. Infected bats often leave hibernation too early, which causes them to deplete their fat reserves and become dehydrated or starve to death. Washington is home to 15 bat species that are important predators of night-flying insects. These bats benefit humans by eating insects that can negatively affect forest health, commercial crops and human health.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A popular riverfront festival is returning to the city next year after a decade­long absence. The Charleston Sternwheel Regatta will take place over the Fourth of July weekend next year, Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin said in a news release Friday night. The Regatta was held as an end-of-summer festival from 1971 to 2009. It ran for as long as 10 days and included fireworks, concerts, carnival rides and food vendors. Goodwin said people have asked her to bring the Regatta back since she took office in 2019. “Regatta means so much to so many,” she said. “Because of the overwhelming amount of feedback we received, it was a priority for us to bring back this famed Charleston event.” The statement said a full schedule of events will be announced in the coming months.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State Department of Natural Resources officials on Monday dramatically scaled back the number of wolves hunters can kill during Wisconsin’s fall season in open defiance of its policy board, setting up another clash between liberal-leaning department leaders and conservative board members. Department biologists originally recommended setting the quota at 130 wolves, saying they were uncertain what effects the state’s spring hunt had on the wolf population. The policy board bumped the limit to 300 animals in August, prompting outrage from conservationists and wolf advocates, who have filed two lawsuits seeking to stop the hunt. The DNR announced in a news release Monday that it was unilaterally moving the quota back to 130 animals. Under treaties established in the 1800s, the state’s Chippewa tribes can claim up to half of the quota, but the Chippewa consider wolves sacred and won’t hunt them. The DNR said the tribes have claimed 56 animals, leaving state-licensed hunters 74. The DNR’s defiance left board member Greg Kazmierski flabbergasted. He said state law makes clear that the board directs and supervises the department. “They are not free to just do that,” Kazmierski said. “It’s in violation of the statute that establishes the board. They’ve gone rogue is what they’ve done.”\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: An autopsy has determined that a man whose body was found on the shore of a Yellowstone lake died of hypothermia, park officials said Wednesday. Mark O’Neill, 67, of Chimacum, Washington, had been on a four-night backcountry trip to Shoshone Lake with his brother, Kim Crumbo, 74, of Ogden, Utah. A relative reported them overdue Sept. 19. Searchers found O’Neill’s body Sept. 20 on the lake’s eastern shore. A search for Crumbo on foot and by boat will continue, weather permitting, for several days, park officials said in a statement. A vacant campsite was found on the lake’s south side. What happened remains under investigation, they said. The men were experienced boaters and former National Park Service employees, and Crumbo is a former Navy SEAL who served in Vietnam. Crumbo co-founded the conservation group Grand Canyon Wildlands Council, which later merged with another group to form Wild Arizona.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/05"}]}

For the latest on the storm, view USA TODAY's live updates for Tuesday, Aug. 6.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. − Debby, now a tropical storm, roared ashore Monday along the Big Bend coast of Florida, killing at least four people, flooding streets, and causing widespread power outages as the storm roared toward Georgia and South Carolina, where it's expected to bring catastrophic flooding this week.\n\n\"Tornadoes, catastrophic flash and urban flooding, coastal flooding, rip currents, strong gusty winds are all expected,'' in parts of the Southeast over the next several days, the National Weather Service said.\n\nAn apparent tornado touched down on Edisto Beach, South Carolina after 9:30 p.m. Monday, according to the National Weather Service in Charleston. There were multiple reports of structures damaged on Edisto Beach and across the river from Edisto Island from the radar-confirmed tornado, the weather service said.\n\nOther popular beach destinations, including Kiawah Island and Johns Island, were being warned of possible tornado activity as additional severe storms moved onshore.\n\nDebby, the fourth named storm of what is predicted to be a historic hurricane season, made landfall Monday at 7 a.m. near the coastal town of Steinhatchee as a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. Steinhatchee, about 70 miles west of Gainesville and home to some 500 people, is just 10 miles from where Hurricane Idalia came ashore last year.\n\nAfter more than three hours moving across northern Florida, Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm with sustained winds of 70 mph, the hurricane center said in its 11 a.m. ET update. By 11 p.m., the winds had diminished to 45 mph, though the storm was still dropping copious amounts of rain.\n\nState officials reported widespread flooding and inundating storm surge as Debby moved inland. The storm's winds uprooted trees and toppled utility poles, knocking out power to more than 250,000 homes and businesses throughout northern Florida. Forecasters said Debby's powerful winds could also spawn tornadoes, and storm surge could reach 10 feet in some areas.\n\n\"This is a life-threatening situation,\" the hurricane center warned.\n\nOn Sunday, President Joe Biden declared an emergency across Florida, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the Florida National Guard and Florida State Guard were activated to support humanitarian assistance and search-and-rescue missions.\n\nBreaking news, in-depth analysis: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing for news you need to know now.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Vice President Kamala Harris postponed her campaign rally scheduled for Friday in Savannah, Georgia, because of the expected deluge there, campaign officials said.\n\n∎ The storm surge produced by Debby brought 25 packages of cocaine with a street value of more than $1 million to a Florida beach, where a passer-by noticed them and alerted authorities, a Border Patrol official posted on the X platform.\n\n∎ The National Hurricane Center recorded a 98 mph wind gust near Horseshoe Beach, according to the Florida Severe Weather Network, a collection of state-run weather stations.\n\n∎ The National Water Prediction Service projected major flooding in three locations on the Santa Fe River and a location on the Suwannee River in north Florida.\n\n∎ Debby wreaked havoc on travel. More than 1,700 flights had been canceled and upwards of 5,800 were delayed Monday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration said all flights at Orlando International Airport have been grounded while airports in Tallahassee and Gainesville were closed.\n\nWhat lies ahead for the Southeast coast\n\nDebby is projected to move slowly across northern Florida before unleashing \"potentially historic heavy rainfall\" across the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 10-20 inches are expected from northern Florida to southeastern North Carolina, while parts of northern Georgia and South Carolina, including Charleston, could get upward of 30 inches of rain through this weekend, Michael Brennan, director of the National Hurricane Center, said in a YouTube livestream.\n\nDebby is expected to head into the Atlantic Ocean by late Tuesday night, then regain strength for a day or two before soaking the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, whose governors have already declared states of emergency as they urge residents to prepare.\n\nNorth Carolina and the mid-Atlantic will start getting heavy rain by midweek, the prediction center said, and tropical storm effects could be felt as far north as southern New England late in the week, AccuWeather reported.\n\nDeath toll up to four after truck driver is killed\n\nAt least four storm-related deaths have been reported in Florida.\n\nThe driver of a semi-truck was killed overnight near Temple Terrace after losing control of his vehicle on a wet Interstate 75 northeast of Tampa, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nThe three previously reported deaths linked to the storm included a woman and a 12-year-old girl killed in a car crash and a teenage boy killed when a tree fell on a mobile home.\n\nThe truck driver, a 64-year-old man from New Albany, Mississippi, lost control of the truck at around 2:30 a.m., Sgt. Steve Gaskins, a public affairs officer with the Florida Highway Patrol, said in a news release. The truck rotated on the wet highway, collided with a concrete barrier and went over the wall, coming to rest hanging over a bridge. Gaskins said the cab came loose from the trailer and fell into a deep canal below.\n\nDivers from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office responded shortly afterward and found the deceased driver still inside the cab underwater in the canal, according to an X post by the Sheriff’s office.\n\nLt. Scott Tummond, a spokesperson for the Levy County Sheriff's Office, told USA TODAY on Monday that more trees could fall after torrential downpours soaked the ground, posing a threat to residents on the road at night.\n\n\"If you're moving around after dark, you might not see it until it's too late, especially if you're driving,\" he warned.\n\nFallen tree kills 13-year-old amid Hurricane Debby\n\nA 13-year-old boy was killed as Hurricane Debby made landfall along the Florida coast Monday morning, the Levy County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.\n\nDeputies responded to a report of a tree that had fallen onto a mobile home around 8 a.m. in Fanning Springs, about 35 miles east from where the hurricane came ashore. The boy who died was \"crushed inside the home,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers are with this family as they deal with this tragedy,” the sheriff’s office said, urging people to be careful as they begin to assess the storm damage. “Downed power lines and falling trees are among the many hazards. One life is too many. Please be safe.”\n\n– Jonathan Limehouse, USA TODAY\n\nRisk of tornadoes\n\nWith the center of Debby about 35 miles west of Brunswick, Georgia at 11 p.m. Monday, the Storm Prediction Center said a risk of tornadoes continued in the storm’s northeast quadrant, along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nThe center said it would likely extend a tornado watch for at least some of the 13 counties in the region beyond the scheduled 1 a.m. expiration. In addition to the earlier tornado on Edisto Island, the weather service said it had confirmed a tornado on radar on Kiawah Island around 11 p.m.\n\nSouth Carolina town under curfew ahead of storm\n\nAuthorities in Charleston, South Carolina, issued a curfew from 11 p.m. Monday through noon Tuesday ahead of what forecasters warn could be a calamitous storm.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency on Sunday as Tropical Storm Debby readied to hit South Carolina’s coast this week. The center will move offshore late Tuesday and Wednesday and approach the coast on Thursday.\n\nThe governor said that as of Monday, he does not anticipate needing to issue any evacuation orders or order the closure of state facilities or agencies. John Quagliariello, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the state would likely see \"historic rainfall\" that would result in \"catastrophic\" flash flooding.\n\n\"It's very likely that some areas that have never flooded in the past will be impacted this time,\" Quagliariello said.\n\n– Savannah Moss, Greenville News\n\nTown still recovering from Idalia gets walloped by Hurricane Debby\n\nDonna Luce lost power at 6 a.m. Monday and said rain came down for hours as the storm approached and eventually made landfall. Her home’s rain gauge showed 7 inches of rain fell Sunday alone, she said.\n\n“It is still raining pretty hard and we expect to get that most of the day, kind of like it’s sitting right here on top of us,” Luce told USA TODAY on Monday morning.\n\nMany fellow residents in Mayo, a small town about 30 miles north of where Debby came ashore, have spent the past year recovering from Hurricane Idalia, said Luce, 65.\n\n“Most people had just gotten their roofs repaired, and had gotten back up on their feet,” she said, adding that several of her neighbors still had tarps on their roofs this summer. “Now it’s hitting us again one year later and we are a little discouraged.\"\n\n– Claire Thornton, USA TODAY\n\nFlooding from Hurricane Debby could last 5-10 days\n\nThe widespread flooding and significant storm surge Debby has caused across northern Florida are expected to last several days, DeSantis said Monday.\n\nKevin Guthrie, the executive director for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said some parts of southwest Florida received up to a foot of rain as Debby approached the Big Bend region. He added that flooding in northern Florida will be widespread as up to 20 inches could fall over the next few days.\n\nGuthrie cautioned people to stay indoors as flash floods break out inland and storm surge continues to inundate coastal communities.\n\nThe flood threat from Hurricane Debby, Guthrie said, \"is probably going to be here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days depending on how much rainfall we get.”\n\nStorm sounds like a freight train, uproots trees\n\nAlice Brown and her husband were awoken by what sounded like a freight train early Monday morning. They soon realized it was the wind and rain lashing their home as Hurricane Debby approached the Big Bend region and eventually made landfall.\n\n“This was the strongest wind and most rain I’ve ever seen,” Brown told USA TODAY.\n\nBrown, 68, lives in downtown High Springs, a small city of some 6,000 people outside Gainesville. While she did not lose power, several of her friends had their power knocked out overnight and were still without it Monday afternoon.\n\nJordan Huey, one of Brown’s neighbors, woke up to a tree falling within inches of his son’s bedroom. Another tree in his yard uprooted and destroyed at least 20 feet of his fence. Huey still had not been able to assess the damage because powerful wind gusts were still hurling tree limbs and other debris outside.\n\n“This is the worst it’s ever been in our area,” said Huey, 52.\n\nSeveral reports of more than 10 inches of rainfall\n\nDebby is leaving behind some eye-popping rain totals, including the 16.56 inches over two days reported by a weather station at Lakewood Ranch in Manatee County. There have been several reports of more than 10 inches of rain across the county, including 12.43 inches at the Sarasota Bradenton airport.\n\nThe weather service in Jacksonville issued a flash flood warning for parts of four counties in north Florida, saying between 7 and 14 inches of rain have fallen, and another 3 to 6 inches are possible.\n\nWith Debby's center still over north Florida by early afternoon, a daily rainfall record was set at Charleston International Airport in South Carolina, with 2.29 inches to that point, according to meteorologist Steven Taylor with the National Weather Service in Charleston.\n\nTaylor also reiterated the forecast of 10-20 inches of rain with localized amounts near 30 inches is still on track. \"The situation still looks favorable for a historic rainfall event with areas of catastrophic flooding. This is a potentially significant and life-threatening event,\" he said.\n\nWoman, girl die in crash as Hurricane Debby approached Florida coast\n\nA woman and a girl died in a single-vehicle crash in Dixie County on Sunday night, the eve of Hurricane Debby’s landfall, according to a law enforcement report.\n\nFlorida Highway Patrol troopers arrived at the scene of the crash around 9:30 p.m. A 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old girl were pronounced dead, while a 14-year-old boy was seriously injured and rushed to a hospital for treatment.\n\nWitnesses told the Florida Highway Patrol the car lost control “due to inclement weather and wet roadway.”\n\n“After losing control, the vehicle struck the guardrail in the center median, then redirected, overturning, leaving the roadway to the right,” the Florida Highway Patrol said. The crash is under investigation.\n\nMore than 130K without power after Debby makes landfall\n\nMore than 130,000 homes and businesses in Florida, the majority of them in the north, were without power by 12 a.m. ET on Tuesday as Debby continued its path across the state.\n\nThe outages were most abundant from Wakulla to Levy County, according to Poweroutage.us. In Taylor County, where Hurricane Debby made landfall at 7 a.m., more than 97% of utility customers lost power at one point. In several surrounding counties, that figure was well over 80%.\n\nAt a news conference Monday morning, DeSantis said 17,000 linemen across the state were poised to begin restoring power once the storm passes.\n\nForecasters watching tropical system near Caribbean\n\nDebby wasn't the only storm forecasters were watching Monday. They were also keeping an eye on another developing tropical system that was approaching the Caribbean Sea.\n\nAlthough chances for development were low as of Monday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said \"environmental conditions are expected to become more conducive for development later this week as the system moves across the western Caribbean Sea or the southern Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nIf its winds eventually reach 39 mph, the system would become a named tropical storm. The next name on the list is Ernesto. It's too early to determine if there will be any impact to the U.S. from this system.\n\nPacific sets 50-year record for storms\n\nThe eastern Pacific hurricane season has also heated up: The Pacific currently has four named storms spinning at the same time: Carlotta, Daniel, Emilia and Fabio. This is the first time since August 1974 that the eastern North Pacific has had four named storms simultaneously, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.\n\nNone of the four storms are forecast to approach or impact land as they spin far out to sea in the Pacific, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe activity in the Pacific comes after a very slow start to the season. For the first time since the satellite era began in 1966, the entire North Pacific saw no named storm activity between June 1 and July 3, Klotzbach said.\n\nWhat makes Debby such a treacherous storm?\n\nDebby is a large and slow-moving storm, making the system particularly dangerous as record amounts of rain inundate many areas, especially along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina in the coming days.\n\nThe storm’s center was forecast to move near Savannah, Georgia, on Tuesday night and drag along the South Carolina Coast on Thursday night. \"Multiple days of very, very heavy rainfall\" are possible, Brennan said. The National Weather Service estimates rainfall totals could reach up to 30 inches or more in isolated locations along the coast through Friday.\n\nDebby shows there's more to a storm than wind scale\n\nThe widespread flooding caused by Debby even after being downgraded to a tropical storm illustrates how the wind scale categories used to define hurricanes can fall short of telling the whole story of their impact, scientists say.\n\n\"This is another example of a storm where the primary impacts are going to be from water, rather than wind,\" said James Franklin, a retired branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the National Hurricane Center.\n\nJennifer Collins, a professor in the Geosciences School at the University of South Florida, has studied how to better communicate all of a storm’s threats. Looking at the forecasts of up to 30 inches of rain in isolated locations between Savannah and Charleston, Collins said she’s very concerned about the likelihood of “catastrophic flooding.\" Read more here.\n\nDebby tracker\n\nSpaghetti models\n\nIllustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nWhen is the Atlantic hurricane season the most active?\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. The peak of the season is Sept. 10, and the most activity usually happens between mid-August and mid-October, according to the hurricane center.\n\nAfter Hurricane Beryl's deadly rampage in July, forecasters from Colorado State University raised their already record hurricane forecast. They now expect an additional hurricane (a total of 12 for the season) and two more named storms (25 for the season).\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/30/helene-aftermath-live-updates-monday-north-carolina/75447978007/", "title": "Helene damage updates: Death toll rises amid rescue efforts", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Hurricane Helene for Monday, Sept. 30. For the latest on recovery efforts, view our live updates file for Tuesday, Oct. 1.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − President Joe Biden is sure to get a first-hand look at the devastation is Asheville when he visits North Carolina on Wednesday as part of his tour of the Southeastern states ravaged by Hurricane Helene, which caused more than 100 deaths and left nearly 1.6 million customers without power as of Monday evening.\n\nBiden is less likely to see communities like Lake Lure and neighboring Chimney Rock, not only because they're more than 30 miles away and much smaller, but because they're barely there anymore.\n\nChimney Rock was largely submerged, its buildings swept away by the water and their debris blocking entry points into the village of 140 residents, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported.\n\n“What was once a town is now a river,'' said Tracey Stevens, who worked at the Chimney Rock brewery, now also wiped away. \"It’s beyond anything I can imagine.”\n\nLake Lure, a resort town of 1,400 people, also took a severe blow from the storm, which destroyed the town hall, police station and pier while washing away businesses.\n\nThe scene is not much prettier in normally picturesque Asheville, county seat of Buncombe County, or for that matter in much of the Southeast. Hundreds of water rescues have taken place across Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia since Helene's brutal landfall in Florida's Big Bend region late Thursday.\n\nAtlanta totaled more than 11 inches of rain in 48 hours, smashing a record that stood for almost 150 years. Western North Carolina took the brunt of the devastating rains, and more than 30 inches was recorded in some areas. Houses floated away from subdivisions, bridges crumbled, and semi-trucks were tossed into mangled piles. Mud, tree branches and food from local grocery stores flowed into the streets. The Associated Press reported at least 133 people have died because of Helene.\n\nForty of those fatalities have been confirmed in Buncombe County, County Manager Avril Pinder said in a Monday afternoon briefing, raising the total in North Carolina to nearly 50. Officials have received about 600 missing persons reports, although many are expected to be resolved when communications are restored.\n\n\"We don't have water and we do not have power across most of the county,\" Pinder said. \"The roads are still incredibly dangerous.\"\n\nSome supplies were being airlifted because ground transportation was limited with so many damaged roads, and the county planned to begin distributing food and water Monday.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper activated more than 500 soldiers and airmen from the National Guard. More than 200 vehicles and aircraft, including hoist and emergency aviation assets and high-water response vehicles, were feverishly working to save lives.\n\nOn the ground:How flood damage is cutting off North Carolina communities from emergency relief\n\nHurricanes, tornadoes, snow and heat: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter for more weather news and analysis.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ AccuWeather has increased its estimate of the total damage and economic loss from Hurricane Helene to between $145 billion and $160 billion. Helene is expected to be one of the costliest storms in U.S. history because of its overwhelming storm surge, winds and flooding, the weather service said.\n\n∎ Vice President Kamala Harris will cut short a campaign trip and plans a visit to the storm-ravaged Southeast, her office told Reuters. Former President Donald Trump, who said he will visit the region, has criticized Harris for campaigning as the tragedy unfolded. He has also continued to hold rallies.\n\n∎ The South Carolina Department of Public Safety has confirmed 29 storm-related deaths, many involving fallen trees. Impassable roads and lack of stable power has forced several school closures in the state, some lasting through Friday.\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Helene killed a minimum of 25 people in his state. In Tennessee, the state Department of Health has confirmed six weather-related fatalities across four counties, and about 100 people are reported missing. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency noted several county health departments have been closed due to the storm's impact.\n\n∎ Helene is one of the deadliest hurricanes to make landfall on the U.S. mainland in modern history. Since 1950, only eight hurricanes have claimed more than 100 lives in the contiguous 48 states. Hurricane Harvey, which flooded Houston and the surrounding region in 2017, killed 103.\n\n∎ Energy production in the Gulf was recovering. Only 3% of crude oil and 1% of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico remained shut down in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said late Sunday.\n\nStorm tracker:Hurricane Center tracking Tropical Depression Joyce, 4 other systems\n\nAsheville water system severely damaged\n\nIn the days after Helene swept through western North Carolina, Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer cautioned that those in the county waiting for the water system to come back online must prepare for the long term.\n\n\"And I’m not talking about days,\" she told the Citizen-Times. \"We want them to plan for longer than that.”\n\nWith the city's water system \"severely damaged\" — which feeds not only the city of Asheville, but also Buncombe County and the northern portion of Henderson County — officials said that restoring service to the full system could take weeks.\n\nAssistant City Manager Ben Woody described the damage as \"catastrophic\" and said crews are still attempting to access infrastructure buried by debris or underwater.\n\nWater distribution began on Monday with four county run sites and one city site. As federal and state supply delivery lagged, though it eventually reached the county for its sites, the city spent \"hundreds of thousands\" of dollars to purchase water through a private provider, said City Manager Debra Campbell.\n\n— Sarah Honosky, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nBiden sends FEMA chief to Asheville 'until the situation has stabilized'\n\nBiden sent FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to be on the ground in Asheville, North Carolina, \"until the situation has stabilized,\" the federal agency said Monday. FEMA teams are deploying to Mission Hospital and are currently treating patients, while another team is moving to Blue Ridge Regional Hospital in Spruce Pine.\n\nTen federal search and rescue teams are on the ground in the region and another nine teams are on the way, for a total of 900 active personnel, FEMA said. Also being being brought to the region: 25 trailer-loads of meals, 60 trailer-loads of waters, and C-17 cargo plane full of food, water and other essentials.\n\nAccording to a news release, 200 federal ambulances have been provided to the state. The agency has also supplied 40 Starlink satellites to help with responder communications, and 18 helicopters are on standby to help deliver additional resources to affected areas.\n\n− Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nDevastation like a scene from 'War of the Worlds'\n\nResidents in parts of western North Carolina where help has not arrived are fending for themselves. Taylor Shelton said her husband spent two days cutting through large fallen trees with a chainsaw to open a passageway for the couple and their three children to drive out of their darkened house in Yancey County, which abuts Buncombe County.\n\nThe devastation they saw along the way left them awestruck.\n\n\"It looks like 'War of the Worlds.' Very, very big trees are down everywhere,\" she said. \"We saw houses that are just washed away.\"\n\nShelton said the couple still hasn't been able to get in touch with her husband's parents in nearby Burnside, which was also battered by the storm.\n\nManheimer echoed the sentiment, noting that she was experiencing the same things — no power, no water, no Wi-Fi and limited to no cell reception — as many others in the county.\n\n“We are so lucky. Our house did not get hit,\" she said. \"Our neighborhood looks like a war zone.”\n\nIn the hours after Helene lashed the county, Manheimer and her youngest son donned backpacks and went looking for her dad, who lives a mile-and-a-half away. The scene, she said, was \"unbelievable.\"\n\nThey picked through the wreckage of the neighborhood, navigating fallen trees, and downed lines, shimmying through gaps where they could. Her family, once everyone was accounted for, was safe, she said\n\nDeSantis sends rescuers for Floridians in North Carolina\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered rescue teams to mobilize air lifts for people from Florida who may be stranded in western North Carolina in areas with blocked roads and power and cellphone outages.\n\n“Operation Blue Ridge” launched Sunday, an effort similar to one he’d ordered almost a year ago to help Florida residents in Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, and from Haiti earlier this year amid that country’s political violence.\n\nRecovery efforts are ongoing in Florida in the aftermath of Helene. At least 11 people were killed in the state, including at least nine in Pinellas County − hundreds of miles from where the storm made landfall.\n\nDeSantis said he missed a call from Biden because he was in the air viewing damage. The governor added that the federal government should concentrate its efforts on helping those in western North Carolina, though he said Florida might ask for more federal assistance in the future.\n\n− Gray Rohrer, Tallahassee Democrat\n\n'Biblical devastation':Helene leaves trail of destruction\n\n'It's a race against time': Historic town begins digging out\n\nMARSHALL, N.C. − Days after flooding devastated this tiny town of less than 800 people, cleanup crews on Monday worked to remove thick mud and debris while business owners pulled belongings from waterlogged downtown buildings. The historic town, set along the French Broad River north of Asheville, was slammed by a deluge that reached to the first-floor roof of some downtown buildings. It also damaged a water-treatment plant across the river.Most of the town was without power and cellular service. The damage extended to some businesses that in recent years have become part of an artistic renewal in the downtown area. As excavators and equipment buzzed around him, Chad Adamowski and his friends were shoveling mud out of his tattoo and music store, hoping to tear out walls before mold set in. “It’s a race against time,” he said.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nLoss of cell service 'crippled' North Carolina town\n\nWhen Helene inundated and isolated communities across the Southeast, it knocked out cell phone service in Canton, North Carolina, at the moment residents needed it most, according to the town's mayor.\n\nThe loss of service \"crippled\" the town's ability to communicate during and after the devastating storm, leaving residents few options to get crucial updates and check on their loved ones, Mayor Zeb Smathers told USA TODAY.\n\n“I must also express my deep frustration and anger with the failures in cellular communication, particularly the inability to rely on services when we needed them most,” he said in a statement. “From the very start of this crisis, our ability to communicate with basic emergency services was crippled, and there is no excuse for this.”\n\nMaking cell communication accessible during a disaster should be something these companies have the resources and know-how to offer, the mayor said.\n\nMajor cellular providers have said they are working around the clock to provide temporary solutions and fully restore service. But the reality on the ground has been harrowing for people stuck without means to reach their loved ones or get help.\n\nCommunications in the region could be impacted for days, weeks or even months, and large companies need to do more to prepare for communication breakdowns triggered by disasters fueled by climate change, said Alyssa Provencio, a professor who oversees the disaster management certificate program at the University of Central Oklahoma.\n\n“Communication failure is not a matter of 'if,' it's a matter of 'when,'” Provencio said. \"We know that extreme events are occurring more frequently and with more intensity, and so whether you're talking about hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes, it's something that will impact you and impact your communications.\" Read more here.\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nWorld Central Kitchen distributing food in Asheville\n\nDisaster relief organizations are providing free food and supplies in the Asheville area amid massive, urgent need.

She is among hundreds of people turning to social media for help to contact friends and loved ones in parts of the Southeast that were battered by Helene. Communication blackouts created by Helene's fury have made obtaining information difficult.\n\nAs the storm approached Florida, Vale and her husband drove from their Burnsville home in the Blue Ridge Mountains to their house in Dunedin, a coastal town west of Tampa. While their Florida home was unscathed, their worry immediately became centered on Burnsville, where washed-out bridges and roads have left residents trapped with no means to communicate with the outside world.\n\n“No one’s been able to get a hold of anyone up there. I’m sure they’re OK, it's just not knowing,” she said, speaking about her friends and neighbors. “It's beyond comprehension what’s happened.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\n'The whole side of the mountain came down'\n\nRED HILL, N.C. – James Waters watched Helene's torrential rains and fierce winds decimate his farm among the hilly slopes of Appalachian North Carolina, snapping trees, ripping out fences and causing a landslide.\n\nIt took him a full day to dig to the main road with a farm excavator. He found windy roads strewn with downed power lines, fallen limbs, thick mud and debris. In some areas, cars were washed into ditches. One neighbor found a dead body near a riverbank, he said.\n\nNo one had cell service or power. People couldn’t find out whether their relatives were alive or dead. Waters knew he had a huge recovery ahead of himself. But his family had survived.

For the latest news on Beryl, please follow USA TODAY's live updates on the storm for Tuesday, July 9.Tropical Storm Beryl unleashed a barrage of severe weather to southeast Texas on Monday, killing at least four people, flooding highways, closing oil ports, canceling more than 1,300 flights and knocking out power to more than 2.7 million homes and businesses.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Beryl, the season's earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, weakened from a hurricane after pounding the coastal Texas town of Matagorda, a coastal community between Corpus Christi and Galveston. It had sustained winds of more than 80 mph as it made landfall at 4 a.m. CT.\n\nThe agency said current conditions could spawn tornadoes in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. By 7 p.m. CT, the weather service office in Shreveport, Louisiana, reported it had issued over 50 tornado warnings. The office had also stacked up a list of a half-dozen possible tornadoes.\n\nHouston Mayor John Whitmire said most of the city was experiencing flood waters of more than 10 inches. \"We're literally getting calls across Houston right now asking for first responders to come rescue individuals in desperate life safety conditions,\" he said Monday.\n\nIn a suburban part of Harris County, just northeast of Houston, a man was killed when a tree fell on his home and trapped him under debris, according to Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. In northern Harris County, a tree fell onto a house and killed a 74-year-old woman, Gonzalez said on social media.\n\nAt least two more people died: A Houston Police Department civilian employee got caught in flood waters driving to work; in southeast Houston, a man was killed in a fire believed to have been started by lightning, Whitmire said at a news conference Monday evening.\n\nLast week, Beryl carved a path of destruction across the Caribbean — leaving at least 11 people dead and destroying or severely damaging infrastructure on several islands. Beryl, which at one point strengthened into the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, last made landfall on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Friday morning.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Officials in Fort Bend County outside of Houston evacuated the residents of an apartment building badly hit by the storm to local fairgrounds, the county’s Emergency Management Agency announced Monday evening.\n\n∎ Beryl’s maximum sustained winds fell to around 35 mph by 7 p.m. local time. The tropical depression is expected to weaken into a post-tropical cyclone on Tuesday, according to a National Weather Service advisory. It is expected to move through the Lower Mississippi Valley and into the Ohio Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n∎ More than 2.7 million homes and businesses in Texas lost power, according to Patrick and PowerOutage.us. Several counties in southeastern Texas — including Houston, where many U.S. energy companies are headquartered — are under a flash-flood warning as thunderstorms unleashed up to nearly 12 inches of rain in some areas.\n\n∎ Closures of major oil-shipping ports around Corpus Christi, Galveston, and Houston ahead of the storm could disrupt crude oil exports and shipments of crude to refineries and motor fuel from the plants. The Corpus Christi Ship Channel has re-opened, while the Port of Houston was projected to resume operations on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n∎ At least two locations on the west side of Houston experienced major flooding Monday, according to the National Water Prediction Service. They included the White Oak Bayou, where the water rose more than 25 feet, and the Buffalo Bayou, where the water rose 24 feet, both within about 9 hours.\n\n∎ Across eastern Texas, heavy rain and flooding triggered water rescues as people became trapped in their homes and vehicles.\n\nMore flooding expected in Houston\n\nAs Beryl drenched the region north of Houston, officials urged residents to stay off the roads.\n\n“Don’t let the clear skies fool you,” Whitmire said. “We still have dangerous circumstances, we still have high water.”\n\nRussell Richardson, a Houston Police Department information security officer, died after getting caught in floodwaters on his way to work Monday morning, the police shared on social media. He was 54.\n\nBrent Taylor, chief communications officer for the city’s Office of Emergency Management, said rain falling north of the city went through Houston’s bayou system, a network of creeks that can easily overflow.\n\n“The flooding isn’t over,” he said. “We anticipate the cresting will happen later as the water moves down to the Gulf of Mexico.”\n\nAdditional flooding plus the impact of the power outage on city traffic lights will continue to make driving dangerous, he said.\n\nBeryl produces tornadoes\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center documented nearly a dozen tornado reports produced by Beryl as it moved north from Texas into Louisiana and Arkansas. Local National Weather Service officials issued over 60 tornado warnings.\n\nA condo building in Jasper County, Texas, took a direct hit from a tornado Monday morning, local emergency management officials told the National Weather Service; a twister in Timpson, Texas, 25 miles from the Lousiana border, tore the roof off of City Hall.\n\nMost of the tornadoes were reported in Texas and Louisiana, with an additional report in Arkansas. Nearly all of Southern Arkansas and Western Louisiana were under tornadoe watch, according to the weather service.\n\nHurricane Beryl's strength caught people off guard\n\nHal Needham, an extreme weather scientist widely known to other locals in Galveston, Texas, as \"Hurricane Hal\", was up just after 4 a.m. Monday to monitor the storm and livestream updates.\n\n\"We've had some pretty big squalls today with widespread power outages,\" he said. \"I think the storm was a lot stronger than a lot of people expected.\"\n\nNeedham also was concerned that continuing power outages would leave residents vulnerable to high-80s heat and high humidity. \"This is the hottest time of the year,\" he said. \"If people still don't have power, there could really be some issues with heat exhaustion, with heat-related illnesses, especially for elderly people with health conditions.\"\n\nAlthough people from the area are hurricane-savvy, this storm hit earlier than most, catching them off guard, Needham said. \"Only 3% of major hurricanes usually happen in June or July,\" he said. \"Typically, Texas does not get a lot of July and June hurricane landfalls.\"\n\n\"I think people were really surprised by how hard and how quickly this hit,\" he added.\n\nHigh heat index, no A/C will make for harsh early recovery\n\nThe early part of the recovery from Beryl's ravages will be an arduous, sweaty task made a lot more uncomfortable by the power outages affecting millions of Texans amid the summer heat.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Houston issued a heat advisory for Tuesday in southeast Texas, where a heat index of 105 Fahrenheit is expected.\n\n\"While this would normally be below criteria (for the advisory), the widespread loss of power and A/C will make for dangerous conditions,'' the Houston office said. \"Those working outside may not have a chance to properly cool off!''\n\nThe heat index combines air temperature with relative humidity to provide a measure of what the temperature actually feels like to people. The thermometer is expected to rise to 93 degrees in Houston on Tuesday and Wednesday, and which along with relative humidity of close to 80 may send the heat index past the 110 mark.\n\nThe Houston office warned about the possibility of heat-related illnesses and advised residents to limit outdoor activities, drink lots of water, wear light clothing, and try to work during cooler times of the day.\n\nWhat now?Where are Beryl's remnants headed next? Flooding rain; tornadoes possible\n\nGalveston resident says first hurricane will be her last\n\nAlanna Carter endured her first hurricane Monday night when Beryl passed over her home in Galveston. \"I don't want to go through that ever again,\" the 44-year-old bartender said hours after the storm passed through the area.\n\n\"If that was only a Cat 1, I can only imagine what Ike was like and that was a Cat 4,\" she said of Hurricane Ike, which struck Texas in 2008, before Carter's arrival.\n\nCarter said Beryl lashed her house with fierce wind and rain. \"It literally shook the entire house,\" she said, adding the neighborhood was dark after losing power. She doesn't expect it back for days.\n\nThough her house wasn't severely damaged, Carter said a neighbor lost a window and the area was covered with debris left behind by Beryl, including fallen trees, shingles, plastic and trash. The next time a hurricane heads for Galveston, Carter doesn't plan to stick around.\n\n\"This is not my jam,'' she said. \"I mean, I was nauseous because my anxiety was so high.\"\n\nBeryl knocks out power for over 2 million people in Texas\n\nMore than 2.1 million customers were out of power in eastern Texas, according to the power company CenterPoint Energy. It’s unclear how many of those customers were in Houston. On its website, CenterPoint Energy said the service was disrupted by 5,993 active outages.\n\nAccording to PowerOutage.us, an outage tracker, more than 2.7 million homes and businesses across Texas were without power.\n\nStorm does heavy damage in last 30 minutes\n\nRichard Reyes thought the worst of the storm had passed him and his family by. Then their house in northeast Houston started flooding with up to a foot of water, the power went out and a huge tree toppled in front of their place.\n\n“All of this happened in the last 30 minutes of the storm,'' said Reyes, 73, a retired actor and arts advocate who as his Santa-like alter ego, “Pancho Claus,” distributes thousands of toys annually to mostly Latino kids in the Houston area.\n\nReyes, who saw similar damage during Hurricane Harvey in 2017 when he lived elsewhere in Houston, said the floodwaters moved in even after the rain stopped. He said his son didn't trust the tall tree would stay upright and moved the family cars just before it fell into the street where the vehicles had been, somehow avoiding pulling multiple power lines down along the way.\n\nReyes said his son and neighbors were out Monday morning cutting through the tree to clear the way so vehicles could pass. In the meantime, they’re hoping FEMA will cover some of the damage.\n\n“Luckily, everyone is safe,” he said.\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nLiving next to a seawall, 'our whole building was shaking'\n\nTom Sheppard, 59, was jolted awake at 3:30 Monday morning by the storm raging through Galveston. \"It was a lot worse than we thought,\" he said, pointing out he lives next to the seawall. \"Our whole building was shaking.\"\n\nThe winds ripped down the wrought iron fence around his gated community, bringing down gutters and part of a wall.\n\nVenturing out after the storm passed, Sheppard saw the destruction was widespread. \"All the palm trees are snapped in half,\" he said. \"All the power poles are down. It's flooded. It got pretty bad.\"\n\nIn Galveston, a fish swimming on a flooded street\n\nJacob Jonathan, 21, awoke Monday to harsh winds banging on the window of his Galveston home, which he found \"a little stressful.''\n\nJonathan said his street was flooded with nearly a foot of water. At one point, he looked out his window to see a fish jump. Debris littered the neighborhood, and a fence was knocked down by the wind, he said.\n\nBy midday, Jonathan was still out of power, and said some friends in Galveston also were without water. \"We're mainly worried about our food going bad in the fridge,\" he said.\n\nJonathan spent the morning at home after the auto repair shop where he works delayed opening until the afternoon because of the storm, and he was waiting to see when conditions improved.\n\n\"Our house is lifted and we don't have any leaking,\" he added. \"The only nuisance right now is we had to pick up after our animals because they can't really walk in the water.\"\n\nHurricane Beryl 'has been rough'\n\nDonna Radin said she was startled awake by the “very strong howl” of wind rattling her home as rain came down in sheets early Monday morning.\n\nThe 58-year-old travel agent lives in Deer Park, a small city east of Houston. Around 5 a.m., as the conditions worsened, she heard a generator blow just down the block, and soon her home lost power.\n\nHuddled inside with her daughter, two granddaughters and five dogs, Radin said she's avoided the windows but can see lots of downed trees and the remnants of a fence that was ripped out of the ground and hurled several yards away.\n\n\"It's the most intense Cat 1 I've ever been through,\" said Radin, who has lived on the Texas Gulf Coast all her life. \"I told my husband, 'Our next investment will be remote-controlled hurricane shutters,' because this has been rough.\"\n\nMore:Hurricane Beryl tracker: Storm makes landfall in Texas, see spaghetti models, path\n\nBeryl causes over 1,000 flight cancellations in Houston\n\nMore than 1,000 flights across airports in Houston were canceled Monday as Beryl bore down on the city.\n\nAt George Bush Intercontinental Airport, over 1,000 arriving and departing flights were canceled, according to FightAware.

For the latest news on the storm, view our story for Friday, Aug. 9.\n\nThough no longer a tropical storm, now-Tropical Depression Debby was still dropping copious amounts of rain on eastern states Thursday evening as the Northeast braces for the system's arrival.\n\nDebby, still a tropical storm at the time, made its second U.S. landfall around 2 a.m. near Bulls Bay, South Carolina, just northeast of Charleston, according to the National Hurricane Center. In a matter of hours, over half a foot of rain had fallen in parts of central North Carolina, causing \"life-threatening flash flooding\" as waterways crested, turning roads into rivers.\n\nDebby is expected to dump 4 to 8 inches of rain − some areas could get up to 15 inches − across parts of the Carolinas and Virginia on Thursday and Friday, bringing \"considerable to locally catastrophic flash flooding impacts,\" the weather service's Storm Prediction Center said. All told, rain totals in some parts of South Carolina could exceed 2 feet.\n\nCaught in Hurricane Debby's winds: A migrating bird named Suwannee 22 ended up where she started\n\nDebby's sustained winds were down to 30 mph by 11 p.m. ET. In the days ahead, the storm is forecast to weaken as it picks up speed and moves north, bringing up to 6 inches of rain from Maryland to Vermont. Flood watches throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions were set to activate Thursday evening and last through Friday night.\n\nAcross Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, Debby drenched communities in over a foot of rain, breaking several decades-old records. Flash flooding triggered water rescues, overtook roads, and breached several dams as winds knocked over trees and tangled power lines. Officials have said at least seven people have died as a result of the storm.\n\nDebby tracker map:Where is Tropical Storm Debby? Maps track path, flooding, rain, where it already hit\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Millions of people from southeast Georgia up through the Carolinas and western New York were under flood advisories, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of North Carolina and Virginia were under tornado watches.\n\n∎ Virginia's Department of Emergency Management warned residents to stay aware of possible tornadoes Thursday and Friday. \"Tropical Storm Debby has the potential to create tornadoes, with the threat potentially lasting through the overnight hours,\" the post said.\n\n∎ Cleanup crews have cleared over 245 miles of road and eight acres of debris across Florida, according to the state's Division of Emergency Management. Emergency responders in high-water vehicles and on foot rescued at least 120 people trapped by floodwaters.\n\nDeath toll rises to at least 7 after tornado kills man in North Carolina\n\nA man in Wilson County, North Carolina, was found dead in his home after a tornado touched down in the area, bringing Debby's death toll to at least seven.\n\nStephen Mann, director of communication for Wilson County, told USA TODAY on Thursday that a twister tore through the outskirts of Lucama, a town 35 miles southeast of Raleigh, sometime before 3 a.m. A middle school, a church and four homes sustained structural damage. Inside one of the homes, a search and rescue team discovered the body of an adult male, Mann said.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper met with local officials at Springfield Middle School to assess the damage and posted photos to social media Thursday. They showed piles of debris outside a heavily damaged building, with about half of the roof missing as insulation foam spilled out, and a collapsed wall that exposed what appeared to be the remnants of a classroom.\n\nOfficials have tied Debby to at least six other deaths, five in Florida and one in Georgia. In the southern Georgia city of Moultrie, a tree fell onto a home, killing a 19-year-old, Gov. Brian Kemp said Tuesday. In Florida, two adults and a child were killed in fatal vehicle accidents; also, a 13-year-old boy died after a fallen tree landed on a mobile home; and officials on Tuesday found the body of a boater who had been missing near the city of Gulfport.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, officials confirmed a tornado touched down in North Carolina's Sampson County, damaging two homes, according to weather service reports. A suspected tornado was also reported in Pender County. Across South Carolina and Florida, Debby spawned eight tornadoes earlier this week.\n\nAt historic North Carolina inn, 'it's literally raining inside'\n\nThursday quickly became a tough day at work for hotel manager Elise Tyler, when the ceiling of the Colonial Inn in Hillsborough, North Carolina, began to leak rainwater and drain systems couldn’t keep up with the heavy downpour.\n\n“We are on the verge of flooded,” said Tyler, 37. “Several areas of the inn are dripping and it’s literally raining inside.”\n\nThe 200-year-old building had not lost power, but the lights were flickering, Tyler said. Nearby roads were closed because of flooding and some staff who lost power at their homes took advantage of empty hotel rooms to shower and charge their phones, she said.\n\nThe Colonial is located in a historic block of Hillsborough, close to the site of a Revolutionary War battle, and the building was pillaged by Union troops, according to the hotel's website.\n\nKnown for its restaurant’s weekend brunch, the inn got a lot of customers Wednesday, Tyler said, likely because people were anticipating hunkering down Thursday – when only “one brave soul” came in for lunch.\n\nForecasters eye another system in the Atlantic\n\nJust as Debby continues to pound the East Coast, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are also keeping an eye on a developing system near the Caribbean islands.\n\n\"An area of low pressure could form in the central or western tropical Atlantic Ocean early next week,\" the center said in an online forecast released Thursday morning. \"Some development of this system is possible while it approaches the Lesser Antilles during the early to middle part of next week and moves generally west-northwestward toward the Greater Antilles thereafter.\"\n\nThe system has a 30% chance of becoming a tropical depression or named storm within the next week. The next name on the 2024 storm list is Ernesto. It's far too soon to determine whether the system will impact any land areas, including the U.S.\n\n– Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nDebby's latest rainfall totals\n\nRainfall reports show more than a dozen locations in the Southeast where Debby has dropped at least a foot of rain since Saturday, causing widespread flooding from Florida to North Carolina. Below are some preliminary selected rain totals from the National Weather Service.\n\nFlorida:\n\nLake City: 19.67 inches\n\nParrish: 18.86 inches\n\nLakewood Ranch: 18.34 inches\n\nSarasota: 17.78 inches\n\nEllenton: 14.60 inches\n\nSouth Carolina:\n\nSummerville: 18.25 inches\n\nMount Pleasant: 17.70 inches\n\nGreen Pond: 17.43 inches\n\nLoris: 15.89 inches\n\nCharleston Airport: 10.35 inches\n\nGeorgia:\n\nOliver: 14.82 inches\n\nRincon: 13.87 inches\n\nBelville: 13.59 inches\n\nRocky Ford: 11.63 inches\n\nSavannah Airport: 10.10 inches\n\nNorth Carolina:\n\nKings Grant: 15.25 inches\n\nShallotte: 13.05 inches\n\nElizabethtown: 10.71 inches\n\nHolden Beach: 10.28 inches\n\nWilmington Airport: 8.57 inches\n\nPower outages in NC down to 60,000\n\nMore than 25,000 homes and businesses in North Carolina were without power Thursday night, a major improvement from 60,000 customers just a few hours earlier as crews repaired some of the damage caused by Debby. Duke Energy, the state's largest power provider, said Wednesday it had 7,500 linemen and other employees staged across the Carolinas to respond to outages.\n\nBlackouts also diminished in Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia, which were all under 2,500 outages by 10 p.m. E.T.\n\nBut as the storm headed north, other states such as Virginia − with 20,000 outages − were feeling its effects. In addition, more than 232,000 homes and businesses were out of power in Ohio, the result of Tuesday's storms impacted by Debby.\n\nWhere is Debby?\n\nDebby gained speed but lost intensity as it moved farther inland Thursday, hours after making its second U.S. landfall, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAccording to an 11 p.m. update, the storm was moving north-northeast at 26 mph. Debby was located 80 miles north-northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina, and 90 miles west-northwest of Raleigh, North Carolina, with sustained winds of 30 mph, according to the center.\n\nNorth Carolina resident prepared campground for Debby\n\nIn Raeford, North Carolina, Michelle Morville said her property got a few inches of rain overnight but hasn’t flooded or lost power. “It poured and is still raining here with more to come,” Morville said Thursday morning.\n\nHer campground, Idlewild Farm Stays, is terraced to allow for erosion control so there’s no standing water, Morville said. Rain flows properly down a main driveway during storms, and after the current downpour passes, Morville said she will use a land plane on the road to clear any remaining moisture.\n\nMany people who come to the farm are visiting family members serving in the military on nearby Fort Liberty, formerly Fort Bragg, Morville said. This week, she is offering discounted rates to anyone needing to move their camper or RV out of a flood zone.\n\n“Most flooding issues I believe come from a lack of regard for Mother Nature and not planning accordingly to work with her,” Morville said.\n\nReopening begins after flooding cuts off North Carolina town\n\nAuthorities in Bladenboro, North Carolina, began reopening several main roads after the town was completely cut off by floodwaters overnight.\n\n\"Water has receded in some areas. Crews will begin reopening up roads here shortly,\" said a statement on the county's Facebook page. Much of the downtown was still closed as standing water remained several inches deep in some areas.\n\nJust before midnight, as Debby approached the South Carolina coast, a statement on Bladenboro's Facebook page announced, \"Downtown is underwater. We have several street closures out. Please stay off the roads!\" Within an hour, the local fire department said, \"Due to flooded roadways all roads into Bladenboro are closed.\"\n\nAs the heavy rains and tornado threat shifted away from the area toward more northern parts of North Carolina and Virginia, the town has begun to assess the damage and reopen main roads. \"Many secondary roads have not been checked, use caution,\" the fire department warned early Thursday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/02/hurricane-helene-live-updates-biden-visit/75478782007/", "title": "'Nation has your back,' Biden says to Hurricane Helene victims ...", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Hurricane Helene's aftermath for Wednesday, Oct. 2. For the latest news, view our live updates file for Thursday, Oct. 3.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − President Joe Biden traveled to the Carolinas on a Wednesday tour to survey devastation from Hurricane Helene as residents across much of the Southeast press on with the arduous task of rebuilding their shattered communities, homes and lives.\n\nBiden visited Greenville, South Carolina, and later got an aerial view of the extensive damage in Asheville, North Carolina. Vice President Kamala Harris also made a trip to a highly impacted state, meeting with local officials and first responders in Augusta, Georgia.\n\n\"I'm here to say the United States – the nation – has your back,'' Biden said at an emergency command center in Raleigh alongside North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. \"We're not leaving until you're back on your feet completely.\"\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Biden had approved the deployment of up to 1,000 active-duty U.S. soldiers to reinforce North Carolina National Guard members assisting recovery efforts in the state.\n\nThe death toll across the Southeast was 181 as of 10 p.m. ET Wednesday, based on state and local reports. Local authorities said they expect the total to rise. Buncombe County, home to Asheville, has reported 57 deaths.\n\nWater authorities warned that potable running water could be weeks away in some areas. Duke Energy said its round-the-clock power-restoration efforts had resolved more than 1.6 million customer outages in the Carolinas. Still, almost 900,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the two states Wednesday; another 450,000 were dark in Florida, Georgia, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nHurricane Helene crashed ashore along Florida's Big Bend as a Category 4 monster late Thursday. Its winds died down after landfall, but the unrelenting rains overwhelmed a wide swath of the already-saturated Southeast. Flash flooding from creeks and rivers destroyed homes and businesses, collapsed roads and ripped victims from their families.\n\nAs the waters receded, the damage to infrastructure grew more apparent.\n\n\"We are starting to see some of this damage,\" Duke Energy spokesman Bill Norton wrote on social media. \"We had entire substations that were under water.\"\n\nStorm tracker:Hurricane Kirk is strengthening and forecast to grow larger, NHC says\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the regional cleanup would be a \"multibillion-dollar undertaking\" and take years to complete.\n\n∎ USA TODAY published a map of resources in the Asheville area that shows where residents can find shelter, water, food and more. The tool is available here.\n\nHarris visits Georgia, will also travel to NC\n\nHarris visited the Augusta Emergency Operations Center in Georgia, where she thanked officials and emergency personnel for their work in the state's recovery from the impacts of Hurricane Helene. She also consoled residents of a neighborhood that had toppled trees and debris on the road.\n\n\"It is particularly devastating in terms of the loss of life that this community has experienced, the loss of normalcy and the loss of critical resources,\" said Harris, who is cutting short her campaign schedule as the Democratic presidential nominee to travel to some of the heavily affected states.\n\nHarris spoke Tuesday with Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer and plans to visit North Carolina in the coming days to view the damage, provide updates on federal response and meet with members of affected communities, the White House said.\n\n\"I've been reading and hearing about the work you've been doing over the last few days,'' Harris told officials in Augusta, \"and I think it really does represent some of the best of what we each know can be done, especially when we coordinate around local, state, federal resources to meet the needs of people who must be seen, who must be heard.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nTennessee company draws probe after workers die in flood\n\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation opened an inquiry into a plastics manufacturer in Erwin where several workers were swept away by floodwaters from Helene, the Knoxville News Sentinel has learned.\n\nTwo women in the group died, an immigrant advocacy group for workers' families said. At least three people are missing. Employees of Impact Plastics have alleged management didn’t allow workers to leave the factory even as warnings were issued and floodwaters from the Nolichucky River began to swamp the building. The company denies the claim.\n\nThe bureau confirmed to The News Sentinel – known as Knox News, part of the USA TODAY Network − that District Attorney Steve Finney requested an investigation involving the company but provided no details.

In addition, more than 1.1 million customers were still without power in the Carolinas and Georgia as of 6 p.m. ET, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nThe municipal water supply system in Asheville, which serves more than 150,000 residents, was so badly damaged by the storm that Assistant City Manager Ben Woody said it would take weeks before it can pump out water. For now, those who are getting water are advised to boil it. .\n\nWater distribution sites have been set up at several locations in ravaged Buncombe County, home to Asheville, with supplies provided in a combined effort by local, state and federal officials. But the lack of running water presents a major obstacle to returning to any semblance of normalcy, such as reopening schools.\n\n\"The biggest concern for getting students back to school is water,\" Asheville City Schools Superintendent Maggie Fehrman said at a news conference Wednesday. \"Without water, we just simply cannot bring students back or staff back into our building.\"\n\nCDC offers tips for avoiding post-hurricane dangers\n\nSome of the less-obvious dangers from a hurricane can linger long after the winds have died down. They include mold and risk of infection from stagnant floodwater, which can have bacteria from overflowing sewage and agricultural and industrial waste, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Here are the CDC's tips for addressing hazards left behind by large storms:\n\nIf you do come in contact with floodwater: Wash the area with soap and clean water as soon as possible. If soap and water aren't available, use alcohol-based wipes or sanitizer. Take care of wounds and seek medical attention if needed. Wash clothes contaminated with flood or sewage water in hot water and detergent before wearing them again.\n\nWash the area with soap and clean water as soon as possible. If soap and water aren't available, use alcohol-based wipes or sanitizer. Take care of wounds and seek medical attention if needed. Wash clothes contaminated with flood or sewage water in hot water and detergent before wearing them again. If you can’t disinfect: Remove and discard items such as mattresses, carpets, rugs, baby toys and most paper products. The same goes for drywall and insulation.\n\nRemove and discard items such as mattresses, carpets, rugs, baby toys and most paper products. The same goes for drywall and insulation. Water and food: Tap water may not be safe, the CDC said. With water you suspect is contaminated, do not use it to wash dishes, brush your teeth, prepare food (including baby formula), wash your hands or make ice. Instead, use bottled, boiled or treated water. Throw away food that may have come in contact with flood or storm water.\n\nTap water may not be safe, the CDC said.

Instead, use bottled, boiled or treated water. Throw away food that may have come in contact with flood or storm water. Power outages: When possible, use battery-powered flashlights or lanterns instead of candles, gas lanterns or torches to reduce fire risk. Poisoning deaths from exposure to carbon monoxide tend to increase after natural disasters like hurricanes, and the CDC said they're already on the rise after Helene. Never use a generator, pressure washer or any gas-powered engine inside a home or garage, or less than 20 feet from a door, window or vent. Such equipment emits carbon monoxide, which is odorless and colorless and can be fatal.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nHow to signal you're OK from disaster area\n\nRelatives and friends of those in areas impacted by natural disasters often become anguished when they can't confirm whether their loved ones in those locations are safe.\n\nHurricane Helene disrupted power and communications in large swaths of the Southeast, and many communities are still disconnected from the outside world. In some places where internet access is back, power is still out, preventing residents from charging their phones and computers.\n\nBut for people in affected areas with even fleeting cellular or WiFi connections, there are ways to signal they're all right, whether it's by indicating so through their voicemail greeting or on Facebook, Instagram or X postings.\n\nRead more here\n\nBiden sending troops to aid recovery in North Carolina\n\nThe soldiers Biden approved being deployed to North Carolina have the manpower and logistical capabilities to \"get this vital job done, and fast,\" the president said in a statement.\n\n\"These soldiers will speed up the delivery of life-saving supplies of food, water and medicine to isolated communities in North Carolina,\" Biden said.\n\nThe North Carolina Air National Guard said Wednesday that it had delivered over 100,000 pounds of food, water and other critical supplies for Helene victims, part of a coordinated relief effort with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Over 760 North Carolina Guard soldiers and airmen have been assisting with hurricane relief efforts by air and ground, conducting search and rescue missions, delivering supplies and clearing roads.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nNo rest for weary: October historically active for hurricanes\n\nHelene's deadly and devastating rampage across the Southeast last week has eliminated any hope of a quiet hurricane season for the U.S. There is still plenty of the season left − it runs through November − and \"October is historically an active month, particularly in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and off the U.S. Southeast coast,\" said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane research scientist at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School. It doesn't take a strong hurricane to cause a lot of damage, McNoldy said.\n\n\"A slow-moving disorganized disturbance that maybe doesn't quite become a tropical storm can unleash feet of rain over an area and create terrible flash flooding,\" he said.

For the latest on the storm, see our story for Saturday, Sept. 28.\n\nST. MARKS, Fla. – Helene weakened to a post-tropical cyclone as it swept through the Southeast on Friday but the storm still wielded enough power to inflict historic flooding across multiple states, causing 39 deaths and millions of power outages.\n\nHelene made landfall at about 11:10 p.m. ET Thursday near Perry, Florida, with 140-mph winds, making it the first known Category 4 storm to hit Florida’s Big Bend region since records began in 1851. Overturned boats, flattened homes and a vista of floodwater several-feet-deep were revealed at dawn across the storm-weary region.\n\nIn Steinhatchee, a coastal town just miles from where Helene made landfall, John Kujawski drove a golf cart with his wife, Jamie Lee, over debris and around downed trees, horrified at the damage. The town of some 500 people took on 9.63 feet of storm surge, a record.\n\n“This is overwhelming,” Lee said. “I don’t think it’s sunk in.”\n\nMoody's Analytics estimated the storm will cost $15 to 26 billion in property damage, much of it spanning across Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nFor several hours, the storm maintained hurricane strength as it pushed inland across northern Florida and into Georgia. By 5 p.m. ET, the weather service said Helene had weakened to a post-tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 35 mph. The storm crossed into Kentucky and was about 50 miles south-southeast of Louisville.\n\nFlash flood emergencies and warnings were active Friday night in Tennessee, Virginia, Ohio and the Carolinas. The weather service urged residents in danger zones to stay off the roads and seek higher road, warning that life-threatening flash floods could continue in some areas until Saturday morning.\n\nHundreds of water rescues were underway across the Southeast amid the torrential rain and continued coastal flooding in western Florida. Meanwhile, more than 4 million utility customers were without power from Florida to Virginia.\n\nTrack the storm:Map Helene's forecast path through Georgia\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters 115 structures in the southern Georgia city of Valdosta had been heavily damaged by Helene's high winds, and crews were responding to rescue people trapped inside.\n\n∎ Widespread flooding and a mudslide shut down a long stretch of Interstate 40 Friday afternoon, extending between Tennessee and North Carolina.\n\n∎ Helene is tied as the 14th most powerful hurricane to hit anywhere in the U.S. since records have been kept and the seventh most powerful to slam into Florida, according to National Hurricane Center data.\n\n∎ Federal Emergency Management Agency teams were on the ground in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas Friday. President Joe Biden had approved emergency declarations for all five states ahead of Helene's landfall in anticipation of the storm's sprawling impact.\n\n∎ More than 1,500 U.S. flights were canceled, and 28,500 were delayed by late Friday, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking website.\n\nHelene wrecks dozens of homes in Florida beach town\n\nHelene wrecked dozens of homes across Horseshoe Beach, a tiny beach town and fishing destination in Florida's Big Bend that has been hit by several hurricanes in recent years.\n\nSome houses were shoved off their concrete footings, while others had their roofs flayed off. The wind and water also tumbled docks onto land, tore down chain-link fences and snapped telephone poles.\n\nBill and Debbie Dotson erected a tent beneath their home Friday where they planned to camp after the storm ripped their staircases away, blocking access to the otherwise undamaged house roughly 20 feet off the ground. Helene was their fourth hurricane since moving to the coastal town in 2021.\n\n“We sure are grateful that it’s standing,” Debbie Dotson, 63, said.\n\nLike many homes in Horseshoe Beach, theirs is built atop concrete footings to keep them out of the flood waters. Idalia destroyed about 40 houses, and the Dotsons said they thought this storm caused more damage.\n\nBill Dotson, 67, said he gauged the floodwaters at around 15 feet, based on the damage to the top of his concrete pilings. Last year, Idalia destroyed one staircase and damaged the other. A local contractor had only recently finished rebuilding both sets for $15,000.\n\n“We came out here and saw this beauty and wanted to go fishing in our retirement,” Debbie Dotson said. “We had the discussion about hurricanes, but you never imagine something like this. You just don’t.”\n\n– Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY\n\nNorth Carolina city under curfew amid widespread power outages\n\nThe western North Carolina city of Asheville that largely remained in the dark late Friday was under nightly curfews for the next two days in an effort to prevent residents from accidentally wandering into rising waters, police announced.\n\n“We are unequivocally in the most significant natural disaster of our lifetime here in Buncombe County, and maybe in history,” said Buncombe County Assistant Emergency Services Director Ryan Cole.\n\nThe French Broad River, which flows more than 200 miles from North Carolina to Tennessee, broke previous historic records Friday. The river reached nearly 25 feet in the late afternoon, breaking the July 16, 1916, record of 23.1 feet, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.\n\nNearly 70% of Buncombe County, including Asheville, was out of power as of 10 p.m. ET, according to USA TODAY's power outage tracker. There have been more than 130 water rescues in Buncombe County, and nearly 200 firefighters were actively responding to calls just in Asheville, a city of roughly 95,000 people.\n\n– Contributing: Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nDam failure in Tennessee prompting emergency evacuations was false alarm\n\nA reported \"catastrophic\" dam failure that triggered an emergency evacuation for the entire downtown area of Newport, Tennessee, Friday afternoon was a false alarm, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said.\n\nCocke County officials urged all residents to flee the area around 3 p.m. ET Friday after reports that Walters Dam had failed. State emergency management officials said around 4:40 p.m. that Duke Energy, which owns and operates the dam, informed them it was still standing.\n\n\"There is no longer a risk of an imminent dam failure for Walters Dam on the Pigeon River,\" the National Weather Service office in Morristown confirmed on X at 4:45 p.m. \"Major flooding continues, however. Continue to heed evacuation orders from local emergency management and law enforcement. Do not drive into flooded or closed roads.\"\n\nThe dam scare comes as nearby rivers continue to rise from the effects of Helene. The Pigeon River at Newport rose to nearly three times its flood stage Friday afternoon, and it's expected to reach 23 feet before receding this evening.\n\n– Tyler Whetstone and Allison Kiehl, the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\n'We have nothing': Florida home washed away by Helene\n\nFrom the posts she saw on Facebook about her Steinhatchee neighborhood, Lynn Padgett knew the damage might be dire at the house she’s called home for 41 of her 48 years.\n\nShe just didn’t expect it would not be where she had left it Thursday.\n\nThe house was located in a riverside neighborhood alongside other homes. Helene's surge of water pushed it off its foundation and relocated it to the edge of a wooded area just down the way.\n\n\"This is the fourth time the river has flooded (the house) and the first time it’s washed my house away,” she said, chuckling, as she sat in her car with five Dachshunds and a cat. Another cat, Muffin, had climbed up a tree in fright.\n\nShe’s not laughing because it’s funny; not only does the Jiffy Food stop manager’s home not have flood insurance, but it’s not insured for wind either.\n\nThe Jiffy store she works at in Steinhatchee is flooded out, too, she said. She was waiting in her car, hoping the water would go down enough so she could get to her house where she lived with her husband, 64; her father, 67, who uses a wheelchair; and her 18-year-old son.\n\n“Laugh, cry, I don’t know what to do,” she said. “We have nothing.”\n\n-Anne Geggis, Palm Beach Post\n\nDozens rescued from roof of hospital 'engulfed' by floodwater\n\nMore than 50 patients and staff were rescued after being stranded on a hospital rooftop as floodwaters quickly rose at Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin, Tennessee, on Friday afternoon, Sen. Bill Hagerty said.\n\n\"Everyone has been rescued safely from the roof of Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin,\" he said. \"More trouble on the horizon for East Tennessee communities. Please stay safe and thank you for your prayers!\"\n\nFloodwaters from the rapidly rising Nolichucky River and high winds prevented ambulances, rescue boats and even helicopters from reaching the hospital earlier, according to a statement from Ballad Health.\n\n\"The hospital has been engulfed by extremely dangerous and rapidly moving water. The situation at the hospital is very dangerous,\" the statement said.\n\nBallad Health said that at about 12:30 p.m., 54 people were on the roof and seven were in rescue boats. Water has also intruded into the hospital, the statement said. The rescue was complete by about 4:15 p.m., according to Hagerty's post.\n\nVirginia State Police said its aviation units were helping with the rescues and posted a photo on social media showing the building surrounded by high floodwaters.\n\nBig Bend resident maintains resolve to build back up after Helene\n\nHer riverside home is destroyed, eight of the 24 riverside rental units she owns were flooded, and the electrical system powering the riverside marina building may have been fritzed.\n\nAnd still, Danielle Norwood, 59, owner of the Sea Hag Marina that fronts the Steinhatchee River, was smiling somehow as she pointed to a concrete floor that had crumbled.\n\n“I think I’m stunned at this point, I can’t release a lot of emotions,” she said. And then she paused.\n\n“We’ll build back,\" she said. \"We’re those kind of people.”\n\nThe build-back is familiar territory for Norwood. Last year's Hurricane Idalia destroyed $1 million worth of docks and flooding shorted out the building's electrical system. To avoid a repeat, Norwood moved the electrical system to a second floor in the building, but Helene's nearly 10-foot storm surge appears to have shorted it again.\n\nOn the floor below, a wooden bar was still standing; however, the TVs above it had a line across the screen showing how far the water had risen.\n\nThe good news for Norwood is that Helene's fury spared the feral cats who prowl the marina grounds — and the docks that were so badly torn up by Idalia.\n\nRead the full story here:In Florida's Big Bend, officials start rescues, assessing damage post-Hurricane Helene\n\n– Anne Geggis, Palm Beach Post\n\nOver 4 million homes and businesses across the eastern U.S. were in the dark Friday night as Helene pummeled the region with powerful winds and heavy rain.\n\nBelow are the outage totals from Florida to Virginia as of 10 p.m., according to the USA TODAY power outage tracker.\n\nSouth Carolina: 1,031,187\n\nGeorgia: 898,176\n\nFlorida: 527,152\n\nNorth Carolina: 748,112\n\nVirginia: 204,561\n\nKentucky: 158,164\n\nTennessee: 66,032\n\nWest Virginia: 71,969\n\nFlorida power outage map:Track widespread outages from Helene in the state\n\nFlorida sheriff says coastal area looks like 'a war zone' in Helene's wake\n\nOfficials in Florida's Pinellas County – hundreds of miles from where Helene came ashore – painted a grim picture when describing the storm's impact on its coast.\n\n“I would just describe it, having spent the last few hours out there, as a war zone,” said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri at a news conference Friday morning.\n\nHe said roads were impassable and that debris and damage were widespread: \"It’s going to take awhile before that area gets back to any sense of functionality.”\n\nAlong the Pinellas County coast, storm surge overnight reached over 8 feet – ”something we’ve never seen before” said Cathie Perkins, director of the county's emergency management, at a news conference Friday.\n\nDeath toll rises as Helene batters Southeast\n\nAt least 39 people have died as Helene unleashed dangerous weather conditions across multiple states in the Southeast, according to authorities and media reports. Officials have said they expect the death toll to keep rising as they go door-to-door in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nIn Florida, at least seven deaths have been attributed to the storm. In Pinellas County, which encompasses Clearwater and St. Petersburg, five people suffered storm-related deaths, said Cathie Perkins, director of emergency management, at a news conference Friday.\n\nEarlier Friday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters a person died in Dixie County, along the Big Bend coast, after a tree fell on a home. On Thursday night, a person was killed in a storm-related traffic fatality in Ybor City in Tampa, the governor said.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp said at a news conference Friday that 11 people were killed during the storm, including a first responder.\n\n\"One of our finest lost his life trying to save others,\" Kemp said.\n\nThe South Carolina Department of Public Safety has confirmed 19 storm-related fatalities across six counties, Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for the governor's office, told USA TODAY Friday evening.\n\nOf those, two people were killed by trees that had fallen on their homes, the Anderson County Sheriff's Office and coroner's office told local media outlets. Two firefighters in Saluda County were also killed, Gov. Henry McMaster said at a news conference. Two people died in Newberry County, Sheriff James Lee Foster said in an email. Four others died in Aiken County, Coroner Darryl Ables told USA TODAY by phone.\n\nIn North Carolina, a 4-year-old was killed and others were injured in a wreck on Thursday that occurred as Helene's outer bands were slamming the state. In Charlotte, North Carolina, a person died and another was hospitalized after a tree fell on a home just after 5 a.m. Friday, according to the Charlotte Fire Department.\n\n“This was a storm related death,” Battalion Chief John Lipcsak, a spokesperson for the fire department, told USA TODAY.\n\nPotential dam failure triggers evacuations in North Carolina\n\nIn Rutherford County, North Carolina, officials issued evacuation orders after major flooding in the area pushed a dam to the brink of failure.\n\nRutherford County Emergency Management on Friday morning announced that \"catastrophic\" flows of water along the Broad River began overtopping the Lake Lure Dam, located about 35 miles southeast of Asheville. As a result, a mandatory evacuation order was issued impacting areas downstream, including River Creek Campground and homes in the Green Hill, Cleghorn and Union communities.\n\n\"RESIDENTS BELOW THE LAKE LURE DAM NEED TO EVACUATE TO HIGHER GROUND IMMEDIATELY!!\" county emergency officials warned on Facebook. \"DAM FAILURE IMMINIENT!! EVACUATE TO HIGHER GROUND IMMEDIATELY!!\"\n\nPower outages, road closures abound in North Carolina, Georgia\n\nTowns across the Carolinas and north-central Georgia were battered through Friday morning as Helene swept over the region, leaving entire parts of Atlanta underwater and triggering evacuation warnings.\n\n“All the apps on my phone kept screaming that there were flash flood warnings all night,” said Paul Thatcher, 38, owner of Franklin Terrace Bed and Breakfast in Franklin, North Carolina, about 70 miles southwest of Asheville.\n\nA nearby mountain highway was ordered closed Friday because the edge of the road bank eroded away, causing the edge of the asphalt to break away, sliding down the valley, officials in Macon County, North Carolina, said on Facebook.\n\nIn Elberton, Georgia, near the state’s border with South Carolina, the Samuel Elbert Hotel lost power overnight and regained it around 10 a.m. Friday, front desk associate Deborah Morrison told USA TODAY.\n\nOn her way to work Friday morning, Morrison said she saw four homes damaged by fallen trees. One road in town was completely washed out around 6 a.m., and other roads were closed because of downed power lines or trees, she said. Traffic on some roads had to alternate using a single lane in either direction, leading to lines of cars, Morrison said.\n\n“Everybody’s weathered it pretty fair, there’s no panicking going on,” Morrison, 63, said.\n\nHurricanes can produce tornadoes for days\n\nAs Helene tore through the Southeast on Friday, tornadoes were a growing concern.\n\nWhile tornadoes don’t typically get the same attention as hurricanes' ferocious winds or perilous storm surge, twisters are always one of the clear and present dangers as storms make landfall and trek inland.\n\n\"Hurricanes can produce tornadoes for two or three days after they move inland,\" said Roger Edwards, a lead forecaster at the Storm Prediction Center, who specializes in tornadoes. The highest risk warning the center has ever issued for a tornado situation related to a hurricane was for the third day after Hurricane Ivan made landfall in Alabama in September 2004. Forecasters were confident there would be a lot of super cells in Virginia, Maryland and even in the southern Pennsylvania area.\n\nNOAA posted a tornado watch at 8:05 a.m. for portions of North Carolina, Eastern South Carolina, Southern Virginia and coastal areas nearby until at least 6 p.m. Friday. The tornado threat from Helene would shift northward, through an area about 110 miles on either side of a line from 40 miles west-southwest of Florence, South Carolina to 20 miles northeast of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, the agency said.\n\nSevere thunderstorms with hail were also possible, the agency said.\n\n– Dinah Pulver, USA TODAY\n\nCoastal Florida town slammed by hurricane – again\n\nBefore Friday morning’s light showed boats in yards, homes shredded and docks thrown from the river into roads, 22 members of the Florida State Guard Special Missions Unit were wading through the mud on the south side of Steinhatchee River’s banks, looking for anyone who needed rescuing.\n\nHurricane Helene struck Thursday evening, making landfall not far away in Perry. In Steinhatchee on Friday, what was dry land only hours earlier was submerged in 40 to 50 inches of water, said Jordon Bowen, commander of the unit, as he gazed down a road that now looked more like a river.\n\n“We have four different skiffs cruising through the neighborhood,” Bowen said, scanning the southeast side of Steinhatchee. “We’re searching all the area to make sure no one’s out there.”\n\nSo far, no one needed help. The search effort also included the National Guard, the Coast Guard, Taylor County sheriffs and Florida Urban Search and Rescue Task Force 2. However, the overall situation looks bleak, according to Bowen.\n\n“It’s destroyed,” Bowen said, indicating an area that’s about the size of 27 football fields. “Not accessible, debris, lots of hazards, downed power lines, houses cut in half.\"\n\n– Anne Geggis, Palm Beach Post\n\nPerry resident: 'I've had worse'\n\nOutside Perry, Florida, longtime resident Donna Parker, 80, watched as her grandson cut up a toppled palm tree with a chainsaw.\n\nParker has lived in her house since 1985 and has never left for a hurricane, the names of which she can still rattle off.\n\n\"The wind, it was bad. But I’ve had worse. We’ve really had worse. I’ve had it where my whole front yard was a lake,” she said.\n\n“A lot of prayers, I tell you, when the wind come up. But the good Lord looked after us.”\n\nIs there another hurricane brewing after Helene?\n\nWhile Helene was smashing into Florida, a new hurricane was coming to life in the Atlantic. Hurricane Isaac formed Friday morning far out in the ocean, almost 1,000 miles from Bermuda, the hurricane center said.\n\nAlthough the hurricane is moving east across the open Atlantic far from land, swells generated by Isaac are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and could spread into the Azores by this weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\nElsewhere, forecasters were also watching a weather disturbance in the central Atlantic Ocean, one that has a 90% chance of becoming a named storm within the next couple of days. \"A tropical depression or storm could form today while the system moves generally westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph,\" the National Hurricane Center said. \"The system is then forecast to slow down and turn north-northwestward by this weekend.\"\n\nIf it gets a name, it would be called Tropical Storm Joyce. As of Friday morning, the system poses no threat to any land areas.\n\nFinally, ominously, forecasters were also turning their attention back to the Caribbean Sea, where yet another system appears to be brewing in a similar location to where Hurricane Helene formed. \"Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for slow development while the system moves generally northwestward, potentially entering the Gulf of Mexico by the end of next week,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nThat system, if it strengthens to a storm, would be called Tropical Storm Kirk.\n\n– Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nMan and his dog rescued from sailboat, taken to hospital\n\nIn Sanibel, Florida, a U.S. Coast Guard Air Station crew rescued a man and his dog after his sailboat became disabled and started taking on water off the Florida coast.\n\nCrews found the disabled boat 25 miles off the island's coast after a mayday call came in Thursday.\n\nA photo posted on X shows the Coast Guard rescuing the pair near a disabled vessel as high waters swirl around them.\n\nOfficials said the boater and the dog were airlifted to Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers.\n\nThe storm came the closest to the barrier island around 3 p.m. Thursday, the National Weather Service reported.\n\n– Natalie Alund, USA TODAY\n\nIs Disney World closed for Hurricane Helene?\n\nTheme park-goers awaited official updates Friday morning announcing what parts of Walt Disney World may be closed.\n\nWalt Disney World in Orlando was open Thursday, but a few parts of the massive theme park were closed because of to Hurricane Helene, including the Typhoon Lagoon water park and miniature golf course. Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party was also canceled for Thursday, the Fort Myers News-Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nDisney World has closed less than a dozen times for hurricanes and national emergencies since its opening in 1971, according to the News-Press.\n\nTampa Bay residents say Helene inflicted 'complete devastation'\n\nIn Tampa Bay, residents said they saw vanished beaches, boats that ran into homes and businesses on fire.\n\n\"Complete devastation and loss here,\" Vikki Hudson, who lives in Largo about three miles from the coast, told USA TODAY on Friday. \"The beaches are gone. Everything is under water. Boats pilled on top of houses and yards.\"\n\nHudson said Gulf Boulevard, which runs the St. Petersburg coastline from Pass-A-Grille historic district north to Clearwater, was \"completely under water.\"\n\nHudson, who lives about 20 minutes from Treasure Island Beach where her two businesses are − The Island Girl Tiki Bar and The Island Girl Beach Rentals − said she has not been able to check on either because bridges are closed because of widespread flooding.\n\n\"We don’t know anything yet, we cannot get to any of the barrier islands,\" Hudson said.\n\n– Natalie Alund, USA TODAY\n\n'The worst I’ve seen': Water rescues underway across Florida\n\nAuthorities in communities up and down the west coast of Florida said they were conducting water rescues on Friday as storm surge continued to inundate coastal areas.\n\nIn Pasco County, communications manager Tambrey Lane, said state and local agencies working together had rescued at least 135 people from rising waters as of 7:30 a.m. Friday, though she added that number might be as high as 200 or more.\n\nCrews were still out as of 8:30 a.m. and rescues were ongoing, Lane said, and some areas remained inaccessible to rescue crews. More than 54,000 homes were under a mandatory evacuation order west of Interstate 19 and about 4,000 more homes east of the highway.\n\n“It’s really bad,” said Michelle Welsh, an emergency communications officer with the county. “I think it’s the worst I’ve seen.”\n\nWelsh, who’s lived in the area since 2007, said her single-wide trailer had no power, but her home, fortunately, was intact.\n\n– Phaedra Trethan, USA TODAY\n\nFlorida city powers down sewage plant, asks residents not to flush or shower\n\nResidents in a section of St. Petersburg, a city of 261,000, were told not to flush toilets or take showers after the city shut off power at a sewer treatment plant.\n\nThe city said it made the “difficult decision” in order to “protect the plant from unprecedented storm surge,\" in a statement released Friday morning.\n\n“Impacted residents/businesses should not drain water, take showers, do laundry or flush toilets,” the city said. “Draining water will cause sewage to back up into homes/businesses.”\n\nMorning light reveals damage in the wake of Helene\n\nDawn broke Friday morning over a battered and sudden Big Bend region of Florida after hurricane Helene roared ashore overnight.\n\nThe sharp smell of pine filled the air, an artifact of the hundreds of snapped trees lining roads between St. Marks and Perry. Emergency workers flooding into the area, wove around downed trees along U.S Highway 98 as sheriff deputies, limited access, and patrolled for possible looting.\n\nIn the tiny community of St. Marks, about 20 miles south of Tallahassee, floodwaters had reached the front of the U.S Post Office building, about 3/10 of a mile from the St. Marks River, which flows into the Gulf a few miles downstream.Some residents had planned to ride out the storm in their homes or aboard fishing boats tied up at the marina. They could not be immediately reached Friday morning, although cellphone service in the area was working.\n\nRescues ongoing in Atlanta as Helene drenches Southeast\n\nAuthorities in the Atlanta metro area conducted rescues early Friday as Helene raced through the state, drenching a vast swath of the Southeast in multiple inches of rain.\n\nAbout 25 people were rescued from a flooded apartment complex north of downtown Atlanta, multiple outlets reported, citing the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department.\n\nNearby Peachtree Creek entered major flood stage, reaching a height of more than 23 feet. Flood watches and warnings were active across the state of Georgia, where all counties are under a state of emergency declared by Gov. Brian Kemp.\n\nAbout 4-6 inches of rain have fallen throughout north-central Georgia, including Atlanta and its surrounding counties, according to the weather service in Peachtree City, south of Atlanta. Forecasters say an additional 2 inches could fall throughout the morning hours.\n\nHundreds took to shelters in Tallahassee ahead of Helene\n\nAmber Handlin sat in front of her Lab mix Duckey in a makeshift shelter at the Leon High School gym. They were among the 546 people and 60 pets were in Leon County shelters Thursday afternoon.\n\nHandlin lives in her car and has no friends or family nearby, and with several counties in the area under mandatory evacuation orders, she and the dog were both anxious as the storm approached.\n\nSydney Walter, Jacob Walsh and 1-year-old Graylan live near Florida State University's campus. \"We're like nope, we are not even going to try it,\" Walter said. \"I said, I have a baby so I'm not risking anything.”\n\nThe family, which is expecting a new member, decided to shelter at Leon's gym, citing its proximity to their home, the security it offers − and the most persuasive push, the mom said, was Gov. Ron DeSantis' encouragement.\n\n– Alaijah Brown, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nRead the full story:Public schools sheltering local evacuees from Helene\n\nNational weather radar\n\nFlorida boaters ride out Hurricane Helene\n\nAs Helene pummeled northwest Florida with over 100 mph winds and surges of water several feet high, Philip Tooke managed to punch out a terse but frantic message from his phone as he sat riding out the storm – not in his house, but on his boat.\n\n“Lost power,” he wrote from St. Mark’s, 30 miles south of Tallahassee and 20 miles away from where Hurricane Helene hit the mouth of the Aucilla River. But, he adds: \"Still floating.\"\n\nTooke, the 63-year-old owner of a local seafood market, and his brother remained aboard their fishing boats as Helene lashed the area.

This is another big blow near where both hurricanes Debby and Idalia made landfall the last two Augusts.\n\nThis storm, like the two other recent ones to hit Florida's Big Bend, again spared a head-on impact to state capital Tallahassee.\n\n➤ Weather alerts via text: Sign up to get updates about current storms and weather events by location\n\nHurricane Helene's landfall is about 30 miles northwest of where Hurricane Idalia made landfall in August 2023.\n\nHelene, after sending surge into the western Florida Gulf Coast en route to landfall, arrived with 140 mph winds about 10 miles west of Perry, Florida, at about 11:10 p.m. ET Thursday. It’s the first Category 4 storm to hit the Big Bend region since 1851, USA TODAY reported.\n\nHelene made its way through Georgia, damaging trees and snapping power poles, including those in Augusta.\n\nHelene weakened into a tropical storm with sustained winds at 45 mph at 11 a.m. ET Friday, the National Hurricane Center said. At that point, the storm was 30 miles southwest of Bryson City, North Carolina, and 105 miles north-northeast of Atlanta.\n\nResidents of Newport, Tennessee, were ordered to evacuate at 2:56 p.m. Friday after the Waterview Dam failed because of rising waters caused by Helene. Authorities in Cocke County were evacuating residents along the Pigeon and French Broad rivers, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported.\n\nHelene's heavy rain also is causing floods in North Carolina. Evacuations have been ordered with the expected failure of the Lake Lure Dam.\n\nHere is a USA TODAY graphical story of the path of Hurricane Helene.\n\n— Christopher Cann, Trevor Hughes, Thao Nguyen and Gabe Hauari\n\nWhere is the hurricane now? Status of Helene\n\nHelene is now Tropical Depression Helene and is having devastating effects with \"catastrophic flooding over portions of the Southeast and Southern Appalacians.\" The storm was centered over McCreary County, Kentucky in the National Hurricane Center's latest update, with damaging effects in East Tennessee.\n\nOfficials in Cocke County, Tennessee, urged everyone in downtown Newport to evacuate immediately Sept. 27 after the Waterville Dam \"suffered a catastrophic failure\" while the Pigeon and French Broad rivers were rising at rapid rates.\n\nEarlier, in Georgia trees and powerlines were smashed and the storm left thousands in Georgia with damage and without power.\n\nSheriff calls post-Helene Pinellas County 'a war zone'\n\nOfficials in Florida's Pinellas County – hundreds of miles from where Helene came ashore – painted a grim picture when describing the storm's impact on its coast.\n\n“I would just describe it, having spent the last few hours out there, as a war zone,” said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri at a news conference Friday morning.\n\nHe said roads were impassable and that debris and damage were widespread: \"It’s going to take awhile before that area gets back to any sense of functionality.”\n\nAlong the Pinellas County coast, storm surge overnight reached over 8 feet – ”something we’ve never seen before” said Cathie Perkins, director of the county's emergency management, at a news conference Friday.\n\n— Rick Neale\n\nTour Florida hurricane damage sites in video, photos from the ground and the air\n\nThe USA TODAY Network's Florida photojournalists captured the damage and aftermath caused by the record-breaking Category 4 Hurricane Helene across multiple cities along the coast and the state's capital.\n\nIn just a matter of hours, Helene brought torrential rains, storm surge and flooding and left behind wind-damaged and swamped, neighborhoods homes and businesses. Cleanup will likely take weeks.\n\nMore than 30% of affected residents get power back in Florida\n\nNumbers from various Florida power companies showed that 846,000 customers remained without electricity, down from pre-dawn numbers of 1.2 million. Pinellas' county's 190,000 customers remained by far the highest overall outage number before 3 p.m. Friday.\n\nHow to help victims of Hurricane Helene\n\nMoney donations are key in the early hours after a disaster because organizations can mobilize to supply what people need and get it at bulk prices. Here's a list of some charities to consider to help with Hurricane Helene relief, though you should always check them out:\n\nAll Hands and Hearts: This volunteer-based organization works alongside local residents to help by rebuilding schools, homes and other community infrastructure.

Ron DeSantis authorized activation of about 3,900 members of the Florida National Guard for Hurricane Helene response.\n\nThe guard is supporting 67 State Emergency Operations Center missions in 21 counties. Search and rescue missions to assist local authorities began in Taylor, Dixie, Levy, Pasco, Hernando and Pinellas counties.\n\nThere were 80 rescues and evacuations of people, and 55 more of animals, according to a release by the state.\n\nCrystal River, Florida sees storm flood inundation\n\nHelene helps cancel Hurricane Ian remembrance in Fort Myers Beach\n\nCiting the effects of Hurricane Helene, Fort Myers Beach town officials announced the Hurricane Ian remembrance ceremony for the storm’s two-year anniversary, initially set Saturday morning, has been canceled.\n\n“Due to the effects of Hurricane Helene and the cleanup our Town staff is currently undertaking, we regret to inform you that our Hurricane Ian Remembrance and Resiliency Ceremony has been canceled,” Nicole Berzin, spokesperson for Fort Myers Beach, wrote in a press release.\n\nBig Bend's Steinhatchee sees more destruction, this time from Helene\n\nHer riverside home is destroyed, eight of the 24 riverside rental units she owns were flooded, and the electrical system powering the riverside marina building may have been fritzed.\n\nAnd still, Danielle Norwood, 59, owner of the Sea Hag Marina that fronts the Steinhatchee River along Riverside Drive, was smiling somehow as she pointed to a concrete floor that had crumbled.\n\n“I think I’m stunned at this point, I can’t release a lot of emotions,” she said. And then she paused.\n\n“We’ll build back,\" she said. \"We’re those kind of people.”\n\n— Anne Geggis\n\n7 dead in Florida from Hurricane Helene; 5 in Pinellas\n\nIn Florida, at least seven deaths have been attributed to the Hurricane Helene.\n\nIn Pinellas County, which encompasses Clearwater and St. Petersburg, five people suffered storm-related deaths, said Cathie Perkins, director of emergency management, at a news conference Friday.\n\nEarlier Friday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters a person died in Dixie County, along the Big Bend coast, after a tree fell on a home. On Thursday night, a person was killed in a storm-related traffic fatality in Ybor City in Tampa, the governor said.\n\n— Thao Nguyen, Christopher Cann and Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY\n\nBayshore Blvd Tampa flooding has people in kayaks\n\nThe Tampa Bay area of Florida including Bayshore Boulevard and parts of Pinellas County were flooded badly by Hurricane Helene's pass.\n\nEven before landfall happened, at least 12 hours ahead of Helene's late-night arrival in Perry, the water was coming over the railings in Bayshore, a prominent community in Tampa. Because of the flooding, people explored the impromptu \"street river\" in kayaks and canoes.\n\n\"Purple kayak guy\" went viral on social media − on X, formerly known as Twitter, and TikTok − for narrating Hurricane Helene flooding conditions while kayaking inside a home.\n\n— Jennifer Sangalang\n\nStorm surge is going to be a Gulf Coast problem for days and days\n\nTampa Bay and Southwest Florida, along with Sarasota-Manatee and Taylor County where Hurricane Helene made landfall are all in the clear of the storm's powerful winds. But storm surge is going to be a really big problem in many communities in those areas.\n\nThe combination of a life-threatening storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach a number of heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide.\n\nDetails about how high are here.\n\nHurricane Joyce? Maybe. Another storm is brewing in the Caribbean\n\nAn area of low pressure could form over the western Caribbean Sea by the middle of next week, according to the National Hurricane Center. Is another tropical storm or hurricane forming? It's too early to tell.\n\n➤ Tropics watch Sept. 27: Here's the latest on what's happening in the tropics\n\nEnvironmental conditions are expected to be conducive for slow development thereafter while the system moves generally northwestward, potentially entering the Gulf of Mexico by the end of next week.\n\n\"Experts are identifying this as a medium risk area for a tropical storm to develop. It could find itself in the southern Gulf of Mexico later next week and then be a threat to the Gulf Coast,\" said AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter. \"If it tracks toward Florida, that would be extra special concern after the serious impact this week from Helene.\n\n\"Early indications are that it could be a threat to U.S. Gulf Coast sometime either late next week.\" or Oct. 5-6, Porter said.\n\n— Cheryl McCloud\n\nFlorida capital of Tallahassee misses brunt of hurricane again\n\nHelene, the most powerful hurricane on record to strike Apalachee Bay and one that threatened Tallahassee with a direct hit, made landfall to the east instead late Thursday, bringing more destruction to a storm-weary part of North Florida.\n\nThe hurricane, with fierce 140-mph winds at landfall, was the third to barrel into the Taylor County coastline in just 13 months and plunge that part of North Florida into darkness and misery. All three landfalls were roughly 23 miles apart in Taylor County.\n\n“I would say it’s rather incredible,” said Jasmine Montgomery, meteorologist with NWS Tallahassee. “There’s no rhyme or reason to it. These storms, more or less, developed in the Caribbean, moved up through the Gulf of Mexico and kept going until they hit land. It’s just the Gulf Coast is prime real estate for a hurricane.”\n\n— Elena Barrera\n\nA sewer system in St. Petersburg shut down, may be disabled for days\n\nSt. Petersburg's Northeast Sewer Plant has been shut down because of flood damage, and inspections that must be completed. The part of the city that is affected is north of 30th Avenue North and east of Haines Road or Interstate 275.\n\nImportant information was relayed by officials in the Instagram video posted below.\n\nWater is available for drinking but you cannot put water down the drain or it will come back up.\n\nDozens of fires calls and rescues overnight in Pasco County, Florida\n\nPasco County Fire Rescue and supporting agencies responded to 31 reports of structure fires in the darkness between 10 p.m. Thursday — when Hurricane Helene's surge started rolling ashore — and 7 a.m. Friday, said Tambrey Laine, county spokesperson.\n\nFirst responders also performed 135 rescues as of 7:30 a.m. Friday, Laine said. Thirty-eight Pasco County roads remain closed and impassible.\n\n\"All of our shelters remain open. That's the biggest question we're getting right now is, where are these people going?\" she said of residents with flooded homes.\n\n— Rick Neale\n\nThere was a Hurricane Helene fatality in Florida\n\nOfficials reported a person killed when a car driving on Interstate 4 near Ybor City in Tampa was hit Thursday night when a sign fell onto the highway.\n\n“We know that travel on the roads can be hazardous, and we typically, unfortunately, will have fatalities in every storm from that,” DeSantis said. “When you are out on the roads in the middle of one of these storms, that is very, very dangerous.”\n\n— Ana Goñi-Lessan\n\nSarasota storm surge remains a danger Friday\n\nThe threat level from storm surge remains significant. Storm surge for Sarasota and Manatee counties is projected at 3 to 5 feet above the mean high water line today.\n\nA storm surge of 6.04 feet was recorded at Port Manatee at 12:30 a.m. Friday but had not yet peaked.\n\n— Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nSanibel, Southwest Florida see widespread flooding\n\nThere wasn’t a breach, but the Florida Department of Transportation has closed the Sanibel Causeway both ways, Sanibel spokesman Eric Jackson said.\n\nCity offices will remain closed today because of “Significant flooding on the island,” Jackson said. “Staff will be assessing and responding. It will take some time for water to recede and for crews to clean up debris from roadways.\n\n— Mark H. Bickel\n\nIs there school today in Florida?\n\nThere were 46 of Florida's 67 counties with school districts closed Friday morning. Some universities and colleges are also closed in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.\n\n➤ Here is a list of Florida schools that are open and closed.\n\n— Cheryl McCloud\n\nHurricane vs. tropical storm: Helene is now downgraded\n\nHurricane Helene blew by Florida's western Gulf Coast and then made landfall in the Big Bend, near Perry, Florida after 11 p.m. on Thursday. By Friday morning the storm was raging through Georgia as a tropical storm. What's the difference?\n\nHurricane categories on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale:\n\nCategory 1: Winds 74-95 mph (64-82 kt or 119-153 km/hr). Very dangerous winds will produce some damage.\n\nCategory 2: Winds 96-110 mph (83-95 kt or 154-177 km/hr). Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage.\n\nCategory 3: Winds 111-129 mph (96-112 kt or 178-208 km/hr). Devastating damage will occur\n\nCategory 4: Winds 130-156 mph (113-136 kt or 209-251 km/hr). Catastrophic damage will occur\n\nCategory 5: Winds 157 mph or higher (137 kt or higher or 252 km/hr or higher). Catastrophic damage will occur\n\nTropical Storm: Winds 39-73 mph\n\nNearly 11% of Florida power customers were in the dark Friday morning after Hurricane Helene sent rains, surge, floods and wind damage across the peninsula and panhandle.\n\nAfter 6:30 a.m. there were nearly 1.2 million people still without power in Florida. The top five counties with power outages were:\n\nPinellas County (St. Petersburg/Clearwater): 234,189\n\nDuval County (Jacksonville): 120,704\n\nAlachua County (Gainesville): 72,627\n\nLeon County (Tallahassee): 70,633\n\nHillsborough County (Tampa): 64,794\n\nIs there another hurricane forming?\n\nHurricane Isaac formed Thursday and is in the middle of the Atlantic steering generally eastward far from the United States.\n\nAnother system is Invest 98L, in the easter and central tropical Atlantic, which has a 90 percent chance of formation in the next 48 hours. There are also three other systems brewing, including one in the Caribbean.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecast outlook describes showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressurelocated midway in between the Cabo Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles that continues to remain well organized.\n\nEnvironmental conditions are conducive for further development and a tropical depression or storm could form at any time today while the system moves generally westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph. The system is then forecast to slow down and turn north-northwestward by this weekend.\n\nLandfall was in the Big Bend. Where is the Big Bend and Perry, Florida?\n\nPerry is located on Florida's Gulf coast in the Big Bend region.\n\nFlorida’s “Big Bend” is in the curve of Florida’s peninsula around the Gulf of Mexico. The area includes Jefferson, Taylor, Dixie and Levy counties and is composed largely of \"untamed coastal landscape,\" according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\nPerry is about 50 miles from Tallahassee, Florida's capital city.\n\n— Grace Pateras and C. A. Bridges\n\nWhat category was Hurricane Helene in Florida?\n\nHurricane Helene made landfall near Perry, Florida, as a Category 4 storm\n\nHelene is the strongest hurricane ever to make landfall along Florida's Big Bend, on record since 1851. That exceeds the previous record for the region set by the Cedar Key hurricane in 1896, which had winds of 125 mph, said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University.\n\n— Dinah Pulver\n\nWhere is Helene going?\n\nHurricane Helene's pre-landfall Florida impacts\n\nWeather radar Florida\n\nStay informed.

Good Samaritans with chainsaws and tractors cut narrow pathways through some of the streets to help extricate their neighbors.\n\n“It came on so fast, and it ended so fast,” one resident said. “And it was so dark outside, just super ominous and really creepy. All you could smell was like dirt and pine. It was just absolutely stunningly strange.”\n\nRead more here.\n\nFAMU declares 'state of emergency'\n\nFlorida A&M University President Larry Robinson has declared \"a state of emergency\" as employees on the Tallahassee campus continue to assess and repair damage caused by what may be the worst tornado in Tallahassee history.\n\nThe university said at least 15 buildings, including the Grand Ballroom, the Banneker Buildings and the old Plant, Operations and Maintenance (POM) Building, suffered some form of roof and water damage. The flashing on Lee Hall was also damaged, according to Kendall Jones, associate vice president Facilities, Planning, Construction, and Safety.\n\nWhile the campus cleanup is underway classes will be conducted remotely May 13-17.

The Educational Research Center for Child Development’s (ERCCD) roof was damaged, and the facility will be closed at least Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday for repairs.\n\n“We appreciate all of the prayers and support from the community. Our employees are working strenuously to ensure we can restore normal operations as soon as possible,” Robinson said in a statement. “Although there has been substantial damage from the storm, we are thankful that there has been no loss of life or serious injuries reported.”\n\nWeatherTiger: The 'most destructive tornado in Tallahassee's history may have occurred'\n\nRyan Truchelut, better known as the WeatherTiger hurricane forecaster to Tallahassee, said Friday's mornings storm was a rare thing indeed.\n\n\"Long-tracking tornadoes are very unusual in Leon County,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"Notable recent events were a 2021 EF-1 that flipped planes at the the airport and then continued east to Southwood, and a 2019 EF-3 in rural eastern parts of the county. There is no history of anything other than brief, short-lived touchdowns in the urban core, college campuses, or densest residential areas of town.\"\n\nHe continued that \"radar data, an 84 mph wind gust report from FAMU, and wide swaths of structural and severe tree damage suggest that most destructive tornado in Tallahassee's history may have occurred around 7 a.m. today.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service will make the final determination.\n\nLooking for a late evening bite to eat?

Residents hunkered down in interior hallways and bathrooms as they prepared for the worst in the early morning hours.\n\n“Having been in Indianhead for 40 years, and a Florida native, I had always heard of tornadoes and the freight train noise that they make, but I had never experienced it. Well, now I have experienced it,” said Sherry Mills, an Indianhead resident.\n\nHer son and small grandson just happened to be staying over at her house the night before. “We all ran to the bathroom with no windows, it was unbelievable. The worst of it was only about five minutes, but it was terribly frightening.”\n\nThe cleanup of the neighborhood with the massive green and brown camouflaged roads will likely take days before residents see some sense of normalcy.\n\nVideo of Railroad Square from above shows scope of damage\n\nThe beloved arts district of Railroad Square was one of the hardest hit areas of Tallahassee, along with Indianhead Acres, Myers Park and College Town.\n\nSee the scope of the damage from above in drone footage and hear from one of the business owner's.\n\n\"It's terrible,\" she said. \"One of the galleries is completely gone, smashed down to the ground.

City officials expect the work to restore power will go through the weekend.\n\nCity spokesperson Alison Faris said the extent of the damage has made it hard-going today because crews are focused on fixing the transmission infrastructure before they can start working on the distribution of power that energizes homes and businesses.\n\n\"Transmission first and then we restore circuits which impacts distribution,\" Faris told the Democrat. \"All hands are on the transmission. We should start seeing some circuits repaired here shortly.\"\n\nThat can lead to entire sections of neighborhoods being powered up.\n\nAt 6 p.m., Faris said 85 percent of the work to the transmission line is complete. Crews are now shifting to fixes that can power up customers in bulk.\n\nRed Cross mobilizing ahead of storm, opens Reception Center\n\nAs the scope of the damage comes into focus, the Red Cross is mobilizing to help the many residents struggling in the powerful storm's aftermath.\n\n\"A significant amount of damage has been reported in the Tallahassee area,\" the Red Cross wrote on Facebook. \"If you need a safe place to go, visit us at our Reception Center at 1115 Easterwood Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32311.\n\n\"If you have you have sustained damage and need emergency assistance, please call 1-800-RED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767) to let us know.\"\n\nDeSantis declares state of emergency for Tallahassee, North Florida\n\nAbout 9 hours after a storm cut a path of destruction through Tallahassee, Gov.

Dick Howser Stadium ― the home for FSU baseball ― was among the structures in the path of the violent storm.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nThe view from Indianhead\n\nThe Indianhead neighborhood, as usual during severe weather, was hard hit. Fallen trees appear to be blocking roads every 50 yards. One neighbor reported that a treetop near his house appeared to have snapped off, was shorn of branches and driven into the ground “like a pencil.”\n\nStill other trees had their tops snipped off, apparently by strong winds, leaving jagged edges of bare wood. Power lines and supporting cables were downed and lying on the ground like a mess of twist ties. A couple of residents could be seen trying to pull a limb off a roof.\n\nWith school canceled, neighborhood kids had nothing else to do but go outside, with some dragging large branches out of the streets.

The circular bleaches are shattered in multiple spots. Wires vine through everything.\n\nThe Florida State University Flying High Circus was founded in 1947 by Jack Haskin and was one of the first ways of integrating men and women after the college became co-ed. Haskin introduced an activity he had used as a high-school teacher in Illinois: a circus of two dozen acrobatic, juggling and balancing acts.\n\nBy the 1960s, the circus was internationally famous and appeared on TV shows such as \"Wide World of Sports.\" In the 1970s, former circus director Dickie Brinson scheduled road shows all over the Southeast and Caribbean, found donors and fostered an alumni association.\n\nLeon County Schools makes the call: Schools are closed\n\nAfter trying to take it on a case-by-case basis, Leon County Schools administrators made the call at 9:15 a.m. to close all schools for the day.\n\n\"After discussion with our school principals and staff, we have made the decision to close schools for the remainder of the day,\" the district wrote on X. \"Parents: Please proceed to your school to pick up your students.\"\n\nThe announcement came less than an hour after the district said it would be opening all elementary schools except Fort Braden and Woodville. Many high school students had arrived at schools before the worst of the storms blew through, which led them to bunker down in media rooms and hallways after the tornado warning was issued.\n\nReported tornado had downtown Tallahassee in its crosshairs\n\nChristian Oliver, meteorologist with the National Weather service in Tallahassee, said a line of severe storms intensified as it neared the city, spawning a reported tornado in the downtown area.\n\n“As that line was approaching the city, we had three distinct circulations, each with their own tornado debris signature,” Oliver said. “It looked like they were all kind of coming together into one tornadic capable storm.”\n\nOliver said the Weather Service received multiple eyewitness reports of a tornado downtown. A firefighter called in to report a twister in near Gaines Street.\n\n“We’ll have to go out once it’s safe to do so to see what really happened and what moved through the city,” he said. “But we’ve had people call in saying that they actually saw at least one tornado.”\n\nCity of Tallahassee calls in outside power crews to assist; restoration will 'take some time'\n\nWith more than 66,000 out of power in Tallahassee, city officials are putting out the call for mutual aid.\n\nThat means crews from other electric companies swoop in to assist on the more than 650 outages around the city. Eight utilities from Louisiana, Alabama, Jacksonville and Central Florida are headed to the capital city.\n\nCity spokesperson Alison Faris said there is \"significant transmission line damage which has impacted 11 substations that power the city.

The category 4 storm turned downtown Punta Gorda into a pile of rubble, ripped thousands of roofs in Lee and Charlotte counties, uprooted thousands of trees and sent public officials and business leaders into a \"we'll be ready for the next one\" mode.\n\nMuch has changed in the past decade. Lee and Charlotte have new emergency operations centers — Charley destroyed Charlotte's. There's new technology for predicting and following storms and evaluating tidal surge. FPL has spent more than $1 billion to upgrade its electrical grids statewide and the local Lee County Electric Cooperative, LCEC, has improved its network. Fort Myers Beach has a plan to get its residents and business owners back on the island quickly. There is now an organization to help the infirm and elderly. Roads have been widened to speed up evacuation. Building codes were strengthened.\n\nIndeed, a whole lot is new since Charley. Is it enough, though? Leaders from the public and private sectors say yes, but they are quick to note, \"we don't want another one to find out.\"\n\nTo refresh, Charley formed as a tropical wave off Africa and made the trek across the Atlantic Ocean, the southern Caribbean Sea and into the Gulf of Mexico for its rendezvous with Southwest Florida. About 3 p.m. on Friday the 13th, Charley made landfall on north end of Captiva Island with its fury of 150-mph winds. It was the strongest hurricane to strike the United States since Andrew 12 years earlier and the first with a bull's eye on Lee County since Donna in 1960.\n\nUntil just before Charley hit, forecasters were predicting the storm would hit in the Tampa area, but a quick, right turn into Charlotte Harbor caught Southwest Florida residents and businesses off-guard.\n\n\"One thing I learned,\" said Fort Myers Beach town manager Don Stilwell, who was Lee County manager in 2004, \"is to take these storms very, very seriously. Be prepared. You just don't know. Hurricanes are often very unpredictable and can turn quickly. Just imagine if it had turned 10 miles sooner. Really, I don't even want to think about it.\"\n\nThe barrier islands took the brunt of Charley in Lee (along with parts of Cape Coral). Winds ravaged Sanibel, Captiva and San Carlos Island (Fort Myers Beach). Sanibel was somewhat prepared. City officials set up shop at the Bell Tower and quickly began getting residents and business owners back on the island.\n\nThat was not the case at Fort Myers Beach. Many who evacuated prior to the storm were stranded on the mainland, some for more than a week. Residents remember law enforcement, weapons in hand, keeping residents off the island during cleanup operation. Some even tried to swim or take boats to the beach, but the Coast Guard intercepted them and turned them back.\n\nStilwell said that's not going to happen the next time.\n\n\"We've been issuing passes for residents and business people for some time,\" he said. \"I can't take credit for that because it started before I got here. The council learned and they are doing something about it. It's an outstanding plan.\"\n\nLee County\n\nA new emergency management center, which includes the latest in high-tech equipment and space to operate during a storm, has been built and there is a new leader in place, Rob Farmer, who replaced John Wilson 16 months ago.\n\nHe's not experienced a hurricane first hand, but dealt with other kinds of Mother Nature's furies — blizzards, ice storms and tornadoes — during his days of emergency management in the Columbus, Ohio, area.\n\nHe said Lee's new EMC on Six Mile Cypress Parkway will enable responders to work more efficiently and faster.\n\n\"People were piled on top of each other in the old center,\" Farmer said. \"For instance, the situation room is four times larger which will let us work more effectively.\"\n\nHe said new technology will allow Lee to gather more information. \"We now have direct access to advanced weather data,\" Farmer said.\n\nWeather forecasting\n\nMore sophisticated computer modeling of hurricanes has improved accuracy in storm predicting as have faster computers. This is not a direct result of Charley, simply an evolution of technology.\n\nBut Charley is responsible for one major change — unlinking storm surge and wind category.\n\n\"Discussion about this started after Charley,\" said WINK-TV chief meteorologist Jim Farrell, who was first on the air declaring the storm had turned toward Southwest Florida. \"Previously, they used the strength of a hurricane to calculate storm surge.\"\n\nWhat started the discussion was that a Category 4 storm such as Charley was believed to produce a storm surge 15 to 20 feet high. It didn't, though.\n\n\"They decided to de-couple them,\" Farrell said. \"The new storm surge guidelines are a direct result of Charley.\"\n\nElectricity\n\nMyth: Because power companies have invested heavily since Charley and technology has improved, Southwest Florida won't lose power during its next hurricane.\n\nTruth: The lights will go out, at least for a while. After all, trees fall on power lines, shrapnel-laden winds disable transformers and some poles simply blow down. \"There will be power outages,\" said Irene White, FPL's director of operations.\n\nFPL and LCEC just hope outages won't be for a week or longer. That's why they have spent money in defense. FPL is inspecting 8,500 utility poles this year and clearing more than 1,100 miles of wires of trees and vegetation in Lee alone. LCEC is doing the same thing in its service areas.\n\n\"The biggest thing we've done is improve our infrastructure,\" White said. She said the company has installed many more concrete poles, which withstand winds better than the standard wood ones. An example of this is along U.S. 17 between Punta Gorda and Arcadia, where a main feeder line services the southern Charlotte County area.\n\nKaren Ryan, manager of public relations for LCEC, which has about 170,000 customers, said much of the damage to its poles and wires came from downed trees and wind-blown debris. That's why the company has been vigilant in trimming limbs that could be dangerous in a storm.\n\nThousands of aid workers came to the area from all parts of the country. \"We learned a lot from this,\" Ryan said. \"You have to educate them when they are here. You have make sure they wear sunscreen … and that there is plenty of Gatorade.\"\n\n'No Person Left Behind'\n\nThis non-profit, founded in Southwest Florida, was born as a result of Charley. Its mission is to educate those with disabilities, the elderly, municipal officials and others on how to prepare for a disaster. \"People with disabilities before Charley were an afterthought in planning,\" said founder and president Linda Carter of Fort Myers.\n\nNow a nationwide program, it allows for people in need to fill out paperwork so a group of volunteers can keep track of them during a storm.\n\nFor information call 368-6846 and ask for Carter.\n\nBuilding codes\n\nAfter Andrew flattened Homestead and much of Miami-Dade County in 1992, building codes across the state were tightened.\n\n\"Before Andrew I remember that we took a home design to the county for approval … just four pages … no architect,\" said Gary Aubuchon a Cape Coral home builder and president of the Aubuchon team of companies. \"That all changed after Andrew, and it got tighter after Charley.\n\n\"Building codes were strong before Charley. After Charley they were increased.\"\n\nAmong changes are roofs in new construction must be engineered to withstand 150-mph winds, new buildings must have impact-resistant windows or hurricane shutters and the truss system is mechanically stronger.\n\nAubuchon said the safety features are a good news-bad news scenario.\n\n\"Florida's homes are some of the strongest homes in the world,\" Aubuchon said. \"But it comes at a cost. They are much more expensive to build now.\"\n\nIn many cases homes built with post-Andrew technology held up against Charley. Not so for those with older roofs.\n\n\"What we saw,\" Aubuchon said, \"was that a lot of older roofs were past their useful life and they blew off like a deck of cards.\"\n\nPopulation\n\nWhen Charley struck just more than 500,000 lived in Lee. Ten years later that figure is pushing 700,000. Lee's safety director Farmer looks at it another way.\n\n\"Our data shows that the population changes 50 percent every eight years,\" he said. \"That means there are about 300,000 who have never experienced a hurricane. People have a tendency to be complacent.\n\n\"There will never be another Charley. It's going to be different. Everything will be different.\"\n\nTransportation\n\nSince Charley, the Florida Department of Transportation has spent millions upgrading traffic signals, to withstand winds up to 150 mph. The technology is called \"mast arm.\" There were a few in place prior to 2004, but the state began making changes in earnest after Charley. Most that were then weathered four hurricanes that struck the state that year. Mast arms are steel poles with extension arms that hang over an intersection supporting traffic lights and signs. Examples of these can be seen on U.S. 41.\n\n\"We have replaced signs and the posts they are attached to,\" said Debbie Tower, spokeswoman for FDOT. \"They will withstand a higher velocity wind speed.\" Southwest Florida was littered with sign debris for weeks after Charley.\n\nShe also said interchange numbers have been painted on the shoulders near the turnoffs. \"They can be seen from the air, that way the interchange can be identified, and it is also a help for motorists if a sign is down or damaged,\" Tower said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/08/13"}]}

No arrests were reported. At least one McDonald's in New York City was temporarily closed by protesters. Several McDonald's stores kept drive-throughs operating, even while the restaurants were temporarily locked.\n\nCentral to Wednesday's strike is the evolution of its scope. What began two years ago as a fast-food workers movement has propelled into something wider, with Wednesday's protests including a range of workers workers from adjunct professors to home care and child care providers to Walmart employees.\n\nStrikers and protesters were occasionally joined by high-profile officials, such as former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who led a walkout at a McDonald's in Oakland prompting three workers to go on strike.\n\nOrganizers called it the largest-ever mobilization of U.S. workers seeking higher pay. That could not be confirmed, but thousands took part in the protests and campus activities in what organizers claim are 226 cities coast to coast. There also was a global element to the protests, with McDonald's stores in Athens, Toronto, Sao Paulo and Hong Kong all hit by protesters demanding higher wages.\n\n\"It's something different,\" said Kendall Fells, organizing director of Fight for $15, which is funded by the Service Employees International Union. \"This is much more of an economic and racial justice movement than the fast-food workers strikes of the past two years.\"\n\nHundreds of protesters took to the streets across New York City. In Brooklyn, crowds blocked traffic. In Manhattan, organizers lay on the pavement outside a McDonald's. Many chanted, \"This is what democracy looks like,\" and waved \"Fight for $15\" signs.\n\n\"We are the backbones of these fast-food restaurants, and I believe that we should be more rewarded,\" said Jorge Math, a McDonald's cashier who makes $8.75. \"Most of us have to get a second job so we can sustain ourselves.\"\n\nKeeshan Harley came as a member of Make the Road New York, a nonprofit that focuses on justice issues. \"In New York City, it's kind of impossible to work on $8 an hour when you have $1,900 to $2,000 rents,\" Harley said. \"So we need $15 an hour. That's the bare minimum. That is just moving toward sustainability in the city.\"\n\nThe timing of the strikes on Tax Day was intentional, Fells said, to focus public attention on the strain that low wages place on public budgets and taxpayers when working families are forced to rely on public assistance.\n\nAs the 2016 presidential campaign just begins to take shape, wage fairness is an issue that presidential candidates may increasingly have to address. Today's strike takes shape even as two of the nation's largest private employers — Walmart and McDonald's — both made recent, small movements to improve wages for employees.\n\nThis strike has some outspoken sympathizers, too. Among them: George Zimmer, founder and former CEO of Men's Wearhouse. \"I think that capitalism needs some modifications if it's going to remain sustainable,\" he said in a phone interview. \"But I'm encouraged. I think this is the first generation since mine that's prepared to collaborate, not just compete.\"\n\nNot everyone is so sympathetic. \"The protests aren't about wages or working conditions, they are about promoting the SEIU's campaign to unionize the fast-food industry. Yet after investing two years and at least $30 million in these PR stunts, the SEIU still struggles to find actual employees to participate, let alone express an interest in joining a union,\" said Glenn Spencer, vice president of the Workforce Freedom Initiative for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in a statement.\n\nMcDonald's, at the focal point of the protests, continues to insist that wages are set not by the company but by the independent franshisee owner at about 90% of its U.S. restaurants.\n\nIn a statement, McDonald's said: \"We respect people's right to peacefully protest, and our restaurants remain open every day with the focus on providing an exceptional experience for our customers. Recently, McDonald's USA announced a wage increase and paid time off for employees at its company-owned restaurants and expanded educational opportunities for eligible employees at all restaurants. This is an important and meaningful first step as we continue to look at opportunities that will make a difference for employees.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/05/georgia-school-shooting-live-updates/75082650007/", "title": "Georgia school shooting updates: Suspect's father charged with ...", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Georgia school shooting for Thursday, Sept. 5. For the latest news, view USA TODAY's story for Friday, Sept. 6.\n\nWINDER, Ga. − Colin Gray, the father of suspected Georgia school shooter Colt Gray, has been arrested in connection with the attack that killed four people at Apalachee High School, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Thursday evening.\n\nThe elder Gray, 54, was charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree murder and eight counts of cruelty to children, the GBI said. In addition to the four fatalities Wednesday at the Winder school, nine people – eight students and one teacher – were injured in the assault.\n\n\"These charges stem from Mr. Gray knowingly allowing his son, Colt, to posses a weapon,'' said GBI Director Chris Hosey.\n\nLaw enforcement agents had visited the Gray household last year after getting tipped off about online threats to commit a school shooting. At the time, Colin Gray told sheriff's deputies he owned hunting rifles but they were not accessible to Colt Gray, who was 13 then.\n\nAuthorities were working Thursday to solve the tragic mystery of why and how a 14-year-old boy previously linked to violent threats opened fire in his high school, killing two teachers and two students and plunging this rural town into anguish and mourning.\n\nMason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14, and math teachers Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Christina Irimie, 53, were fatally shot Wednesday at Apalachee High School. Eight other students and one teacher were wounded.\n\nBarrow County Sheriff Jud Smith told reporters late Thursday all nine people were expected to make a full recovery. He added some had been discharged from the hospital while several were still being treated.\n\nSmith said the gunman, armed with an \"an AR-platform style weapon,\" began shooting around 10:20 a.m. Smith said the shooter, identified as Colt Gray, was quickly confronted by deputies assigned to the school and immediately surrendered. Gray faces four counts of felony murder and \"additional charges are expected,'' the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said.\n\nColt Gray was speaking with investigators, who were trying to determine what motivated the rampage Smith described as \"pure evil.\" The FBI said tips about online threats made last year involving then-13-year-old Gray were forwarded to authorities in neighboring Jackson County, but it was determined there was insufficient evidence to make an arrest.\n\nInvestigators have found evidence indicating Gray was interested in previous school shootings, especially the 2018 massacre in Parkland, Florida, the New York Times and CNN reported Thursday, citing unnamed law enforcement officials.\n\nKatherine Hooper has lived a few minutes away from the school since it was built. Despite no longer having school-age children, she donates books, paper and pens to the school every year. And she was stunned at the news that a recurring national nightmare had come to her small Georgia town.\n\n\"I cried like a baby,\" Hooper said Thursday. \"Everyone says, 'That never happens in my neighborhood,' but we said it and we actually meant it.\"\n\nHow the shooting unfolded:Complete timeline of events\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Gray was brought to the Regional Youth Detention Center in Gainesville overnight, Glenn Allen, a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice, told USA TODAY.

Sayarath, who described Gray as a quiet student who recently transferred and was frequently absent from school, said she was watching him through a window in the door.\n\nShe said some students went to open the locked door, but then backed away. “I’m guessing they saw something,” Sayarath said. Then she heard the shots \"about 10 or 15 of them at once, back-to-back.”\n\nMarques Coleman, 14, told CBS he saw the attacker holding a \"big gun\" moments before shots rang out. \"I got up, I started running, he started shooting like, like 10 times,\" Coleman said. \"My teacher started barricading the door with desks.\"\n\nKyson Stancion told ABC News he was in class when he heard gunshots and heard police scream to kids in the hallway that \"there's a shooting going on, get down, get back in the classroom.\"\n\n\"Everybody was crying,\" he said. \"My teacher tried to keep everybody safe.\"\n\nFBI received tips about online threats:Tips involved suspected Georgia school shooter\n\nFBI interviewed Colt Gray about threats last year\n\nThe FBI received tips about online threats last year involving then-13-year-old Gray, the bureau's Atlanta office said Wednesday. In May of 2023, the FBI's National Threat Operations Center obtained anonymous tips about threats to commit a school shooting at an unidentified location, federal agents said in a social media post. The threats, which contained images of guns, were traced to Jackson County, Georgia, and the FBI notified the Jackson County Sheriff's office.\n\nAuthorities interviewed Gray and his father, who said he had hunting rifles in the house but his son did not have unsupervised access to them. Colt Gray also denied making the online threats. There was no probable cause at the time for an arrest or additional law enforcement action, the post said. Jackson County passed on information to local schools, but Gray was a student at Apalachee High School in neighboring Barrow County when the shooting took place.

The school shooting at Apalachee High School was the 23rd time this year a school shooting has resulted in injuries or deaths, according to data compiled by Education Week, a news organization that covers K-12 education.\n\nEducation Week is just one of multiple organizations that compiles data about gun violence in schools, but they only track incidents that fulfill a certain criteria. The 22 school shootings prior to Wednesday's in Georgia have resulted in seven deaths and 29 injuries, according to Education Week's tally.\n\nThere have been more than 200 school shootings since Education Week began to track them in 2018.\n\n− Amaris Encinas\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen and Ryne Dennis, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/tennessee/2018/04/03/series-fragments-hate-prejudice-and-healing-east-tennessee/433170002/", "title": "A Series on fragments of hate: Prejudice and healing in East ...", "text": "Sam Venable\n\nKnoxville News Sentinel\n\nEditor's Note: This story was originally published in February 2014\n\nSam Venable reveals the untold story of an integration pioneer who carries bullet shards from a shooting that East Tennessee ignored just days after MLK was killed\n\n\n\nIt was April 10, 1968 — the day after a mule-drawn wagon carried the casket of Martin Luther King Jr. through the streets of Atlanta for burial. Charles Moulden, a young black man from Sevier County, was fishing for trout with white friends on the Tellico River near Tellico Plains. He was threatened by a local man who said he’d kill him if he didn’t leave.\n\n\n\n“It never crossed my mind that he’d shoot me,” Moulden says 46 years later.\n\n\n\nBut he did.\n\n\n\nNo outcry followed the attack, just days after the assassination of America’s civil-rights leader. Almost nothing appeared in the newspapers, even after the suspect was acquitted, despite overwhelming evidence. Instead, the incident was ignored and, through the years, faded into the past — until now.\n\n\n\nNews Sentinel columnist Sam Venable had long heard whispers of what happened that day, and this year he determined to find the truth. What he uncovered is a powerful story of hate, courage and, ultimately, healing.\n\nTELLICO PLAINS, Tenn. — Charles Moulden didn’t hear the sound at first. That comes later, he explained; it takes a second or two for your subconscious to process what just happened.\n\n\n\nFor the moment, all he knew was (1) he was face-first in the gravel of a narrow road alongside Tellico River and (2) his left thigh was stinging intensely.\n\n\n\n“It was like a mad hornet on steroids,” Moulden related a few days ago as he strode the same roadway, now paved with asphalt.\n\n\n\n“I thought I must have gotten into some bees. I pushed myself back up on my feet and looked down at my leg. I thought I’d find some kind of huge stinger poking out.”\n\n\n\nAll Moulden saw was a hole in his pants. He squeezed the flesh beneath it. Instead of a stinger, out came a trickle of blood. Immediately, excruciating pain erupted in the back of his leg.\n\n\n\n“That’s when I looked up and saw him again,” Moulden continues, gesturing toward a small rise in the bend of the road up ahead.\n\n\n\n“He had stepped out from behind the bush. His arms were straight down by his side. Then he raised one arm, and I saw the pistol.”\n\n\n\nMoulden makes a circle with his fingertips.\n\n\n\n“Man, the end of that thing looked like it was three inches wide.\n\n\n\n“He aimed directly at me. I shut my eyes and grimaced.”\n\n\n\nThis time, Moulden heard the gun’s report. Forty-six years after the fact, he considers that a good omen:\n\n\n\n“If you hear the ‘pow,’ it means you didn’t get hit. By the time the sound gets there, the bullet is long gone.”\n\n\n\nIt was Wednesday, April 10, 1968, and the news was riveting.\n\nOne day earlier in Atlanta, 150,000 marchers followed a mule-drawn wagon carrying the casket of Martin Luther King Jr. to a service at Morehouse College, shortly after his funeral at Ebenezer Baptist Church.\n\n\n\nIn Memphis and throughout the U.S., teams of investigators were sorting through tips — some intentionally misleading, as it turned out — in their frantic search for the gunman who had assassinated the civil-rights leader six days earlier.\n\nIn Chattanooga, a curfew was in effect after looting broke out following an MLK memorial service.\n\n\n\nIn the highlands of East Tennessee, however, the mood was a bit more festive, despite gray skies and sporadic showers. It was the long-awaited opening day of trout season.\n\n\n\nMoulden, a 24-year-old brick mason from Sevierville, was among the army of anglers who turned out.\n\n\n\nA few of these sportsmen deployed fly rods and tiny, hand-tied insect imitations in hopes of catching rainbow, brown and brook trout. The vast majority, like Moulden, used spinning equipment and an array of “live bait” — everything from nightcrawlers to doughballs to the ever-popular yellow kernels of canned corn.\n\n\n\nYet there was one major difference between Moulden and the other fishermen. A difference that transcended equipment and tactics. A societal difference that mattered greatly in those not-so-good old days.\n\n\n\nHe was black.\n\n“I’d been fishing all my life,” says Moulden, now 70, an Oak Ridge resident and site superintendent for Summit Contractors in Knoxville. “Douglas Lake, Cherokee Lake, I was all over them. But I never had fished for trout.”\n\n\n\nHe pauses to chuckle and shake his head. “When they told me you could catch trout on corn, I was like, ‘Aw, c’mon!’ But Bill, ‘Arvilee’ and Leroy insisted it worked. They invited me to come along with them that morning.”\n\n\n\nThat would be Bill Williams, Arvil Lee Parton and his son Leroy.\n\n\n\nArvil ran a masonry and concrete-finishing business in Sevier County and often sought Moulden’s skills. Williams and the Partons were white but saw nothing unusual about including a black friend on the trip.\n\n\n\nParticularly if that friend was Charles Moulden — born, raised and widely known by folks of all races throughout Sevier County.\n\n\n\nBy the standards of that era, of course, such mingling ceased at the schoolhouse door.\n\n\n\nMoulden and his five siblings attended the all-black Pleasant View Elementary School in Sevierville. At the ninth grade, their only educational option — and that of most black students throughout the region — was to be driven into Knoxville to the all-black Vine Junior and Austin High schools.\n\nThat changed for Moulden in the fall of 1963, aided and abetted by the fact he was a gifted athlete.\n\n\n\nIn his senior year, he was in the first group of black students to enroll in Sevier County High School. As a quick, muscular Smoky Bears running back, he also was the first black athlete to play football in the old Knoxville Interscholastic League. Moulden was popular with classmates, graduating in 1964 along with a blond bouffant country music singer — another Parton, this one named Dolly.\n\n\n\n“I never really thought anything about going fishing with white guys,” he says.\n\n\n\n“I already had a fishing license, but I went to Carl Owenby’s hardware store in Sevierville to buy a trout stamp. On the way down to Tellico, we stopped somewhere to buy a daily permit. I remember it cost one dollar.”\n\n\n\nMoulden doesn’t recall much else about his inaugural trip into the rugged Monroe County mountains. Not because of mental erosion during the intervening years. He simply never had a chance to see the landscape:\n\n\n\n“Me and one of the other boys rode in the bed of Arvilee’s pickup truck. He had a camper shell on it. It didn’t have any windows, except one in the very back. Arvilee had busted up a couple of bales of straw in there, so me and whoever else it was slept most of the way.\n\n\n\n“It wasn’t until 2010, when I rode with some friends to Tellico Plains on our motorcycles, that I even knew how to get there. I had to look it up on a map.”\n\n\n\nThe foursome attracted some unwanted attention from the start.\n\n\n\n“It was still early, and me and Charlie were walkin’ down the road, goin’ from one pool to another,” says Leroy Parton, now 66, who still lives in Sevierville.\n\n\n\n“This old white man walked up to us. I’ll never forget the look on his face. He had a long, white beard that must have gone to his waist. He looked at us and said, ‘You’re gonna have to git outta these mountains!’\n\n\n\n“He glanced over at me and said: ‘Not you! Him!’ He pointed to Charlie, and then he stomped off.\n\n\n\n“I said, ‘Charlie, what are you gonna do?’\n\n\n\n“He shrugged, ‘Why, I’m goin’ fishin.’ ”\n\n\n\nEven today, the mood of that unsettling moment is fresh on Leroy Parton’s mind: “I remember thinking, ‘Wow, these people down here must even hate their own mothers!’ ”\n\n\n\nIt took Moulden awhile to get the hang of drifting his bait through moving water instead of casting into the placid environs of a reservoir. Soon enough, though, everything clicked.\n\n“I caught a couple of little ‘cigar’ trout and threw ’em back,” he says. “Then I realized I’d do better if I fished in the slow, deep holes instead of the rapids. I caught four good trout real quick.\n\n\n\n“I had just come up out of the river and was walking down the road to find another place to fish. That’s when he drove up.”\n\n\n\nThe car that approached was a black, early-1950s model Chevrolet, Moulden recalls. It may have had some green paint on the fender or hood. But he has vivid recall of what transpired between him and the driver.\n\n\n\n“He came all the way across the road and brushed my leg with his fender. He revved the engine real loud. Then he started cussing me. It was ‘nigger this’ and ‘nigger that.’ ”\n\n\n\nMoulden felt an immediate flush of rage. Instinctively, his fists began to clench. In another place, he might have punched the driver senseless through the car’s open window. But he had the presence of mind to know he was in foreign territory.\n\n\n\n“I could smell alcohol on him, but he wasn’t what you’d call drunk. He knew exactly what he was saying and doing. Finally, he said, ‘Didn’t you see the sign?’\n\n\n\n“I said, ‘What sign is that, sir?’\n\n\n\n“He said, ‘The sign in town that says: ‘Nigger, read and run. Don’t let the sun set with you in this town.’ ”\n\n\n\nMoulden was all-too familiar with warnings of “the sign,” real or fictive. He’d heard them all his life. Thus, he adopted a ploy that had often worked in similarly tense situations.\n\n\n\nHe played Stepin Fetchit dumb.\n\n\n\n“I said: ‘No, sir; I didn’t see no sign. I was ridin’ in the back of this here truck when we came through town. Besides, it wouldn’t have done me no good to see it ’cause I can’t read or write.’ ”\n\n“That figures!” spat the angry driver, who then issued an ominous warning before speeding away: “You get outta here! Next time I see you, you’re a dead nigger!”\n\n\n\nMoulden’s friends quickly gathered. Leroy asked again, “What are you gonna do, Charlie?”\n\n\n\n“I’m tellin’ you, I’m goin’ fishin’!” Moulden reiterated, now more determined than ever.\n\n\n\n“I said, ‘Leroy, if I paid attention every time a white man called me a nigger or threatened me, I’d be too scared to come out of my house.’\n\n\n\n“Oh, I was sensitive to the N-word, all right. I didn’t like it. I knew how to fight. But it’s like my dad had always said to me: ‘Son, you can’t fight ’em all.’\n\n\n\n“I told Leroy: ‘All I can do is hope the Good Lord is riding with me today. That’s the only protection I got. That’s the only protection I need.’ So I went on fishing.”\n\n\n\nAfter a few hours, the party moved several miles upriver to a spot just above the old Tellico Lodge. They found a promising stretch of water. Arvil pulled his truck to the side of the road. Everyone got out.\n\n\n\nAt virtually the same moment, the black Chevrolet flew by.\n\n\n\n“One of the boys said, ‘Charlie, there goes your buddy,’ ” Moulden recalls.\n\n\n\n“He drove on around the bend, and I figured he hadn’t seen me. I saw a nice eddy in the river and started walking up the road to reach it.”\n\n\n\nThat’s when one of his friends uttered four words Moulden will never forget:\n\n\n\n“Charlie, there he is.”\n\n\n\n“I looked up and sure enough, there he stood. He was on a little bit of an incline, trying to hide behind a bush. I could see him plain as day from the waist up.”\n\n\n\nMore than four decades later, Moulden’s eyes bore holes through that same rise in the terrain. He is temporarily silent. The only sound comes from the rushing river nearby. Finally, he speaks.\n\n\n\n“I remember thinking, ‘Well, I wonder what’s he gonna do?’\n\n\n\n“ ‘Is he gonna come out here in the road and we go fist-to-fist?’ That would’ve been fine with me. I was a boxer, and I knew he’d been drinking. I was sure I could take care of myself.\n\n\n\n“Then I thought, ‘Is he gonna throw a rock? Bring a stick?’ The wheels in my mind were just spinning.\n\n\n\n“I knew some people hated me for the color of my skin. Even though they didn’t know me or know what I did or anything, they were just mad at me for my color. Still, it never crossed my mind that he’d shoot me.\n\n\n\n“So I sorta lowered my head and kept walking.”\n\n\n\nOne second, Moulden was striding confidently. The next, his left leg blew backward just as his right leg was coming forward. His body crashed into the roadbed.\n\n\n\n“Ain’t it funny?” he says. “I remember crushing that can of corn as I fell. Corn spewed out all over the road. My fishing pole broke. My knuckles were bloody.”\n\n\n\nHe struggled back to his feet and began looking for that imagined “mad hornet stinger.” The assailant stepped into the road, re-aimed, launched a second (albeit errant) round, pointed the muzzle of his pistol skyward, fired twice more into the air and vanished into the woods. It was over in an eyeblink.\n\n\n\nMoulden tried to walk, but his legs betrayed him. He fell again and began crawling toward the only cover available: a steep bank to his left.\n\n\n\n“I didn’t know if maybe he was coming back around to shoot me from above,” Moulden recalls. “I just remember lying on my back and looking up through the trees, trying to find him.”\n\n\n\nAt that very moment, the heads of two young boys popped up from the river. Moulden shouted for them to get down. They vanished, only to reappear and run by him seconds later.\n\n\n\n“I don’t think they had anything to do with the shooting,” he says. “Maybe they were upriver somewhere, fishing with their dad. That’s the last I ever saw of them.\n\n\n\n“My buddies had taken cover. They were hollering: ‘Charlie! Charlie! Did he just shoot you?’\n\n\n\n“I said, ‘Yeah!’ ”\n\n\n\nMoulden gathers himself once again as the shocking event replays in his mind. He chooses his words deliberately, every syllable punctuated by the anger and pain he felt that day:\n\n\n\n“I yelled real loud back over my head, toward the woods: ‘Yeah, that SON OF A BITCH just shot me!’ ”\n\n\n\nHe adds in retrospect: “I guess that wasn’t the smartest thing to say, knowin’ he was probably right above me. But honestly, I was hurtin’ so bad by then, I didn’t care if he came back around and killed me.”\n\n\n\nThe next few minutes are a blur.\n\n\n\nMoulden’s friends were afraid to come to his aid for fear the shooter was perched above. Waiting. Pistol cocked. Aiming. Who knew?\n\n\n\nSummoning what was left of his strength, Moulden crawled back across the road and down to the parked truck. He opened the passenger door, pulled himself into the floorboard and pushed the clutch pedal with one hand. The truck rolled rearward a few feet.\n\n\n\n“They kept telling me how to cut the steering wheel,” he says. “I’d turn the wheel and push the clutch and move closer to them.”\n\n\n\nEventually the distance closed enough for his friends to sprint from hiding.\n\n\n\n“Arvilee climbed over me and got hold of my belt,” Moulden says. “He pulled me inside. The others jumped into the bed. Arvilee cranked the engine and sped around the curve.”\n\n\n\nAbout that time “a government man” pulled up in his car. Moulden doesn’t know if it was a game warden or a Forest Service worker. He does know the man wasn’t armed.\n\n\n\n“My buddies kept yelling, ‘Give us your gun!’ The guy kept saying, ‘I ain’t got one!’ But at least he called an ambulance.”\n\n\n\nFor all the good that would do.\n\nAs soon as the situation was explained and radioed to civilization, rescue workers said no way were they coming into the national forest to pick up a black man who’d been shot by a white man — especially one who might still be hidden, poised to attack again.\n\n\n\n“They had to drive me down to Tellico Plains (a distance of 18 miles),” says Moulden. “Once they got me loaded into the ambulance, the rest of the boys took off for Sevierville.\n\n\n\n“I was riding along in that ambulance, begging them to give me a shot for pain. Nobody would. I finally asked where we were going. The only hospitals I knew were Baptist and UT.\n\n\n\n“The driver said, ‘We’re going to Blount Memorial.’ I asked, ‘Where’s that?’\n\n\n\n“ ‘Maryville,’ he said.”\n\nMoulden can’t help but laugh at his memory of that moment, terrifying as it was.\n\n\n\n“Maryville was 10,” he says, referring to the numeral 10 on Blount County license plates back in the day.\n\n\n\n“Ten was where the Klan was! I used to see ‘10’ on cars whenever there was a cross-burning. I kept thinking: ‘Oh, Lord! I’m out of the frying pan and into the oven!’ ”\n\n\n\nHappily, no ill will came Moulden’s way at Blount Memorial. “They treated me real nice,” he says.\n\n\n\nHe remained hospitalized five days and was discharged on crutches. The bullet was still embedded in his thigh.\n\n\n\nIt still is.\n\n“The doctors told me it had fragmented into at least six pieces,” he says. “They said they’d have to do a lot more damage to the muscles in my leg than the bullet itself. Those pieces cut me. They hurt me for a long time. Sometimes they still do.”\n\n\n\nMoulden was married with one daughter. He couldn’t work. His wife applied for welfare.\n\n“I hated that,” he says. “I’d never been on welfare.\n\n\n\n“After I could finally get up and move around on crutches, I asked Arvilee for some work, any work. I said I’d even hose out the wheelbarrows, whatever I could do to make some money. He had just gotten the job to pour the foundation for a motel between Pigeon and Gatlinburg, so he hired me.\n\n\n\n“I taped a board to my leg. That way, I could get down on one knee and stick that leg out. I was able to start finishing concrete again.\n\n\n\n“The going wage back then was $16-$18 a day. At the end of the first week, Arvilee paid me $20 a day. I told him he didn’t have to do that, but he said I was out-working everybody else on the crew.”\n\n\n\nIn 1971, Moulden was hired at K-25 in Oak Ridge. He stayed at the government facility until it closed 14 years later. He worked a variety of masonry jobs after that, even had his own construction company for a while.\n\n\n\nHe retired at age 66, only to be subsequently hired by Summit. The crews he supervises have built more than 75 Dollar Tree stores all over the United States.\n\n\n\n“The first thing I did after Arvilee paid me was to go downtown and get off welfare,” he said. “Bullet or no bullet, I wasn’t gonna be on no welfare.”\n\nMADISONVILLE, Tenn. — If there were any doubts in Charles Moulden’s mind about prejudicial feelings, they were settled the morning of Sept. 4, 1968, as he limped into the Monroe County Courthouse on crutches.\n\n\n\n“When I came in, there was this white lady standing in the hall,” Moulden recalls. “I smiled and said howdy to her, how are you doing?\n\n\n\n“She said: ‘I’d be doin’ a lot better if you wasn’t here. We don’t want no niggers down here. He shoulda killed you.’\n\n\n\n“I told her, ‘Well, he didn’t.’ I wasn’t smiling by then.”\n\n\n\nOut on the courthouse lawn, rib-poking good ol’ boy commentary was even more blunt, more biting.\n\n\n\nMoulden still has a vivid memory of those humiliating statements:\n\n\n\n“Some of ’em were saying stuff like, ‘You know Fred didn’t shoot at that nigger. Fred’s a better shot than that. If he’d shot at that nigger, he would’ve killed him.’ Then they’d laugh.”\n\n\n\nLittle wonder, then, why the jury reached a quick verdict.\n\n\n\nTestimony in the case lasted a little more than half the day. In just under a half-hour — 3:25 p.m. until 3:50 p.m. — the all-male, all-white panel came to a unanimous decision:\n\n\n\n“Not guilty, your honor.”\n\nForty-five-year-old Fred William Ellis — a previously convicted killer already infamous in the East Tennessee backcountry for frequent brushes with the law — was free to go.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, Judge James C. Witt dismissed all charges and sent a smug and smiling Ellis on his way.\n\n\n\n“Ellis was always acting nonchalant (on the stand),” said Moulden. “My attention was on him all the time. Whenever he looked at me, I could see the anger in his eyes.\n\n\n\n“I will tell you this: I tried to make as much eye contact as possible, just to make him mad. I thought, ‘Surely they won’t let him shoot me here.’ ”\n\n\n\nBy one measure, Moulden says today, he was surprised by the decision.\n\n\n\nBy another, it was nauseatingly predictable.\n\n\n\nCase number 3030 appeared airtight. The state had four eyewitnesses on its side.\n\n\n\nThere was 24-year-old Moulden, the victim who was black, along with his three white fishing buddies: Bill Williams, Arvil Lee Parton and Leroy Parton, all from Sevierville.\n\n\n\nOn April 10, Williams and the Partons had watched and listened as Ellis, a lifelong resident of the nearby Coker Creek community, cursed and angrily threatened their friend on opening day of trout season in the Cherokee National Forest. Later that same day, they had seen Ellis’ car roar past their fishing party and then Ellis appear seconds later in a bend of the road ahead.\n\n\n\nAgreed, only Moulden — cut down as the first shot was fired — had actually watched the assailant re-aim his pistol and squeeze off a second round. By then, the three others had ducked for cover.\n\n\n\nStill, it was pretty strong evidence, especially considering that an intoxicated Ellis had been arrested at Tellico Lodge shortly after the assault occurred. He was charged with attempted murder and jailed under a $5,000 bond.\n\nOfficers believed Ellis sprinted up the ridge from the site of the shooting, hid his gun, dropped into a low gap and emerged where Bill White’s rustic hunting and fishing resort was located.\n\n\n\nIt’s a quite plausible theory. Anyone familiar with these hills and hollows could eclipse the distance in a matter of minutes.\n\n“Right before the trial started, the sheriff had us walk through the courtroom, one at a time, and look around,” said Moulden. “Then he had us walk out through another door and describe what the shooter looked like.\n\n\n\n“All four of us identified Fred Ellis. I thought this was going to be a slam-dunk.”\n\n\n\nIt was a slam-dunk all right. Just 180 degrees in the other direction. Which underscores why Moulden wasn’t surprised by the outcome.\n\n\n\n“The whole thing was a farce, a dog and pony show,” he said.\n\n\n\nLeroy Parton, 66, who still lives in Sevierville, remains as bitter in 2014 as he was in 1968 when the not-guilty verdict was announced.\n\n\n\n“They should’ve hung that son of a bitch,” he said. “Instead, they let him go free.”\n\n\n\nVeteran criminal court reporter Jack Harrill recorded the spellbinding testimony on Edison Voicewriter vinyl discs — cutting-edge technology in its era but audio antiques today.\n\n\n\n“That jury wasn’t going to convict Fred Ellis of anything,” he said grimly.\n\n\n\nCharles Moulden: Court testimony\n\n\n\nMoulden concurs:\n\n\n\n“It was either because I was black or all of us were outsiders from Sevier County. Or maybe everybody was afraid to testify against him. It didn’t matter.”\n\n\n\nJust how poisonous was this atmosphere?\n\n\n\nThe Sevier Countians received so many threats, veiled and direct, they had to be driven to the courthouse by deputy escort.\n\n\n\nThe defense, led by Knoxville attorney Calvin N. Taylor, planted seeds of doubt in the jury’s mind at every turn. Such as:\n\n\n\nHow could Moulden and the Partons distinguish Ellis’ black 1952 Chevrolet from other possible black 1952 Chevrolets on the road that day?\n\n\n\nHow could they identify Ellis from 50-75 yards away and yet not be able to describe the kind of gun he used?\n\n\n\nHad it not been foggy?\n\n\n\nWas there not enough emergent vegetation to obscure the shooter?\n\n\n\nWho knows if “this colored boy” was even telling the truth about being shot? Why was there no doctor to testify about the extent of his injuries?\n\n\n\nEllis himself took the stand and repeatedly denied any involvement.\n\n\n\nHe swore he didn’t own a pistol. He insisted he had only pulled his car off the road to consume “a half-pint of bonded whiskey some feller give me up on North River.” He said he ran into the woods in fear for his own life when he heard shots being fired down the road.\n\n\n\nAttorney General Tom J. Taylor of Cleveland re-examined often, allowing the victim and his friends to reiterate their eyewitness versions.\n\n\n\nIt was during his closing argument to the jury, though, that the prosecutor cut to the chase.\n\n\n\n“You gentlemen are not stupid,” his voice can be heard on the scratchy recordings, recently found in the Monroe County Courthouse’s archives.\n\n\n\n“You know what happened. You know what this case is really about.\n\n“I don’t know how you feel about mixing colored and white,” Taylor continued, his voice rising with emotion. “But if you are so prejudiced (as to turn Ellis free), you might just as well put a badge on him and let him go back to terrorizing whoever he wants!”\n\n\n\n“What if it had been your own (son) who’d been shot?” he pleaded with the panel. “How would you feel then?”\n\n\n\nThe attorney general’s final sentence to the jury, delivered in the politically correct jargon of the day, reverberated through the courtroom like a fire-and-brimstone sermon:\n\n\n\n“You might let (Ellis) go free because he ‘just shot a Negra,’ but I tell you, it might not be a Negra next time!”\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t.\n\n\n\nAlthough originally accused of attempted murder, Ellis was ultimately tried for felonious assault. On May 6, 1968, the Monroe County grand jury had returned a true bill on that charge.\n\n\n\nHis first trial was held May 24. The outcome was a hung jury.\n\n\n\nOn Sept. 4, as soon as the second jury announced its not-guilty verdict, Moulden saw no further use trying to beat the system.\n\n\n\n“The attorney general told me it was my duty to come back and we’d fight this thing in federal court,” Moulden remembered.\n\n\n\n“I said, ‘No, sir. I’ve had enough. I wasn’t comin’ back no more. The only way I’d do that was if they gave Fred Ellis a fishing pole and me a pistol.\n\n\n\n“I told him, ‘These people want this man down here more than they want me down here. A person with no more intelligence than that, he’ll probably never leave this area.\n\n\n\n“Besides, my friends had a concrete-finishing business in Sevierville. They were losing money every time we came to Madisonville. I couldn’t ask them to keep doing that.”\n\n\n\nMoulden’s final message to the prosecutor proved hauntingly prophetic:\n\n\n\n“Now you’ve got to contend with him. Who’s he gonna shoot next? He’s already showed he doesn’t mind pulling the trigger on another human being.”\n\n\n\nEllis belonged to a hillbilly family with a reputation for “law-bending” — mostly hunting and fishing violations, as well as making and drinking moonshine.\n\n\n\n“I never personally arrested Fred,” said former Monroe County Sheriff Frank White, 82, who still works as a courthouse officer when his health permits. “But it seems like my deputies were picking him up all the time, mostly for drinking. I remember he could really aggravate you.”\n\n\n\nBy all accounts, the clan’s patriarch, Ben Ellis, was a soft-spoken mountain man who supplemented his meager farm income as a bear-and-boar hunting guide — “in season or out,” the late News Sentinel staff writer Willard Yarbrough once quipped in print.\n\n\n\nAs Ben’s sons came of age, however, they turned to violence.\n\n\n\nTwo of them, Ed and Benton, died in separate outbreaks of gunfire. A third, Roy, was wounded in another shootout. Roy died at age 75 in 2008, although it is not clear whether those injuries contributed to his death.\n\n\n\nBy far, Ed Ellis’ death attracted the greatest media attention. He was a major player in a 20th-century, East Tennessee version of the Hatfields and McCoys.\n\n\n\nTrouble began brewing when another Coker Creek native, Korean War veteran Myles Witt, returned to Monroe County and started a construction business. Witt hoped to develop some of the region into vacation homes and retreats. He attracted outside investors, formed the Unicoi Mountain Corp. and set up operations.\n\n\n\nAnger, jealousy, confrontation and retribution — “mountain justice” in local parlance — quickly followed.\n\n\n\nThe common denominator was a clear liquid dispensed in Mason jars.\n\n\n\nThe licensed making of corn liquor became legal in Tennessee in 2009; it has blossomed into a lucrative tourist attraction. But for two centuries prior, this art was practiced on the sly throughout these rough, misty highlands.\n\n\n\nIn the 1960s and ’70s, the notion that flatlanders might start prowling around where stills were located — let alone take up residence — was a recipe for disaster. Here’s what Yarbrough wrote about the situation in an analysis from Sept. 8, 1974:\n\n\n\n“The Ellis and Witt clans have been involved in court actions for the past 21/2 years, both civil and criminal — ranging from allegations of cabin burnings and shooting into buildings owned by the Witt interests, damage suits and earlier bloodshed.\n\n\n\n“The saga is complex,” Yarbrough noted, “but it involves moonshining and little law enforcement, which at times is non-existent.”\n\n\n\nThe conflict smouldered back and forth before exploding savagely. On Aug. 17, 1974, Ed Ellis was killed in a rural road shootout with Myles Witt and two of his associates.\n\n\n\nWitt and his men were charged with murder. Three trials resulted in hung juries. Prosecutors pushed for a fourth. But in November 1978, the Tennessee Supreme Court ordered all charges dismissed because “the probability of any future jury reaching a verdict of guilt or innocence is almost non-existent.”\n\n\n\nThe death of Benton (“Babe”) Ellis was even more grisly and mysterious.\n\n\n\nOn April 13, 1988, his body was found in the woods about one mile from his house. He had been struck at close range by a shotgun blast to the back of his head.\n\n\n\nMonths passed with no arrest, prompting investigators to attempt loosening lips another way.\n\n\n\nOn Aug. 5, 1988, the News Sentinel reported that a $2,500 state reward had been posted for information about the killing.\n\n\n\nStill nothing. Money may be an effective lubricant for solving crime in some settings. Not here.\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t until 1997 that a suspect was brought into custody. He was a Kentuckian, Roy E. Browder.\n\n\n\nHe also was Babe Ellis’ nephew.\n\n\n\nBrowder’s trial was postponed several times. Finally, on April 19, 1999, he pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was paroled on Christmas Eve of that year and returned to Kentucky on probation.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1960s, long before the Moulden case, Fred Ellis had served 17 months in North Carolina for voluntary manslaughter. A decade later, he continued to be implicated as the Monroe County feuding, arson and gun battles raged.\n\n\n\nIn 1977, he received a two-to-five-year prison sentence on attempted murder charges — this time involving a shootout with Myles Witt and his wife, Dixie — but was granted probation after serving 60 days. During that same era, he racked up a litany of other arrests, everything from public drunkenness to attempted jailbreak.\n\n\n\nMany longtime employees of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency also recall a brief — albeit terrifying — standoff near Waucheesi Lookout between the Ellises and the late game warden John French.\n\n\n\n“The way I heard the story,” says retired wildlife biologist Dick Conley, “the boys had been drinking when John stopped them. One of ’em got out of the truck and started to point a shotgun at him. John grabbed his own pistol and stuck it in one of Ellis boy’s ears and hollered, ‘If you mother------s shoot me, I’ll shoot him!’ Everybody backed off pretty quick, but it rattled John to the day he died.”\n\n\n\nIronically, on Sept. 4, 1969 — one year to the day after Fred Ellis was declared not guilty in the shooting of trout fisherman Charles Moulden — he was found guilty of possessing moonshine and fined $10 and court costs, a total of $69.85.\n\n\n\nDespite his lengthy association with violence, Fred Ellis did not die at the end of a gun. He passed away Oct. 3, 1986, at Athens Community Hospital.\n\n\n\nSome say due to heart attack, others cancer. The Tennessee Department of Public Health would not release the cause listed on his death certificate.\n\nAt any rate, he appears to have been a very old man at the relatively young age of 62.\n\n\n\nMoulden has paradoxical feelings about the person he believes wounded him that spring day nearly half a century ago.\n\n\n\n“Don’t get me wrong. It took me well over a year to get rid of my worst anger,” he says.\n\n\n\n“I was one mad man. I kept saying to myself and my friends, ‘That’s fine if he stays down there in Monroe County. But if I ever catch him in Sevier County, I’ll plant him.’ ”\n\n\n\nThe years have softened his attitude and refocused his perspective.\n\n\n\n“Fred was a product of his environment, his culture and the times,” said Moulden. “That’s just the way it was. I’m sure he was saying (in court) what his lawyer told him to say.\n\n\n\n“Of course, he was a coward who hid behind a gun. I would have been happy to fist-fight him, man to man. But I do have a strange kind of respect for him. He told me to my face how he felt about me and what he was going to do to me. I was just young enough and dumb enough to believe it never would actually happen.”\n\n\n\nAt this point, Moulden can’t help but inject some gallows humor: “You know, Fred was a pretty good shot, wasn’t he!\n\n\n\n“When I went down, he probably thought he’d killed me. It was 50-75 yards between us. Maybe he had aimed for my chest and the bullet dropped and hit me in the leg.\n\n\n\n“I’m just glad he missed the second shot.”\n\n\n\nRacial prejudice still exists today, Moulden acknowledges. Instead of being expressed openly, though, bitter feelings often are veiled.\n\n\n\n“What’s worse?” he asked, “for somebody to come right out and say they hate you for the color of your skin? Or to smile at you and be polite and then say bad things as soon as you turn your back?”\n\n\n\nIf given the chance, what would Moulden say in 2014, not only to his attacker but the jurors who set him free?\n\n\n\nHe thought for a moment. Sighed deeply. His gray-bearded face finally settled on a resolute countenance:\n\n\n\n“If they were willing to shake my hand and say they were sorry, I’d shake theirs. If the Good Lord can forgive them, surely I can, too.”\n\n\n\nWhat’s his opinion of the current social and political climate sweeping America, a stance that advocates carrying concealed weapons and stand-your-ground resistance?\n\n\n\n“I certainly understand it,” he answered, “and I suppose if anybody oughta be carrying a gun, it’s me. But I don’t.\n\n\n\n“Think about it: Nobody announces he’s going to shoot you.\n\n\n\n“They didn’t at that movie theater in Colorado or at that school in Connecticut. They just started shooting, the same way I got ambushed. By that time, it’s too late to reach for your gun.”\n\n\n\nThen Moulden was asked what he would have done if he had had a gun that day.\n\n\n\n“Hmmph,” he responded, a grim smile on his lips. “You know the answer as well as I do.\n\n\n\n“In 1968, it wouldn’t have mattered if Fred Ellis had put six holes in me and I only returned one shot in his general direction. A black guy shootin’ at a white man back then?”\n\n\n\nHe shakes his head wistfully.\n\n\n\n“They would’ve strung me up to the nearest tree.”\n\nMADISONVILLE — A stroll around the Monroe County Courthouse speaks volumes about the past.\n\n\n\nAt all four corners of the lawn, as well as on street-side utility poles, there are memorials to soldiers from this area who died in service to their country.\n\n\n\nThe street banners, complete with color photos and pertinent personal information, honor men who have fallen in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThose who perished in the Korean and Vietnam wars are listed alphabetically, including the date of their death.\n\n\n\nSomething stark, however, stands out on the memorials from World Wars I and II.\n\n\n\nThe warriors commemorated here are separated. On each granite face, there’s a long, main list. Then a smaller one beneath.\n\n\n\nUnder “colored.”\n\n\n\nSuch an observation should not be construed as New Age, politically correct judgment of Monroe County. Nor of small towns throughout America, particularly in the South, that continue to divide the memory of military service in this manner.\n\n\n\nThis practice is understandable. It is accurate. It is historical fact.\n\n\n\nU.S. armed forces were segregated during those wars. So were many of the societies whence these brave men lived, worked, raised families, were drafted or volunteered their last measure.\n\nThey grew up separately, served separately, died separately, are memorialized separately.\n\n\n\nSome communities have erased these old lines by posting new plaques that combine the victims into a single group. Some communities have not chosen to do so. To each its own.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, it does strike the casual visitor ironic that at this very courthouse, race — not damning testimony — determined the outcome of a long-whispered-about criminal trial.\n\n\n\nOn Sept. 4, 1968, jurors decreed a local white man not guilty of felonious assault in a heinous, cowardly attack. In so doing, they disregarded the testimony of law enforcement officers and four eyewitnesses.\n\n\n\nEyewitnesses who were “not from around here.” Including the victim, who happened to be “negro,” in the language of the day.\n\n\n\nLife is neither fair nor perfect. It won’t ever be. Here or anywhere else.\n\n\n\nBut, locals say, if nothing else positive came out of the trial of Fred Ellis, accused in the shooting of Charles Moulden, it did spark a social awakening.\n\n\n\n“Nobody is proud of that trial,” says 89-year-old Charles Hall, revered businessman and historian who served 16 terms as mayor of Tellico Plains until stepping down from office in 1990.\n\n\n\n“Attitudes have changed immensely since then. Tellico Plains has made a lot of progress. So have communities all around here.”\n\n\n\nHall recalled a high school basketball game, not long after the trial, pitting Tellico Plains against a Knoxville team with a lone black player.\n\n\n\n“I met with our boys before the game and said, ‘There aren’t going to be any problems, are there?’\n\n\n\n“They assured me no. And there weren’t. They just played basketball.”\n\n\n\nMarty Cook, longtime Monroe County Circuit Court clerk, says she was in high school when Jim Crow-era restrictions fell by the way.\n\n\n\n“I don’t remember it being a big deal for any of us students,” she said. “If there were any concerns, it was among a few adults. Everybody else got along. They still do.”\n\n\n\n“Yes, I remember those times,” says Monroe County sheriff Bill Bivens, “but I can assure you it’s not like that now. It’s changed a lot.”\n\n\n\nA black deputy, Chris Francis, serves on Bivens’ staff.\n\n\n\n“Chris is as fine an officer as you’ll find,” said the sheriff. “He came here from the Sweetwater Police Department. He has great respect in this community.\n\n\n\n“I’ve also had a couple of black female deputies. One retired, and one moved on to another job.”\n\n\n\n“I came to Tellico Plains in 1968,” said Pennsylvania native Dick Conley, a retired biologist for the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency who now lives in Madisonville.\n\n\n\nIt didn’t take Conley long to realize he had moved into a hotbed of bigotry: “Honest to gosh, I thought I’d stepped back in time.\n\n\n\n“But it’s not that way now,” he emphasized. “Things certainly have changed for the better.”\n\n\n\nTo illustrate, Conley cited Leon Tillman, who serves Blount and Monroe counties as a representative for the USDA’s National Resource Conservation Service.\n\n\n\nTillman, who is black, frequently calls on farmers and timberland owners deep in the wilderness. This is the same remote territory where his skin color would have invited inevitable trouble in years gone by.\n\n\n\n“One time I asked Leon if he wanted me to ride with him on some of those calls,” Conley says with a laugh.\n\n\n\n“He shrugged it off. He didn’t need any help. It was sort of like, ‘Why?’ He’d never had a problem.”\n\n\n\nFifty-six-year old Monroe County Mayor Tim Yates recalled “a few” racially charged incidents from his teenage years.\n\n\n\n“It’s sad things used to be like that,” he said. “It’s sad the way the Indians were treated long before that, too.\n\n\n\n“But that’s in our past. It’s history. I hope that’s where it stays.”\n\n\n\nAll of which brings the casual visitor back to those courthouse monuments. Specifically, the one memorializing veterans of the Civil War.\n\nNo individual names are listed here. Just the battalions, regiments and companies to which they belonged.\n\n\n\nIt is not lost on the observer that a single stone now blends these combatants from opposite sides of a bitter, four-year campaign dividing the nation.\n\n\n\nThey are divided no more.\n\n\n\nOne sculpted side of the monument reads: “Monroe County Confederate.” A few inches away, the script says: “Monroe County Federal.”\n\nThis stone was erected in 2004, a full 139 years after hostilities ceased.\n\n\n\nWho knows?\n\n\n\nPerhaps after sufficient time, all of the Monroe County soldiers who lost their lives in World Wars I and II finally will be memorialized as one.\n\nMore:Coverage of Monroe County shooting barely made a sound in 1968\n\nMore:Getting in the game: How one man became first black player on team\n\nMore:Sam Venable column: A story finally told — this one's for Big Sam\n\nMore:A Series on fragments of hate: Prejudice and healing in East Tennessee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/13/school-food-shortages-elk-sheds-tire-city-status-retained-news-around-states/119045212/", "title": "School food shortages, elk sheds tire: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAlexander City: Schools across the state have been facing food shortages, education officials say. Disruptions in the workforce needed to serve and deliver meals – along with supplies of food and packaging materials – are behind the shortages, Al.com reports. State education officials say every school district in Alabama is facing shortages to some degree. Alexander City Schools recently warned parents that it’s experiencing supply chain issues with its food vendors. In recent weeks, the school system hasn’t received food deliveries because suppliers are short on supplies, drivers and warehouse employees. The school system asked parents to feed breakfast to their students at home if possible. In southeast Alabama, Dothan City Schools asked parents last month to prepare for a possible shift to remote learning due to the district’s food supply issues.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Several Republican state lawmakers are urging easier access to ivermectin amid the pandemic, though that drug is not authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for preventing or treating COVID-19. Senate Majority Leader Shelley Hughes of Palmer said she urged Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state health commissioner to consider supplying Alaskans with vitamins and drugs, including ivermectin, “that some Alaskan physicians are prescribing but pharmacies aren’t filling.” Three Republican House members testified about ivermectin at a recent state pharmacy board meeting, Alaska Public Media reports. “Maybe the pharmacists could be directed – or directed’s the wrong word – suggested that they allow the doctors to actually be doctors and do their jobs,” said Rep. Kevin McCabe of Big Lake. In a letter to the House members after the meeting, the board’s chair, Justin Ruffridge, a Kenai Peninsula pharmacist, noted potential legal liability for pharmacists for drugs they dispense and said pharmacists were free to use their “professional judgment” when deciding whether to fill prescriptions. He said the board has not threatened pharmacists’ licenses around the issue but said reports of misuse of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 “should give most prescribers and pharmacists reason to pause.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has blocked the state from collecting $1.1 million from the city of Flagstaff to compensate for its minimum wage that is higher than the state’s rate, ruling that the state missed a deadline for the assessment and was stretching a law targeting higher voter-approved city wages to collect its indirect costs. But the ruling from Maricopa County Superior Court Judge James Smith released Monday sidestepped the question of whether the assessments are unconstitutional. The state minimum wage reached $12 an hour in 2020 with inflation adjustments after that and now stands at $12.15 an hour. Flagstaff voters in 2016 phased in higher city minimum wages, which hit $15 per hour this year with annual increases thereafter. Smith’s ruling said a law enacted by the Republican-controlled Legislature in 2019 targeting higher local minimum wages set a July 31 deadline for setting the yearly assessment. The state missed that deadline. The judge also said the state can’t charge for the indirect costs of Flagstaff’s higher minimum wage, which is what it did in coming up with the $1.1 million figure. The state is exempt from paying the higher minimum wage Flagstaff voters approved in 2016, and the law authorizing assessments does not specifically say the state can calculate the indirect costs of paying contractors.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers sent the governor a congressional redistricting plan that critics say weakens the influence of minority voters in the Little Rock area by splitting the state’s most populous county among three U.S. House districts. The measure splits portions of Pulaski County, a heavily Democratic county that includes Little Rock, among the 1st, 2nd and 4th congressional districts. The county is currently in the 2nd District, which Democrats have tried unsuccessfully to flip in recent years. Republicans hold all four of the state’s U.S. House seats and a majority of both chambers of the Legislature. Democrats have criticized the plan for moving predominantly Black and Hispanic precincts out of the 2nd District and accused Republicans of trying make a GOP district even redder. Arkansas is the only former Confederate state that has not elected a Black representative to the U.S. House. “It’s going to disenfranchise African American communities, regardless of the intent,” state Rep. Fred Love, D-Little Rock, said before the House approved the measure last week. Supporters of the plan say splitting Pulaski County makes sense given its location in the middle of the state. They also say it helps limits the number of counties split up. Opponents of splitting up counties have said it divides up communities and their interests.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSantee: Recordings indicate the pilot of a twin-engine plane nose-dived into a San Diego suburb despite a growingly concerned air traffic controller who repeatedly warned the pilot to climb in altitude – information that will be examined by investigators who arrived at the crash scene Tuesday. The Cessna 340 smashed into a UPS van, killing the driver, and then hit two houses to ignite just after 12 p.m. Monday in Santee, a suburb of 50,000 people east of San Diego. United Parcel Service of America Inc. held a moment of silence Tuesday for van driver Steve Krueger, who was remembered for making work better with his laugh, the company said in a statement. The plane’s owner, an Arizona physician, also died, and an elderly couple whose home went up in flames after it was hit suffered burns. It was unclear whether others were on board the plane. An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived at the crash scene Tuesday morning, according to agency spokeswoman Jennifer Gabris. Investigators will review radar data, weather information, air traffic control communication, airplane maintenance records and the pilot’s medical records, she said. The plane had planned to land at Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport in San Diego when it crashed.\n\nColorado\n\nPine: Wildlife officials say an elusive elk that has been wandering the hills with a car tire around its neck for at least two years has finally been freed of the obstruction. The 41/ 2 -year-old, 600-pound bull elk was spotted near Pine Junction, southwest of Denver, on Saturday evening and tranquilized, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Officers with the agency had to cut off the elk’s five-point antlers to remove the encumbrance because they couldn’t slice through the steel in the bead of the tire. “We would have preferred to cut the tire and leave the antlers for his rutting activity, but the situation was dynamic, and we had to just get the tire off in any way possible,” Officer Scott Murdoch said. Murdoch and fellow officer Dawson Swanson estimated the elk shed about 35 pounds with the removal of the tire, the antlers and debris inside the tire. Wildlife officers first spotted the elk with the tire around its neck in July 2019 while conducting a population survey for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and mountain goats in the Mount Evans Wilderness. They said they have seen deer, elk, moose, bears and other wildlife become entangled in a number of items, including swingsets, hammocks, clotheslines, decorative or holiday lighting, furniture, tomato cages, chicken feeders, laundry baskets, soccer goals and volleyball nets.\n\nConnecticut\n\nSimsbury: A plot of land that was once a thriving tobacco farm where Martin Luther King Jr. worked as a college student in the 1940s will be protected for its historic and cultural significance to the state’s civil rights history. Last month’s finalized sale of the 288-acre parcel of land was announced Friday. The nonprofit Trust for Public Land and the town of Simsbury plan to hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday for the Meadowood site. Nearly 130 acres will be set aside for recreational access and roughly 120 acres for working farmland. The rest will be saved for future needs of the town of Simsbury, while 2 acres will be kept for historic preservation purposes. Simsbury voters in May overwhelmingly authorized $2.5 million to purchase the property. Various state agencies, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the George Dudley Seymour Trust, individuals and foundations have provided an additional $4 million. Historians believe King’s experiences in Connecticut influenced his decision to become a minister and civil rights leader. He was among a group of students from Atlanta’s Morehouse College recruited by tobacco growers to work in the fields to earn money for tuition. “On our way here we saw some things I had never anticipated to see,” King wrote his father in June 1944. “After we passed Washington there was no discrimination at all. The white people here are very nice. We go to any place we want to and sit any where we want to.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state auditor, who is responsible for rooting out government fraud, waste and abuse, was indicted Monday on public corruption charges. An indictment issued by a New Castle County grand jury charges Kathleen McGuiness, 58, with felony counts of theft and witness intimidation, plus misdemeanor charges of official misconduct, conflict of interest and noncompliance with state procurement laws. Prosecutors said the charges include allegations that McGuiness hired her daughter and one of her daughter’s friends, both high school seniors at the time, as temporary employees in May 2020, even though other temporary employees had to leave their positions because of the lack of available work amid the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said Elizabeth McGuiness, who has not been charged, continued to be paid even after enrolling at a college in South Carolina last August, and she was still listed as an employee as recently as Aug. 28 of this year. She was initially listed as a “public information officer” and later as an “intern.” McGuiness also is charged with orchestrating a 2019 no-bid “communications services” contract for a company she had used as a campaign consultant when running for lieutenant governor in 2016.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University and Netflix have announced a $5.4 million endowed scholarship to honor the late actor, writer, producer and Howard alumnus Chadwick Boseman, WUSA-TV reports. The Chadwick A. Boseman Memorial Scholarship will provide incoming students in the College of Fine Arts, recently named for Boseman, with a four-year scholarship to cover the full cost of tuition, the university said. “This scholarship embodies Chadwick’s love for Howard, his passion for storytelling, and his willingness to support future generations of Howard students,” Howard University President Dr. Wayne A.I. Frederick said in a release. “I am thankful for the continuous support and partnership of Chadwick’s wife, Mrs. Simone Ledward-Boseman, and to Netflix for this important gift.” The scholarship was established with the support of Ledward-Boseman, with Netflix as the inaugural donor. The first four scholarships were earmarked for one recipient in each class beginning this fall, and they’ll continue to be distributed to an incoming freshman every year. The university said the scholarship will focus on students who exemplify exceptional skills in the arts, reminiscent of Boseman, and who demonstrate financial need.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state is investigating dozens of local governments, performing arts centers, the Miami Marlins, a law enforcement counterterrorism unit and a concert by singer Harry Styles for violating a law prohibiting businesses and governments from requiring people to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. About 120 cases are being reviewed for violations of Florida’s “vaccine passport” law, which took effect last month and can result in a $5,000 fine per violation, according to a public records request from the Orlando Sentinel. The law is being challenged in court and conflicts with a Biden administration order that companies with over 100 employees require them to be vaccinated or face weekly coronavirus testing. In central Florida, the list includes Orange County government; the Orange County Convention Center; AdventHealth, one of the state’s largest health care systems; several performing arts venues; and the Amway Center, which is home to the Orlando Magic and recently hosted a concert by Styles whose tour mandated attendees either be vaccinated or have a negative test. “At this point … the courts have not reached the final decision, but the indication is that the Florida law flies in the face of our Florida Constitution and perhaps in the face of common sense,” Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings told the newspaper.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Officials in Fulton County, where election operations are already under review by the state, have fired two workers accused of shredding paper voter registration applications, according to a county statement released Monday. Preliminary information indicates the employees checked out batches of applications for processing, and they are alleged to have shredded some of the forms, the Fulton County statement said. Fellow employees reported the alleged actions to their supervisor Friday morning, and the two employees were fired that day. The county statement said the applications were received in the past two weeks. Fulton County includes most of the city of Atlanta, where voters are set to go to the polls Nov. 2 to elect a mayor, City Council members and other municipal officials. The deadline to register to vote in that election was Oct. 4. It’s not immediately clear whether the 300 voter registration records in question were lost, county spokeswoman Jessica Corbitt said. “Normally, processing a voter registration application involves entering them in the state system, updating them, verifying their information,” she said. “That is the matter that’s under investigation – was that process completed.” Voters don’t register by party in Georgia, so the applications had no party affiliation.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: The median sales price of a single-family home in Maui County dropped below $1 million last month as people priced out of the market have chosen to pause their homebuying. The Maui News reports the median sales price for a single-family home in the county stood at $996,500 in September. That’s up 27.3% from the same month last year. But it’s below levels from May through August, when the median topped $1 million for four straight months. Median sales prices for single-family homes in Kauai and Honolulu counties have also topped $1 million this year. The September report from the Realtors Association of Maui said declining affordability has had “a significant impact” on homebuyers who have been priced out of the market. Association President Keone Ball said Sunday that he believes prices will go back up. “The problem is the volume – you know, there isn’t enough for sale,” he said, noting that low inventory combined with high demand for affordable housing is also a nationwide problem. Pending sales decreased 4.3% for single-family homes in Maui County but increased 5.7% for condominiums. Ball said investment in condos may have spiked due to the settling of the COVID-19 pandemic, affordability and condominiums being “the only option.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials will make available up to $200,000 to be divided into payments for hunters and trappers who kill wolves in the state through next summer. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game late last month entered into an agreement with a nonprofit hunting group to reimburse the expenses for a proven kill. The agreement follows a change in Idaho law aimed at killing more wolves that are blamed for attacking livestock and reducing deer and elk herds. Montana this year also expanded when, where and how wolves can be killed. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at the request of environmental groups concerned about the expanded wolf killing in the two states, last month announced a yearlong review to see if wolves in the U.S. West should be relisted under the Endangered Species Act. Idaho has managed wolves since they were taken off the list in 2011. State wildlife managers had been incrementally increasing wolf harvest during that time – but not fast enough for lawmakers, who earlier this year passed the law backed by some trappers and the powerful ranching sector. Republican Gov. Brad Little signed the measure lawmakers said could lead to killing 90% of the state’s 1,500 wolves before federal authorities would take over management.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Al Capone died nearly 75 years ago, but it’s clear interest in the infamous Chicago gangster is very much alive after some of his prized possessions were auctioned off over the weekend for at least $3 million. The Chicago Tribune reports Capone’s family sold several of his belongings, including what was billed as his favorite gun, at auction in California, where his three surviving granddaughters live. The event, called “A Century of Notoriety: The Estate of Al Capone,” was held at a private club in Sacramento and attracted nearly 1,000 registered bidders, including 150 who attended the nearly four-hour-long event in person. Among the items up for auction was a bear-shaped humidor as well as diamond jewelry and some family photographs. The most popular item proved to be Capone’s favorite Colt .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol, which went for $860,000. The story of Capone, the original “Scarface,” is a familiar one, thanks in large part to a host of movies, television shows and books about the mobster. Called Public Enemy No. 1 after the 1929 “Valentine’s Day Massacre” in which seven members of a rival bootlegger gang were gunned down in a Lincoln Park parking garage, Capone was convicted of income tax evasion in 1934. He spent 11 years locked up in Alcatraz and died of a heart attack in 1947.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than 6,600 Afghan refugees who began arriving at the Indiana National Guard’s Camp Atterbury training post nearly six weeks ago are awaiting resettlement. Additional evacuees are expected to arrive in the coming weeks, although it’s unclear how many, said Mark Howell, regional spokesman for the federal Transportation Security Administration overseeing Operation Allies Welcome. Officials said they’re also uncertain if the refugees will be permanently resettled by early November, as hoped. Howell said Friday that many Afghans are still completing medical and security screening checks. Once cleared, they’ll work with nongovernmental organizations to determine housing assignments, sponsor families and work authorizations before they can leave the post. Camp Atterbury, about 25 miles south of Indianapolis, is one of eight sites in the U.S. that the Department of Defense is using for Afghan special immigrant visa applicants, their families and other Afghan personnel. Exodus Refugee Immigration, an Indianapolis agency, has helped at least four Afghan families resettle in the city in the past month, Executive Director Cole Varga said. They were all U.S. citizens or had visas and family ties to the area. It’s unclear how many Afghans have resettled in Indiana, but the state is projected to take 490, according to U.S. officials.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A judge has found a local activist guilty of a felony theft count for taking a police flyer used to identify protesters from an officer’s back pocket during a protest last year. Alexandria Dea, 27, was found guilty of first-degree theft Monday by Judge David Porter after she waived her right to a jury trial and consented to allow the judge to base his decision on facts already on the record. Dea is expected to seek a deferred judgment when she’s sentenced Dec. 7. Prosecutors have said Dea picked up and threw a police radio that fell to the ground as the officer scuffled with a protester July 1, 2020. She was also accused of taking the intelligence bulletin from an officer’s back pocket during the confrontation, then giving it to another Black Lives Matter activist who gave it to a television reporter. Dea and the other activist had also initially been charged with a rarely used count of leaking intelligence data, but the charge was dismissed in July after a judge ruled that the bulletin did not count as “intelligence data.”\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: An organization run by rapper Jay-Z has facilitated donations totaling $1 million for an effort to investigate wrongful convictions in Wyandotte County. The money was raised by Team Roc, which is the criminal justice division of Jay-Z’s entertainment organization, Roc Nation, the Kansas City Star reports. Tricia Rojo Bushnell, executive director of the Midwest Innocence Project, called it “a huge investment,” adding that the ability to look at these cases is going to shine a light on what the group needs to do to provide a just criminal legal system in Wyandotte County. Among those injustices is the wrongful conviction of Lamonte McIntyre, who spent 23 years in prison for two murders he did not commit in Kansas City, Kansas. Another is the case of Olin “Pete” Coones Jr., who spent 12 years in prison before he was exonerated of a Wyandotte County murder – only to die from cancer that went undiagnosed 108 days after he was freed. About 40 others have asked the innocence project to investigate their convictions in Wyandotte County, Rojo Bushnell said Monday. In September, Team Roc filed a petition seeking records from the Kansas City, Kansas, police department related to what it calls a history of officer misconduct within the agency.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The city has agreed to pay $75,000 to a couple who say police removed them from their car and frisked them because they were Black and driving a nice vehicle. But in an unusual condition of the payment, the couple and their lawyers are forbidden from criticizing the Louisville Metro Government or the police officers involved. The prohibition includes criticisms in statements to the media or on social media, according to a copy of the settlement obtained under open records laws. Michael Abate, a lawyer for the Louisville Courier Journal and the Kentucky Press Association, said the stipulations are “totally improper.” “The city is paying to silence its critics,” he said. “It is paying them off. And it seems designed to impede reform. It is bad policy and really troubling.” In a statement, First Assistant County Attorney Ingrid Geiser said the couple “are not prohibited from talking truthfully about what happened during their traffic stop,” though she said the language “should have more accurately reflected the agreement of the parties.” In their federal lawsuit, Anthony Parker Sr. and Demetria Firman, who are now married, say they were pulled over in 2018 for failing to use a turn signal, but body camera footage from one of the officers showed their turn signal was on.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s problem of wasted COVID-19 vaccine shots continues to balloon, with about 224,000 doses thrown out across Louisiana as health providers can’t find enough residents willing to roll up their sleeves. The number of trashed doses has nearly tripled since the end of July, even as the state grappled with a fourth, deadly surge of the coronavirus pandemic during that time that led to increased interest in the vaccines. The latest data provided by the Louisiana Department of Health showed 223,918 doses of the two-shot Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine have been thrown out. That’s relatively small compared to the 4.4 million vaccine doses administered around the state. But while waste is not uncommon in mass immunization efforts, the throwing away of doses in the United States comes as millions of people around the globe still are waiting for the opportunity to get inoculated against COVID-19. Most of Louisiana’s wasted vaccine doses happened because vials containing the shots were opened, but hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and other providers couldn’t find someone to take the doses, health department spokesperson Kevin Litten said. More than 21,500 shots simply weren’t used before their expiration dates. Louisiana has one of the nation’s lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Environmental regulators will soon undertake a statewide investigation to find concentrations of long-lasting environmental pollutants. The investigation stems from the state’s efforts to mitigate a class of chemicals known as PFAS, also called “forever chemicals.” The substances are a problem in some parts of Maine because of the long-standing use of municipal sludge and paper mill waste as farm fertilizer, the Portland Press Herald reports. The state set aside $30 million to test for the chemicals and install filtration systems in areas with contaminated water. Maine officials also plan to help farmers and start cleaning up sites, the Press Herald reports. Maine is hiring and training 17 new staff members for the effort. The state needs to decide which of more than 500 sludge application sites should be prioritized for testing. Sewage sludge as farm fertilizer has caused environmental problems in other parts of the country as well. The chemicals also carry human health risks.\n\nMaryland\n\nGaithersburg: Four police officers will not be charged for fatally shooting a Black man they said fired first during a late-night foot chase in January. A grand jury declined to charge the officers from the Gaithersburg Police Department due to lack of evidence in a decision announced last week. The officers, members of a plainclothes street crimes unit, told investigators they saw a “muzzle flash” from a gun aimed at them by Kwamena Ocran, 24, according to their recorded statements released by Montgomery County prosecutors. One officer said he heard a round pass by his head. All four fired on Ocran, who was running away from them. He was hit eight times, according to a report from prosecutors. The shooting happened outside an apartment complex after officers said they received a tip that Ocran was illegally carrying a gun he intended to sell, according to the report. The incident was not recorded on video. Another officer arrived at the scene moments later and recorded footage of a gun next to Ocran’s body, but investigators could not find evidence he had fired it. Crime scene technicians failed to find shell casings from Ocran’s gun – only the 23 shell casings from the officers’ guns, prosecutors said. Howard County Deputy State’s Attorney Christopher Sandmann told The Washington Post that investigators had prepped Ocran’s hands for gunshot reside analysis, but there was a “mistake or miscommunication,” and his hands were never swabbed.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A letter written by founding father Alexander Hamilton during the Revolutionary War and believed stolen decades ago from the state archives has been returned following a federal appeals court decision, officials said Tuesday. Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin hailed the homecoming, after last week’s decision by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a previous ruling by a district court judge. The letter was reputedly stolen between 1938 and 1945 by a “kleptomaniacal cataloguer” who worked at the archives, according to the court decision. Hamilton wrote the letter to the Marquis de Lafayette, a French aristocrat who served as a general in the Continental Army. Dated July 21, 1780, the letter resulted in Massachusetts sending troops to Rhode Island “to bolster the embattled French forces,” the appeals court wrote. Galvin, whose office oversees the archives and the Commonwealth Museum, said he was pleased the court ruled “that this historical treasure belongs to the people.” The letter is expected to be put on display at the museum for special events, including the annual Independence Day celebration, Galvin said.\n\nMichigan\n\nCenter Line: An employee at a suburban Detroit nursing home filled out absentee ballot applications for two dozen residents without consulting them before the 2020 election, authorities said Monday. The case was one of three cases of alleged fraud announced by the state. “Our election system is secure, and today’s charges demonstrate that in the rare circumstances when fraud occurs, we catch it and hold the perpetrators accountable,” Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said. A woman who worked at the Father Murray home in Center Line was charged with election forgery and signature forgery. In another case, a Detroit woman was accused of signing her grandson’s name on an absentee ballot and returning it, even though he had decided to vote at a polling place. In a third investigation, a woman who served as a guardian was charged in several communities after authorities said she fraudulently submitted 26 absentee ballot applications and sought to have ballots mailed directly to her. Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel praised local election officials for noticing irregularities. “We will not hesitate to prosecute anyone who attempts to undermine our elections,” Nessel said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBeaver Bay: A Lake Superior lighthouse plans to welcome visitors back for an annual memorial honoring the sailors who died when the Edmund Fitzgerald sank. Every Nov. 10, the day the ship sank in a gale in 1975, the Split Rock Lighthouse just south of Beaver Bay holds a beacon lighting. Lighthouse officials announce the names of all 29 sailors who died as a bell tolls, Minnesota Public Radio reports. The lighthouse didn’t allow visitors to attend last year’s ceremony because of COVID-19 concerns. People had to listen through an online livestream. Lighthouse officials say this year’s ceremony will be a hybrid, with the lighthouse grounds open to the public and a livestream on the Minnesota Historical Society’s Facebook and YouTube pages for those who can’t attend. The ceremony will begin at 4:30 p.m. “There’s something about being here on site and hearing the bell ring and the names being read off and then seeing the beacon turned on right after that. There’s just something very special about that,” said Hayes Scriven, the lighthouse site manager. “It’s just a way to connect with the past and remember that Lake Superior is a fickle animal, and you’ve got to respect the power and not take it for granted.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Book Festival is being shown online after the in-person event was canceled because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers say videos of 31 panel discussions have been recorded in the past month. Those became available Tuesday on the festival’s website, msbookfestival.com. “We’ve got an amazing group of authors and moderators who have rallied to record more than 35 hours of great conversations about books and writing,” Executive Director Ellen Daniels said in a news release. “Honoring these writers and continuing to engage our loyal and growing community of book lovers is what the festival is all about.” Among the authors speaking are Curtis Wilkie, Kiese Laymon, Nic Stone, W. Ralph Eubanks, Jerry Mitchell, Catherine Pierce, Beth Ann Fennelly, Mitch Landrieu, William Ferris, Angie Thomas, Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Robert Khayat and Kai Bird. The festival originally was scheduled for Aug. 21 at the Mississippi Capitol and nearby Galloway United Methodist Church in downtown Jackson. Organizers switched to the online format because the state was experiencing a surge of COVID-19 cases at the time.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Data shows that most of the people who participated in the state’s COVID-19 vaccine lottery were already immunized before the program started. The incentive program was started in July as Missouri struggled to control a surge of coronavirus cases driven by the more transmissible delta variant in less-vaccinated communities. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services conducted the last of the drawings in the program Friday. Among the participants, 57,117 adults got the shot after the program was announced, while nearly 600,000 got the shot beforehand, The Kansas City Star reports. The program also had more than 39,000 entries from children 12 and up. In total, the state will pay out $9 million to 900 prizewinners, who will each receive $10,000 in either cash or, for the youth winners, scholarship accounts. Anyone who had gotten at least one dose of a vaccine was eligible to enter, but separate drawings were conducted for those who had already gotten a shot, making the odds of winning higher for the newly vaccinated. Just over 48% of Missouri’s total population is fully vaccinated now, up from about 40% when the incentive program was announced.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: All local calls in the state must be dialed with the 406 area code to connect beginning Oct. 24 due to changing federal regulations. Montana’s 406 area code currently allows seven-digit dialing to complete local calls. That will change this month due to a Federal Communications Commission order designating 988 as the new nationwide number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Some seven-digit phone numbers in Montana’s 406 area code begin with 988. To prevent misdialing the 988 Lifeline, all local calls in Montana must be dialed with the area code. Calls that are currently considered local for billing purposes will continue to be billed as local calls. Existing seven-digit phone numbers will not change but will require the 406 area code to connect. Three-digit dialing services, such as the 911 emergency number, will continue to work as a three-digit number with no need to dial an area code. Along with manually dialed calls, all services that use automated dialing will need to be updated to include 10-digit phone numbers. The 988 number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline will be available beginning July 16, 2022.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Police are investigating after downtown pedestrians were forced to dodge deck chairs, tables and bricks thrown from a rooftop. The Omaha World-Herald reports the incident happened Saturday night when items were thrown from the roof of the nine-story Old Market Lofts apartments. Omaha resident Lisa Brauer told the newspaper she was nearly struck by several objects. Brauer, who works for Park Omaha, was checking parking meters when she was nearly hit by a rock. That was followed by a metal table, a metal chair and a grill rack, all landing within inches of her. A police report said a pickup truck was hit by something and sustained $2,000 in damage. No arrests have been made.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Two historic locomotives that were part of the pioneering shift from steam-powered to diesel-electric trains in the mid-1900s are coming back to their home in a northeast Nevada railyard. Built in 1951, Locomotive 201 is the last survivor among 38 experimental models manufactured by the American Locomotive Company. It is scheduled to be loaded onto a truck Nov. 2 at the Northwest Railway Museum in Snoqualmie, Washington, where it still sometimes pulls excursion trains on the museum’s Snoqualmie Valley Railroad. The truck hauling the 286,000-pound engine will take four or five days at a top speed of about 35 mph to make the 900-mile trip back to Ely at the Nevada Northern Railway Museum near the Nevada-Utah line, railway President Mark Bassett said. Details are still pending for the return from Delta, Utah, of the No. 401, the first special-duty model General Motors built in 1952 in its Electro-Motive Division. It was the only one painted in the “Desert War Bonnet” scheme, a cream, scarlet and black design that remains on it today. It became known as the “Last Empress of Ely.” “These both are one-of-a-kind locomotives,” Bassett said. “Both have a story to tell, and they are both tied into the early days of dieselization of the Nevada Northern Railway.” The museum plans to restore each and eventually return them to operation for tour rides.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: For the first time, New Hampshire’s only state-run psychiatric treatment facility has negotiated contracts with all major insurance carriers in the state. Carriers now under contract with New Hampshire Hospital include Aetna, Ambetter, Anthem, Cigna, Harvard Pilgrim and United Health Care, state officials said. “Over the past few years, we have made significant strides to rebuild New Hampshire’s mental health system, and those critical efforts will continue,” Gov. Chris Sununu said in a statement. “Having insurer contracts in place is an important step and will help alleviate the financial uncertainty that has been a challenge for patients at New Hampshire Hospital for decades.” Previously, special case agreements were negotiated on a patient-by-patient basis. However, some care was uncompensated. The practice of New Hampshire Hospital is to accept all patients regardless of insurance coverage. New Hampshire Hospital is currently the only inpatient institute for adults with serious mental illnesses in the state.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: No one understands the stress a nurse faces on the job better than another nurse. And nothing has caused more stress for nurses than the COVID pandemic, as front-line caregivers guard against exposure to the coronavirus, witness patient deaths, and worry about family members and friends becoming infected. A confidential mental health help line, staffed by current and retired nurses, was launched Monday for nurses and their family members in the state. The Nurse2Nurse help line – at 844-687-7301 – is based at Rutgers Behavioral Health Services and available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. “It’s in our hearts to help the healers,” said Barbara Brilliantine, one of the nurses staffing the help line. “We’ve walked in their shoes.” The counselors include active and retired nurses who receive training in reciprocal peer support and wellness principles and are mental health and peer support specialists. Services are also available through virtual support groups, wellness webinars and other resources at nurse2nursenj.com. Information provided on the calls is confidential, the sponsors say. The website says the project is not affiliated with any health care system or nursing organization, and no information from the calls will be shared with employers, co-workers or peers.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The final price tag for a settlement reached by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and a former campaign spokesman to settle accusations of harassment is now $150,000. The latest round of payments was disclosed in a mandatory campaign finance report that the Democrat’s campaign filed Monday. The twice-annual report on spending and contributions shows the incumbent has raised $2.5 million since April for her reelection bid as several Republicans are vying to take back the office. GOP state Rep. Rebecca Dow raised more than $440,500 since announcing her candidacy in early July. Her campaign said she has received contributions from more than 1,300 donors. In the settlement involving Lujan Grisham, former campaign staffer James Hallinan had accused Lujan Grisham of dropping water on his crotch and then grabbing his crotch in the midst of a campaign staff meeting prior to the election – accusations that the governor denies. Lujan Grisham said earlier this year that she decided to resolve the matter because she wanted to focus her attention on the pandemic. At the time, the governor said there hadn’t been any other financial settlements and nondisclosure agreements of a similar nature.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Recreational marijuana legalization is moving into a new phase. After stifling staff delays brought on by political infighting, newly minted members of the state Cannabis Control Board are now interpreting and shaping the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, the cannabis law approved by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and lawmakers last spring. Much of what the redefined medical cannabis program and the implementation of the potentially lucrative legal market will look like in the Empire State is in the purview of the five-person panel, which had its first meeting last week. The board must do that work while putting particular emphasis on social equity and repairing the harms done during the substance’s prohibition. Already, language in the law has legalized possession of 3 ounces of cannabis for people 21 and over. However, some of the regulations for localities, as well as the licensing process and social equity provisions, have yet to materialize. Kristin Jordan of Park Jordan, a commercial real estate brokerage and cannabis industry advisory firm, said the cannabis regulators don’t have a model in other states in how to legalize while accentuating social equity. “So I think more than anything we’ve got a roadmap of what didn’t work,” said Jordan, the firm’s founder and CEO.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is facing calls to resign from elected officials and LGBTQ advocacy groups over comments he made criticizing sexual education and likening gay and transgender people to “filth.” “There’s no reason anybody anywhere in America should be telling any child about transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth,” Robinson said at Asbury Baptist Church in Seagrove. The state’s highest Republican executive officeholder, already the focus of criticism for trying to influence how racism can be discussed in public schools, is getting more pushback since Right Wing Watch, a project of the progressive advocacy group People for the American Way, posted the video on social media last week. The Human Rights Campaign, Equality North Carolina, prominent Democratic lawmakers and the White House have condemned the remarks, with some demanding the lieutenant governor’s resignation. In a video posted on his Facebook page Saturday, Robinson narrated over images depicting gay sex that were taken from “Gender Queer,” an illustrated book he claimed “is currently in North Carolina schools,” though it wasn’t mentioned in the 831-page report he released in August highlighting cases of alleged “indoctrination.” In 2017, Robinson wrote: “You CAN NOT love God and support the homosexual agenda.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State wildlife officials are urging people to keep an eye out for migrating whooping cranes. The North Dakota Fish and Game Department says a portion of a population of 500 cranes is crossing the state on a 2,500-mile migration from nesting grounds at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada to wintering grounds in Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas. The agency says anyone who spots cranes should leave them alone but record the date, time and location along with the birds’ activities and report the sighting to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The reports help biologists locate crane habitat areas, monitor marked birds, and determine population numbers and migration routes.\n\nOhio\n\nNelsonville: Thanks to a long-forgotten state law from 1953 and a community dinner, the city has challenged the results of the 2020 U.S. census. The results of last year’s count had downgraded the Athens County community from a city to a village after counting 4,612 residents – a 780-person drop from the 2010 census. Under Ohio law, the 5,000-resident level demarcates the difference between a city and a village. “We knew it was wrong,” City Auditor Taylor Sappington said. On Tuesday morning, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose agreed, restoring Nelsonville’s city status. Sappington set out to prove the city’s case by collecting census information and signatures from the town’s 5,373 residents. After a preliminary federal census report demotes a city to a village, state law gives a city auditor the authority to conduct a re-enumeration if the municipality’s governing body passes a resolution directing the auditor to do so, according to a statute in the Ohio Revised Code. After the City Council took that action, Sappington appointed five enumerators, who canvassed each block of Nelsonville over 10 days. Last week, volunteers served ham, green beans, cheesy potatoes, salad and rolls donated by Texas Roadhouse at a free community dinner where residents could come down to the town square to be counted, Sappington told council members Monday night. “I’m so proud of this community,” he said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The city and Tulsa County have each announced they will officially recognize Juneteenth as a holiday. June 19 will be an additional paid holiday for city and county employees beginning in 2022. June 19, 1865, is the day Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas – some 21/ 2 years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation had freed slaves in Southern states. “Juneteenth is an important day in our country’s history, and I’m glad we are able to celebrate freedom for all Americans in this way by joining Tulsa County in adding Juneteenth to our official holiday schedule,” Mayor G.T. Bynum said in a statement Monday announcing the holiday. A 1921 massacre in Tulsa left an estimated 300 Black people dead at the hands of white mobs. Then-President Donald Trump scheduled his first campaign rally amid the coronavirus pandemic for June 19, 2020, in Tulsa but later rescheduled the rally for the following day amid widespread criticism from Black leaders. In June, President Joe Biden signed legislation officially recognizing the day as a federal holiday.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Former Oregon Secretary of State Bev Clarno and three other Republicans have filed a lawsuit to challenge new congressional districts recently passed by state lawmakers. They say the new maps are partisan gerrymandering, unconstitutional and contrary to state law. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the suit, filed Monday in Marion County Circuit Court, is the first such attempt to alter the six-district map that Democrats pushed through during a contentious special legislative session last month. That session nearly ended in a Republican walkout after House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, reneged on a deal to grant the GOP an equal say in new congressional and legislative maps. Instead, Republican lawmakers showed up on the last possible day and allowed Democrats to pass a map that could lead to Democratic control of five of the state’s now-six seats in Congress. Oregon picked up an additional U.S. House seat because of population gains recorded by the recent U.S. census. The suit notes that four of the state’s six new congressional districts include part of the Portland metro area, which the Republicans say is a sign Democrats improperly stocked the districts with left-leaning voters. They have asked the court to block the plan and draw its own.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Total enrollment at Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities has declined to the lowest level in decades, according to data released Monday. The State System of Higher Education figures indicate loss of another 5,000-plus students this fall, dropping the universities’ total enrollment below 89,000 students – a level not seen in more than three decades, dating nearly to the system’s founding, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. PennLive.com reports the percentage drop in enrollment was the highest in well over two decades. System officials earlier warned state lawmakers and others that the 2021-22 year would be a “very challenging” one for enrollment, citing factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The system, founded in 1983, saw its enrollment peak at about 119,500 students in 2010 but saw the total drop to 94,000 last year. A review of system data indicates that the current total below 89,000 is lower than in any year since 1989, the Post-Gazette reports. Chancellor Dan Greenstein said the drop likely stems from the pandemic finally catching up with the system, which had avoided the declines other institutions saw last year. He said anecdotal accounts point to the pandemic’s impact on family incomes and students taking advantage of $15 and $20 per hour wages some firms are offering.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza wants to spend up to $1.6 million in federal coronavirus relief funding to establish nonviolence training and youth mentorship programs to address an increase in violence in the city. Providence recently opened requests for proposals for both initiatives, planning to allocate up to $500,000 in American Rescue Plan funds for training and up to $1.1 million for mentorship. Elorza said the idea began taking shape in May when nine people were injured in a shooting. “I reached out to some community leaders, sort of on the front line of things, and I asked them to put me in contact with families, mothers who had lost children, people who were either on parole or on probation, but were trying to turn their life around, and other folks who are on the front lines of living and working with these issues,” Elorza said. It became clear that the city was in need of more opportunities for youth, he said. There have been 20 homicides in the city this year. The five-year average for this point in the year is 11.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The South Carolina State Fair returns Wednesday after a hiatus brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Last year’s event was drive-thru only due to a high number of COVID-19 cases. On Tuesday, Department of Health and Environmental Control officials reported that such cases have dropped below 1,000 for the first time since July. More than 50% of South Carolinians are fully vaccinated against the disease caused by the virus. State fair officials have instituted new protocols to prevent the virus’s spread, including increased cleaning, hygiene signage, hand sanitizer stations and reminding guests that in Columbia they must wear a face covering, WIS-TV reports. Guests are also encouraged to socially distance, use card and touchless methods for payments, and not come to the fair if they aren’t feeling well. The event, which runs through Oct. 24, includes rides, food, agriculture and livestock shows, crafts, art and a cookie kitchen.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers redrawing the state’s political boundaries kicked off a three-day tour of public input meetings Monday amid intraparty Republican bickering and competing proposals for new legislative districts. The House and Senate committees, both dominated by Republicans, had previously sought accord in the once-in-a-decade process. But at a public input meeting in Box Elder, the schism between the House and Senate was on full display during the tour, dubbed “the redistricting roadshow” by lawmakers. The Legislature will convene Nov. 8 to consider new political boundaries, which must also be approved by Gov. Kristi Noem. If they can’t reach a consensus by Dec. 1, redistricting would be determined by the state Supreme Court. As Republicans accused each other of gerrymandering and “D.C. political tactics,” members of Native American communities used the meetings to press for greater representation in the Legislature. At the first meeting Monday, advocates pushed for compact political boundaries around northern Rapid City, which has a large number of Native Americans, that would allow the community to elect someone who represents its interests. The lawmakers are making seven stops this week, culminating with two meetings in Sioux Falls on Wednesday.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Tuesday slightly tweaked his order requiring Knox County schools to implement a school mask mandate, saying officials would be allowed to approve exemptions on a case-by-case basis. In his 14-page ruling, however, U.S. District Judge J. Ronnie Greer warned school officials – who had previously refused to adopt a mask mandate amid the COVID-19 outbreak – that the new mask exemption policy must not be abused. “The court reminds the Knox County Board of Education that its school system is no longer under a voluntary mask mandate; rather, it is under a court-ordered mask mandate,” Greer wrote. “The record evidence supports the need for – and the court ordered – a universal mask mandate, and the court fully expects its mask mandate to be exactly that: universal, to every possible extent, with ‘very few’ medical exemptions.” The Knox County Board of Education must file monthly status reports that identify not only the number of exemptions for students, employees and visitors but also the specific reasons for the exemptions. Greer said he would impose “considerable sanctions” if the education board did not comply with his latest order.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The state’s child welfare agency is being accused of removing a webpage that provided information about a suicide prevention hotline and other resources for young LGBTQ people, following criticism by one of Gov. Greg Abbott’s primary challengers. The Houston Chronicle reports Abbott challenger Don Huffines posted a video on Twitter in August accusing the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services of “promoting transgender sexual policies to Texas youth.” Within hours of the video being posted, the webpage was removed. The page appeared in a section of the agency’s website called “Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation.” Also gone was the entire website for the Texas Youth Connection, a division of Family and Protective Services that steers young people in foster care to various resources, including education, housing and those on its LGBTQ page. “These are not Texas values, these are not Republican Party values, but these are obviously Greg Abbott’s values,” Huffines said in his video. Abbott, who appoints the department’s commissioner and nine-member council, didn’t respond to the newspaper’s request for comment. Agency communications obtained through a public records request show that employees discussed removing the page in response to Huffines’ tweet.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Lawyers for Gov. Spencer Cox’s former campaign manager, who resigned last week after an investigation substantiated claims of sexual misconduct made against him by a female campaign employee, are calling the accusations baseless. In a statement Friday, lawyers representing Austin Cox said the relationship in question was a long-term one between two young adults that he ended earlier this year, KUTV reports. “Our client unequivocally and emphatically denies any allegations to the contrary,” the statement said. The Republican governor said Thursday that an independent investigation found cause to terminate Austin Cox, his 2020 campaign manager, but he resigned before its completion. The investigation also revealed previously unreported “hostile conduct” toward other members of the team. Austin Cox’s attorneys on Friday additionally criticized a joint statement from the governor and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson on Thursday that condemned the former campaign manager’s behavior. KUTV requested to speak with Austin Cox on Friday, but his attorney declined their request for an interview. The governor and former campaign manager are not related.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: An Abraham Lincoln statue at a museum was vandalized with the number “38,” which police say they believe is a reference to the execution of 38 Native Americans ordered by the former president in 1862. Police said an employee at the Bennington Museum arrived Sunday morning to find a large “LAND BACK” banner had been put up between two light poles at the entrance to the museum’s courtyard. The Lincoln statue in the courtyard had reddish spray paint on its face and hands, along with the number “38” painted on its chest, police said. Officials said it is expected to cost several thousand dollars to repair the statue and remove the paint. Police said they believe the vandalism is a reference to the Dakota 38, who were executed after the 1862 Dakota War, also known as the Sioux Uprising of 1862. A military commission sentenced 303 Sioux fighters to be executed. Lincoln reviewed the cases and decided there was evidence that 39 Sioux were guilty of murder or rape during the uprising and ordered their execution. The remaining 264 sentences were commuted. One of those sentenced to be executed received a reprieve. The Bennington Museum describes itself as a museum of art, history and innovation.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Former President Barack Obama will campaign with fellow Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the final stretch of the gubernatorial race. “The stakes could not be greater,” McAuliffe said as he announced the news Tuesday morning on MSNBC. McAuliffe’s race against the GOP nominee, first-time political candidate Glenn Youngkin, is tightening, according to the latest polls. His effort to win a second, nonconsecutive term in office is one of only two regularly scheduled governor’s races in the country this year and is being closely watched for indications of voter sentiment ahead of next year’s midterms. McAuliffe’s campaign announced that Obama will join him in Richmond on Oct. 23 to mobilize Virginians during early voting, which began weeks ago and runs in person through Oct. 30. Obama rallied Democrats in Virginia’s capital city in 2017 before Ralph Northam beat Republican gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie by nearly 9 percentage points. He’ll follow other high-profile Democrats visiting the commonwealth to support McAuliffe. First lady Jill Biden is set to visit on Friday. Stacey Abrams, the voting rights activist, grassroots organizer and former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate, will campaign with McAuliffe in Norfolk and northern Virginia on Sunday.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Rewards totaling $2.5 million are now being offered for information that helps solve the killing of federal prosecutor Thomas C. Wales in Seattle 20 years ago. Nicholas Brown, newly sworn in as the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Washington, announced Monday at a ceremony marking the anniversary of Wales’ death that the Justice Department had doubled its reward to $2 million, in addition to about $500,000 being offered by the National Association of Former U.S. Attorneys. Brown also said his office – long recused from the case – is taking on leadership of the investigation, as there are few remaining assistant U.S. attorneys in Seattle who worked with Wales. The investigation had been overseen by a special prosecutor in New York, Steve Clymer; transferring the oversight to Seattle will allow for fresh eyes and additional resources, Brown said. “Twenty years is far too long for this crime – this attack on the American justice system – to go unresolved,” Brown said. Wales was an 18-year veteran of the U.S. attorney’s office who focused on white-collar crime and also served as president of a gun-control group called Washington CeaseFire. A gunman shot him through a basement window of his home Oct. 11, 2001.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Lawmakers endorsed proposed maps of congressional and state legislative districts during a special session on redistricting Monday, setting up a potential fight between two of the state’s current members of Congress. West Virginia lost one of its three U.S. House seats after the 2020 census, and lawmakers are trying to redraw the state into two congressional districts. In the proposed map, Rep. David McKinley and Rep. Alex Mooney would be in the same district. All three current U.S. House members from West Virginia are Republicans. The state Senate redistricting committee forwarded its versions of congressional and state Senate maps Monday. Earlier in the day, a map that reconfigures all 100 House of Delegates seats into separate, single-member districts was endorsed by a House committee. The maps now go before the committees’ respective full chambers. The congressional redistricting map endorsed by the House committee would split the state roughly into north and south sections. The 1st District would include both panhandles and much of the northern part of the state along with Wood County on the western edge. The 2nd District would include the southern coalfields and the Greenbrier Valley, extending north into Ritchie County.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s Democratic attorney general, who represents the state elections commission, on Monday called for a Republican-ordered investigation into the 2020 presidential election to be shut down, saying it is a partisan political effort that lacks credibility, wastes taxpayer money and is not serious. “This investigation suffers from glaring flaws that destroy any credibility its results could have had,” Attorney General Josh Kaul said at a news conference. “Shut this fake investigation down.” Kaul’s comments came after the Republican leader of the Assembly election committee said she’s been kept out of the loop and doesn’t agree with moves being made by the leader of the probe. The latest twists comes after Michael Gableman, the retired Wisconsin Supreme Court justice leading the investigation, issued a video over the weekend taking aim at Gov. Tony Evers. The Democratic governor told local election officials they should be “lawyered up” and called the taxpayer-funded investigation a “$700,000 boondoggle.” Gableman called that “an incomplete and misguided view” of the probe. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos ordered the investigation under pressure from Donald Trump, who has falsely claimed he won Wisconsin last year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Rapper, music producer and clothing entrepreneur Kanye West has put his ranch and business properties in northwestern Wyoming up for sale. The West Ranch, formerly known as Monster Lake Ranch, went on the market Monday for $11 million. The property sprawls across 6 square miles of open land and tree-studded hills and outcrops about 6 miles south of Cody. The property features lakes, a lodge, a commercial kitchen, equipment sheds, a horse facility, corrals and a go-kart track, according to the DBW Realty listing. The listing came days after West listed his seven commercial properties in Cody for more than $3.2 million, the Cody Enterprise reports. The ranch, which leases additional land owned by the U.S. government, was listed for $13.3 million before West bought it in 2019, though it’s unknown how much he paid for the property. Wyoming law does not provide for public disclosure of real estate sale amounts. West moved from California to Wyoming in 2019 and set about basing at least some of his clothing business in Cody, a city of about 10,000 on the eastern approach to Yellowstone National Park. It wasn’t clear if the property sales mean West is leaving Wyoming or just reorganizing his business there.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/23/nuns-donate-home-canines-court-swine-control-news-around-states/118941372/", "title": "Nuns donate home, canines in court: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: Archaeologists are analyzing pieces of pottery, nails and glass found at Pope’s Tavern, an inn and stagecoach stop for travelers dating back to the early 1800s before Alabama achieved statehood. A state team funded by a grant recently conducted a dig at the northwest Alabama site, which has a museum that focuses on the history of the city of Florence. Museum curator Brian Murphy told the TimesDaily pottery was the most common item discovered during the work. “They pulled out a bunch of artifacts that are being cleaned and processed right now,” Murphy said. “They will give us a really good image of the types of materials and type of utensils used, and really a glimpse into the daily life of the people who lived there and used that space.” The crew also found the brick remains of an old structure that could have been a hearth or outbuilding, he said. “They are seeing what type of materials are associated with that, using flotation, which brings up microscopic material to a level that can be processed. After they do that, they’re going to get back to us with the larger picture of what it all means and what might be under there still that could be the source of a future excavation,” he said. Pope’s Tavern was built in the the 1830s, he said, and artifacts found on the grounds dated to the 1820s and ’30s.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Officials are aiming to make the first wave of dividend payments to state residents the week of Oct. 11, a Department of Revenue spokesperson said. Genevieve Wojtusik, the department’s legislative liaison, said in an email Wednesday that the first wave would include those who filed for dividends electronically. She said the second mass payments, which would include those who filed paper applications, would go out about two weeks later. The Legislature last week approved $730.5 million for dividends this year of about $1,100 and for administrative and other related costs. Wojtusik said the final check amount is being calculated and is expected to be announced by Oct. 1. Dividends typically are paid in the early fall, but this year’s payout wasn’t finalized until the third special session of the year, which ended last week. Lawmakers earlier this year proposed a roughly $1,100 dividend, using money from various sources, but failed to win sufficient support for use of some of the funds. What was left at that time was a dividend estimated to be $525, which Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: This year’s wet monsoon is contributing to a record-high season for the West Nile virus, which is spread through mosquito bites, health officials said. Arizona had 123 cases and four deaths through late last week, the state Department of Health Services said Tuesday. Nearly all of the cases were reported in Maricopa County, where the virus has been detected in record numbers of mosquitos studied, the department said. While most people infected with West Nile don’t get symptoms, older people and those with weakened immune systems are more prone to diseases that be fatal. Health officials recommend wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants to help prevent mosquito bites on arms and legs and eliminating standing water where mosquitos lay their eggs.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two men have been convicted of conspiring to kill a federal witness in 2016. A federal jury deliberated for about 61/ 2 hours before delivering the verdicts Tuesday against Donald Smith, 37, of Malvern, and Samuel Sherman, 38, of Batesville, in the shooting death of 44-year-old Suzen Cooper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Prosecutors alleged Smith, Sherman and Suzen Cooper’s former sister-in-law, Racheal Cooper, conspired to sell methamphetamine and cocaine, and Cooper was a confidential informant who had purchased meth from Sherman. Racheal Cooper was originally charged with capital murder in Hot Spring County but later pleaded guilty to a charge of hindering apprehension, for which she served five years of a 25-year sentence. Smith and Sherman face up to life in prison after being convicted of federal charges of witness tampering resulting in death, conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, and aiding and abetting the use, carry and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. A sentencing hearing has not yet been set. Porter led the police to the grave site, Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Gardner said. “Suzen Cooper’s body was exactly where Jimmy Porter said it would be,” Gardner said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Residents failed to significantly cut back their water consumption in July, state officials announced Tuesday, foreshadowing some difficult decisions for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration as a historic drought lingers into the fall. Newsom had asked people in July to voluntarily cut back their water consumption by 15% to help address a severe drought that has left some of the state’s reservoirs at dangerously low levels. But in the three weeks after Newsom’s announcement, residents reduced their water consumption just 1.8%, according to new data released Tuesday and reported by the Sacramento Bee. “On conservation, we’re going to be needing to do more,” board chair Joaquin Esquivel said. Still, Esquivel was hopeful the state’s conservation numbers will improve. Newsom declared a drought emergency in the Russian River watershed along the state’s north coast in April. Data from that region shows people reduced their water consumption by 17% in July compared to 2020. “We see that it takes time for conservation to boot up,” Esquivel said, adding that the 17% figure “shows the responsiveness of communities” to appeals for conservation. Dave Eggerton, executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies, said the numbers “represent a promising start in reducing water use.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Criminal charges have been dropped in connection with the death of a spiritual leader whose mummified body was found in what appeared to be a shrine in a southern Colorado home, according to court officials. The body of Amy Carlson, 45, leader of the Love Has Won group, was found decorated with Christmas lights and glitter in the tiny, rural town of Moffat in April, according to previously released arrest affidavits. Seven people were charged with tampering with or abusing her corpse as well as child abuse, presumably because there were two children living in the home. Charges against six people were dropped during court proceedings, the Saguache County court clerk’s office said in an email Tuesday. It said no case existed for a seventh person who was among those charged with the others in May, though the office did not explain what happened in that case. It’s not known why the charges were dropped. Assistant District Attorney Alex Raines asked a judge to dismiss all the charges during a Sept. 14 hearing, the Valley Courier reports. Defense lawyers also requested that records be sealed, which was approved, it said. A telephone message left for Raines was not returned.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Hundreds of unionized group home workers are threatening to walk off the job next month if settlements aren’t reached on new labor contracts. The New England Health Care Employees Union, District 1199, SEIU, delivered strike notices Tuesday to two private agencies – Whole Life Inc. and Network Inc. – that have about 70 locations across the state that could be affected. The union’s deadline for an agreement is Oct. 5. The threat of a strike, which would involve over 500 workers at group homes and day programs for people with developmental disabilities, comes more than three months after state officials authorized $184 million to increase wages and benefits for group home workers. The union said these remaining two operators have failed to settle on new agreements, despite the added funding. In July, a threatened strike by over 2,100 group home workers at 200 homes was called off after a late-night agreement for higher wages and improved benefits was reached with the Lamont administration’s help. “The State of Connecticut stepped up and provided funding that was adequate,” Rob Baril, the union president, said in a statement. “Now it’s time for these agencies to do the same: to provide people with pensions, affordable health insurance and enough wages that people can take care of their families.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A new law is expected to make it simpler for residents to use solar energy to power their homes through a community-centered program scheduled to start next year. To participate, customers can get credit on their electric bills by subscribing to a centrally located local community solar project, which can be cheaper than paying to install solar panels on their own roofs. Community-owned solar generation facilities have been legal in Delaware since 2010 but included some legal barriers such as requiring the facility to identify all its customers before being built. The bill by Sen. Stephanie Hansen, D-Middletown, removed some of those barriers to make it easier for people to take advantage of the fast-growing industry. Delaware hasn’t had the facilities in the past because the laws weren’t set up to accommodate them, Hansen said. The bill specifically changes regulations for solar facilities that will connect through Delmarva Power, the most prominent energy company in the state. Once facility owners get the green light, Delaware can expect to see the solar panel facilities popping up in open lands like Brownfield sites, undeveloped fields, or on top of parking lots or landfills, according to Hansen.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Artifacts from the racial injustice protests that erupted last year in the wake of George Floyd’s death are being preserved, and their protectors are hoping to find new homes for some of the mementos, WUSA-TV reports. As pro-Trump demonstrators repeatedly targeted a makeshift memorial at the barrier that separated Black Lives Matter Plaza from the White House, “fence guardians” sought to protect artifacts of the movement that shone a spotlight on police brutality against Black people. The Biden administration dismantled the fence earlier this year, but not before Nadine Seiler saved more than 700 mementos. “We were lucky that the Library of Congress took some pieces, and Howard University took some pieces,” Seiler said. “But the vast majority of the collection remained with us.” Hundreds of signs, photographs and pieces of artwork remain in her D.C. storage space. Seiler and fellow “fence guardian Karen Irwin are now finding homes for each item, asking interested businesses, nonprofits and organizations to contact them via Facebook. “Ideally, the Black Lives Matter community would like the pieces to stay in the hands of Black organizations,” Seiler said. “But personally, any organization that would give these treasures a safe home and recognize their value, they should reach out as well.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis named a UCLA doctor and health policy researcher who shares his approach to managing the coronavirus pandemic to serve as the state’s surgeon general Tuesday. Like DeSantis, Dr. Joseph Ladapo said he doesn’t believe in school closures, lockdowns or vaccine mandates. “Florida will completely reject fear as a way of making policies in public health,” Ladapo said. DeSantis said there’s been misinformation spread about COVID-19 to control personal behavior and mentioned monoclonal antibody treatment, claiming that while he’s been advocating it for months, others haven’t been pushing it as vocally. Doctors agree with DeSantis that the treatment, when delivered soon after infection, is effective. Lapado said vaccines aren’t the only way to combat COVID-19. “There’s nothing special about them compared to any other preventive measure,” he said, adding that people should be encouraged to lose weight, exercise more and eat healthier. And Lapado spoke out against lockdowns, saying that “after lockdowns, overall mortality increased ... lots of reasons why they’re bad.” On Wednesday, Ladapo signed new protocols allowing parents to decide whether their children should quarantine or stay in school if they are asymptomatic after being exposed to someone with COVID-19. His new guidelines also tweaked the state’s prohibition against school mask mandates, prompting an administrative law judge to dismiss a lawsuit against the old rule that had been filed by various school boards.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Some of the people living in a homeless camp known as Cooterville say they’re skeptical of a new, government-sanctioned homeless camp planned for the community. The Cooterville encampment under CSX railroad tracks is set to be cleared by Nov. 12, with city leaders trying to time the ejections with the opening of the new camp where homeless will be allowed to stay legally. City officials are looking for an organization to head the government-sanctioned encampment, which will determine what it eventually looks like. The Athens-Clarke County Commission this summer selected a site for it at the North Athens School. Opponents have said they’re concerned it will attract more homeless people to Athens. But supporters say the new camp will come with services aimed at helping homeless people make the transition to permanent housing. In the Cooterville camp, some have expressed feeling left in the dark about the process are are unsure whether they will be secured a spot in the new camp. Oscar Sutton, who’s lived in Cooterville a couple of months, said he has no plans to move to the government-sanctioned encampment and worries about placing so many random people from the homeless community together. “It’s going to be chaos,” he said. “If I have to stay out here, I’ll just find somewhere to stay.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man who helped organize a group that opposes COVID-19 vaccines and mandates says he contracted the disease and now has regrets. Chris Wikoff told Hawaii News Now he helped start the Aloha Freedom Coalition last October, believing government shutdowns and mandates were threatening liberties and harming businesses. “They were talking about vaccine passports and vaccine mandates, and it seemed like it was over-the top totalitarianism and control,” Wikoff said. But then he and his wife contracted COVID-19. “We were told the COVID virus was not that deadly. It was nothing more than a little flu. I can tell you it’s more than a little flu,” he said. Wikoff was sent to a hospital on the west side of Oahu but transferred to a facility in Honolulu because hospitals were at or near capacity. “I was in a bed. I can’t move; I can’t breathe,” he recalled. “I was afraid I was going to die.” Wikoff is now considering getting vaccinated because his family and doctors recommend it. “Probably getting COVID again would be more dangerous than getting the reaction from the vaccines,” he said. Wikoff said he asked the Aloha Freedom Coalition to remove his name as a member on state business registration and is warning people not to attend large protests like the ones the group staged in front of Lt. Gov. Josh Green’s home. “Before I thought Josh Green was exaggerating the situation, and after my experience he sounds very rational to me,” he said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Health care workers are exhausted and angry. COVID-19 vaccines are expiring because they have sat unused for so long. And coronavirus case numbers and deaths continue to climb, putting the state among the worst in the nation for the rate of new diagnoses. Idaho’s public health leaders painted a grim picture – again – during a weekly briefing Tuesday. The state continues to set records with 686 hospitalized COVID-19 patients as of Saturday, 180 of them in intensive care beds and 112 on ventilators, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Dave Jeppesen said. At the moment, there is no end in sight to the surge. The entire state entered “crisis standards of care” last week, officially allowing hospitals to ration health care as needed so that scarce resources can be directed to the patients most in need and most likely to survive. Urgent surgeries have been placed on hold, some patients are being treated in lobbies or field hospitals, and hospital administrators and doctors are desperately trying to shuffle the sickest patients to any facility that has enough open beds or ventilators to treat them. Over the weekend, physicians at one hospital nearly had to face “de-allocation,” in which one patient is taken out of an ICU bed to give it to someone with a greater chance of survival, said Dr. Jim Souza with St. Luke’s Health System.\n\nIllinois\n\nBeecher: A fire destroyed a historic church in Chicago’s far southern suburbs that had appeared in the 2002 film “Road to Perdition.” Officials said nearly a dozen fire departments responded, but by the time the flames were doused, St. Paul’s Lutheran Church was in ruins. No one was injured, and the cause of the fire is under investigation. Flames swept the church Sunday afternoon as members of the congregation were enjoying an Oktoberfest celebration in the parking lot. The building dates to 1865. “Yeah, it is devastating: The 150 years of the weddings and the funerals and the baptisms and all of that are gone. But the church still stands, the people; we still have our folk and our faith,” said the Rev. Michael Stein. The closest fire hydrant was approximately a mile away, prompting an effort to shuttle roughly 91,000 gallons of water to the rural location to extinguish the flames, officials said. The church appeared in Tom Hanks’s 2002 film “Road to Perdition,” WGN-TV reports. “My grandparents are buried there. It’s really sad seeing the church like this,” Beecher resident Zachery Wehling told the station. Stein said it’s an opportunity to rebuild. “It is a dark chapter, and a sad one, and we mourn it, and we grieve it … but we still look to Christ, and we find that hope to go on,” he said.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University said it has nearly 50,000 students this fall, a record fueled by a freshman class of about 10,200. Purdue said it was surprised by an increase in out-of-state students accepted for admission. Families and students told Purdue they were impressed by the school’s response to COVID-19. “Our focuses have been encouraging everyone to be vaccinated,” said Jay Akridge, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity. “We’re up over 83% of the campus (vaccinated). And then if you’re not, get tested,” he said. “And then students have been great about masking inside. … Just as they did last year, students have been very good about following that protocol.” Purdue was expecting 8,450 freshmen but greatly exceeded that number. Total enrollment is pegged at 49,639.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Dodge: Experts say a cyberattack on a northwest Iowa grain cooperative could signal Russian-linked groups are beginning to target smaller farm businesses in rural America as bigger companies tighten their security. The cyberattack on New Cooperative, a farm services business with headquarters in Fort Dodge, comes on the heels of a ransomware attack on the giant meatpacking company JBS in late May. JBS closed at least one Iowa pork processing plant as well as all nine of its U.S. beef plants before paying hackers $11 million in ransom. Cybersecurity experts say Russian-backed ransomware group BlackMatter is demanding a $5.9 million ransom from New Cooperative. New Cooperative acknowledged Monday that it had experienced “a cybersecurity incident” affecting some of the company’s “devices and systems.” The member-owned business said it’s using “every available tool and resource to quickly restore our systems.” The cooperative said it had notified law enforcement and was working with data security experts to “investigate and remediate the situation.” New Cooperative declined to say more about the attack Tuesday. Chad Hart, an Iowa State University agriculture economist, said “size really doesn’t matter” to hackers, who “are looking for any target that they think could be valuable.”\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: An organization run by rapper Jay-Z has filed a petition seeking records from the city’s police department related to what it calls a history of officer misconduct within the agency. The request was filed Monday in Wyandotte County District Court by Team Roc, the criminal justice division of Jay-Z’s entertainment organization, Roc Nation. The filing said the department has failed for decades to hold officers accountable for misconduct, including planting evidence, fabricating witnesses, and soliciting sex from victims and witnesses, The Kansas City Star reports. “And, thanks to the blue veil of silence and apparent failure to investigate serious allegations, little of it has come to light,” according to the petition. It alleges department officials refused to provide Team Roc with complaints filed against the department’s investigative division, reports or internal investigations against an officer who has a history of abuse allegations and policies relating to supervising detectives. The department responded in a statement that it has given hundreds of pages of documents to Team Roc but that the Kansas Open Records Act does not require the release of personnel records and criminal investigation files.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A drive-by shooting at a school bus stop Wednesday morning left a 16-year-old student dead and another hospitalized, police said. A third child was injured by unknown means as the youths waited at the bus stop just west of downtown Louisville, authorities said. A person in a car drove by and shot at the waiting students, some of whom were not injured, Louisville Metro Police Maj. Shannon Lauder said during a news conference. No suspects were in custody Wednesday afternoon. Police put a photo of a dark gray Jeep SUV on social media and asked for the public’s help in finding it. The vehicle had Illinois license tags, with the plate number BD91644. Mayor Greg Fischer said the shooting – the city’s 145th homicide this year – violated a “sacred space.” Police were working with the FBI and other agencies in investigating the shooting, Chief Erika Shields said Wednesday morning. The chief suggested the shooting could be gang-related, but she said she did not believe the victim was involved with gangs. The bus stop near the city’s downtown was for students of Eastern High School. Jefferson County Schools Superintendent Marty Pollio called the incident “one of the most difficult mornings of my career.” He said support is being provided to students and teachers at the school.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Smoke and flames shot up the side of the Superdome’s roof Tuesday after a pressure washer being used to clean the roof of the sports and entertainment arena caught fire. The New Orleans Fire Department confirmed firefighters responded to flames on the building’s roof shortly after 12:30 p.m. The fire appeared under control a short time later. New Orleans Emergency Management Services said on Twitter that it was transporting one person to the hospital for “minor burns.” Emergency officials called on people to stay away from the area. Crews were power-washing the roof to prepare it to be painted, officials said. “The fire was contained to the exterior gutter system surrounding (the) Superdome, and only a small area of the roof suffered minimal damage,” said a statement from the Louisiana Stadium and Expedition District, a state board that governs the dome, and ASM Global, which manages the Superdome. “Initial assessments suggest that damage is superficial and there appears to be no structural damage or impact to the integrity of the roof’s exterior skin. The building’s outer skin and roof remain watertight.” A photo posted on the city’s emergency management Twitter feed showed firefighters in the trench that separates the Superdome roof from an outer wall as they sprayed down the fire-blackened walls.\n\nMaine\n\nLebanon: Residents will vote on whether to recall several town leaders in a flap that grew out of the select board chairman’s decision to take a farmer’s pot plants. Farmer Eric Kelley accused Select Board Chairman Charles Russell Jr. and board member Ernest “Butch” Lizotte Jr. of swiping $100,000 worth of plants, knowing that the farmer was in jail. In addition, local animal control officers took his livestock. District Attorney Kathryn Slattery confirmed there was an investigation that focused on possible theft. But there was not enough evidence to prove the charges “beyond a reasonable doubt,” she said. Anger over the marijuana episode apparently served as a tipping point for a recall effort targeting Russell, Lizotte and another person who went to the farm that night. The recall also targets a third selectman who’s accused of missing half of this year’s meetings. Russell, who grows medicinal marijuana for household use, consulted for a local pot business and helped draft town marijuana ordinances, acknowledged to the Boston Globe that he pilfered Kelley’s marijuana plants. But he said he did it because he didn’t want the plants getting “into the hands of the wrong people” while Kelley was in jail. He called it a “public safety” matter.\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: National Public Radio can air audio recordings from the trial of the gunman who killed five Capital Gazette newspaper employees in 2018, a federal judge has ruled in a case challenging the state’s ban on broadcasting court proceedings. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Bennett on Tuesday permanently barred the state of Maryland from enforcing its “broadcast ban” against NPR, which intends to use audio from the trial of Capital Gazette newsroom shooter Jarrod Ramos in an upcoming episode of its “Embedded” podcast. Bennett ruled it would be unconstitutional for Maryland to ban NPR from broadcasting recordings of the jury trial for Ramos’ criminal case. NPR’s challenge to the broadcast ban was limited to its use of recordings of Ramos’ court proceedings. In July, a jury rejected defense attorneys’ mental illness arguments and found Ramos criminally responsible for killing five people at the newspaper’s office in Annapolis. Prosecutors are seeking five life sentences without the possibility of parole when Ramos is sentenced. The judge already had ruled in NPR’s favor after a hearing Sept. 13, issuing a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocked the law’s enforcement against the radio network. Tuesday’s ruling granted NPR’s request for a permanent injunction.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A group of high school students had to ride on a party bus complete with a stripper pole and neon lights during a recent field trip – an experience their teacher said highlights problems with the education system. Jim Mayers, an 11th grade Advanced Placement language and composition teacher at the Brooke Charter School in Boston, said in a since-deleted tweet that the original charter bus had fallen through, Masslive.com reports. “It is a funny story, but there actually is a real bus shortage, and it speaks to major flaws in our education system,” he said, adding that the field trip was a success. He is now using the attention he’s getting because of the original tweet to urge people to better understand educational inequities and other problems facing the nation’s schools. “I’m worried that there is too much attention being paid to the tweet itself, or simply the fact that it went viral, instead of attending to the many systemic issues that are facing not just my students, but students all across the country,” he wrote in a follow-up tweet. For example, districts across the nation are struggling to hire enough drivers to shuttle kids to school, and some states have become creative, including Massachusetts, which is enlisting National Guard members to drive school transport vans.\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: Plans are underway for the state to construct a first-in-the-nation segment of road that will charge electric vehicles while they’re driving, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Tuesday at the Motor Bella auto show in Pontiac. Michigan’s Department of Transportation and the Office of Future Mobility and Electrification are partnering to make a 1-mile stretch of state roadway in Wayne, Oakland or Macomb counties to allow public transportation and private vehicles to charge while traveling as a part of the Inductive Vehicle Charging Pilot, according to a news release. “Michigan was home to the first mile of paved road, and now we’re paving the way for the roads of tomorrow with innovative infrastructure that will support the economy and the environment, helping us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050,” Whitmer said in the release. As electric vehicles advance, charging infrastructure has become a priority for Michigan cities that want to draw residents. The city of Saginaw got its first charging stations in September in the hope that those traveling in the east side of the state toward tourist areas in northern Michigan will stop because there is little electric vehicle infrastructure available at most destinations.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Joseph: A small crowd of local business owners and community members gathered around a gray house near downtown Tuesday morning to kick off a project that would give a house used by the Sisters of the Order of St. Benedict a new life. Armed with sledgehammers, Sisters Dorothy Manuel and Karen Streveler posed for photographs outside the house as Habitat for Humanity volunteers in blue hard hats walked around the inside, ready to begin renovating the home that the sisters donated to the organization in December. Next summer a local family will move into the house, addressing a need for affordable housing in the area. “As volunteers and family members begin the kicking out the old to make room for the new and improved, we pray for the safety of all who participate in the renovation project and that everything gets accomplished in a timely manner,” Manuel said as she led a prayer in front of the home. “May this house truly become a home for the family and a blessing for their lives.” The Genesis House was built in 1926 and purchased by the sisters in 1950. It was used to accommodate lay staff from the College of St. Benedict in the past and later to house chaplains, Streveler said. Most recently, some of the sisters lived there for the past seven years.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The authors of the state’s 1890 constitution had racist intent when they stripped voting rights from people convicted of some felonies because they chose crimes they thought were more likely to be committed by Black people, an attorney argued Wednesday in a federal appeals court. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should overturn most of Mississippi’s felon disenfranchisement plan, attorney Donald B. Verrilli Jr. argued on behalf of people with felony convictions. The case could affect thousands who have lost voting rights. “Because the 1890 provisions were unconstitutional, they were invalid from the moment that they’re enacted,” Verrilli said. Attorneys representing the state said Mississippi dropped burglary from the list of disenfranchising crimes in 1950 and added murder and rape to the list in 1968. They said in written arguments that those changes “cured any discriminatory taint on the original provision.” The Mississippi Constitution strips voting rights from people convicted of 10 felonies, including forgery, arson and bigamy. The state attorney general issued an opinion in 2009 that expanded the list to 22 crimes, including timber larceny, carjacking, felony-level shoplifting and felony-level bad check writing.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The city’s police used force against Black people more than three times as often as on white people, according to a newly released study. The California-based, nonprofit research group Center for Policing Equity examined police report data from 2012 to 2019 and also found that in 9 out of 10 instances in which police pulled out a gun, it was at a Black civilian, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Even as the overall use of force dropped by 18%, police still used it more often against Black people, the report said. “What we typically hear from police officers is that use of force happens predominantly in areas with high crime,” said Hans Menos, vice president of law enforcement initiatives at the center. “So we try to control using neighborhood-level demographics, and even after controlling for that, the number (of Black people who have force used against them) is still higher.” Mayor Tishaura Jones said eliminating racial disparities in policing is key to making St. Louis safer for all of its residents. Outgoing Police Chief John Hayden said this kind of research can bring about scrutiny and questions about policing practices. “However, we embrace the challenge to do better and consider all suggestions from professionals, community stakeholders, and citizens,” Hayden said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: National Guard soldiers will assist hospitals with their COVID-19 response as the state struggles with a surge in infections, Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Tuesday. A total of 70 soldiers will assist six different hospitals in Helena, Billings, Butte, Missoula and Bozeman. They will begin helping the hospitals either this weekend or next weekend, according to an announcement from the governor’s office. The Guardsmen will support staffing with nonmedical intensive care assistance, environmental services, patient data entry and coronavirus testing. Gianforte has stopped short of issuing any statewide mask or vaccine requirements even as some communities face record-high COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. “While we will not mandate them, vaccines are safe, they work, and they can save your life,” Gianforte said in a statement. The decision to mobilize the National Guard comes after Gianforte announced last week that 10 Guardsmen would begin assisting Billings Clinic, and seven additional Guardsmen would assist in the state lab. The state anticipates additional requests for Guard resources from several other hospitals, according to the governor’s office.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Lawmakers remained at a stalemate Wednesday over how to draw new congressional and legislative maps despite a looming deadline that could force them to postpone the decision until next year and delay the May primary election. Lawmakers have until Saturday to advance both measures, or else Speaker of the Legislature Mike Hilgers has promised to end their special session, forcing them to resume the debate during their next regular session in January. Delaying the new maps until next year would force state officials to reschedule the primary and create major hassles for county election officials and candidates. At issue with the maps are accusations that Republicans and Democrats are trying to draw political boundaries in ways that benefit their party. Republicans enjoy a majority in the officially nonpartisan, one-house Legislature, but they don’t have enough votes to overcome a filibuster led by Democrats and some moderate Republicans, preventing them from forcing through their preferred map. Hilgers said lawmakers have made good progress toward an agreement, and he hoped to pin down specific concerns about the maps to try to reach a compromise so that lawmakers aren’t “just talking past each other.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: In their first public opportunity to voice concerns on a proposal to let tech companies that meet certain requirements create semi-autonomous jurisdictions called Innovation Zones, officials from Storey County dressed down the idea in a line-by-line fashion. They called into question the motives of the company that wants to break away from its control. “While I’m sure many would prefer to have no independent government oversight, we don’t make laws based on what is convenient for just one party,” Storey County Commissioner Clay Mitchell told lawmakers Tuesday. Mitchell and other county representatives oppose a proposal backed by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak that would allow companies that promise a $1.25 billion investment and possess at least 78 square miles of land to apply to form the Innovation Zones. The zones would be governed by three county commission-like board members – two of whom would at first be nominated by the company. They would operate outside the jurisdiction of preexisting local government and eventually could create court systems, impose taxes and make zoning decisions. The company’s proposal has been met with opposition from skeptics of overly powerful tech companies, environmentalists and local officials.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Fall visitors to the Granite State are being asked to keep their tempers in check and their trash off the ground during their leaf peeping trips this year. With interest in outdoor recreation on the rise amid the coronavirus pandemic, state tourism officials last year launched a “Leave No Trace” campaign to remind visitors not to sully the state’s natural resources. This year, they added a new message – “Don’t Take New Hampshire for Granite” – to encourage visitors to be understanding about rules and respectful of other people and property. With foliage season just beginning, officials are again reminding visitors to show courtesy to workers and the environment alike. Fall is New Hampshire’s second-busiest tourism season, and state officials expect 3.2 million visitors to spend $1.4 billion this year, nearly back to pre-pandemic levels. Businesses still are struggling with workforce shortages and supply chain delays, said Mike Somers, president of the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association. That, in turn, has led to an increase in rude and abusive customer behavior. “We’re really asking folks to plan ahead and have a little bit of patience and understanding,” he said. “Just call ahead, find out what the hours of operation are, and please don’t get upset if we’re not open until 11 o’clock at night.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Liquor stores, bars and restaurants are all having trouble stocking their shelves with enough wines, beers and spirits, thanks to COVID-19’s impact on supplies, along with heat waves and frosts that damaged crops. “It’s not just one thing that’s causing the liquor shortage,” said Joe Ringwood, manager of Super Cellars, a fine wine and spirits shop in Ridgewood. It’s a shortage of truck drivers, a scarcity of aluminum, a shutdown of factories, a dearth of containers, extreme weather, tariffs or a lack thereof, and even the greater demand by consumers for premium liquor. “Some of it is directly related to the pandemic,” Ringwood said. “But not all of it.” And it’s not just one category of liquor that’s gone missing. What is in short supply seems to change from month to month, if not week to week. Last year, liquor store owners said, they had trouble getting canned beers, amid a shortage of aluminum. Today, bottled beers and top-shelf tequilas are in particularly short supply. “Every week it’s something else,” said Kathy Mahon, bar manager for Park West Tavern in Ridgewood. Paul Santelle, executive director of the New Jersey Liquor Store Alliance and owner of Garden State Discount Liquors in Perth Amboy, said he has begun to ration over a hundred items so more people will be able to enjoy them.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A coalition of Native American communities has unveiled its proposal for redrawing the state’s political map to boost Indigenous voters’ influence in elections. The proposed changes from New Mexico’s 19 Native American pueblos and the Jicarilla Apache Nation, outlined Monday, would reshape a congressional swing district where Republicans regained control in 2020. They would also bolster Native American majorities among eligible voters in six state House and three Senate districts in northwestern New Mexico. The proposals were submitted to a committee that will provide recommendations to the Legislature at the end of October. The Democrat-led Legislature can draw its own lines. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham must approve the redistricting, and court challenges are possible. New Mexico is home to 23 federally recognized tribes, and the share of New Mexicans who identify themselves as Indigenous by race or by combined ancestry is 12.4%. Four Indigenous tribes have joined together for the first time to form a stronger voting bloc within one Senate district that might unite Acoma, Laguna, Isleta and Zuni pueblos. Other proposed changes would split the Mescalero Apache reservation between two congressional districts, in hopes of expanding that tribe’s voice in Congress.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Four members of Congress from New York demanded the release of inmates and closure of New York City’s troubled Rikers Island jail complex after another inmate was reported dead at the facility. Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jerry Nadler, Jamaal Bowman and Nydia Velazquez called conditions at the jail “deplorable and nothing short of a humanitarian crisis,” in a letter Tuesday to Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Bill de Blasio. The demand followed the 11th death reported at Rikers Island this year. The city’s Department of Correction said an inmate died Sunday at the jail after reporting he did not feel well and was taken to the infirmary. His death came on the heels of both Hochul and de Blasio announcing plans to try to improve conditions at Rikers Island, where long-standing troubles were exacerbated amid the pandemic. The House members said the jail has failed to provide inmates with basic services and protection against the spread of COVID-19, and lawmakers on a recent visit to the facility found conditions that were “life-threatening and horrific.” They reported overflowing toilets and floors covered in dead cockroaches, feces and rotting food. State Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas said inmates told her they felt like they were being treated like slaves and animals.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: People attending the 2021 N.C. State Fair won’t be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but it’s strongly encouraged, officials said. Also, those going to the fair, which begins Oct. 14, will be required to use clear plastic bags upon entering, and officials say there will be no indoor concerts at this year’s event – a decision they said has nothing to do with the pandemic. A statement from fair officials said any size or type of clear bag is acceptable. Wristlets, diaper bags and medical equipment bags will be accepted at the fair even if they are not clear, but they will require additional inspection. In addition, officials said there will be no concerts inside Dorton Arena. That room will be reserved for vendors. “Moving the vendors, displays and cheesemakers into Dorton Arena will offer a larger space to include more vendors and provide more space for consumers to sample featured products and shop for their favorites,” state Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said in a statement.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The head of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is asking a federal agency overseeing the environmental review of the Dakota Access oil pipeline to cut ties with a contractor conducting the analysis, citing a conflict of interest. Chairman Mike Faith and other tribal leaders fighting the pipeline sent a letter Wednesday to a top U.S. Army Corps of Engineers official, taking issue with Environmental Resources Management, the company doing the review, and its ties to the oil industry, the Bismarck Tribune reports. One of the tribes’ concerns is that the London-based company is a member of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group that lobbies for the oil industry and has submitted court briefs supporting Dakota Access. Meanwhile, the company that operates the Dakota Access pipeline has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse an appellate ruling ordering additional environmental review, saying it puts the line at risk of being shut down. Texas-based Energy Transfer operates the $3.8 billion, 1,172-mile pipeline. Faith said in a statement that the request by the pipeline operator “is part of an ongoing attempt to “evade accountability.” The pipeline began operating in 2017, after being the subject of months of protests during its construction.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: The city plans to demolish the 129-year-old historic building that once was the site of the Wright brothers’ first bike shop because the building has deteriorated to a point where it can no longer be maintained and redeveloped. The shop was first built in 1892 to serve as the Wrights’ first bike shop. Soon thereafter, Gem City Ice Cream Co. bought the property and was housed there until it closed in 1975, when the building was sold to another company, the Dayton Daily News reports. Years after a wide array of owners, the city attempted to sell the rundown property to developers, but it failed inspection tests. The building was deemed structurally damaged and in danger of collapse. City officials also attempted to receive approval to bulldoze the property but did not move forward after hearing community concerns, Daytons Landmark Commission staff report said. But multiple inspections in 2019 concluded the building can’t be saved. City staff and nuisance abatement specialists said the building needs to be removed, the report said. This isn’t the first of the Wright brothers’ bike shops to be torn down in Ohio. Their second and third bike shops were torn down, but the fourth is a national historic site in the Wright Dunbar District, according to the newspaper.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Efforts to control feral swine eating their way across fields might seem as futile as trying to catch a greased pig – the hogs are known to destroy crops and land for farmers, who say the animals aren’t picky eaters and will consume just about anything they find growing. But an influx in federal dollars creating pilot eradication projects across broad areas of the state and a new pesticide introduced this month are making the fight just a little more fair for farmers, ranchers and regulators. The two feral swine control pilot projects, paid for by about $3.6 million in federal dollars allocated through the 2018 Farm Act, have combined tracking efforts with hunting and trapping activities across multiple counties in northern and southwestern Oklahoma to blunt swine activity in those areas. The manufacturer of the new pesticide, called HogStop, claims it can decrease the fertility of male swine and help cut rapid reproduction rates for the animal. It was approved for use by the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food & Forestry this month. Any and all tools to fight the infestation are welcome, as feral swine damage across the state has cost landowners hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A broken power-sharing deal, the lingering possibility of a Republican walkout and a COVID-19 case are adding greater uncertainty to whether legislators will successfully redraw the state’s political districts ahead of a tight deadline. Stakes are high as Oregon gained a new, sixth U.S. House seat following the latest census. Lawmakers were told the House would reconvene Wednesday following news Tuesday that someone in the building had tested positive for the coronavirus. But House Speaker Tina Kotek now says the chamber won’t convene until Saturday to give time for those potentially exposed to the virus to be tested and receive results. Democrats say their entire caucus in the House has been vaccinated. The number of vaccinated Republican lawmakers was not immediately available. When the House reconvenes Saturday, lawmakers will have just two days to vote on and pass new political boundaries. If congressional maps are not passed by Sept. 27, the task will fall to a panel of five retired judges appointed by the Oregon Supreme Court. House Republicans showed signs of a possible walkout this week after Kotek, a Democrat, rescinded a power-sharing deal to redraw political maps that she made with the House GOP as Republicans used delaying tactics to block bills during the 2021 legislative session.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state Supreme Court is saying yes to canines in the courtroom, under certain conditions. A trial witness may be accompanied by a “comfort dog” if the animal will help yield reliable, complete and truthful testimony, the justices ruled Wednesday in a precedent-setting opinion that established a “balancing test” for Pennsylvania judges confronted with such a request. Ruling unanimously in a murder case, the Supreme Court pointed to other states that allow witnesses to testify with the help of emotional support dogs. The justices said it’s permissible, as long as steps are taken to minimize any potential harm to a defendant. “Trial courts have the discretion to permit a witness to testify with the assistance of a comfort dog,” Chief Justice Max Baer wrote for the court. “In exercising that discretion, courts should balance the degree to which the accommodation will assist the witness in testifying in a truthful manner against any possible prejudice to the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” The defendant, Sheron Purnell, was convicted of third-degree murder and sentenced to up to 47 years in prison. Purnell’s lawyers argued a judge abused his discretion by allowing a comfort dog to accompany a teenage witness who testified against Purnell, with the defense saying that would “generate sympathy” among jurors for the girl.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Health officials are allowing a little leeway to a state mandate that requires health care workers to receive a COVID-19 vaccine by Oct. 1. State Department of Health Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott announced Tuesday that unvaccinated workers will be allowed to continue working beyond that date if their absence would jeopardize quality of care at a facility. “If there is a risk to quality of care and an unvaccinated worker must continue to work beyond October 1 to mitigate that risk, the employer has 30 days to ensure that role is fulfilled by a fully vaccinated health care worker,” she said in a statement. The change was made to “safeguard patients, residents, and staff by holding health professionals and facilities accountable to the October 1 vaccination requirement, while also preventing disruptions to care in Rhode Island as health care facilities work toward full compliance,” she said. According to the latest state survey, 87% of health care workers in Rhode Island are vaccinated. Many of the state’s nursing homes had expressed concern about the Oct. 1 deadline, saying it would put additional strain on facilities already struggling with staffing shortages.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A tent has been pitched at Prisma Health’s Greer Memorial Hospital to provide additional triage and treatment space, according to a spokesperson for the health system. The 40-by-80-foot tent was erected over the weekend by the South Carolina State Guard but has not yet been activated to provide treatment, according to a statement from a representative of the health system. Prisma spokesperson Sandy Dees said the tent is part of efforts at Prisma emergency departments in the Upstate to “proactively ‘surge up’ and create additional space to treat patients as needed.” Prisma did not respond to a question about the occupancy of its hospital in Greer. “We’re here to take care of our communities and that means taking the necessary steps to ensure we’re ready when and if those additional resources are needed,” Dr. Matthew Bitner, chair of emergency medicine at Prisma Health in the Upstate, said in the statement. “From a traditional ‘all-hazards’ approach, we are preparing not only for COVID patients but also the everyday emergencies such as trauma, heart attack, strokes, illness and injuries.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The nation’s largest domestic hunger-relief organization projects more children will go hungry in South Dakota this year and won’t know where their next meal is coming from. Feeding America said the state’s child food insecurity rate for 2021 will be 16.3%, up from 15.3% in 2019. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as reduced food intake, disruptive eating, and decreased quality and variety in diets. The USDA recently reported a national trend of increasing food insecurity, which rose to 14.8% in 2020. “I think it is really concerning,” said Lisa Davis, senior vice president of the No Kid Hungry campaign, a national initiative to end child hunger. “Children who face hunger generally have worse health impacts on their physical and brain development. … They don’t do well in school, they graduate at lower rates, and those consequences for kids literally last a lifetime.” Before the coronavirus pandemic, food insecurity was at its lowest rate since USDA started tracking it in the late 1990s. But the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on food access to households with young children, households of children headed by single women, and households of color, specifically Black and Hispanic, Davis said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials are asking the public to pick their favorite of four redesign options for new license plates that will be available starting in January. Gov. Bill Lee’s office said voting began Monday and runs through Sept. 27 at tn.gov/ratetheplates. The new design will replace the current plate that launched in 2006, with modifications in 2011, 2016 and 2017. State law includes a redesign every eight years if lawmakers approve funding for it. Tennessee law also requires the words “Tennessee,” “Volunteer State” and “TNvacation.com” to be on the plate, and it lets Tennesseans pick an “In God We Trust” option. The winning design of the primarily white and deep-blue options will be announced in the fall.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: After serving as interim police chief for the capital city since March, Joseph Chacon was named Wednesday as the permanent choice for the top spot. City Manager Spencer Cronk announced the appointment of Chacon, whose career with Austin police has spanned more than 20 years, after a nationwide search for a new chief. Chacon has been interim police chief since the retirement of former Chief Brian Manley amid a reckoning over racial injustice and use of force in law enforcement. Chacon, who served as assistant chief in Austin for almost five years before being named interim chief, said he was “extremely excited and humbled” by the opportunity. Chacon’s appointment must still be confirmed by the City Council, which is set to place an item on the appointment on next week’s agenda. Manley, chosen to lead the department in 2018, had been at the center of ongoing criticism following a fatal police shooting in April 2020 of a man driving away from officers and controversial uses of force by officers during protests over the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis in May 2020.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced Wednesday that masks will be required inside temples to limit the spread of COVID-19. Church leaders said in a statement that masks will be required temporarily in an effort to keep temples open. The message was the latest in a series of statements from church leaders encouraging masking and vaccination efforts against COVID-19. “As cases of COVID-19 increase in many areas, we want to do everything possible to allow temples to remain open,” the church said in a statement. “Therefore, effective immediately, all temple patrons and workers are asked to wear face masks at all times while in the temple.” In Utah, where the church is based, a summer surge of the coronavirus among unvaccinated residents has continued to grow, while vaccination rates have slightly increased. Data from the Utah Health Department showed that in the past 28 days, state residents who are unvaccinated have been 5.9 times more likely to die from COVID-19 and 7.2 times more likely to be hospitalized than those who are vaccinated. About 64% of Utah residents ages 12 and older were fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, state data shows. Utah reported 25 new deaths from COVID-19, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 2,829.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont State Police has its first director of mental health programs to help coordinate and oversee the delivery of mental health services to people who come into contact with state police, officials said. Mourning Fox, who was deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Mental Health for the past four years and has more than 25 years of experience in the field, was named to the position, the Department of Public Safety and state police announced. “This is a crucial position within the Department of Public Safety and for the Vermont public safety community as we pursue short-, medium- and long-term goals with respect to mental health response and reimagining policing and safety services,” DPS Commissioner Michael Schirling said in a statement. Fox, who joined the department Aug. 30, will work with the state police’s 10 barracks and the Department of Mental Health to complete hiring. He will also ensure that each field station has at least one embedded mental health crisis specialist and that training is consistent, officials said. In the long term, he’ll help the Public Safety Department reimagine how police provide services to people who may be experiencing a mental health or substance use disorder crisis or have other unmet social service needs, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A year and a half into the coronavirus pandemic, the Virginia Employment Commission is still swamped with backlogged claims, its call centers are underperforming, and serious staffing problems persist, according to a scathing interim report the state’s legislative watchdog agency presented to lawmakers Monday. The agency’s staff undertook its review after the employment commission came under harsh scrutiny from lawmakers and the public for what by some measures is a worst-in-the-nation response to the surge in jobless claims. Thousands of Virginians have faced lengthy delays while waiting for benefits, and many have been unable to reach anyone for help or information about their case. “While operating in the extremely challenging public health environment created by COVID was understandably difficult … meaningful actions could have been taken sooner to respond to the public’s needs,” said Hal Greer, director of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s secretary of labor, Megan Healy, oversees the employment commission and defended its performance. Although she agreed the agency was not prepared for the pandemic, she argued to lawmakers that the root of the problem was a complicated federal funding formula that has long left the agency starved for resources.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Three new buildings with 165 studio apartments that were supposed to be rented at market rates will instead house people leaving homelessness and people at risk of becoming homeless. The nonprofit Low Income Housing Institute will buy the buildings on Capitol Hill for about $50 million, with city and state housing programs sharing the cost equally, The Seattle Times reports. Seattle is using federal COVID-19 relief funds for its part, Mayor Jenny Durkan said. Two of the buildings will be managed by LIHI for adults. The third will be managed by YouthCare for young adults. Each will have a live-in case worker, said Sharon Lee, LIHI’s executive director. The deals will house people quickly and cheaply, relative to the time and cost required to develop low-income projects from scratch, Durkan said. The three buildings should be occupied by the end of the year, according to the city. “This is the fastest we have ever brought housing online,” Lee said. Tent encampments in parks and greenbelts have grown in Seattle during the coronavirus pandemic partly because the city has lacked shelter and housing spots, Durkan said. LIHI will move people into the buildings from tiny house villages it manages for the city, which should open more of those houses for people living on the streets, Lee said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLewisburg: Gov. Jim Justice has withdrawn from consideration as the coach of a boys basketball team at a high school where he already is the girls coach and where he’d already faced rejection for the job. In a letter to the Greenbrier Board of Education on Tuesday, Justice asked that a boys coach be named soon at Greenbrier East High School, with practices for the 2021-22 season starting in a month. Last month the board rejected a motion to hire Justice as boys coach. The board is looking to replace former NBA player Bimbo Coles, who resigned in July. “We need to move forward,” Justice said. “Pick a coach. The kids deserve that, and I wish them all the success.” Justice served as the boys coach from 2010 to 2017, his first year as governor. He has coached the girls team since 2000, winning a state championship in 2012. Justice’s second term as governor runs through 2024.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Workers reinstalled two statues Tuesday on the state Capitol grounds that protesters ripped down during a demonstration last year in the wake of George Floyd’s death. Workers reinstalled a 9-foot-6-inch statue of Wisconsin abolitionist Col. Hans Christian Heg as well as a 7-foot statue of a woman symbolizing the state’s “Forward” motto. The statues have no associated racist history, but protesters said they represented a false narrative that Wisconsin supports Black people and racial equity. Demonstrators toppled both statues in June 2020, breaking off Heg’s leg and head. The “Forward” statue was dented and one of its fingers broken off. The demonstration was among several that shook downtown Madison in the days after Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Floyd, who was Black and handcuffed, died after white police Officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Heg, a Norwegian immigrant who became an outspoken abolitionist, served in the 15th Wisconsin Regiment during the Civil War. He was killed at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863. His statue, funded by the Norwegian Society of America, had stood outside the Capitol since 1926. The “Forward” statue was a bronze replica of the one that represented Wisconsin at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: Rescue crews recovered the body of a 67-year-old man and searched around a lake Tuesday for his half-brother after the pair failed to return from a backcountry canoe trip. A 10-person ground crew was walking the shoreline of Shoshone Lake looking for Kim Crumbo, a 74-year-old former Navy SEAL from Ogden, Utah, Yellowstone officials said. A helicopter from nearby Grand Teton National Park was helping in the effort. Rescuers found the body of Mark O’Neill of Chimacum, Washington, on Monday along the eastern shore, where a canoe, paddle, flotation device and other items were found Sunday. A vacant campsite was found on the south side of the lake. A family member reported the two experienced boaters and former National Park Service employees overdue from their four-night trip Sunday. Shoshone Lake covers 13 square miles and has an average temperature of about 48 degrees Fahrenheit, with survival time estimated to be only 20 to 30 minutes in such cold water, officials said.

Profiles will continue each day through March, which is National Women's History Month.\n\nThe lives and work of these women span more than two centuries and represent a wide range of achievements and occupations.\n\nSome of them are well known, such as Abigail Scott Duniway, who fought for women's suffrage and published a weekly newspaper in Portland.\n\nOthers are more obscure, such as Fern Hobbs, the personal secretary to Gov. Oswald West who was sent to decree martial law in the rowdy mining town of Copperfield.\n\nTheir contributions have been diverse and historic:\n\nThe first female doctor in the West: Bethenia Owens-Adair.\n\nThe first U.S. congresswoman from Oregon: Nan Wood Honeyman.\n\nThe first female steamboat captain West of the Mississippi: Minnie Hill.\n\nThe first Oregon woman to compete in the Olympics: Thelma Payne.\n\nThe first female police officer in the United States: Lola Greene Baldwin.\n\nMany of these women overcame obstacles to make a difference and secure their place in Oregon herstory. They helped make this state what it is today.\n\nMore:Women of the Century project honors Oregon leaders who made a difference\n\nTabitha Moffat Brown\n\nBorn: May 1, 1780, in Brimfield, Mass.\n\nDied: May 4, 1858, in Salem. She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery.\n\nFacts: Brown was a social reformer and educator who traveled the Oregon Trail and assisted in the founding of Tualatin Academy, which became Pacific University in Forest Grove. She turned to teaching to support four children after her husband, a minister, died. She was 66 when she crossed the plains in 1846 with her son and suffered much hardship. At one point on the journey, she was left alone on the trail in the bitter cold with her ailing 77-year-old brother-in-law. She pulled them through, despite being near starvation. Once in Oregon, she traveled between Oregon City and her daughter's home in Salem, and eventually settled in Forest Grove. Her first job was sewing gloves to sell. She later helped start a home and school for orphan children and became affectionately known as \"Grandma Brown.\" The log church she used for the school was officially established as Tualatin Academy in 1848, and the following year became what is now Pacific University.\n\nNotable: Honored in 1987 by the Oregon Legislature as the \"Mother of Oregon.\"\n\nQuotable: \"I rode through (the Umpqua Mountains) in three days at the risk of my life, on horseback, having lost my wagon and all that I had but the horse I was on.\"\n\nSOURCES: Pacific University, Salem Online History, RootsWeb.com, The Brown Family History II\n\nAbigail Scott Duniway\n\nBorn: Oct. 22, 1834, near Groveland, Ill.\n\nDied: Oct. 11, 1915. She is buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: Duniway was a novelist, newspaper publisher, teacher, pioneer, milliner and suffragist. She came to Oregon in 1852 and wrote a novel based on the overland experience. Her mother and brother died during the grueling trek. Her family settled near Lafayette, where she began a career as a schoolteacher. She married Benjamin Duniway, and they had four children spaced less than two years apart. She endured the loss of their Yamhill County farm because of her husband's faulty business decisions. Later, he became an invalid. In order to support the family, she returned to teaching as well as running a hat shop in Albany. Her experiences convinced her that women needed the right to vote. She campaigned for suffrage throughout the Northwest, and in 1871, started a newspaper in Portland called The New Northwest. She masterminded the suffrage campaigns in Idaho and Washington, but her efforts to win the right to vote in her home state proved more demanding. From 1884 to 1910, Oregon's male voters defeated suffrage five times at the polls. Finally, in 1912, the initiative passed. She was the first woman to register to vote in Multnomah County.\n\nNotable: Duniway was the first woman to speak before the Oregon Legislature and the state's first woman publisher.\n\nQuotable: \"The young women of today, free to study, to speak, to write, to choose their occupation, should remember that every inch of this freedom was bought for them at a great price. It is for them to show their gratitude by helping onward the reforms of their own times, by spreading the light of freedom and of truth still wider. The debt that each generation owes to the past it must pay to the future.\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Women of the West Museum\n\nBethenia Owens-Adair\n\nBorn: Feb. 7, 1840, in Van Buren County, Mo.\n\nDied: Sept. 11, 1926, in Astoria. She is buried at Ocean View Cemetery in Warrenton.\n\nFacts: A physician, teacher, feminist and social reformer, she was the first woman west of the Mississippi to hold a medical degree. Her family crossed the Oregon Trail in 1843, and she did not begin her formal education until she was 12. She was married at 14 to one of her father's farm hands but divorced her abusive husband by 16. She turned to millinery to earn her living and raise her son, George, who also became a doctor. Her business was successful, but after six years she decided to pursue a career in medicine. She attended an eclectic school in Philadelphia and then University of Michigan Medical School, finishing her degree in 1880, at age 40. She returned to Portland the following year and became the first woman to practice in Oregon. She married Col. John Adair in 1884, and the couple moved to Astoria, where she continued to practice medicine and help with the family farm.\n\nNotable: She thought insanity and criminal action were hereditary and argued for mandatory sterilization of the criminally insane. Her famous work on the subject, \"Human Sterilization: Its Social and Legislative Aspects,\" was published in 1922. Three years later, the sterilization statute was adopted as state law in Oregon.\n\nQuotable: She was not afraid to drive great distances alone in her carriage to reach a patient. \"At no time did I ever refuse a call, day or night, rain or shine.\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Findagrave.com, Dameron-Damron family newsletter\n\nLola Greene Baldwin\n\nBorn: 1860\n\nDied: June 22, 1957. Buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: On April 1, 1908, she was sworn in as the first female police officer in the United States. Her primary mission was to protect young women from prostitution. She began this type of work in 1905 as an employee of Portland's branch of the Traveler's Aid organization during the Lewis and Clark Exposition. The goal of the organization was to encourage women who flocked to the city to avoid the pitfalls of prostitution. Her unit with the Portland Police Bureau, the Women's Protection Division, made a priority of protecting women from the effects of vice, rather than punishing them for it. She reportedly maintained an office away from the police department and declined to work in uniform. She also was involved in organizing a juvenile court in Portland. On May 1, 1922, she resigned her commission after influencing local, regional and national women's policing activities for 17 years, 14 of them as a paid municipal officer.\n\nNotable: To learn about Baldwin, read \"A Municipal Mother,\" by Gloria E. Myers. A Portland-based foundation that helps women who are recovering from prostitution is named in her honor.\n\nQuotable: Baldwin's goal was \"to make the path safe for the feet of the girl who desired to lead a clean, honest, useful life.\"\n\nSources: Lola Greene Baldwin Foundation, \"A Municipal Mother\"\n\nMercedes Deiz\n\nBorn: 1917\n\nDied: Oct. 5, 2005, in Portland\n\nFacts: She became the first black female lawyer in Oregon when she was admitted to the bar in 1960. She attended Northwestern School of Law at night while married and raising three children and working as a legal assistant. She finished fourth in her class and years later credited her husband with taking a large part in raising their children. \"I am not a dependent woman,\" she said. \"But I could not have done the things I did without Carl.\" In November 1969, then-Gov. Tom McCall appointed her as a district court judge, making her the first woman of color to become a judge in Oregon. The following May, in the primary, Multnomah County voters elected her to the post outright and she became the first black woman to be elected to the bench in Oregon. Oregon Women Lawyers give an annual award in her name to someone who makes an outstanding contribution to promoting women and minorities in the legal profession and in the community.\n\nNotable: In 2000, on the 40th anniversary of her admission to the bar, she was recognized with the Award of Merit, the Oregon State Bar's highest honor.\n\nQuotable: \"Black has nothing to do with the color of the skin; it's a question of ethnicity. You are your race. A person has roots to whatever he or she comes from in one's ancestry.

Buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Duerksen was one of the founders of Deaconess Hospital, a predecessor of Salem Hospital. A group of Mennonites came to Salem in 1916 and opened a 12-bed hospital in an old hotel on Winter Street. Sister Anna, a graduate of Evangelical Deaconess Hospital School of Nursing in St. Louis, Mo., was one of four Mennonite sisters on the Board of Trustees. The sisters worked 20-hour days and received no salary until Social Security was launched in 1935. To them, it was a calling, not a job. Duerksen served as the hospital's only anesthetist. She lived in the basement and not only cared for patients, but cooked and did housekeeping. She married the hospital's gardener and worked at the hospital into the 1950s. In 1947, the Mennonites turned the hospital over to a board of Salem citizens, and the name was changed to Salem Memorial Hospital. It merged in 1969 with Salem General Hospital to create the hospital that exists today.\n\nNotable: In 1957, Duerksen was recognized by the Oregon Nurses Association with a life membership for her long leadership in providing health care.\n\nQuotable: Her legacy is well-documented in the annals of Salem Hospital. Ted Stang, a longtime local hospital administrator, met Duerksen after he came to Salem in 1968. She was in her 80s. He also heard many stories from the grandson of Deaconess Hospital's first administrator. \"She was diminutive, quiet, unassuming,\" Stang said. \"But boy, was she a powerhouse. People listened to what Sister Anna had to say, even though she was not the administrator. Sister Anna carried a lot of weight at that institution.\"\n\nSources: Salem History Online, Oregon Statesman, Salem Hospital\n\nSarah Winnemucca\n\nBorn: About 1844\n\nDied: Oct. 17, 1891\n\nFacts: Historians have referred to Winnemucca as the most famous Native American woman on the Pacific Coast. She used her language skills to try to be a peacemaker and was the first Native American woman to publish in English. Her book, \"Life Among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims,\" is an autobiographical account of her people and their contact with explorers and settlers. She was born and raised in Nevada but spent much of her life in southeastern Oregon as an interpreter for an agent at Malheur Reservation and as a scout and mediator for the Army during the Bannock War. She learned to read and write when her grandfather placed her in the home of a white family in Nevada. By the time she was 14, she could speak three Indian dialects, English and Spanish. She married at least twice, to an Army lieutenant and then an Indian Department employee. After the Bannock War, she received national attention by campaigning for Native American education programs and reservation reform — making more than 400 speeches. She even pleaded her cause to President Rutherford B. Hayes in Washington, D.C., where she reportedly received promises that were later broken. Winnemucca also opened and ran the first school in the West where Native American children could remain with their families and were not forced to stop speaking their native language.\n\nNotable: On March 9, 2005, a bronze statue of her representing Nevada was unveiled in the National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. A town in Nevada carries her family name.\n\nQuotable: \"I would place all the Indians of Nevada on ships in our harbor, take them to New York and land them there as immigrants, that they might be received with open arms ...\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Wikipedia, \"Native Peoples\"\n\nChloe Clarke Willson\n\nBorn: April 16, 1818, in Connecticut.\n\nDied: July 2, 1874. She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Willson was the first teacher at the Oregon Institute, which was founded by Methodist missionaries and later became Willamette University. She devoted her life to bringing religion and education to Oregon, and particularly to educating the young women of Salem. She traveled with about 50 new missionary recruits to the Oregon Territory in 1839. The following year, at a new mission outpost in the Puget Sound, she met her husband, William H. Willson. In 1844, the couple was asked to move to the settlement called Chemeketa Plains, which would become Salem. Chloe had been chosen to open the Oregon Institute.\n\nShe was both teacher and housemother for five primary-grade students and remained the only teacher the first two years. The board of the institute chartered \"Wallamet University\" in 1853 and began offering higher education. Chloe left Salem for a time after her husband died, but she returned in 1863 to serve as Governess of the Ladies Department at Willamette University, the equivalent of Dean of Women.\n\nNotable: Her husband is remembered as the founder of Salem because he filed the first plat of the city and held the original title to the land that now comprises Willamette University, the state Capitol and downtown Salem. Their name lives on today in Willson Park, directly west of the Capitol.\n\nQuotable: \"I feel the weight of responsibility which rests upon me in giving character to this infant institution,\" she wrote on Aug. 13, 1844, the first day of classes at the Oregon Institute. \"O my Father ... thou seest the desire of my heart for the prosperity of this institution, but without thy blessing it can never prosper.\"\n\nSources: Salem Online History, \"Journals of Brewer and Clarke\"\n\nHallie Parrish Hinges\n\nBorn: Jan. 30, 1868.\n\nDied: Jan. 25, 1950. She is buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Hinges was a vocal performer in Oregon for nearly 60 years, most famous for her performance during President Theodore Roosevelt's visit to Salem on May 21, 1903. Roosevelt called her the \"Oregon Nightingale\" when he heard her sing, and the nickname stuck. She studied music at Willamette University, graduating from the Willamette Conservatory when she was 18. She also studied in New York for a year. Music always was a big part of her life. She performed at her first public concert when she was 6, in the basement of First Methodist Church. Her audiences later expanded to political dignitaries. In 1891, she sang for President Benjamin Harrison, and in 1900, she performed for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. But her biggest moment came when Roosevelt visited Salem. Thousands gathered at Willson Park to see the president. Before he spoke, the 35-year-old soprano sang the national anthem. Roosevelt told Gov. George Chamberlain that Hinges had one of the most beautiful voices he had ever heard and asked if she would sing again. Hinges responded with a favorite of the time, \"The Flag Without a Stain,\" and witnesses claimed that the president wiped tears from his eyes.\n\nQuotable: \"Truly, she is the Oregon Nightingale,\" Roosevelt said.\n\nNotable: Hinges' grandfather was Methodist missionary Josiah L. Parrish, whom Parrish Middle School is named after.\n\nSource: The Statesman Journal, Salem Online History, \"Marion County History,\" Volume XV\n\nThelma Payne Sanborn\n\nBorn: July 18, 1896, in Silverton\n\nDied: Sept. 7, 1988, in Los Angeles\n\nFacts: She was the first Oregon woman to compete in the Olympics and the first to win a medal. She won the bronze in the 3-meter springboard diving competition at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium. The U.S. swept the medals in that event, with Payne missing silver by seven-tenths of a point. She was the U.S. women's springboard champion in 1918, 1919 and 1920, and trained at Multnomah Athletic Club in Portland. She reportedly incorporated ballet into her training regimen. After competing in the Olympics, she was a longtime swimming and diving coach at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. She taught the children of several famous people to swim, including John Wayne and Bing Crosby. Payne was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of fame in 1983, among one of the early classes that included Bobby Doerr, Mel Renfro and Steve Prefontaine.\n\nNotable: Sanborn said in a 1987 interview that she was one of the models for the red-suited diving girl introduced by Jantzen in 1920 and later plastered on billboards.\n\nQuotable: \"In those days, we had nothing to go by. We had to actually see someone perform a dive and then try to do it ourselves. It was the only way.\"\n\nSources: Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, The Associated Press, Oregon Sports Hall of Fame\n\nCornelia Marvin Pierce\n\nBorn: Dec. 26, 1873, in Monticello, Iowa\n\nDied: Feb. 12, 1957\n\nFacts: Marvin was the leader of the Oregon State Library for 24 years, almost singlehandedly building one of the finest state library systems in the nation. She came to Oregon in 1905 for the position of secretary of the Oregon Library Commission, which later became the State Library. She instituted many innovative programs, including the first books-by-mail service in the country. In a day when many Oregonians lived isolated lives without telephones, newspapers and other regular sources of information, her innovation was a lifeline for thousands of rural Oregonians, particularly women. She resigned as State Librarian in 1928 to marry Gov. Walter M. Pierce. He was elected in 1932 to Congress, and she became his secretary, researcher and speech writer. Their political partnership was one he readily recognized, often reminding his constituents that they had two representatives for the price of one.\n\nQuotable: \"The only thing I have ever done to make the world a better place to live is to promote libraries.\"\n\nNotable: At the end of her life, she bequeathed most of her estate to Reed College, a private Portland liberal-arts school. The $300,000 gift still supports a Cornelia Marvin Pierce chairmanship in American history at Reed.\n\nSources: \"Cornelia Marvin Pierce: Pioneer in Library Extension,\" \"Library Trends,\" Oregon State Library\n\nMaurine Brown Neuberger\n\nBorn: Jan. 9, 1907, in Cloverdale, Tillamook County.\n\nDied: Feb. 22, 2000, in Portland.\n\nFacts: She remains the first and only woman from Oregon to serve in the U.S. Senate. She and her husband, Richard, were known as a political team. They gained notice in 1951 as the first married couple in the nation to serve together in a legislature — he in the Oregon Senate and she in the House. He won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1954, and she served as his aide. When he died from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1960, she won a special election to fill the vacancy and then the general election to serve the next term. She focused on environmental and health issues, including sponsorship of one of the first bills to require warning labels on cigarette packaging. Back home, she took on Oregon's then-powerful dairy industry about a law forbidding the sale of yellow margarine. She donned a striped apron, pulled out a mixing bowl and showed her colleagues in the House — all men — just how much work it took to mix food coloring into the lard-white butter substitute. The ban was lifted, and her demonstration became part of the state's political lore.\n\nQuotable: \"Before she puts her name on the ballot, she encounters prejudice and people saying, 'A women's place is in the home.' She has to walk a very tight wire in conducting her campaign. She can't be too pussyfooting or mousy. Also, she can't go to the other extreme — belligerent, coarse, nasty.\"\n\nNotable: After serving in the U.S. Senate, she taught at Boston University and Radcliffe and was part of the social and academic circle surrounding the Kennedy family.\n\nSources: Oregon History Project, Harvard Square Library\n\nMercedes Bates\n\nBorn: 1916\n\nDied: Aug. 16, 1997, in Minneapolis\n\nFacts: Bates is one of the most important women to graduate from Oregon State University. She is credited with helping make Betty Crocker a household name. She was a vice president of the General Mills food company, in charge of the Betty Crocker division. The fictional character was created in 1921 and evolved into an American cultural icon under Bates' direction. After graduating from Oregon State in 1936 with a degree in food and nutrition, Bates began working at the Southern California Gas Co. and became supervisor of home service. She then moved to the Globe Mills food company before opening her own business in Hollywood as an advertising food consultant. She later joined the staff of McCall's magazine as food editor before moving to General Mills in 1964 as director of the Betty Crocker kitchens. Two years later, she rose through the ranks to become vice president and the first female corporate officer of General Mills. She held that title until retiring in 1983.\n\nNotable: She donated $3 million to Oregon State in the early 1990s, helping establish a nationally renowned Bates Family Study Center on campus. At that time, it was the largest one-time donation ever made to OSU. The facility opened in 1992 and was the first of its kind in the United States. It houses programs of research, instruction and outreach designed to benefit individuals and families.\n\nSources: Oregon State University, OSU Alumni Association\n\nNan Wood Honeyman\n\nBorn: July 15, 1881.\n\nDied: Dec. 10, 1970.

She married David Honeyman in 1908, raised three children and was active in civic and humanitarian organizations before becoming involved in politics. She served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1933, which ratified the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution, repealing prohibition. She was a state representative from 1935 to 1937 before being elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Congress. Her bids for re-election in 1938 and election in 1940 failed. While working in the Pacific Coast office of the U.S. Price Administration, the Multnomah County commissioners appointed Honeyman to the Oregon Senate in 1941 to fill a vacancy, and she served until her resignation in 1942. She was U.S. collector of customs in Portland from 1942 to 1953.\n\nNotable: After graduating in 1898 from St. Helens Hall (later incorporated in the Oregon Episcopal School), she continued her education at the Finch School in New York City, where she began a lifelong friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nSources: Oregon Blue Book, Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\n\nCarolyn Shelton\n\nBorn: Around 1877.\n\nDied: Unknown.\n\nFacts: Shelton was governor for a day in 1909, according to the Capital Journal. The newspaper ran a banner headline proclaiming her head of state Feb. 27, 1909, following the resignation of Gov. George E. Chamberlain and the delay in swearing in Secretary of State Frank W. Benson, the next in line. Chamberlain resigned his seat after being elected to the U.S. Senate. In a hurry to get to Washington, D.C., he left his resignation with his private secretary, Shelton, about 9 a.m. that Saturday. The papers weren't to be filed until 4 p.m. Monday, and Benson couldn't be sworn in right away, so there effectively was no governor except Shelton. The Capital Journal pronounced her \"the first woman to govern any state.\" The newspaper reported Sunday that Benson assumed control at 10:10 a.m. Nowhere in state records is Shelton mentioned as governor. Barbara Roberts officially would become the first female governor of Oregon when she was elected and served from 1991 to 1995.\n\nQuotable: \"I want to fill the governor's shoes, and he really has a small foot,\" Shelton was quoted as saying in the Capital Journal. \"I fear the principal trouble will be in trying to fill his hat.\"\n\nNotable: \"Time\" magazine reported July 26, 1926, that Chamberlain, 72, married Carolyn B. Shelton, 49, in Norfolk, Va. Shelton was clerk to the Senate Military Affairs Committee when Chamberlain was chairman during World War I. Chamberlain's first wife had died the previous year.\n\nSource: The Capital Journal\n\nMary Purvine\n\nBorn: Feb. 26, 1881.\n\nDied: June 10, 1965. She is buried at City View Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: She graduated from medical school at Willamette University in 1903 and was one of the first female doctors in Oregon. She left Salem after graduating at age 22, and launched her practice in the small Eastern Oregon town of Condon, where her brother and future governor of Oregon, Jay Bowerman, practiced law. Purvine returned to Salem after four years and began a medical practice specializing in obstetrics. She and her husband, Ellis, had three children. Her son, Ralph, followed in her footsteps and became a doctor. Mary Purvine was a member of the staffs at Salem General and Salem Memorial hospitals. She maintained a practice in Salem for more than half a century, working for many years out of her home on University Street SE. She practiced medicine until she was well into her 70s.\n\nNotable: Her book, \"Pioneer Doctor,\" was published in 1958.\n\nQuotable: \"Woman doctors were few in the early days of my practice. Those were the days when the only two professions a good woman was supposed to engage in were teaching school and keeping house.\"\n\nSources: Oregon Statesman, Statesman Journal, Salem Online History\n\nWinema 'Toby' Riddle\n\nBorn: Around 1850.\n\nDied: 1920, on the Klamath Reservation.\n\nFacts: She was one of the first American women to be distinguished by Congressional act for her actions in a time of war. The Native American woman, who married a white settler named Frank Riddle, was rewarded a government pension of $25 per month for helping save lives during the Modoc War of 1872-73. She and her husband acted as interpreters, messengers and mediators between her people and the U.S. Army. She is perhaps best known for having warned Gen. Edward Canby about the Modoc plot to kill him during peace negotiations. The general ignored the advice and was killed April 11, 1873. On the same day, Winema was credited for saving the life of Alfred Meacham, a Methodist minister and the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon. Meacham was wounded and about to be scalped when Winema yelled that the soldiers were coming, sending the Modoc warriors running. Meacham was the one who pressed Congress to give her a pension, which she received until she died.\n\nNotable: The Winema National Forest in Southern Oregon was established in 1961 and named after her.\n\nSources: Trover Studio collection, courtesy of the Oregon State Library\n\nElizabeth Lord and Edith Schryver\n\nElizabeth Lord\n\nBorn: Nov. 12, 1887, in Salem.\n\nDied: Oct. 9, 1976. She is buried at City View Cemetery in Salem.\n\nEdith Schryver\n\nBorn: March 20, 1901, in Kingston, N.Y.\n\nDied: May 20, 1984. She is buried in her family plot in Kingston, N.Y.\n\nFacts: Lord and Schryver became the first female professionals to open a landscape-architecture firm in the Northwest in 1929. They designed more than 250 gardens from Eugene to Seattle. Schryver was considered the design genius and Lord the plant expert and businesswoman with connections. Lord grew up in Salem and was the daughter of a former Oregon governor, William Lord. Schryver grew up in New York and attended the Lowthrope School of Landscape Architecture in Massachusetts, where Lord also studied. A few years after Schryver graduated, she set sail for a garden tour of Europe, where she met Lord. The friends traveled and studied together for several months and then Lord brought Schryver to Salem. Two of their most notable imprints on Salem are the gardens at Historic Deepwood Estate and Bush's Pasture Park.\n\nQuotable: \"We were free-swinging career girls, and nobody ever questioned us,\" Schryver told the Statesman Journal in 1980.\n\nNotable: The Lord & Schryver Conservancy works to preserve and interpret the legacy of the two women.\n\nSources: Statesman Journal, Lord & Schryver Conservancy\n\nMinnie Hill\n\nBorn: 1863 in Albany.\n\nDied: January 1946 in San Francisco.\n\nFacts: Hill was the first female steamboat captain west of the Mississippi. On Dec. 1, 1886, at age 23, she was granted a master's and pilot's license. She had been working with her husband, Charles O. Hill, on various boats for several years and became \"thoroughly conversant with the steamboat business,\" according to \"Lewis & Dryden's Marine History of the Pacific Northwest.\" When Charles and Minnie bought the 112-foot Governor Newell in 1889, Charles went down into the engine room while Minnie took the pilothouse wheel. They specialized in moving scows laden with jetty stone from a quarry east of Vancouver, Wash., downstream to meet a U.S. Army Engineer tow boat, which took the loads to Astoria. The stone was used to build the south jetty at the mouth of the Columbia River. Minnie was a captain for 14 years. At least two movie producers supposedly tried to get her to consent to filming her life story, but she refused.\n\nNotable: She reportedly was the only woman on the Pacific Coast licensed to command a steamer until 1907, when a second-class master's and pilot's license was granted to a woman in the Puget Sound area.\n\nQuotable: Her son, Herbert W. Hill, on her passing the examination given by two U.S. inspectors: \"Father always said it was much more difficult than the examination he took because the inspectors wanted to refuse her a license with justification.\"\n\nSources: \"Quarterdeck Review\" of the Columbia River Maritime Museum, \"Lewis & Dryden's Marine History of the Pacific Northwest,\" The Sunday Oregonian\n\nBeatrice Morrow Cannady\n\nBorn: Jan. 9, 1889\n\nDied: Aug. 19, 1974, in the Los Angeles area\n\nFacts: Cannady was a pioneer woman attorney and an outspoken advocate for civil rights in the early 1900s. She was editor of The Advocate, an African-American newspaper published in Portland between 1903 and 1936, regularly challenging racial discrimination and becoming the unofficial spokeswoman for the city's small black community. She helped found the Portland chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, known as the NAACP, and craft the state's first civil-rights legislation, which would have mandated full access to public accommodations without regard to race. Although that piece of legislation failed, in 1925 she worked on the successful campaign to repeal Oregon's notorious exclusion laws, which prohibited African Americans from settling in the state.\n\nQuotable: \"Not even the pulpit has been as effective for the advancement of our group, and for justice, as the press.\"\n\nNotable: She ran for state representative in May 1932 but was not elected.

She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Corbett.\n\nFacts: Green was a Democrat in the United States Congress who helped push through legislation that led to Title IX. A former school teacher, radio commentator and lobbyist, she became an important figure in Oregon politics when she was elected to Congress in 1955. She served 10 terms and focused on women's issues, education and social reforms. In her first term, she proposed the Equal Pay Act to ensure that men and women were paid equally for equal work. The bill was signed into law eight years later. She is most noted for her work developing the legislation that was to become Title IX, which prohibited sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions. She introduced a higher-education bill that contained provisions regarding gender equity in education. The hearings on that bill, together with significant input from Rep. Patsy Mink and Sen. Birch Bayh, eventually resulted in the passage of Title IX in 1972.\n\nQuotable: Sen. Mark Hatfield called Green \"the most powerful woman ever to serve in the Congress.\"\n\nNotable: Linfield College annually presents the Edith Green Distinguished Professor award to a faculty member who has demonstrated outstanding performance in teaching and related faculty roles.

She is interred at City View Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Eyre was a revered educator who taught for 40 years at Salem High School. Among the 6,000 or so students who sat in her classes were current teachers and politicians, including retired U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield. She was a strong role model for a generation of up-and-coming women including Norma Paulus, who praised Eyre's work for equal rights for women, open government meetings and the preservation of historic buildings. Eyre came to Salem in 1904, when she was 6. She graduated from Willamette University in 1918 and began her teaching career in Salem in 1922. She taught history and government, economics and sociology, retiring in 1962. In addition to her contributions as an educator, she was involved in local government. She was a precinct committee member and president of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters, and ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic candidate for the state Senate in 1962.\n\nQuotable: She said she ran for the legislative office because she \"wanted to try out some of the things I had been teaching over the years.\"\n\nNotable: The Salem-Keizer School District named an elementary school in her honor in 1977. Mary Eyre Elementary is in Southeast Salem.\n\nSources: Statesman Journal, Salem Online History\n\nFern Hobbs\n\nBorn: May 8, 1883\n\nDied: April 10, 1964\n\nFacts: Hobbs was sent by Gov. Oswald West in January 1914 to declare martial law in Copperfield, perhaps Oregon's most notorious \"bad\" town. Copperfield was established in 1908 to house the mining and railroad crews working at Snake River. It had three saloons, including one owned by the mayor and another by a city councilman, and a population of 84 when Hobbs was dispatched. West had vowed personally to clean up the vice-ridden town but was warned that he would be shot if he tried, so he sent his private secretary. Described as a diminutive woman — 5-foot-3 and less than 100 pounds — Hobbs arrived with a small National Guard contingent and read the governor's orders to close the saloons and resign from city council. The orders were refused, Hobbs left town that afternoon and the National Guard placed the town under martial law. More troops eventually arrived and confiscated liquor and gambling devices. The town, about 75 miles northeast of Baker City, later was destroyed by fire and today is known as Oxbow.\n\nSources: Oregon State Archives, The Oregon Journal, The Oregon Statesman\n\nMarie Dorion\n\nBorn: Unknown\n\nDied: Sept. 5, 1850. She was reportedly buried at St. Louis Catholic Church in Gervais.\n\nFacts: She was the only woman among the overland expedition financed by John Jacob Astor in 1811-12 to establish a fur-trading post at the mouth of the Columbia River. The courageous Native American accompanied her husband and two small children on the journey. Like her predecessor on the Lewis and Clark expedition, Sacagawea, Dorion earned respect from the men. She never complained about the hardships along the journey and kept pace despite caring for two children and giving birth to a third. The epitome of Dorion's courage was noted after the expedition had reached what would later be named Astoria. She and her family returned with a trapping party to the Snake River, where Indians attacked and killed all but her and her two sons. They escaped by hiding in the brush. In the wake of the tragedy, including the death of her husband, she and the boys survived more than 50 days in the bitter cold of the Blue Mountains.\n\nQuotable: Roger Howard, who lives near the church in Gervais, on the legend of Marie Dorion: \"She should be as famous as Sacagawea.\"\n\nSource: Statesman Journal\n\nBetty Roberts\n\nBorn: Feb. 5, 1923.\n\nNow: June 25, 2011.\n\nFacts: Roberts was the first woman appointed to the Oregon Court of Appeals (1977) and the first woman appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court (1982). She was married and raising four children in the 1950s, when she signed up for college courses and graduated from Portland State University in 1958. She taught high school and by 1962 had a master's degree in political science from the University of Oregon. She then enrolled in the night program at Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College, continued to teach and was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives. She graduated from law school in 1966, the same year one daughter graduated from Stanford University and a son from high school. She married a lawyer and legislative colleague two years later, and they established a successful legal practice. She then became the lone woman in the Oregon Senate and in 1974, ran a strong statewide campaign for governor but was narrowly defeated in the primary. The Democratic Party named her to fill a vacancy on the ballot for the general election against U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood, and again she was narrowly defeated. The Oregon Women's Political Caucus named her the 1975 \"Woman of the Year\" for setting a precedent for other women to run for statewide office.\n\nNotable: She helped found Women's Investment Network-PAC to recruit and support women to run for the Legislature and Oregon Women Lawyers to promote women and minorities in the profession.

She was active in her neighborhood association and the local transit district board before running for office. She defeated two sitting city councilors (one man and one woman) in the primary and then went on to serve three terms. Being the first female mayor didn't seem like a big deal at the time, perhaps because Norma Paulus had laid the groundwork for women to become political leaders in Salem. Paulus served in the Oregon Legislature before becoming the first woman in Oregon history to win a state office in 1976, when she was elected Secretary of State. \"If Norma hadn't been so successful,\" Miller said, \"it would have been a lot harder. She had kind of tilled that ground for others to follow, and I've always thanked her for that.\" As mayor, Miller was most noted for her work in helping the city purchase 22 acres of waterfront property on the Willamette River, which today is Riverfront Park.\n\nQuotable: \"It was an amazing privilege to be mayor of Salem.

Gen. Jeanne Holm, USAF\n\nBorn: June 23, 1921.\n\nDied: Feb. 15, 2010, in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nFacts: Holm was the first female general in the Air Force and the first two-star general in the Armed Forces. A native Oregonian, she was among the first women to enlist in the military in 1942, in what was called the Women's Army Corps (WAC). She started as an Army truck driver but soon became an officer. She spent most of World War II training thousands of WACs. She left active duty after the war and went to Lewis & Clark College in her hometown of Portland. She then returned to active duty and joined the Air Force. She was the war plans officer at one of the major bases in Europe during the Berlin Airlift and began her rise through the ranks. She was Director of Women in the Air Force from 1965 to 1973. She was promoted to brigadier general in 1971, the first woman to be appointed to that grade in the Air Force. Two years later, she became the first woman in any branch of service to reach the rank of major general, or two-star general. She retired in 1975 after a 33-year career in the Air Force and went on to serve as Special Assistant on women's issues for President Gerald Ford. She also held positions during the Carter and Reagan administrations and is recognized as a driving force behind women achieving opportunities and equal rights in the military.\n\nNotable: Holm authored three books.\n\nQuotable: \"There was an enormous desire to be part of the war effort. My father had been in the Marine Corps in World War I. My two brothers already had been called to active duty, both in the Navy.

She is interred at Belcrest Memorial Park in Salem.\n\nFacts: Paulus was the first woman in Oregon history to win a state office in 1976, when she was elected Secretary of State. She served two terms and instituted the first vote-by-mail system in the nation. Her three decades as an elected official began in 1970, when she served in the Oregon Legislature. She sponsored environmental legislation, civil rights and ethical changes. She was the Republican candidate for governor in 1986, but lost in a closely-contested race to Neil Goldschmidt. Four years later, Paulus was elected Superintendent of Public Instruction and led a comprehensive restructuring of the state's public school system. She spearheaded work to set rigorous academic standards for all students and to increase accountability with state testing standards. In 1996, U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley named her to the National Assessment Governing Board. A New York Times profile described Paulus' work in Oregon as the most cutting-edge school reform in the country.\n\nQuotable: \"I know I have made government more accountable. It's been a really rewarding experience to be involved in Oregon's state government because in our state, one person can still make a difference.\"\n\nNotable: Paulus never went to college. She was admitted to Willamette Law School in 1956, based on her test scores and the personal recommendation of State Supreme Court Justice Earl C. Latourette. She was his private secretary, and he encouraged her to apply. She continued to work full time and graduated with honors in 1962.\n\nSources: Oregon Blue Book, Statesman Journal, Salem Online History\n\nBarbara Roberts\n\nBorn: Dec. 21, 1936, in Corvallis.\n\nNow: The Portland resident continues to serve on the boards of several nonprofit organizations.\n\nFacts: Roberts was inaugurated as Oregon's first woman governor on Jan. 14, 1991. The descendant of Oregon Trail pioneers and a fourth-generation Oregonian, she began her career in public service as an advocate for the educational rights of her autistic son. Her efforts resulted in one of the nation's first special-education laws and propelled her rise in politics to the governorship. She served on the Parkrose School Board, the Mt. Hood Community College Board and the Multnomah County Commission before her election to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1981. During her second term, she became Oregon's first woman House majority leader. In 1984, she was elected secretary of state, the first Democrat elected to that post in more than 100 years. She was re-elected in 1988. She ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for governor in 1990, and was elected to succeed Gov. Neil Goldschmidt. During her four-year term, Roberts was recognized as an advocate for public education, human rights and services, environmental management and streamlining state government.\n\nQuotable: \"You are looking at a woman who raised two children - one of them autistic - by herself. You are looking at a person who struggled for years to make ends meet. You are looking at a part-time student still working and committed to earning my college degree.

Her first climbing lesson was on a 50-foot Douglas fir on the Corvallis campus, and she was hooked. She tackled rocks first, then mountains. She was part of the first successful women's ascent of Ama Dablam in 1983. From the summit, she could see the rising crest of Everest and set her sights on the world's tallest mountain. Her first attempt was unsuccessful because of a snowstorm that left the climbing party trapped in a snow cave for five days. But the following year, in 1988, she was triumphant. On Sept. 29, at the age of 29, after 29 days on the mountain, she made history by becoming the first American woman to stand on top of the 29,035-foot mountain. She went on to lead a successful expedition in 1993 at K2, the world's second tallest mountain.\n\nQuotable: \"Climbing has inspired me, shaped my life, and changed it.

Prior to entering politics, she enjoyed a career as a broadcast journalist. She graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in communications and worked for Oregon Public Radio and later for KVAL-TV in Eugene. Her political career began in 1996, when she was appointed by the Lane County commissioners to fill a vacancy in the Oregon Senate, then won re-election in 1998. She became vice-chairwoman of the Education Committee, dealing with such issues as charter schools, teacher tenure and school reform. She served in the Senate through 2002, and then was elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction. She held that office from 2003 to 2012, overseeing a department serving more than a half-million students in more than 1,200 schools. She was an advocate for students of color and those from low-income households, supporting increased Head Start coverage, full-day kindergarten, and English for second-language learners. After resigning, she joined the nonprofit education organization Project Lead the Way as its western regional vice president.\n\nQuotable: \"I grew up in a household where my mother dropped out in the eighth grade and was very challenged throughout her life on the kind of work that was available to her.

Because some 230,000 miles away, Alan Shepard was playing golf on the moon.\n\nBeamed back to TV sets on Earth in grainy images, Shepard’s exploits on Apollo 14 – the eighth crewed Apollo mission and only the third to land on the lunar surface – left viewers stunned, including those at mission control in Houston.\n\nAn avid golfer, Shepard had sought out Jack Harden, a club pro at River Oaks Country Club in Texas, to build him a modified club. The resulting creation, a Wilson Staff Dyna-Power 6-iron head, was tucked away in Shepard’s space suit for launch, with a few balls hidden in a sock.\n\nNone of this was on NASA’s inventory. The Apollo program cost almost $25 billion – some $246 billion today according to a 2019 analysis by The Planetary Society – bringing a new meaning to the phrase “time is money.” With minutes worth millions, moonwalk schedules were meticulously strategized to ensure maximum efficiency.\n\nIt is rumored that only mission director Bob Gilruth knew of the astronaut’s plan, with Shepard gaining Gilruth’s reluctant permission only on the promise that any golfing would be saved for the end of extravehicular activities (EVA), and only if there was time.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The incredible true story of the time an astronaut played golf on the moon 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nAfter nine hours walking the surface and several scientific experiments, Shepard was returning to the lunar module when he saw his chance. Attaching the modified club head to a tool designed for scooping lunar rock samples, the commander prepared to take on one of the universe’s biggest bunkers – one-handed.\n\n“Houston … you might recognize what I have in my hand as the handle for the contingency sample return. It just so happens to have a genuine six iron on the bottom of it,” Shepard said, speaking directly into the camera.\n\n“In my left hand, I have a little white pellet that’s familiar to millions of Americans … Unfortunately, the suit is so stiff, I can’t do this with two hands, but I’m going to try a little sand-trap shot here.”\n\nAfter two botched efforts, Shepard’s first shot shanked into a nearby crater, much to the joy of Capsule Communicator Fred Haise in Houston.\n\n“That looked like a slice to me Al,” Haise jabbed, but the moon’s first golfer had one more ball left to play.\n\nBlowing up plumes of lunar dust, the second shot was struck with a sweeter connection, and Shepard liked what he saw.\n\n“Miles and miles and miles,” the jubilant astronaut remarked as the ball sailed out of his view, swallowed by the infinite blackness of space. Needless to say, shot-tracking technology was unavailable, and so Shepard returned to Earth with the whereabouts of his second shot unknown.\n\nAlan Shephard lining up a shot in December 1995. J.D. Cuban/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nCamera shy\n\nThree years later, in the Northwest of England, Andy Saunders was born. After graduating from Loughborough University, he carved out a career in property renovation, but harbored a passion for photography.\n\nWhat does any of that have to do with an astronaut playing golf on the moon? Almost 50 years on, Saunders would be the man to show that, actually, the astronaut’s second shot traveled just 40 yards – roughly the length of two 10-pin bowling lanes.\n\nSaunders has had an obsession with all things space since childhood. Andy Saunders\n\nSaunders did not set out to rain on Shepard’s parade. Instead, he began with a nagging desire to amend a lifelong frustration, expressed neatly in a 2012 piece in The Atlantic titled “There Are No Good Pictures of Neil Armstrong on the Moon.”\n\nBecause while Armstrong may have been the astronaut tasked with taking one small step for man, he was also the astronaut on camera duty. As a result, effectively all the iconic astronaut images captured on the surface during Apollo 11 are of Buzz Aldrin.\n\n“If you think in today’s world how absolutely ridiculous that concept is; the first person on another world, but they only took one camera,” Saunders told CNN.\n\n“They didn’t take a selfie as we would do now.”\n\nUsing a modern digital enhancement technique known as stacking, whereby frames are separated then stacked and consolidated to coax out more detail, Saunders produced the clearest ever image of Armstrong on the moon.\n\nWhen he released the picture on the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 in July 2019, it made world news. Shortly after, NASA opened access to a sprawling library of Apollo flight film – long sealed in a frozen vault at Johnson Space Center in Houston – and Saunders applied his techniques en masse.\n\nNASA's original 16mm film footage of Armstrong on the surface (L), and Saunders' restored version (R). NASA / Andy Saunders\n\nFaced with 35,000 still photos and more than 10 hours of film footage, over the next two years he put his properties career on hold to spend more than 10,000 hours restoring each and every frame. The result was “Apollo Remastered,” a book of Saunders’ favorite 400 stunning images that show the space program in unprecedented clarity.\n\nThe book’s front cover, a shot of Apollo Nine astronaut Jim McDivitt, is a perfect encapsulation of the water-to-wine magic of Saunder’s restoration techniques. Previously an image of near total blackness, barring a dim outline of McDivitt’s helmet, it is hard to believe that the illuminated, cinematic portrait can possibly be mined from the original.\n\nApollo 16 astronaut Charlie Duke described the pictures as an “exact representation” of his memories on the moon, “the next best thing to being there.” For Saunders, there is no better appraisal.\n\n“I want people to feel like this is as close as they can get to walking on the moon themselves,” he said.\n\n“You think of the subject matter for any photographer – you’ve got fellow humans doing these incredibly extraordinary things in an extraordinary place against a backdrop that’s literally otherworldly.\n\n“Every several hundred images I’m going through, there is something of interest, something of significance, or something that just looks incredible.”\n\nShooting stars\n\nWhen he reached Apollo 14, Saunders tasked himself with finding Shepard’s elusive second ball. Picking it out from the original, murky footage – where almost everything on the surface resembled small rocks – made for an impossible game of interstellar Where’s Waldo, but with Saunders’ array of tricks, he quickly found his prize.\n\nWorking out how far the ball had traveled was a little trickier, given there was no reference for scale. Saunders’ workaround was to superimpose the images onto footage captured from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, a satellite that orbited the moon in 2009.\n\nWith no wind or erosion at play, nothing had moved; the scene was perfectly preserved from 38 years prior, and Saunders had his answer: 40 yards. Some 318 yards shy of the 2022 PGA Tour average driving distance, even the most casual golfers would write such an opening shot off as a disaster.\n\nBut casual golfers aren’t playing in a restrictive, bulky spacesuit and thick gloves, aren’t swinging a weightless club in one sixth of Earth’s gravity, barely able to see their feet, and – with the exception of a certain Tik-Tok star – aren’t swinging one-handed.\n\nSaunders' restoration finally revealed the location of Shepard's second ball. NASA / Andy Saunders\n\n“He didn’t get preferred lies, he just dropped the ball – full of rocks and footprints and like an unraked bunker – so to even make contact, I think was pretty impressive,” Saunders said.\n\nSaunders believed Shepard’s “miles and miles” remark to have been made tongue-in-cheek, an almost instinctive reflex of his hyper-competitive, “fighter-jock” nature. The fact that Shepard, who died aged 74 in 1998, later lowered his estimate to – a still generous – 200 yards would seem to support this assessment.\n\nAnd yet, ironically, there was some innate truth beneath the astronaut’s bold claim. By Saunder’s calculations, if famed big-hitter Bryson DeChambeau was able to replicate his earthbound clubhead speed at a 45-degree angle on the moon, he would blast his drive 3.41 miles.\n\n“So actually, funnily enough, that is miles and miles and miles as Shepard said,” Saunders added.\n\n“It is possible, given a flexible enough suit … because there’s no air resistance, because there’s one sixth gravity, you could hit it almost the length of a whole golf course.”\n\nShepard is lifted up to the helicopter after he splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean aboard the Mercury capsule in May 1961. AFP via Getty Images\n\nFinders keepers\n\nWith the launch of the Artemis I earlier this month, NASA edged towards a long-awaited return to the surface of the moon, untouched by humans since Apollo 17 astronaut Gene Cernan’s final steps in December 1972.\n\nTheoretically, it could make Saunders a millionaire. A 2021 ESPN article put the auction value of each ball at a minimum of $10 million, and Saunders joked that he would be chasing NASA for his 10% finders fee should they be retrieved.\n\nThough Saunders isn’t planning an early retirement just yet. He is content in his conviction that the site of Shepard’s exploits will never be disturbed, a belief supported by NASA’s chief historian Brian Odom.\n\n“Maybe one day we’ll have colonies on the moon and it’s like Stonehenge – we don’t want to be messing around in the Apollo landing sites,” Odom said.\n\n“We want to make sure that we treat these landing sites as national landmarks, make sure that they’re preserved, make sure that they’re not contaminated, make sure that they’re there in perpetuity.\n\n“I think they (the balls) are where they need to stay and we need to make sure they’re preserved as they were.”\n\nShepard is commemorated as one of two USPS stamps released in 2011 to celebrate Project Mercury and the MESSENGER Mission respectively. Bill Ingalls / NASA / Getty Images\n\nThe pair’s hopes touch on something that has contributed to the enduring legacy of Shepard’s shots: not their distance or monetary value, but their human resonance.\n\nAs odd as it may seem, by the time of Apollo 14, Odom explained, the American public had developed a desensitized “been there, done that” attitude towards the space program, and the prospect of a predominantly science research mission did little to change the mood.\n\nThat all changed with news of golf on the moon, even more so due to the man wielding the club. As the first American astronaut in space in 1961, Second World War navy veteran Shepard had become a national celebrity, a remedy to the shame of the Soviet Union’s Yuri Gagarin pipping the US into space.\n\n“People love Shepard, they know Shepard,” Odom explained.\n\n“It seems like maybe a lot of people want to see themselves as an Alan Shepard at times.\n\n“Folks who knew Shepard, that I’ve talked to – he had this zest for life. He had this appreciation for doing your job but having fun too … those two things come together in that moment on the moon when he’s smacking golf balls around.”\n\nShepard's EVA suit on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Matt Stroshane / Getty Images\n\nHistory’s longest drive or not, Shepard’s lunar golfing exhibition has captured the imagination for half a century, and not just of those interested in golf.\n\n“We always talk about getting to the moon, landing on the moon, returning back to Earth – that’s how we think of the moon,” Odom said.\n\n“But when it comes to a human activity, something that’s done just for the joy of being alive, that’s something that people can appreciate.”\n\nSaunders agrees. “A lot of people know that someone played golf on the moon,” he said, “But not a lot of those people would know that it was on Apollo 14, that there even was an Apollo 14.\n\n“Those human moments resonate forever.”\n\nAndy Saunders’ “Apollo Remastered” book is out now.\n\n", "authors": ["Jack Bantock"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/08/bohjalian-back-sleepwalker/96292624/", "title": "Bohjalian back with 'The Sleepwalker'", "text": "Dennis Redmond\n\nFree Press Staff Writer\n\nSleepwalking — a form of parasomnia — is a condition experienced by millions.

Once she destroyed the hydrangeas in front of her home in the small town of Bartlett. Then there was the night her older daughter, Lianna, pulled her back from the precipice of the Gale River bridge.\n\nLianna, the college-age daughter, her younger sister Paige, a high school swimmer and skier, and Annalee’s husband, Warren, fear the worst. Warren, a Middlebury College professor, was out of town the night she disappeared and was out of town during some of her other nighttime wanderings.\n\nThe story is narrated mostly by Lianna, a pot-smoking amateur magician, who drops out of college to stay home and take care of her sister and father, who is turning to liquor to soothe his pain as search parties comb the nearby woods.\n\nLianna finds some comfort of her own as she develops a relationship with Gavin Rikert, the state police detective investigating her mother’s disappearance.\n\nAnd Rickert also has some dark secrets of his own that come into play as his interest in Lianna grows deeper.\n\nMysteries, twists and turns all unravel in Bohjalian’s story as the main characters deal with Annalee’s disappearance in their own ways and as Lianna becomes acquainted with the world of sleepwalking. Lianna also learns of stories, secrets, rumors and background about her mother and her sleepwalking.\n\nExcerpt from ‘The Sleepwalker’\n\nBohjalian, a New York Times best-selling author and former Sunday columnist for the Burlington Free Press, lives in the Addison County town of Lincoln. He uses his town as the setting for the book along with some familiar places in Middlebury and downtown Burlington. Local readers will recognize the New Haven River in Lincoln, the Middlebury College swimming pool, downtown Burlington’s Vermont House, a local cupcake bakery and even the Sears parking lot in South Burlington.\n\nBohjalian is the author of 19 books, including “The Guest Room,” “Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands,” “The Sandcastle Girls,” “Skeletons at the Feast” and “Midwives.”\n\nBefore he sets out on a national book tour, the author took the time to answer some questions about “The Sleepwalker,” the art of writing and books that inspired him.\n\nQ&A with Chris Bohjalian\n\nBurlington Free Press: Your new book is all about sleepwalking and some of its variations and implications and dangers. How did you come up with this topic?\n\nBohjalian: I thought I was going to write a book about dreams — that great Freudian abyss. And so I was having lunch with the director of the UVM Sleep Center to try and understand more about sleep cycles and what we know about our brains when we dream. At one point, the conversation rather naturally went to sleepwalking and I grew interested. And the more I researched the topic, the more excited I grew. People sleep-cook, sleep-drive, sleep-jog, sleep-murder. And so instead of writing about the part of sleep where we dream, I wrote about the part of sleep where we walk.\n\nBFP: What type of research did you do? Did you talk to any local experts?\n\nBohjalian: The first person I spoke with was Dr. Garrick Applebee. At the time he was the director of the Sleep Center at the UVM Medical Center, but now he and his family have moved to Albany, New York. He is incredibly knowledgeable about what the body and the mind are doing when we sleep. He’s a great guy and an incredibly interesting lunch companion.\n\nIn addition, I spent a lot of time talking to Emmet Helrich. Currently he’s the coordinator for the state’s rapid intervention community court. He a former lieutenant with the Burlington Police Department and also a great person to spend a lunch with. In addition to his experience in law enforcement, he’s an extremely astute judge of motive: why we do what we do. Emmet has helped with other books I’ve written and he’s helped other writers, including Gillian Flynn when she was writing “Gone Girl.”\n\nI really enjoy the research part of a book — and it’s profoundly important. As John Gardner observed years ago, among the ways you can wake your reader from the fictional dream is with inauthenticity, or bad research. Whenever I have writer’s block, it’s because I haven’t done my homework and I simply don’t know enough to bring a scene to life.\n\nBFP: In the book you cite how some sleepwalkers get acquitted of crimes with their condition as a defense. Were you surprised by this?\n\nBohjalian: I was surprised. In one study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, in nine cases of sleep-related violence (including murder and attempted murder), there were four acquittals when sleepwalking was the defense. In cases of sexual behavior and violence, the sleepwalking defense resulted in an even higher acquittal rate.\n\nBFP: How common is sleepwalking — or parasomnia — and what kind of research has been done about it?\n\nBohjalian: Roughly 10 percent of children have some history of sleepwalking or night terrors or confusional arousals. Roughly four percent of adults have had at least one sleepwalking event in the last year.\n\nSleep study is a very young field. The term “arousal disorder” wasn’t even coined until 1968. It was only in 1979 that medicine began categorizing sleepwalking and parasomnias. And forensic sleep medicine has really only been around for a little more than a decade.\n\nBFP: The descriptions of police work and searching for a missing person are very realistic. What kind of research was involved here?\n\nBohjalian: Certainly I have to give another shout-out to Emmet Helrich. He walked me through exactly how the investigation would proceed. But I also learned a bit about search and rescue from Mike Cannon of Colchester, Vermont Technical Rescue and Andrew Graham, a police officer in Essex. And Dr. Steven Shapiro, chief medical examiner for the state of Vermont, shared with me the mysteries of the morgue. This is, I believe, the third of my books in which Steven was incredibly generous with his wisdom and his time.\n\nBFP: The story follows the ups and downs of the main character Lianna Ahlberg, daughter of the missing sleepwalker. Many of your books are told through a woman’s or girl’s perspective. Why do you think this works so well for you?\n\nBohjalian: I love writing across gender. I tend to like my female characters a lot more than my male ones. Maybe there is too much of me in the men in my books, and I know my own demons too well.\n\nBut as my daughter Grace Experience observed after reading a rough draft of one of my earlier novels, “Dad, take this as a compliment, because I mean it that way, but I think your sweet spot as a writer is seriously messed up young women.” She’s right.\n\nBFP: “The Sleepwalker” is a mystery with some crucial twists and turns along the way. In this type of story, do you know the ending right away? Is the whole plot outlined? Or do you come up with some of the story lines while writing the book?\n\nBohjalian: I have no idea where my books are going when I begin. I have just the vaguest premise — in this case, a woman with a rare form of parasomnia who disappears one night. I depend upon my characters to take me by the hand and lead me through the dark of the story.\n\nI’ve never used an outline. I discover a lot of what is going to happen about the same way my readers do: little by little, as the characters reveal themselves. I think that’s part of the reason why I love what I do — and I always look forward to sitting down at my computer and starting to write.\n\nBFP: You have tweeted that you solve some of your character development while on one of your bicycle rides through Addison County. Does that happen often?\n\nBohjalian: I do some of my best work on my bike and have for years. My mind roams a little more freely and I tend to solve problems about characters and plotting and motivation. I’ve written whole scenes on my iPhone while biking. I pull over when I have an idea and write wherever I am, and then edit it as soon as I get home.\n\nThe short story prequel to “The Sleepwalker,” a tale called “The Premonition,” begins with power lines swaying ominously in the breeze before an August thunderstorm. I witnessed precisely that while biking one day last summer and wrote the first few paragraphs of that story on my iPhone.\n\nBFP: When not working out the story while riding, what is your daily writing schedule like? Do you write at the crack of dawn, the crack of noon or under the moon?\n\nBohjalian: I start my day around 6 in the morning with a Red Bull and a couple of movie trailers. I love movie trailers: They instantly catapult me into the place I need to be to write.\n\nI write until lunchtime. The goal is to produce a thousand words a day. I don’t always write that many, and a lot of what I write will end up on the cutting room floor. But it’s progress and invariably it gives me something I can work on.\n\nBFP: “The Sleepwalker” is set in rural Addison County, Middlebury College and in downtown Burlington. The historic Vermont House in Burlington has some key scenes as does the village of Bartlett, which has appeared in other books. How do come up with which settings to use?\n\nBohjalian: Usually I begin with the characters. Little by little I come to understand who they are, and that means building their small worlds —including such basics as where they live and what they do for a living.\n\nBut Vermont itself is a great character. I love this place for a thousand reasons, but among them are the realities that whole books can be constructed around our weather or the beauty of our natural landscape. Also? Sometimes we seem to be a strangely prescient microcosm of the conflicts affecting the rest of the nation.\n\nBFP: Bartlett seems very much like Lincoln, where you live — with the river, country store and small-town neighbors helping neighbors. What do the people of Lincoln think of having their little town as a “character” in your books?\n\nBohjalian: I’m not sure. Certainly parts of Lincoln appeared in “Water Witches,” “Midwives,” “The Law of Similars,” “Trans-Sister Radio,” and “The Buffalo Soldier.” In “The Sleepwalker” I am using that same geography — although the New Haven River in real life is nowhere near as wide or deep or powerful as the Gale River in the novel. If my neighbors have seen elements of the village in some of my novels, I can only hope they have been flattered. It is a wonderful community and one of the greatest blessings in my wife’s and my life was getting to raise our daughter here.\n\nBFP: There is quite a bit of gossip, hearsay and theories by the residents of Bartlett about Annalee Ahlberg’s life and her disappearance. This seems true to life.\n\nBohjalian: I think it’s very natural for all of us to wonder about the mysteries of our neighbors — and what goes on when the front door is shut and the shades are drawn.\n\nBFP: And does the Lincoln General Store make those Mexican wraps featured in “The Sleepwalker?”\n\nBohjalian: The Lincoln General Store is one of my favorite places in Vermont. The desserts and cookies and pastries they make there everyday are culinary heaven — and worth every calorie, which isn’t true of most confections. And, yes, they also have delicious sandwiches and wraps. But the character in the novel who works at the general store is nothing like the people who work at the real Lincoln General Store. The women of the Lincoln General Store could be spies. They will take the town’s secrets to their graves.\n\nBFP: Magic is a central part of “The Sleepwalker.” Where do you draw these scenes and magic acts from?\n\nBohjalian: I was a child and teenage magician. I used to perform at children’s birthday parties until I was 16. I loved it. I especially loved wearing a cape.\n\nBFP: Who are the authors that influenced you the most in your writing career?\n\nBohjalian: I savored the work of Scott Fitzgerald as a young man because of the wistfulness that marked his work, but I also appreciated the way so many Russian writers really agonized over the “big” questions. In addition, I owe a debt to Harper Lee, Joyce Carol Oates, William Peter Blatty, and Peter Benchley for the ways they inspired me when I was a pretty lonely middle school kid in South Florida.\n\nBFP: What are five novels everyone should read and why?\n\nBohjalian: That’s a great question — and highly subjective. I will share with you five novels I revere as a reader and a writer and that have stood the test of time.\n\n• “Anna Karenina” — I love how real and nuanced the characters are. But that’s only one reason why it’s a masterpiece. It moves effortlessly through one of the biggest canvases ever: nineteenth-century Russia.\n\n•“The Great Gatsby” — We may never have a great American novel, but this is both great and distinctly American. And for a short novel, it has a lot of the most beautiful sentences in American literature.\n\n•“To Kill a Mockingbird” —I cherish Scout’s voice and I’m always moved by her coming of age — and her discovery that injustice is such an inescapable part of the soul of the world.\n\n•“Beloved” — Toni Morrison is a bit like Tolstoy in terms of the brilliance with which she shares the internal lives of her characters. And I think it is important that America never loses sight of the horrific stain of American slavery.\n\n•“Sophie’s Choice” —I first read it 35 years ago and it still haunts me. I was standing on the Brooklyn Bridge last month and found myself thinking of Sophie and Stingo and Nathan.\n\nNow, ask me this question tomorrow and I might suggest five different books. But those are the novels that I thought of today.\n\nBFP: Any hints on your next book after “The Sleepwalker”? The topic and where it takes place?\n\nBohjalian: My next novel is called “The Flight Attendant.” It’s set in Dubai, Rome and New York City. I love aviation and travel and I am fascinated by those people who spend their professional lives at 35,000 feet and see a lot of the country or a lot of the world. And I think this forthcoming novel is reminescent of my best work: it is all about regret — and dread.\n\nAbout the book\n\n“The Sleepwalker” by Chris Bohjalian\n\nPublished by Doubleday, 284 pages\n\n$26.95\n\nThis story was first posted on Jan. 8, 2017.

All the photos he took, including the iconic boot print, were of fellow NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin.\n\nBut Armstrong’s face and other details of the mission were finally revealed in 2019, when photographer Andy Saunders used an enhancement technique called stacking to produce the clearest, composite image of Armstrong’s iconic excursion.\n\nSince then, Saunders has applied his technique to 400 images from the Apollo program. His book of images, “Apollo Remastered,” was published in September.\n\n“I want people to feel like this is as close as they can get to walking on the moon themselves,” Saunders told CNN.\n\nDuring his 10,000 hours of working on Apollo images, Saunders set himself another task: solving the case of the missing lunar golf ball.\n\nDefying gravity\n\nAstronaut Alan Shepard served as the commander of NASA's Apollo 14 lunar landing mission. Space Frontiers / Archive Photos / Getty Images\n\nIn 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American to journey to space — and 10 years later, he was the first person to play golf on the moon.\n\nThe late NASA astronaut, known for his zest for life, smuggled a custom 6-iron clubhead and some golf balls to the moon during Apollo 14.\n\nAt the end of a nine-hour walk on the lunar surface, Shepard stuck the head on the end of a sampling tool and literally swung for the moon — one-handed, of course.\n\nProud of his second shot after an initial slice into a crater, Shepard said the golf ball sailed for “miles and miles and miles.”\n\nNow, Saunders has determined just how far Shepard’s shot traveled and where the golf ball likely still sits on the moon — and it’s not as far as anyone thought.\n\nMeanwhile, the Artemis I mission is ready to take a final lap around the moon before setting a return course to Earth next week — and the Orion spacecraft is providing plenty of glimpses from its historic journey along the way.\n\nFantastic creatures\n\nIn Kenya’s oldest park, rare prehistoric-looking elephants bearing massive tusks stand out among the “theater of the wild.”\n\nConservationist Joseph Kyalo grew up watching the wandering giants, known as Super Tuskers, along the protected area of the Tsavo East National Park.\n\nThese pachyderms have tusks that weigh over 100 pounds (45 kilograms) and are so long they usually graze the ground. But these eye-catching features also make the elephants the prime target of ivory poachers.\n\nKyalo and other members of the nonprofit Tsavo Trust aim to protect the Super Tuskers and grow their dwindling population.\n\nA long time ago\n\nAn original slate plaque (left) modeled after an owl is shown with a replica adorned with owl feathers inserted in drilled holes. John J. Negro/Scientific Reports\n\nThousands of slate pieces shaped and engraved to look like owls have been found in tombs and pits across Portugal and Spain for more than a century.\n\nAfter puzzling over them for decades, researchers have finally determined the artifacts served a playful purpose: as toys.\n\nChildren made and used the adorable owls, which included a spot just right for a tuft of feathers atop the head, around 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe slate pieces are in good company with a number of ancient finds that might have once delighted children across the ages.\n\nOther worlds\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope, which can detect incredibly distant galaxies, has been eyeing cosmic objects a little bit closer to home.\n\nThe space observatory turned its infrared gaze to Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, to peer through the thick haze of its atmosphere and spy dreamy clouds.\n\nThe intriguing world is the only moon to harbor a dense atmosphere and has Earth-like rivers and lakes on its surface.\n\nMeanwhile, during a visit to NASA headquarters in Washington, Vice President Kamala Harris and French President Emmanuel Macron were among the first to see a new Webb image depicting the beautiful chaos of entangled, merging galaxies.\n\nWild kingdom\n\nA snow leopard stands against a backdrop of the mountains of Ladakh in northern India.

His morning ride up the monument’s eight-mile scenic drive had been on an otherwise empty van, and he had not seen another soul while enjoying nine miles of trail.\n\nThe relative seclusion within a 40-mile-long mountain range, once inhabited by the Chiricahua Apaches, remains a getaway mainly for those in the know, possibly numbering no more than 130,000 people a year, according to the National Park Service. For the sake of a burgeoning tourism economy in small towns around the mountains, Arizona politicians and regional boosters hope to draw more attention and traffic by redesignating the 12,025-acre wonder to make it America’s 64th national park. The change would help it stand out among 424 monuments, lakeshores, parkways and other sites managed by the National Park Service.\n\nVisting Chiricahua was a far different experience than Boulter, a “view chaser” from Kalamazoo, Michigan, had encountered at Arches National Park, the previous destination on his western trip. That sandstone spectacle outside of Moab, Utah, was \"so flooded with people\" it required timed permits for entry. The story is similar at other famous sites adorned with the “national park” moniker far north of Chiricahua. Grand Canyon National Park, about a seven-hour drive from Chiricahua, attracted 4.7 million people last year.\n\nIf Congress approves, Chiricahua would become the first national park atop one of Arizona's Sky Islands, a chain of biologically rich and diverse mountain ranges that extend north from Mexico. Also called the Madrean Archipelago, these forested \"islands\" towering over a sea of desert grasslands are a mixing zone for migrating birds and mammals from the Rockies and Sierra Madres. They attract birders from across America, and at least one jaguar that has set off camera traps as it traversed the mountains in recent years.\n\nThe zone faces renewed pressure from mining companies and from a changing climate that could push some species off the mountains. Fire, including one that burned across most of the national monument a dozen years ago, is a constant threat to pine and spruce species living at the edges of their natural range.\n\nCreating a park would require Congress to act\n\nPutting Chiricahua on the national parks map could buoy gateway motels, restaurants and wineries 35 minutes away in Willcox.\n\n“Obviously, you get more exposure when it’s a national park,” said Greg Hancock, a Willcox city councilmember. He moved from Safford to Willcox and bought neighboring motels that had previously closed, hoping to capitalize on the potential he saw when wine-tasting rooms and festivals energized the sleepy Interstate-10 town. He refurbished one motel and is working on the second, both of which stand opposite empty warehouses and near an empty car showroom. “I’d like to see the town grow,” he said.\n\nNew crowds streaming to Chiricahua might also deter solo wilderness seekers like Boulter.\n\n“It’s beautiful,” he said, just as it is. “One of the things I really like about it is it flies under the radar.” He said he would prefer national park designations to prioritize preservation, not profit.\n\nUnlike national monuments, which presidents can create on their own under the Antiquities Act to protect landmarks and landscapes of historic or scientific interest, national parks require congressional authorization. The U.S. Senate approved a Chiricahua National Park bill last year, but the House did not act on it before that session ended.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, announced in March that he had reintroduced the bill with cosponsor support from Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Arizona. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Arizona, introduced companion legislation in the House. All three touted a national park’s ability to boost tourism in the region. If approved this year, the legislation would create Arizona’s fourth national park, after Grand Canyon, Saguaro and Petrified Forest.\n\nDedicated in 1924 and still featuring rock trail work completed by the New Deal’s Civilian Conservation Corps, Chiricahua National Monument protects wildlands and a broad sprinkling of rhyolite columns and balanced rocks, also known as hoodoos, eroded from the tuff deposited 27 million years ago by a volcanic explosion. A chartreuse layer of lichens clings to the taupe pillars. More than eight-tenths of the monument is congressionally designated wilderness, meaning roads and mechanized travel are generally forbidden beyond the scenic drive, a campground and a visitor center.\n\nLocal families who had sought monument status to drive tourism called this part of the mountains the “Wonderland of Rocks.” The Apaches called it the “Land of Standing-Up Rocks,” according to the National Park Service.\n\nCongressional support:Sen. Mark Kelly, Rep. Juan Ciscomani team up to make Chiricahua National Monument a national park\n\nA new level of protection for the landscape\n\nThe monument is a “hidden gem” among the national parks and monuments systems, said Tiffany Powers, head of interpretation, education and visitor services for the National Park Service’s Southeast Arizona Group. Only 50,000 to 65,000 people pass through the visitor center in a given year, she said. The monument does not charge an entrance fee or track every visitor, though, and managers assume at least another 50,000 to 65,000 people enter the park but skip the visitor center.\n\nMost of those visitors come in February and March, Powers said, coinciding with the region’s busy birdwatching season. “You can have the park to yourself the rest of the year,” she said.\n\nWhile the National Park Service takes no official position on the legislation, Powers said, she and others on the monument’s leadership team would welcome the chance to greet more visitors. “What are we preserving this for if people can’t come here and enjoy it?”\n\nPark status would also confer a greater level of protection to the land, Powers said. Management priorities wouldn’t change, but dissolving or shrinking a national park would require an act of Congress. Though reductions to national monuments are rare, former Republican President Donald Trump downsized two Utah monuments that Democratic presidents had created.\n\nNot much is likely to change immediately if Congress redesignates Chiricahua as a park, Powers said. The legislation does not increase funding for the monument or increase its staff of 33. That could change over time if more visitors hear about and visit the park, causing the agency to redistribute funds to keep up.\n\nThere’s little developable area to make significant changes. Managers plan to upgrade camp and picnic sites, but don’t have room to add or widen roads. That could change if private lands nearby become available for sale, Powers said.\n\nWhere to travel:Top 10 state and national parks around Arizona that aren't Grand Canyon\n\nNot everyone wants a national park nearby\n\nThe monument’s compact stature and limited development are reasons some neighbors are skeptical of a park designation. Doubts appear strongest on the east side of the Chiricahua Mountains, opposite the monument’s west-side entry. There, around clusters of homesteads for birdwatchers and night-sky aficionados at the hamlets of Portal and Paradise, some believe they already have their hands full with visitors. It’s a place where people consider the lack of cellphone service an amenity.\n\n“I don’t need any more business,” said Reed Peters, who bought a Portal lodge catering to birdwatchers shortly after he came birding himself in the 1990s. Called Cave Creek Ranch, his business rents rooms and cottages under a canopy of oaks and sycamores in a habitat favoring numerous birds rare to the U.S., including the elegant trogon, a red-white-and-green birder magnet that’s more common in Mexico and Central America. His outpost at the base of Cave Creek Canyon is connected to the monument’s entrance via a narrow gravel road that winds over the mountains through Coronado National Forest and closes in winter.\n\n“The thing that might save us is that the road is so bad,” Peters said.\n\nLocal Cochise County services such as EMTs also are scarce in the area, he said, and hiking trails on the U.S. Forest Service lands surrounding the monument are in rough shape. The creek grows algae in summer, he said, nourished by human waste because there are inadequate restrooms. “Nobody here has the staff to deal with more people.”\n\nMostly, Peters said, the monument itself doesn’t have space to handle more people.\n\n“It’s totally inappropriate for the scale of the place. It works very well the way it is.” He mentioned Massai Point, a commanding viewpoint over the rock spires, and the place most roadside visitors stop for a look when the monument road tops out.\n\n“You can’t expand the mountaintop,” he said. “That’s all there is.”\n\nStill, “You can love an area to death,” said Rick Taylor, a naturalist, author and birding guide. He moved to the east side of the Chiricahuas after he fell in love with the mountains while working as a fire lookout in the 1970s. Through various jobs he held at the monument, he had an arduous but enjoyable daily commute via dirt bike, hike and bicycle left chained in the forest. It was the kind of place he could leave a bike chained to a tree and no one would notice or take it. Making it a national park could change the intimate place he loves, likely disappointing some of the newcomers because there’s no room for upgrades within park boundaries, he said.\n\n“I’m sure we’ll get spillover visitation to this side of the mountains,” he said, noting the likely effect on Peters’ lodge. “It’ll just mean there’s a longer waiting list at Cave Creek Ranch.”\n\n'There's not a lot up there'\n\nAcross the mountains in Willcox, though, local officials are all in on the park idea. They began writing to the congressional delegation to press their case two years ago, City Manager Caleb Blaschke said. Having built a tourism reputation on wine grapes and the throng of sandhills cranes that descend on a nearby playa each winter, he said, Willcox is ready for the next step. “We think we’ll get increased visitation to our community.”\n\n“Most people associate the word ‘monument’ with something small,” Blaschke said. But when people arrive and “see all those pillars and start hiking see all the wild turkeys and deer, it’s a totally different thing than you thought it was going to be.”\n\nSome locals who enjoy the Chiricahua Mountains say they’re eager for the business but not necessarily new traffic to their favorite campsites.\n\n“I love Turkey Creek,” said George Burkert, referring to a recreation zone south of the monument. His wife, Janet, agreed, but said she has little use for the monument, especially because there are few campsites and they cost more than camping on the nearby national forest.\n\n“There’s not a lot up there. To us, the monument is: Drive up the road and look,” she said. \"It's not my place to go to.\"\n\nIf a national park attracted more people, though, it could benefit the couple’s buy-sell-trade shop, Willcox Traders, which occupies a prominent downtown corner on the intersection where motorists turn south toward the Chiricahuas. The shop sells everything from greeting cards to dishes, books, used vacuum cleaners and live chicks. The couple said a tourist once bought a young goat from them and rented a truck to get it home.\n\nThe rock formations are worthy of national park preservation, hiker Dayton VanAcker said while passing through the monument’s Echo Canyon Grottoes, where shaded recesses in the rhyolite open onto dramatic views of the spires. But the rocks alone aren’t what had drawn the young man from Mesa to Chiricahua 13 times and counting.\n\n“I come looking for the rattlesnakes,” he said. An amateur herpetologist who also studied reptiles in college, he enjoys photographing snakes. VanAcker spoke after just missing his chance to photograph a banded rock rattler: He and the snake had startled each other on the trail.\n\nThe Chiricahuas have a unique assortment of animals, VanAcker said, including not just reptiles, but birds like the trogon and mammals like the coati. They’re among the nation’s most biodiverse mountains, and he said he hopes park designation will help keep them that way.\n\n“Places like this should be preserved,” he said.\n\nBrandon Loomis covers environmental and climate issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

The Jets signed him to a five-year, $72.5 million contract in March of 2018, committing $34 million guaranteed over the first two seasons believing they had secured a lockdown cornerback for the future.\n\nBut Johnson had a horrible 2018 with the Jets, struggling with injury, poor play and even getting benched for tardiness in Week 17. He briefly lost his starting job early this season because of poor play, and now his ankle injuries will limit him to only seven games.\n\nIn the end, Johnson will likely play only 17 games for the Jets -- yes, that's $2 million per game.

The Jets also signed linebackers Bryce Hager and Noah Dawkins, and offensive lineman Blake Hance, to the practice squad.\n\nMalone has four catches for 16 yards this season while helping bolster an injury-depleted receiving group. He began the season on the practice squad, but was elevated to the active roster before each of the first two games. As part of new NFL rules, a team can elevate a player from the practice squad and then return him twice in a season without exposing him to waivers.\n\nHe joins Chris Hogan and Braxton Berrios as the only healthy wide receivers on the active roster. Breshad Perriman injured an ankle against San Francisco last Sunday and could miss a few games.

We will continue to update this list as players make their decisions.\n\nHere's a look at the top players available at each position, along with Insider Zak Keefer's take on the Colts' needs at each:\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nKirk Cousins, Washington Redskins: Received franchise tag Mike Glennon, Tampa Bay: Signing with Chicago, 3 years, $45 million, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Brian Hoyer, Chicago: Signing with San Francisco, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Chase Daniel, Philadelphia Geno Smith, New York Jets: Signs with New York Giants. Ryan Fitzpatrick, New York Jets Jay Cutler, Chicago Colin Kaepernick, San Francisco Matt Barkley, Chicago: Signs with San Francisco, 2 years. Josh McCown, Cleveland: Signs with New York Jets, 1 year.\n\nBest of the rest: Landry Jones, Pittsburgh (Re-signs with Pittsburgh); Case Keenum, Los Angeles Rams; Nick Foles, Kansas City (signs with Philadelphia, 2 years); Mark Sanchez, Dallas; Robert Griffin III, Cleveland; EJ Manuel, Buffalo (signs with Oakland); Blaine Gabbert, San Francisco; Matt McGloin, Oakland; Christian Ponder, San Francisco; T.J. Yates, Miami; Dan Orlovsky, Detroit; Shaun Hill, Minnesota; Josh Johnson, New York Giants re-signs with New York Giants, 2 years); Kellen Moore, Dallas (re-signs with Dallas); Johnny Manziel, Cleveland; Ryan Nassib, New York Giants; Thad Lewis, San Francisco.\n\nAll things Colts: Latest Indianapolis Colts news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nKirk Cousins proved last year wasn't a fluke and dropped over 4,900 yards and 25 touchdowns in Washington, but the franchise tag was slapped on him again for the second year. Could a trade be in his future? ... With few options available, teams in a need of a stop-gap starter will kick the tires on Mike Glennon and Geno Smith ... Bryan Hoyer had six TDs and zero interceptions while subbing in for the Bears before breaking his arm. He could find himself reunited with Kyle Shanahan in San Francisco.\n\nColts outlook: No discussion here. If Andrew Luck misses any time recovering from early-January shoulder surgery, back-up Scott Tolzien will take the reins.\n\nRunning backs\n\nLe'Veon Bell, Pittsburgh: Received franchise tag Adrian Peterson, Minnesota Eddie Lacy, Green Bay: Signs with Seattle, 1 year, $5.55 million. Jamaal Charles, Kanas City Latavius Murray, Oakland: Signs with Minnesota, 3 years. LeGarrette Blount, New England Rex Burkhead, Cincinnati: Signs with New England. Andre Ellington, Arizona: Re-signs, 1 year. Jacquizz Rodgers, Tampa Bay: Re-signing with Tampa Bay, according to ESPN's Jenna Laine. Danny Woodhead, Los Angeles Chargers: Signing with Baltimore, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.\n\nBest of the rest: Christine Michael, Green Bay (re-signs with Green Bay); Chris Johnson, Arizona; Brandon Bolden, New England; Tim Hightower, New Orleans; DeAngelo Williams, Pittsburgh; Justin Forsett, Denver; Darren McFadden, Dallas (re-signs with Dallas, 1 year); Denard Robinson, Jacksonville; Jonathan Grimes, Houston; Shaun Draughn, San Francisco (signs with New York Giants); Bobby Rainey, New York Giants; Jordan Todman, Indianapolis; Robert Turbin, Indianapolis (re-signs with Indianapolis, 2 years); Knile Davis, Kansas City (signs with Pittsburgh); Lance Dunbar, Dallas (signs with Los Angeles Rams, 1 year); Rashad Jennings, New York Giants; Travaris Cadet, New Orleans (re-signs with New Orleans); Antone Smith, Tampa Bay; Dexter McCluster, Los Angeles Chargers; Benny Cunningham, Los Angeles Rams (signs with Chicago); DuJuan Harris, San Francisco; Chase Reynolds, Los Angeles Rams; Matt Asiata, Minnesota; James Starks, Green Bay; Ronnie Hillman, Los Angeles Chargers; Cedric Peerman, Cincinnati; Stepfan Taylor, Arizona; Joique Bell, Detroit; Reggie Bush, Buffalo.\n\nAdrian Peterson averaged 1.9 yards per carry behind a mediocre (at best) offensive line last season. Despite turning 32 this month, Peterson will have suitors for his services, banking last year was an anomaly. ... Eddie Lacy may have only racked up 72 yards per game for Green Bay, but his 5.1 yards per carry says people should consider giving him a call. ... Can anyone trust the knees of Jamaal Charles? Someone will give him a year to find out. ... Rex Burkhead could be the diamond in the rough. He posted a 4.6 yard per carry average for Cincinnati, including a regular season finale where he racked up 119 yards and two TDs against Baltimore.\n\nColts outlook: The most glaring need on the offensive side of the ball for Indianapolis, the Colts figure to attack this in the draft rather than free agency. They need their running back of the future. Robert Turbin, a viable back-up to Frank Gore, will hit the open market but hopes to return to Indianapolis. If the Colts are smart, they address this need in April, not March.\n\nFullbacks\n\nPatrick DiMarco, Atlanta: Signing with Buffalo, 4 years, $8.5 million, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Kyle Juszczyk, Baltimore: Signing with San Francisco, 4 years, $21 million, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Mike Tolbert, Carolina: Signing with Buffalo, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Zach Line, Minnesota Jerome Felton, Buffalo Marcel Reece, Seattle Will Tukuafu, Seattle\n\nPatrick DiMarco flashed his pass catching skills against the Colts in Week 11 of the 2015 season with three catches for 21 yards and two TDs. Every team in the NFL remembers watching him open holes for Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman in 2016. ... Kyle Juszczyk is also known for his soft hands out of the backfield, but shined in the blocking department, especially where Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco was concerned.\n\nColts outlook: Won’t happen. The Colts have much, much bigger concerns.\n\nWide receivers\n\nAlshon Jeffery, Chicago: Signing with Philadelphia for 1 year, $14 million, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport DeSean Jackson, Washington: Signs with Tampa Bay according to the team. Terrelle Pryor, Cleveland: Signs with Washington. Brandon Marshall, New York Jets: Signing with New York Giants, 2 years, $12 million, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Michael Floyd, New England Kenny Britt, Los Angeles Rams: Signing with Cleveland, according to ESPN's Adam Caplan. Kendall Wright, Tennessee: Signs with Chicago, 1 year, $4 million. Pierre Garcon, Washington: Signing with San Francisco, 3 years, according to NFL Network's Mike Garafolo. Robert Woods, Buffalo: Signing with Los Angeles Rams, 5 years, $39 million, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Cordarrelle Patterson, Minnesota: Signs with Oakland.\n\nBest of the rest: Ted Ginn Jr., Carolina (signing with New Orleans, according to ESPN's Dianna Russini‏); Torrey Smith, San Francisco (Signing with Philadelphia, 3 years, $15 million, according to Ian Rapoport); Brian Quick, Los Angeles Rams; Terrance Williams, Dallas (re-signs with Dallas, 4 years); Anquan Boldin, Detroit; Marquess Wilson, Chicago; Markus Wheaton, Pittsburgh (signs with Chicago); Kamar Aiken, Baltimore (signs with Indianapolis, 1 year); Andrew Hawkins, Cleveland; Andre Holmes, Oakland (signs with Buffalo); Vincent Jackson, Tampa Bay; Stevie Johnson, Los Angeles Chargers; Rod Streater, San Francisco; Victor Cruz, New York Giants; Justin Hunter, Buffalo (signs with Pittsburgh); Marquise Goodwin, Buffalo (Signing with San Francisco, 2 years, $8 million, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport); Stedman Bailey, Los Angeles; Marc Mariani, Tennessee; Deonte Thompson, Chicago; Aldrick Robinson, Atlanta (signs with San Francisco); Andre Roberts, Detroit (signs with Atlanta); Quinton Patton, San Francisco; Percy Harvin, Buffalo (retiring); Bryan Walters, Jacksonville; Eric Weems, Atlanta (signs with Tennessee); Michael Johnson, Philadelphia; Marlon Brown, Denver; Russell Shepard, Tampa Bay (signs with Carolina); Cecil Shorts, Tampa Bay; Jordan Norwood, Denver.\n\nAlshon Jeffery didn't get the big numbers he was hoping for in 2016 and a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's PED policy didn't help his cause. However, he is clearly the top talent in this year's wide receiver crop and someone will surely pay top dollar for his services. ... DeSean Jackson's 17.9 yards per catch was among the best in the league last season. He's still in his prime at 30 years old. ... Terrelle Pryor is the ultimate question mark. Can he hold up as a No. 1 receiver? With 1,007 yards in his first full year at the position, teams are eager to find out.\n\nColts outlook: One of the team’s deepest units – no, that’s not saying much – the Colts won’t be chasing any wide receivers this week. T.Y. Hilton just led the league in receiving yards and is playing on a $65 million contract. Donte Moncrief is due for an extension next year, and Phillip Dorsett has at least another season to prove he’s a first-round talent. Also, Chester Rogers impressed down the stretch for Indy and is under contract for two more years.\n\nTight ends\n\nMartellus Bennett, New England: Signing with Green Bay Packers, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Jared Cook, Green Bay: Signs with Oakland, 2 years. Jacob Tamme, Atlanta Luke Willson, Seattle: Re-signs with Seattle, 1 year Anthony Fasano, Tennessee: Signing with Miami per ESPN's Jeff Darlington Dion Sims, Miami: Signs with Chicago. Gavin Escobar, Dallas Levine Toilolo, Atlanta: Re-signs with Atlanta. Larry Donnell, New York Giants Jordan Cameron, Miami: Retired\n\nBest of the rest: Mychal Rivera, Oakland (signs with Jacksonville); Ryan Griffin, Houston (re-signs with Houston, 3 years); Timothy Wright, Detroit; Clay Harbor, Detroit; Kellen Davis, New York Jets; Brandon Williams, Seattle (signs with Indianapolis); MarQueis Gray, Miami; Jim Dray, San Francisco; Logan Paulsen, Chicago; Jeff Cumberland, Los Angeles Chargers; John Phillips, New Orleans; Brandon Myers, Tampa Bay; David Johnson, Pittsburgh (re-signs with Pittsburgh); Matthew Mulligan, Detroit; Dominique Jones, Miami; Gerald Christian, Buffalo.\n\nRare are the tight ends that can do it all, but that is exactly what Martellus Bennett brings to the table. Pair that with his toughness and it's easy to see why he is the top tight end in this market. Did we mention his 701 yards receiving and seven TDs? ... Jared Cook has shown flashes of greatness, but never has made himself a consistent threat. At age 30, the speed that makes him so enticing will start to fade soon.\n\nColts outlook: It all depends on the future of Jack Doyle, the team’s top free agent entering this week. If Doyle walks, Erik Swoope – who had a breakout season in 2016 – slides into the No. 2 spot behind starter Dwayne Allen. Like the running back position, the Colts would very likely look to add depth to the spot through the draft rather than free agency.\n\nOffensive tackles\n\nRiley Reiff, Detroit: Signing with Minnesota according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Andrew Whitworth, Cincinnati: Signing with Los Angeles Rams, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Ricky Wagner, Baltimore: Signing with Detroit, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Russell Okung, Denver: Signs with Los Angeles Chargers, 4 years, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Matt Kalil, Minnesota: Signing with Carolina, 5 years, $55.5 million according to USA Today's Tom Pelissero. Ryan Clady, New York Jets Kelvin Beachum, Jacksonville: Signs with N.Y. Jets. Jordan Mills, Buffalo: Re-signs with Buffalo. Sebastian Vollmer, New England Menelik Watson, Oakland: Signs with Denver, 3 years, $18 million according to Troy Renck of Denver7.\n\nBest of the rest: Mike Remmers, Carolina (signing with Minnesota); Gosder Cherilus, Tampa Bay (retiring); Eric Winston, Cincinnati (re-signs with Cincinnati); Marshall Newhouse, New York Giants (signs with Oakland, 2 years); King Dunlap, Los Angeles Chargers; Will Beatty, New York Giants; Ben Ijalana, New York Jets; Andre Smith, Minnesota (signs with Cincinnati); Matt McCants, Chicago; Bradley Sowell, Seattle; Jake Long, Minnesota; Tony Hills, New Orleans; Mike Adams, Chicago; Earl Watford, Arizona (signs with Jacksonville); Don Barclay, Green Bay (re-signs with Green Bay); Jeffrey Linkenbach, Jacksonville; David Quessenberry, Houston; Sam Young, Miami; Byron Bell, Tennessee; Nick Becton, Chicago.\n\nRiley Reiff was a big part of Matthew Stafford's resurgence, and his skills haven't gone unnoticed. ... Andrew Whitworth is a beast, but he is also 35 years old. When will father time catch up with him? ... Russell Okung didn't pan out in Denver, but considering the weakness of the tackle crop, he's sure to still get paid for his services. ... Teams looking for experience on the offensive line will give Kelvin Beachum another go despite his struggles in 2017.\n\nColts outlook: Of the few tidbits new general manager Chris Ballard offered at last week’s combine, he admitted he was encouraged by the young talent on the team’s offensive line, singling out Joe Haeg and Le’Raven Clark by name. The unit progressed late in the 2016 season, enough so to make you think the Colts could be comfortable with them moving forward. Haeg, Clark and Denzelle Good could offer the sort of training camp competition Ballard wants to instill in the franchise.\n\nGuards\n\nKevin Zeitler, Cincinnati: Signing with Cleveland, 5 years, $60 million, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Larry Warford, Detroit: Signing with New Orleans, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport T.J. Lang, Green Bay: Signs with Detroit, 3 years, Ronald Leary, Dallas: Signing with Denver, 4 years, $35 million, according to NFL Network's Mike Garafolo. Chance Warmack, Tennessee: Signs with Philadelphia according to his agents. Tim Lelito, New Orleans: Signs with Tennessee, 1 year. D.J. Fluker, Los Angeles Chargers: Signs with N.Y. Giants, 1 year. Luke Joeckel, Jacksonville: Signing with Seattle, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Brandon Fusco, Minnesota Ted Larsen, Chicago: Signs with Miami.\n\nBest of the rest: John Jerry, New York Giants (re-signs with N.Y. Giants); Jahri Evans, New Orleans; Mike Harris, Minnesota; Hugh Thornton, Indianapolis (signs with Atlanta); Andrew Gardner, San Francisco; Jermon Bushrod, Miami (re-signs with Miami, 1 year); Chris Chester, Atlanta; Oday Aboushi, Houston (signs with Seattle); Evan Mathis, Arizona; Vladimir Ducasse, Baltimore (Signing with Buffalo, 3 years, according to CBS Sports' Jason La Canfora); Tom Compton, Atlanta (signs with Chicago); Chris Scott, Carolina (re-signs with Carolina); Austin Pasztor, Cleveland.\n\n\n\nThe strength and power of Kevin Zeitler will be coveted by many teams seeking help on the offensive line. ... No one will question the abilities of T.J. Lang. His health? That may be another thing entirely, especially for the price tag he'll demand. ... Ronald Leary did a great job of keeping defenses off of Dak Prescott for the Cowboys. Of course, that is easier to do when you are sandwiched between All-Pros left tackle Tyron Smith and center Travis Frederick.\n\nColts outlook: The guard spot could be the one area on the offensive line the Colts chase in free agency. Jack Mewhort has been solid at the left guard spot since landing in Indy in the second round of the 2013 draft; the right guard spot has been a never-ending game of musical chairs. If 2016 is any indication, Haeg figures to fill that spot moving forward.\n\nCenters\n\nNick Mangold, New York Jets J.C. Tretter, Green Bay: Signing with Cleveland, 3 years, $16.75 million, according to ESPN's Adam Caplan. A.Q. Shipley, Arizona: Re-signing with Arizona, according to the team. Joe Hawley, Tampa Bay: Re-signs with Tampa Bay, 2 years. John Sullivan, Washington Brian Schwenke, Tennessee: Signs with Indianapolis. Ryan Wendell, Carolina Mike Person, Kansas City: Re-signs with Kanas City. Cody Wallace, Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nA weak crop of centers made Nick Mangold's availability a pleasant sight. The Jets are moving on from the 33-year-old veteran to save money, but his experience could be huge for a young offensive line. ... J.C. Tretter's seven-game audition as a fill-in on Green Bay's offensive line went well enough that several teams should be looking into his services.\n\nColts outlook: It’s Ryan Kelly’s job for the next decade.\n\nDefensive ends\n\nCalais Campbell, Arizona: Signing with Jacksonville, 4 years, $60 million, according to ESON's Adam Schefter. Jason Pierre-Paul, New York Giants: Received franchise tag Chris Baker, Washington: Signs with Tampa Bay according to team. Jabaal Sheard, New England: Signs with Indianapolis, 3 years, $25.5 million, according to IndyStar's Stephen Holder. Lawrence Guy, Baltimore: Signs with New England, 4 years. Jared Odrick, Jacksonville Andre Branch, Miami: Re-signing with Miami, 3 years, $27 million, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Dwight Freeney, Atlanta Chris Long, New England Connor Barwin, Philadelphia: Signs with Los Angeles Rams, 1 year.\n\nBest of the rest: Elvis Dumervil, Baltimore; Mario Williams, Miami; Devin Taylor, Detroit; Darryl Tapp, New Orleans; Margus Hunt, Cincinnati (signs with Indianapolis); Jason Jones, Miami; Damontre Moore, Seattle; Justin Trattou, Minnesota; Jarvis Jenkins, Kansas City (re-signs with Kansas City); Stephen Paea, Cleveland (signs with Dallas); Wallace Gilberry, Cincinnati; Cleveland; C.J. Wilson, Chicago (re-signs with Chicago); Cornelius Washington, Chicago (signs with Detroit, 2 years, $6 million according to ESPN's Adam Caplan); Cullen Jenkins, Washington; Cam Thomas, Los Angeles; Ziggy Hood, Washington (re-signs with Washington, 2 years); Glenn Dorsey, San Francisco; Vance Walker, Denver; Damion Square, Los Angeles Chargers (re-signs with Los Angeles Chargers); Kendall Reyes, Kansas City; Antonio Smith, Houston; John Hughes, Tampa Bay; Tony Jerod-Eddie, San Francisco; Billy Winn, Denver; Jack Crawford, Dallas (signs with Atlanta); Greg Scruggs, New England.\n\nAfter eight sacks and 12 tackles for loss in 2016, Calais Campbell has teams with money to spend salivating at the chance to land the 31-year-old. ... Chris Baker's 48 combined tackles and constant ability to create havoc makes him a premium addition for any defensive unit.\n\nColts outlook: Beyond the linebacker spots, there is no greater need on this team than the defensive line. Expensive as he’d be – and he’d be very, very expensive -- Calais Campbell could transform the unit.\n\nTOP HITS: Only days before the start of the free agent signing period, is Zach Kerr out?\n\nDefensive tackles\n\nKawann Short, Carolina: Received franchise tag Brandon Williams, Baltimore: Re-signing with Baltimore according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Dontari Poe, Kansas City: Signs with Atlanta, 1 year, $8 million. Johnathan Hankins, New York Giants Nick Fairley, New Orleans: Signs with New Orleans, 4 years, $30 million, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Alan Branch, New England: Re-signing with Patriots, 2 years, $12 million, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Bennie Logan, Philadelphia: Signs with Kansas City, 1 year. Terrell McClain, Dallas: Signing with Washington, 4 years, $21 million, according to Washington Post's Master Tesfatsion. Stacy McGee, Oakland: Signs with Washington. Karl Klug, Tennessee Titans: Re-signs with Tennessee.\n\nBest of the rest: Vince Wilfork, Houston; Tyrunn Walker, Detroit; Tony McDaniel, Seattle; Sylvester Williams, Denver (signs with Tennessee); Frostee Rucker, Arizona (re-signs with Arizona); Corbin Bryant, Buffalo; Jonathan Babineaux, Atlanta; Roy Miller, Jackonsville; John Jenkins, Seattle (signs with Chicago, 1 year); Kedric Golston, Washington; Stefan Charles, Detroit (signs with Jacksonville); Domata Peko, Cincinnati (signs with Denver, 2 years); Akeem Spence, Tampa Bay (signs with Detroit, 3 years); Jordan Hill, Jacksonville (signs with Detroit); Tyson Jackson, Atlanta; Kyle Love, Carolina (re-signs with Carolina); Ricardo Mathews, Pittsburgh; Leger Douzable, Buffalo; Devon Still, Houston; Sealver Siliga, Tampa Bay (re-signs with Tampa Bay); Tyson Alualu, Jacksonville (signs with Pittsburgh); Paul Soliai, Carolina; Sean Lissemore, Los Angeles Chargers; Brandon Thompson, Cincinnati.\n\nBrandon Williams really should almost be a 1B because he was an one-man wrecking crew when it came to stopping the run in Baltimore. ... Few defensive tackles have the athleticism of Dontari Poe and he's still fairly young. ... Nick Fairley had 43 combined tackles and 6.5 sacks in 2016. If you're looking for raw power, here's where you start.\n\nColts outlook: Like much of the Colts’ defense, this is an unit defined by uncertainty. David Parry just got arrested. Kendall Langford played just seven games last season. Art Jones might not see next season – not at his current salary, at least. Zach Kerr is a restricted free agent. Henry Anderson is coming off an injury-plagued sophomore season. Who could the Colts target? Brandon Williams would beef up a defense that has struggled to stop the run for years. Alan Branch is another possibility, though the Colts haven’t had much luck in recent years chasing 32-year-old free agents. Kansas City’s Dontari Poe is another option, and he’s only 26.\n\nOutside linebackers\n\nMelvin Ingram, Los Angeles Chargers: Received franchise tag Chandler Jones, Arizona: Received franchise tag Nick Perry, Green Bay: Re-signing with Green Bay, 5 years, $60 million, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Julius Peppers, Green Bay: Signs with Carolina. DeMarcus Ware, Denver: Retired. Alex Okafor, Arizona: Signs with New Orleans. Lorenzo Alexander, Buffalo: Re-signs with Buffalo, 2 years. Datone Jones, Green Bay Erik Walden, Indianapolis John Simon, Houston: Signs with Indianapolis, three years, $13.5 million, according to IndyStar's Stephen Holder.\n\nBest of the rest: Paul Kruger, New Orleans; Jarvis Jones, Pittsburgh; Josh Bynes, Detroit Lions; Armonty Bryant, Detroit (re-signs with Detroit); Jelani Jenkins, Miami (signs with Oakland); Courtney Upshaw, Atlanta (Re-signing with Atlanta, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport); Trent Cole, Indianapolis; David Bass, Tennessee; Mike Morgan, Seattle; Bryan Braman, Philadelphia; Michael Mauti, New Orleans; Barkevious Mingo, New England (signs with Indianapolis, 1 year); Sam Acho, Chicago; Spencer Paysinger, Miami; Philip Wheeler, Atlanta; Tourek Williams, Los Angeles Chargers; Ramon Humber, Buffalo; Andrew Gachkar, Dallas; Josh Martin, New York Jets (re-signs with N.Y. Jets); Mark Herzlich, New York Giants (re-signs with New York Giants); Corey Lemonier, New York Jets (re-signs with N.Y. Jets); Dekoda Watson, Denver (signs with San Francisco); Akeem Ayers, Indianapolis; Chris Carter, Indianapolis (signs with Washington); Lerentee McCray, Buffalo (signs with Jacksonville).\n\nNick Perry was tied for fifth in the NFL with 11 sacks while playing with Julius Peppers, Clay Matthews and Datone Jones. There's a need for that. ... Peppers had 7.5 sacks for Green Bay last season. For those keeping track at home, that's 14 of 15 years with at least seven sacks. Did we mention he's 37 years old? ... At 34 years old, DeMarcus Ware still has a way of finding the quarterback and creating havoc in the backfield. Can he stay on the field?\n\nColts outlook: At this position, the Colts need bodies. They need talent. They need something. In light of Robert Mathis’ retirement and the expected departure of Erik Walden, the Colts desperately need to fill the void. Green Bay’s Nick Perry, a viable pass-rusher from the edge, is another option the Colts could look long and hard at. Bottom line: The Colts can’t afford to sit tight at this spot. They have to make something happen.\n\nInside Linebackers\n\nDont'a Hightower, New England: Re-signs with New England, 4 years, $43.5 million. Zach Brown, Buffalo Kevin Minter, Arizona: Signs with Cincinnati, 1 year. Perry Riley, Oakland Lawrence Timmons, Pittsburgh: Signs with Miami, 2 years. Gerald Hodges, San Francisco Malcolm Smith, Oakland: Signing with San Francisco, according to NFL Network's Mike Garafolo. Sio Moore, Arizona Manti Te'o, Los Angeles Chargers: Signs with New Orleans, 2 years. Sean Spence, Tennessee: Signs with Indianapolis, 1 year, $3 million.\n\nBest of the rest: Paul Worrilow, Atlanta (signs with Detroit, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport); Michael Wilhoite, San Francisco; Keenan Robinson, New York Giants (re-signs with New York Giants); A.J. Klein, Carolina (signs with New Orleans); Justin Durant, Dallas; Kelvin Sheppard, New York Giants; Jon Bostic, Detroit; Daryl Smith, Tampa Bay; Stephen Tulloch, Philadelphia; Sean Weatherspoon, Atlanta; Akeem Dent, Houston; Donald Butler, Miami; D'Qwell Jackson, Indianapolis; Rolando McClain, Dallas; Bruce Carter, New York Jets; Daren Bates, Oakland (signs with Tennessee); Nick Bellore, San Francisco; Nate Palmer, Tennessee (re-signs with Tennessee); Audie Cole, Minnesota (signs with Jacksonville); Najee Goode, Philadelphia; Sam Barrington, New Orleans; Terence Garvin, Washington; LaRoy Reynolds, Atlanta (re-signs with Atlanta); Ben Jacobs, Carolina; Jason Trusnik, New Orleans.\n\nDont'a Hightower's flexibility makes him highly coveted. Few inside linebackers can slip into coverage, stuff the run and pressure a quarterback like he can. ... With 97 tackles and four sacks, there's no question Zach Brown will be one of the first to find a new home. ... Kevin Minter provided 81 combined tackles and 3.5 sacks in his fourth season with Arizona and should be on several teams' radar.\n\nColts outlook: The Colts are young at this position – after the release of D’Qwell Jackson, Indy’s top two inside linebackers are Edwin Jackson, coming off his second NFL season, and Antonio Morrison, coming off his first. Dont’a Hightower would be their crown jewel, the sort of playmaker who can play inside and out. His skillset is exactly what this defense has been missing (just ask the Atlanta Falcons). He won’t come cheap, and New England very well could swoop back into the picture after Hightower fields offers from other teams, but the Colts have the salary cap room to afford it. Buffalo’s Zach Brown, entering the prime of his career, would be a solid fit.\n\nCornerbacks\n\nA.J. Bouye, Houston: Signing with Jacksonville, 5 years, $67.5 million, according to the Houston Chronicle's Aaron Wilson Stephon Gilmore, Buffalo: Signing with Buffalo, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Trumaine Johnson, Los Angeles Rams: Received franchise tag Logan Ryan, New England: Signs with Tennessee, according to The Tennessean's Jason Wolf. Dre Kirkpatrick, Cincinnati: Re-signing with Cincinnati. Morris Claiborne, Dallas: Signs with New York Jets, 1 year. Prince Amukamara, Jacksonville: Signing with Chicago according to ESPN's Dan Graziano. Brandon Carr, Dallas: Signs with Baltimore, 4 years. Captain Munnerlyn, Minnesota: Signs with Carolina, 4 years Nolan Carroll, Philadelphia: Signs with Dallas, 3 years.\n\nBest of the rest: Darrelle Revis, New York Jets; Darius Butler, Indianapolis (re-signs with Indianapolis, 1 year); Nickell Robey-Coleman, Buffalo; Sam Shields, Green Bay; Davon House, Jacksonville (signs with Green Bay); Brandon Boykin, Cincinnati; Terence Newman, Minnesota (re-signs with Minnesota); Leodis McKelvin, Philadelphia; Sterling Moore, New Orleans (re-signs with New Orleans); Kayvon Webster, Denver (signs with Los Angeles Rams, 2 years); Robert McClain, Los Angeles Chargers; D.J. Hayden, Oakland (signs with Detroit); Leonard Johnson, Carolina (signs with Buffalo); Brandon Flowers, Los Angeles Chargers; Leon Hall, New York Giants; Jerraud Powers, Baltimore; Marcus Cooper, Arizona (signs with Chicago); Coty Sensabaugh, New York Giants (signs with Pittsburgh, 2 years); Greg Toler, Washington Redskins; Trevin Wade, New York Giants; Valentino Blake, Tennessee (signs with New York Giants); Mike Jenkins, Arizona; Johnthan Banks, Chicago (re-signs with Chicago); Corey White, Buffalo; Josh Robinson, Tampa Bay (re-signs with Tampa Bay); Asa Jackson, Detroit; Chykie Brown, Cincinnati; Chimdi Chekwa, Miami; Ifo Ekpre-Olomu, Miami; Teddy Williams, Carolina (re-sgns with Carolina); Josh Thomas, Dallas; Blidi Wreh-Wilson, Atlanta (re-signs with Atlanta); Kyle Wilson, New Orleans; Shareece Wright, Baltimore; Dwayne Gratz, Philadelphia; Darryl Morris, Indianapolis.\n\nA.J. Bouye started last season as the fourth cornerback and injuries allowed him to showcase his skills. Clearly, he didn't disappoint with 63 combined tackles and 17 passes defended. ... Stephon Gilmore's reputation precedes him as a shutdown corner. He tied for fifth in the NFL with five interceptions last year. ... Logan Ryan was all over the field for the Patriots, collecting 92 total tackles and defending 13 passes.\n\nColts outlook: The Colts could very well be in the market for a cornerback, but don’t expect them to swing big. Patrick Robinson remains under contract opposite Vontae Davis, Indy’s top talent on the entire defense. Re-signing Darius Butler would offer depth at both the cornerback and safety position, making this less of a glaring need. In all likelihood, the Colts won’t be in play for A.J. Bouye or Stephon Gilmore.\n\nSafeties\n\nT.J. McDonald, Los Angeles Rams Tony Jefferson, Arizona: Signing with Baltimore, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Barry Church, Dallas: Signing with Jacksonville, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Johnathan Cyprien, Jacksonville: Signs with Tennessee, 4 years, $25 million, according to Houston Chronicle's Aaron Wilson. Micah Hyde, Green Bay: Signs with Buffalo according to team. Bradley McDougald, Tampa Bay: Signs with Seattle, 1 year. Jahleel Addae, Los Angeles Chargers: Re-signing with Los Angeles Chargers, 4 years, ESPN's Field Yates. D.J. Swearinger, Arizona: Signs with Washington, 3 years, $13.5 million, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. J.J. Wilcox, Dallas: Signs with Tampa Bay. Quintin Demps, Houston: Signing with Chicago, 3 years, $13.5 million, according to Houston Chronicle's Aaron Wilson.\n\nBest of the rest: Jairus Byrd, New Orleans; Donte Whitner, Washington; Duron Harmon, New England (re-signs with New England, 4 years); Matt Elam, Baltimore; James Ihedigbo, Buffalo; Rashad Johnson, Tennessee; Daimion Stafford, Tennessee; Mike Adams, Indianapolis (signs with Carolina); Antoine Bethea, San Francisco (Signing with Arizona, 3 years, according to Arizona Republic's Kent Somers); Duke Ihenacho, Washington; Robert Blanton, Buffalo; Jordan Poyer, Cleveland (signs with Buffalo); Kemal Ishmael, Atlanta (re-signs with Atlanta); Nate Allen, Oakland (Signs with Miami); Jamarca Sanford, New Orleans; Roman Harper, New Orleans; Michael Griffin, Carolina; Kendrick Lewis, Baltimore; Chris Conte, Tampa Bay; Dashon Goldson, Atlanta; Phillip Thomas, Buffalo; Chris Prosinski, Chicago (re-signs with Chicago); Don Jones, Houston (signs with San Francisco); Rafael Bush, Detroit; Brynden Trawick, Oakland (signs with Tennessee, 2 years); Michael Thomas, Miami; Jeron Johnson, Seattle; Kelcie McCray, Seattle; Shamarko Thomas, Pittsburgh; Anthony Levine, Baltimore (Re-signs with Baltimore); Duke Williams, Indianapolis.\n\nA heavy-hitting safety that can get into the backfield is always a welcome sight and T.J. McDonald fills that role. ... Tony Jefferson finished 2016 with 92 combined tackles, ranking fifth among defensive backs. He also added two sacks. ... Why is Johnathan Cyprien a top target? He only led all defensive backs with 127 total tackles.\n\nColts outlook: Mike Adams would be 36 next season but has expressed his desire to return to Indianapolis. The Colts could use him, if not for his talents (12 interceptions over the past three season) his leadership. Their two starters behind him – Clayton Geathers and T.J. Green – remain exceptionally young. The Colts could make a splash with Arizona’s Tony Jefferson or L.A.’s T.J. McDonald. But in all likelihood, Geathers and Green are the future for Indy.\n\nKickers\n\nSteven Hauschka, Seattle: Signing with Buffalo, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Greg Zuerlein, Los Angeles Rams: Re-signs with Los Angeles Rams, 3 years. Phil Dawson, San Francisco: Signing with Arizona, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Nick Novak, Houston: Re-signing with Houston, 1 year, according to ESPN's Sarah Barshop. Robbie Gould, New York Giants Chandler Catanzaro, Arizona: Signs with N.Y. Jets. Connor Barth, Chicago: Re-signs with Chicago. Nick Folk, New York Jets: Signs with Tampa Bay. Dan Carpenter, Buffalo Zach Hocker, Cincinnati\n\nSteven Hauschka leads a decent crop of kickers available to teams in need. His 89 percent accuracy on 37 attempts was good for seventh in the league. He nailed his only kick of more than 50 yards. ... Robbie Gould proved there is still life in his leg, hitting all 10 of his field goals this season. However, his longest kick came from 47 yards out. ... Nick Novak punched home 85 percent of his 41 field goals, including three from over 50 yards.\n\nColts outlook: Adam Vinatieri has missed just seven kicks over the last three seasons. Any questions?\n\nPunters\n\nJeff Locke, Minnesota: Signs with Indianapolis, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport Shane Lechler, Houston: Re-signing with Houston, according to ESPN's Sarah Barshop.\n\nAn interesting leg to keep an eye on is Jeff Locke. He finished tied for fifth in the NFL for punts inside the 20 and had just three touchbacks.\n\nColts outlook: Suddenly the Colts’ have a hole to fill here, and a big one at that. Pat McAfee’s replacement either comes through the draft or in the later stages of free agency.\n\nChris Sims is a digital producer at IndyStar.

Now, the rugby league star is set to return to Australia to resume his already successful career.\n\nThe New York Jets released Holmes, who played running back and wide receiver, from their practice squad Friday.\n\nThe 24-year-old Holmes joined New York in April as part of the NFL's International Player Pathway Program.\n\nHe participated in offseason workouts, training camp and the preseason with New York. As part of the NFL’s program, all four AFC East teams received an extra spot on their practice squads this season for players to continue working on their football skills.\n\nHolmes was a standout winger and fullback for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks of the National Rugby League. He headed to the United States for a chance to pursue his dream of playing American football in the NFL. Holmes had one year left on his contract with the Sharks, but instead had the team release him and passed up about $720,000.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\n“I just felt like I wanted to test myself as a person and an athlete,” Holmes told The Associated Press in August. “I wasn’t really thinking about what I was giving up, I guess. It was just that I wanted to chase more.”\n\nHolmes is a massive star in Australia, racking up 369 points in five seasons with the Sharks. He represented Australia in the 2017 Rugby League World Cup, where he set a record with 12 tries — the equivalent of touchdowns — in the tournament.\n\nHolmes first worked out for NFL scouts in Los Angeles in 2016, and spent three months early this year learning American football at IMG Academy in Florida before joining the Jets in the spring.\n\nHe played in all four preseason games and had 11 carries for 9 yards, eight catches for 85 yards and a 21-yard kickoff return.\n\nNOTES: LB C.J.

Kay Ivey is calling lawmakers into special session this month to vote on a prison construction plan that would use part of the state’s coronavirus relief funds to jump-start the building of three new lockups. In a letter to lawmakers announcing the special session, Ivey painted the construction project as a partial solution to the state’s long-standing prison woes, which have included a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit over violence and a separate federal court order to improve mental health treatment behind bars. “Failure to timely resolve these issues outlined in federal lawsuits could result in detrimental consequences for our state,” Ivey wrote to lawmakers. “Achieving an Alabama solution to these problems – rather than a federal court-ordered solution – is paramount.” While proponents said the construction would be a partial solution, one lawmaker said it would put “old problems in new buildings” unless the state made additional reforms. “Just building prisons without engaging in some sort of comprehensive criminal justice reform is the definition of kicking the can down the road,” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa. On the use of federal pandemic funds on the project, England said there are “obviously better uses of the money.” Ivey said the special session would begin Sept. 27.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Dozens of Afghan refugees will be resettled in the state over the next six months, according to a resettlement organization. Between 50 and 100 refugees will come to Alaska starting in September, Catholic Social Services Refugee Assistance and Immigration Services said in a statement. Resettlement will continue through March. Catholic Social Services Alaska CEO Lisa Aquino told the Associated Press it wasn’t known when the first refugees would arrive in Alaska, but the organization will be ready for them. The refugees were described as being in vulnerable populations, such as children, women and the elderly. Many worked for the U.S. government or the military in Afghanistan in positions like translators. Thousands of Afghanis were evacuated after American forces left Afghanistan last month. They were first sent to military bases in the Lower 48 for screening and preparing to be sent to destinations around the U.S. The refugees, including individuals and families, will work with program staff in several areas like employment and English-language skills after arriving in Anchorage. Aquino said it wasn’t known how many would settle in other parts of the state, but it’s expected a majority would remain in Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: As the state’s biggest hospitals fill up with COVID-19 patients – most unvaccinated – physicians in some smaller, more rural communities say their patients who need specialty care are paying the ultimate price. The inability to find a bed has left smaller facilities such as Santa Cruz Valley Regional Hospital in Green Valley frustrated. A Tucson gastroenterologist drove to Green Valley last week to operate on a patient who couldn’t be transferred anywhere in the state to get the surgery. The hospital has filed a complaint with the Arizona Department of Health Services about the inability to transfer, the Arizona Daily Star reports. The patient lived “only because this doctor was nice enough, was human enough to save his life,” said Stephen Harris, the hospital’s CEO. In Cochise County, Dr. Cristian Laguillo, a senior physician with Copper Queen Community Hospital in Bisbee, said he has never felt this helpless trying to assist patients – even while serving a tour in Afghanistan as a combat medic. A surge line was created in April 2020 by the state Department of Health Services to facilitate transfers of COVID-19 patients across the state. But it’s meant to be used to track down beds for COVID-19 patients. Laguillo said he thinks the state surge line has to change to be for all patients in critical need, not just virus patients.\n\nArkansas\n\nLonoke: A former sheriff’s deputy charged with manslaughter for fatally shooting a white teenager whose death has drawn the attention of civil rights activists was released Monday on $15,000 bond. Michael Davis, a former sergeant with the Lonoke County sheriff’s office, is set to appear again in court Nov. 15, Little Rock television station KTHV reports. Davis was charged Friday with felony manslaughter in the death of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain. Davis, who is also white, shot Brittain during a June 23 traffic stop. Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley fired Davis in July, saying the former deputy did not turn on his body camera until after the shooting. Investigators have said Brittain was holding a container at the time of the shooting, and they did not find any firearms in or around the teen’s truck. Davis’ attorney has said the former deputy plans to plead not guilty. Brittain was eulogized by the Rev. Al Sharpton and two attorneys who represented George Floyd’s family. They said the teen’s death highlighted the need for interracial support for changes in policing. Brittain’s family and friends have regularly demonstrated outside the Lonoke County sheriff’s office, demanding more details on the shooting.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom has approved two measures to slice through local zoning ordinances as the most populous state struggles with soaring home prices, an affordable housing shortage and stubborn homelessness. He signed the most prominent legislation despite nearly 250 cities objecting that it will, by design, undermine local planning and control. The outcome marks the latest battle between what’s come to be thought of as “NIMBY vs. YIMBY.” While most agree there is an affordable housing shortage, proposed construction often runs into “not in my backyard” opposition. “The housing affordability crisis is undermining the California Dream for families across the state, and threatens our long-term growth and prosperity,” Newsom said in announcing his approval Thursday. He also announced the state will put $1.75 billion into what his administration is calling a new California Housing Accelerator, which he said will speed building 6,500 affordable multifamily units that had been stalled for lack of tax-exempt bonds and low-income housing tax credits. It’s part of $22 billion that the state plans to spend to spur new housing and ease homelessness along with the new laws. The bill by Senate leader Toni Atkins would require cities to approve up to four housing units on what was a single-family lot.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state panel has recommended that a mountain peak west of Denver be renamed in honor of a Native American woman who acted as a translator for tribes and white settlers in the 19th century. Thursday’s recommendation comes amid national efforts to address a history of colonialism and oppression against Native Americans and other people of color after last summer’s protests calling for racial justice reform. It is the first of several name changes being considered by the state panel. The Colorado Geographic Naming Advisory Board recommended changing the name of Squaw Mountain, located in Clear Creek County about 30 miles miles west of Denver, to Mestaa’ehehe Mountain, which is pronounced “mess-taw-hay.” The name honors an influential Cheyenne translator known as Owl Woman who facilitated relations between white settlers and Native American tribes in the early 1800s, The Colorado Sun reports. The word “squaw,” derived from the Algonquin language, may once have simply meant “woman.” But over generations, the word morphed into a misogynist and racist term to disparage Indigenous women, according to experts.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: One restaurant is taking an unorthodox approach to addressing staff shortages: robot servers to serve meals. The operator of the New London location of the Shaking Crab told The Day the ocean-themed restaurant will use regular waiters and waitresses to explain the menu and take orders, but the robots will deliver the meals to the tables. Gulshan Soni told the newspaper the robots can be summoned with a bell. The innovation is partly for showmanship and to draw in customers with something unique, he said, and partly to address staffing shortages being experienced across the industry. The four robots cost between $6,000 and $22,000, Soni said. The restaurant is scheduled to open to the public in early October. The Shaking Crab has more than two dozen locations in the northeastern U.S. and China, according to its website.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: In uplifting news for environmentalists, Delawareans can no longer release balloons into the sky, thanks to a law Gov. John Carney signed Friday. The bill that lawmakers passed in June makes it illegal to intentionally release balloons in the First State. Releasing up to four balloons is considered littering and can mean a fine of $25 or more. Releasing five or more balloons brings a fine of $250 and up to eight hours of community service for the first offense. Maryland and Virginia passed similar laws earlier this year. While Carney has dedicated much of his tenure to a litter-reduction campaign, the bill isn’t just intended to prevent residents from suffering the sight of latex balloon remnants scattered across the state. The new law is also meant to protect wildlife, according to environmentalists. “Balloons have long polluted shorelines of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, adding to the plastic pollution that threatens both marine life and the roughly 225,000 jobs in the three states that depend on a clean coast,” Oceana field campaigns manager Caroline Wood said in a statement. Delawareans can still throw water balloons as long as they pick up the trash after they pop. People planning celebrations or mourning events can visit preventballoonlitter.org to find other ideas in lieu of balloon releases.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After showing signs of coughing, sneezing and a lack of appetite, nine big cats at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Zoo tested positive for the coronavirus. The Smithsonian said Friday that six African lions, a Sumatran tiger and two Amur tigers exhibited symptoms and tested presumptive positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. The final results are expected in the coming days, the Smithsonian said on its website. “All lions and tigers are being treated with anti-inflammatories and anti-nausea medication to address discomfort and decreased appetite,” the zoo said on its website. “In addition, all are being treated with antibiotics for presumptive secondary bacterial pneumonia. They remain under close observation.” Due to the social distance between visitors and animals, the public is at no risk for the coronavirus. The zoo confirmed no other animals were exhibiting symptoms as of Friday. Zookeepers conducted an investigation of all staff and animals, and the source of the outbreak wasn’t found, according to the website. The first round of the COVID-19 vaccine made for zoo animals by Zoetis has been authorized for use by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The National Zoo has said it will disburse the first round of vaccines among “susceptible species” in the coming months.\n\nFlorida\n\nOcala: A woman floating on a paddleboard in the Silver River used her paddle to push away a large alligator that swam directly toward her in a frightful, up-close encounter captured in startling videos and photographs. The alligator came within inches of Vicki Baker, 60, of Ocala. She estimated the reptile to be nearly as long as her 10-foot paddleboard. It hissed loudly at her. She said at one point it opened its mouth, revealing large teeth and its powerful jaw as it floated on the surface. “What are you doing? Get away from me! Get away from me!” she yelled at the alligator as it swam inches from her paddleboard. “No! Oh, my God, I had to push him away with my paddle!” Nearby, off camera in the video, an employee at Silver Springs State Park can be heard on a speaker advising her: “Ma’am, I’m going to suggest backing up considering you just made him pretty mad.” Baker said she remains puzzled over the encounter. She said she presumed someone else on the water had been feeding the alligator, desensitizing it to humans and helping it associate paddlers on the river with food. “I was afraid,” she said. “I’ve seen them my whole life and have never been afraid.” The encounter happened near Silver Springs, where deep springs feed the Silver River, and the water is so stunningly clear that tourists board glass-bottom boats.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: The Cobb County district attorney’s office is offering warm, furry support to crime victims and staff. District Attorney Flynn Broady announced Friday that Rose, a 3-year-old black Labrador retriever, is joining the office. The victim witness unit has been working to bring Rose on board, according to a news release from the office. “The level of stress and anxiety that victims of domestic violence experience is drastically reduced with the introduction of assistance animals,” unit director Kimberly McCoy said. “It’s been a long process, but we are excited.” The Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office partnered with the Pups with a Purpose program to donate the dog. Pups with a Purpose matches people held in the Forsyth County jail with volunteer citizen dog trainers and Forsyth County Animal Shelter dogs. Rose received specialized training from Rucker Dog Training to prepare her to help crime victims in court, the release said. “Child victims will have the opportunity to have Rose there to calm them down and assure them that they are in a safe place so they can tell their story and not feel afraid of what happens if they tell it,” Broady said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Board of Education has approved changing Central Middle School’s name to honor the Hawaiian princess who once owned the downtown Honolulu property. At a meeting Thursday, the board approved naming the campus Princess Ruth Ke’elikolani Middle School. School and community leaders have been trying since 2019 to rename the school. The princess’ home, Keoua Hale, once stood on the grounds of the current campus, and when she died in 1883, her property was bequeathed to Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, according to documents supporting the name change. After Pauahi’s death in 1885, the board of education purchased the property for what became Honolulu High School in 1895, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. It later became Central Grammar School before it was changed briefly to Ke’elikolani School. It became Central Junior High School in 1928, then Central Intermediate School in 1932 and Central Middle School in 1997, the newspaper reports. “In the 1930s, because people couldn’t pronounce the name, they changed it back to Central,” said the school’s principal, Joseph Passantino, Hawaii News Now reports. “So the significance is huge, especially for the staff who’s dedicated over two years to give her that duty and honor.”\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: The principal at a southwestern Idaho public charter school has died due to COVID-19, the school’s board said. The school board at Heritage Community Charter School in Caldwell announced the death of Javier Castaneda in a letter to parents. The school’s website links to a GoFundMe page created Friday that said Castaneda died unexpectedly Wednesday as a result of becoming ill with COVID-19. He is survived by his wife and seven children. The school board said in the letter first reported by KTVB-TV that the school will provide counseling resources and other support for children. The school has some restrictions in place due to COVID-19. It made face masks optional. The school said on its website that it focuses on a classical liberal arts education and uses a dual Spanish-language immersion program to provide a strong foreign language emphasis.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: All 18 of the state’s job centers offering services for people searching for work are accepting in-person appointments after shifting to remote operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Illinois Department of Employment Security announced. In-person appointments began Monday at five offices in Burbank, Chicago, Joliet and North Aurora. Other centers began accepting appointments in August and in early September. Officials encouraged people to use the agency’s website to apply for unemployment benefits, search for work and use other services. Appointments, have to be made at least 24 hours in advance by calling the agency’s hotline, at (217) 558-0401, and last 20 minutes. Anyone entering an office must wear a mask and should reschedule their appointment if they feel sick or have been exposed to COVID-19. Help will still be available over the phone as the job centers reopen for in-person services.\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: Organizers of a planned museum about basketball great Larry Bird are starting to assemble thousands of items ahead of its expected opening next year. The museum will be part of the new Terre Haute Convention Center, which remains under construction with an anticipated completion date of March 2022. It will include items donated by Bird and others from his career with the Boston Celtics, Indiana State University and the U.S. Olympic team. The site for work on cataloging the memorabilia is being modified for security and should be ready within weeks, the Tribune-Star reports. “As other items are collected, they can be housed in one location,” memorabilia consultant Shelly Keen said. “It’s just going to make things move a little more swiftly than what it was before.” Bird grew up in the southern Indiana town of French Lick. He created excitement during his days at Indiana State in Terre Haute when he led the school to the NCAA title game in 1979, although the Sycamores lost to Magic Johnson’s Michigan State team. When the Celtics won the 1984 NBA Championship, Bird dedicated the win to Terre Haute. He was the Indiana Pacers coach and a top team executive after his playing career.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: The city’s first Black police chief is facing intense opposition from some current and former officers as he works with local leaders to reform the department, including the removal of its longtime insignia that resembles a Ku Klux Klan dragon. Joel Fitzgerald said his 16-month tenure in Waterloo, a city of 67,000 with a history of racial divisions, is a “case study” for what Black police chiefs face as they seek to build community trust and hold officers to higher standards. In an interview with the Associated Press, he said the attacks were driven by misinformation and racism toward him and his boss, the city’s first Black mayor. “I don’t think there’s been any police chief in America in a small- or medium-sized department that have endured this for the reasons I have endured it, and I think the reasons have to do with race,” said Fitzgerald, who previously served as the chief of larger departments in Fort Worth, Texas, and Allentown, Pennsylvania. “This is my fourth job being the first Black police chief. I’ve dealt with pushback in other places but never so overt. Never so nonfactual.” The backlash has intensified since last fall, when the City Council began pushing to remove the department’s emblem – a winged creature known as a griffin that had adorned patches on officers’ uniforms since the 1960s. After a messy process, the council voted 5-2 last week to order the department to remove the symbol from its uniforms by the end of September.\n\nKansas\n\nLansing: A nurse who texted a co-worker a picture of a dementia patient slumped over in a wheelchair and then suggested she was responsible and deserved thanks has pleaded guilty to intentionally administering the wrong medication. The Kansas City Star reports 37-year-old Jennifer Lynn Reavis, of Atchison, is free on bond as she awaits sentencing on charges of endangerment, unlawful administration of a controlled substance and battery. She pleaded guilty to the charges Friday in Leavenworth County District Court. In May 2019, administrators with Twin Oaks Rehab Center in Lansing contacted police after discovering a patient had been getting evening medications along with the anti-anxiety drug Ativan and Benadryl when she was not supposed to receive them. “Your (sic) welcome! I hope she is asleep most of the day tomorrow,” prosecutors said Reaves wrote to an oncoming night nurse in a text that included the photograph of the victim apparently sleeping in a wheelchair. “Hint hint.” The medication caused the patient to become lethargic and be hospitalized, prosecutors say. Reavis admitted to police giving the medicine to the woman, saying she tried to wander away from the nursing home.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: On the first Saturday after a new “safety zone” law went into effect at the state’s only abortion clinic, some protesters ignored the 10-foot-wide restricted area at the entrance as they followed patients to the door, shouting and berating them. No police were present to enforce the zone meant to ensure safe access to EMW Women’s Surgical Center, where patients often must pass through shouting, jostling anti-abortion protesters waving graphic signs of fetuses. “Repent, murderer!” self-proclaimed sidewalk preacher Jesse Morrell shouted as he and others stepped inside the restricted area to follow a young woman to the door of the clinic. The city’s police department put out a statement Sunday saying it had more urgent priorities than trying to enforce the new city ordinance, which requires officers to witness a violation before they can issue a citation. Morrell, a regular protester outside EMW, said he doesn’t feel constrained by the restricted area. “The thing about these buffer zones is that if you don’t test them, they just get bigger,” he said. “Eventually the whole street will be a buffer zone if we don’t stand up for our rights.” The protests Saturday grew increasingly chaotic as more protesters arrived, swarming vehicles that pulled up to the curb to drop off patients, shouting and admonishing them as they exited.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A Louisiana-based research organization and a professor at the University of Southern Mississippi are joining forces in a research project aimed at restoring and protecting the Chandeleur Islands in the northern Gulf of Mexico. In a news release announcing the effort, USM noted that the islands provide habitat for gulf fish and wildlife and offer storm protection for coastal Louisiana. Led by Dr. Kelly Darnell, an assistant research professor at USM, the project is one of 20 awarded a combined $2.3 million to find ways of best managing natural resources in the Gulf, including marine mammals, shorebirds, barrier islands, seagrass and fisheries. The projects, slated to begin this month, are funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration RESTORE Science Program. The Water Institute of the Gulf, based in Baton Rouge, will be among those working with Darnell. Others include the University of Florida, Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Gulf of Mexico Alliance. Darnell’s project, which relates to seagrass ecosystems along the Chandeleur Islands, was given $127,065. The project will provide usable data for restoration and long-term management of the islands.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: Acadia National Park is on track for a record year, as park officials see no signs of visitation slowing down this fall. The park’s busiest year on record was 2018, when there were 3.54 million visits. This year, the number could top 4 million, Kevin Schneider, park superintendent, told the Acadia Advisory Commission. Things have taken off since 2020, which was an off year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2.67 million visits Acadia recorded in 2020 amounted to the lowest annual count the park has had since 2014, the Bangor Daily News reports. But visitation picked up significantly last fall. Since October 2020, “every single month has been a record month” for visitation, according to Adam Gibson, a social scientist for Acadia. The past 11 months have had on average 22% more visitors than the same period from the year before, he said. The park had roughly 800,000 visits last month, and Acadia has welcomed an estimated 2.75 million visitors so far in 2021. The volume of people in the park has resulted in more rescues, said Therese Picard, the park’s chief ranger. The park typically handles two dozen rescues through August of each year, she said, but there have been 50 rescues so far this year. Most of the rescues involve leg injuries of some sort.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: BP has inked a 15-year agreement with Annapolis-based CleanBay Renewables to turn poultry litter into natural gas. The partnership involves mixing poultry litter with water in a closed system known as an anaerobic digester. One of the end products is biogas, which includes methane. The biogas can be processed into renewable natural gas and used to fuel vehicles. “We have a portfolio of projects and a corporate strategy to develop 30 (facilities) across the U.S.,” said Thomas Spangler, CleanBay Renewables’ executive chairman. Among the first locations slated to receive such a facility is Westover, in Somerset County, with a groundbreaking scheduled for early in the first quarter of 2022. That is expected to be fully operational by mid-2024. Usually, such facilities employ 26 full-time employees over three shifts a day running 24 hours a day, all year. Completing a two-year construction period could also create an additional 250 jobs. According to Spangler, the initial process behind green-lighting projects started with reaching out to Somerset Economic Development Commission and county planning and zoning officials. At the state level, the company approached the Maryland Department of Commerce, state workforce agencies, and area community colleges and universities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: A museum dedicated to the English colony of Plymouth and local Indigenous tribes is opening a new exhibit to mark the 400th anniversary of Thanksgiving. The Plimoth Patuxet Museums said the exhibit, entitled “We Gather Together: Thanksgiving, Gratitude, and the Making of an American Holiday,” will open Saturday. The exhibit will explore the relationship between Native Americans and English colonists to “better understand the events that led to the first Thanksgiving,” said the museum, which features a replica colonial village and reenactors in Plymouth. It will feature rarely seen artifacts from the museum’s collection, as well as art from across the centuries tracing how the New England tradition grew and emerged as a national holiday in the 19th century, the museum said. “Patuxet/Plymouth is the place where ancient traditions of gratitude in both Indigenous and European cultures merged,” the museum said in a statement. “ ‘We Gather Together’ will explore the ancient and deeply human expression of gratitude that is the bedrock of this national holiday.” The Pokanoket tribe and their sachem Massasoit shared in three days of feasting and entertainment with English colonists in the autumn of 1621, helping to inspire the holiday of gathering and giving thanks, according to the museum.\n\nMichigan\n\nYpsilanti: A “Black Lives Matter” street mural painted this summer in southeastern Michigan has been defaced by vandals who covered part of it with white paint. The weekend attack in Ypsilanti left the 260-foot mural’s words “Black Lives” drenched in white paint, while the word “Matter” was untouched. Trische Duckworth, executive director of the community organization Survivors Speak, was joined Sunday by city officials and others who expressed outrage over the vandalism in the city about 35 miles southwest of Detroit. “It was an ugly display of hatred,” Duckworth said. She said that no matter who defaced the mural, the act shows that racism and white supremacy “are not a thing of the past. It’s alive and active.” City manager Frances McMullan said law enforcement is investigating the vandalism. She said in a statement that the city was “sickened by this horrible act of destruction” but that the mural would be restored. The vandals left behind the painted name of a group identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist hate group. The Ypsilanti City Council approved the mural at the entrance of a city park in February. Volunteers painted the mural and a second one in June using donated paint. Duckworth said the council is expected to discuss the defaced mural this week.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Agriculture officials in the state say they are seeing an increase in inquiries about mental health. “We are seeing a lot of despair right now, a lot of fear, a lot of anxiety,” said Meg Moynihan, who works for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture with a focus on the human side of farming. Moynihan recently put an ad on Facebook with a link to mental health help. The response caught her attention: nearly 2,500 clicks in 18 days, Minnesota Public Radio reports. “So they’re not just looking at, ‘Oh, there’s the phone number in the ad I could call,’ but they’re clicking through for more information,” Moynihan said. “And I’m hoping that’s some people who want that kind of help and support for themselves. But I’m also hoping it’s for people who might be concerned about somebody they know.” Commissioner of Agriculture Thom Petersen recently surveyed conditions in northwestern Minnesota, where the drought is taking its biggest toll on the state. “I thought I was in Arizona,” he said. “I just looked at this bare church with no grass and the graves, you know, looked like a ghost town. And I kept going, and the pastures were the worst I’ve ever seen in my life.” Peterson said he also met an 80-year-old farmer who’d just sold off all his sheep who said the situation was the worst he’s seen in his lifetime.\n\nMississippi\n\nClarksdale: The Mississippi Writers Trail has unveiled a marker for Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and short story writer Richard Ford. The marker for Ford, a Jackson native, was placed recently at the Clarksdale Carnegie Public Library. Ford won acclaim with his first two novels, “A Piece of My Heart” and “The Ultimate Good Luck.” “Our library here in little Clarksdale, Mississippi, is just so pleased to pay tribute and to honor one of the most well-known greatest writers of all times, a native Mississippian, a novelist, a short story writer, and a Pulitzer Prize Winner,” Mary Caradine, interim director of the Carnegie Public Library of Clarksdale and Coahoma County, said in a press release. “Mr. Ford’s achievements are known far and wide.” Ford’s novel “The Sportsman” was named one of TIME Magazine’s Top 100 novels published since the magazine’s inception. Ford wrote “The Sportswriter” while living in rural Coahoma County, and he used the book’s protagonist in future novels, including “Independence Day,” for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction in 1996. “Richard Ford is a true international author and cultural essayist who brings a rich view of the Southern experience to his readers,” Visit Mississippi Director Craig Ray said.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A federal investigation is underway after arson damaged a historic church that now serves a congregation predominantly made up of people from South Sudan. John Ham of the Kansas City office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told the Kansas City Star that authorities have determined the blaze was intentionally set, making it a federal crime. The fire was discovered about 9:15 a.m. Saturday at the building known as Harlem Baptist Church on the city’s north side. Arriving firefighters discovered the front of the building and an area of stairs going to the basement were fully engulfed in flames and determined that’s where the fire started. One firefighter had to be rescued after the stairway collapsed but was not injured. The church suffered heavy fire damage to the front and smoke and water damage elsewhere. The church, founded in 1907 as the Harlem Tabernacle Church, is the last remaining original building of a non-incorporated community known as Harlem. It now serves as a gathering place for the United Christian Fellowship. Pastor Gabriel Riak said the congregation has Black and white members, including Sudanese and Americans. He said he was grateful no one was in the building, KMBC reports. Members plan to restore the church, which sustained about $90,000 in damage, he said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Health officials are begging residents to wear masks indoors and get vaccinated against COVID-19 as hospitals face increasing strain in the absence of any statewide health mandates. Officials in Bozeman and Missoula lamented their inability to implement public health restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus after the Legislature passed several laws earlier this year curtailing the power of local health officers to implement rules such as mask requirements and limits on gathering sizes. “Now is the time when we would have mandates in place,” said D’Shane Barnett, Missoula County health officer. “Unfortunately, we have anti-health state legislators who went out of their way to make that not possible.” Lori Christensen, public health officer for Gallatin County, said the legislative changes have “complicated the scene” in terms of immediate action she can take. She said she trying to navigate “the complexity of the law,” but a mask mandate is not on the horizon. In Missoula, officials have requested 24 National Guard soldiers to assist the county in addressing its COVID-19 surge at health care facilities and in The Sleepy Inn, a facility used to quarantine unhoused people who are diagnosed with the virus or identified as close contacts. Bozeman Health has also put in a request for National Guard assistance.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state is one of the few in the nation that haven’t legalized cannabis use in some form, but the industry has already launched a lobbying group to help influence the rules that will regulate the industry. John Cartier, president of the Nebraska Cannabis Association, said the organization expects some form of marijuana legalization to be approved in the state in coming years, so it makes sense to be prepared, according to the Lincoln Journal Star. “It is not unreasonable to predict that some form of legalization will happen before this decade is done, and with several ballot initiatives planned for 2022, it could come as early as January 2023,” he said. Two ballot initiatives working in tandem to legalize medical marijuana were filed with the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office, and a petition to legalize all uses of marijuana remains on file. Both are seeking to put the question of legalization before voters next year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A death row inmate convicted in the 1980 robbery-killing of a man for $2 is no longer eligible for capital punishment and must be resentenced, the Nevada Supreme Court said. The justices ruled Thursday that a New York court’s recent erasure of Samuel Howard’s lone conviction for a violent crime took the death penalty off the table for his Nevada murder conviction, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Howard, 73, has been on death row for nearly 40 years after being sentenced in the fatal 1980 shooting of Las Vegas dentist George Monahan during a robbery. According to the Nevada high court, the vacating of Howard’s New York conviction eliminated the one remaining aggravating circumstance making him eligible for a possible death sentence. Under a new penalty hearing for Howard, a jury would decide between on whether his sentence of life in prison would come with or without the possibility of parole. The last person executed by Nevada was Daryl Mack, in 2006 for the 1988 murder of Betty Jane May, of Reno.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLebanon: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is starting a dermatology clinic to meet the unique skin care needs of people with Down syndrome. The clinic is opening Tuesday in Manchester. There are many associated skin conditions with Down syndrome, including dry skin, excessive dandruff, rashes around the mouth, acne in the groin and armpits, patchy hair loss, vitiligo, and toenail and foot fungus, Dartmouth-Hitchcock said in a news release. Down syndrome is also linked with other medical conditions such as congenital heart disease, celiac disease, chronic ear infections and thyroid disease. The clinic will consider how treatment plans will affect other medical conditions common with Down syndrome. “Since before the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been my dream to have a dermatology clinic specifically for people with Down syndrome – to really take our time to educate and empower. We are excited to get started,” dermatologist Jillian Rork said in a news release.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: An officer safely caught a 1-month-old baby dropped off a second-floor balcony over the weekend, police said. The Hudson County prosecutor’s office said Officer Eduardo Matute was among those called to the Jersey City residence Saturday morning after reports that a man was threatening the baby. He and several officers were positioned below the second-floor balcony as the child was dangled over the balcony railing. Officials said the man dropped the infant after a lengthy standoff, and Matute caught the child. City spokesperson Kimberly Wallace-Scalcione said the child was taken to the hospital as a precaution. Mayor Steve Fulop later posted a photo on social media of the officer holding the child, who was wrapped in a white blanket. “Thankfully the baby wasn’t harmed physically,” Fulop said. Wallace-Scalcione said the man who dropped the baby was immediately arrested, and charges are pending. “Kudos to the (Jersey City Police Department) and all the officers involved for their heroics and for bringing a safe conclusion to this dangerous situation,” Prosecutor Esther Suarez said in a Twitter post.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Amid debate over the state’s system of releasing felony defendants, University of New Mexico research indicates that just under 5% of Albuquerque-area defendants awaiting trial commit violent crimes while free from jail. Findings from the university’s Institute for Social Research’s analysis of more than 10,000 felony cases in Bernalillo County also included that less than 1% of people on pretrial release were arrested for a first-degree felony while on pretrial release, the Albuquerque Journal reports. A senior state courts official said the research indicates that the vast majority of defendants don’t commit new crimes pending trial, but the top prosecutor for Bernalillo County and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said its still troubling that some defendants commit crimes while free. Administrative Office of the Courts Director Artie Pepin said the research “validates the pretrial justice improvements underway in New Mexico.” District Attorney Raul Torrez said through spokeswoman Laura Rodriguez that the few violent crimes committed by people on pretrial release are “an unacceptable price for our community to pay.” Lujan Grisham spokesman Tripp Stelnicki said it “can still be utterly devastating to a family or a community” when 5% of felony defendants commit a violent crime.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is taking steps to address a mounting shortage of school bus drivers. Gov. Kathy Hochul on Sunday announced several short-term and long-term initiatives, including opening up new testing sites for commercial driver’s license applicants, expediting the testing and permitting process, and conducting outreach to law enforcement, firefighters, military and other organizations that already have trained drivers. A study by the New York Association for Pupil Transportation two years ago found that 8 in 10 school transportation directors considered driver shortages a major concern, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem. A lack of drivers can lead to delayed departures and arrivals and the cancellation of field trips and other extracurricular activities. “Our schools and public health officials have moved mountains to ensure our children receive an in-person education this year, and we are leaving no stone unturned to make sure schools have adequate bus service to bring students to school and back,” Hochul said in a statement. The state is reaching out to more than half a million existing commercial driver’s license holders in the state, including those who are currently unemployed, Hochul said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMonroe: Union County’s school board voted Monday to modify the district’s quarantine protocols to comply with state law and let the county health department lead contact tracing efforts. The move comes after the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services threatened to sue the district for overhauling contact tracing procedures and allowing most of its 7,000 quarantined students back into the classroom so long as they are not symptomatic or known to be infected with the coronavirus. “UCPS will recognize quarantines in accordance with state law of students and staff who are considered close contacts with a COVID-19-positive case,” said Kathy Heintel, a member of the board. Because it is one of a handful of districts not compelling students or staff to wear masks and does not have an online learning option, some Union County parents say the quarantines have amounted to 14 days of near-total learning loss. Roughly one-sixth of the district’s 39,000 enrolled pupils were stuck at home the week before the district substantially changed its COVID-19 protocols. Fewer than 1,700 kids were quarantined last week after the changes, a 77% weekly drop.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Regulators say the state has officially lost its status as the nation’s second-biggest oil producer. North Dakota produced just over 1 million barrels of oil per day in July, the most recent month for which data is available from the state Oil and Gas Division. The July production marks a 56,000-barrel-per-day or 5% drop from June, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Texas continues to lead the nation in oil production. The Permian Basin spans parts of New Mexico and Texas, and it’s arguably the biggest competition for North Dakota’s Bakken oil patch. The southern oil-producing region is closer to major refineries and export terminals, and it attracts significant drilling and investment within the oil and gas industry. North Dakota ranked second, behind Texas, in oil production for nine years. It lost that status to New Mexico in July. The two states had been neck and neck for several months. New Mexico had 82 rigs drilling Friday, far more than the 27 operating in North Dakota. Aside from bragging rights, a state’s position holds other implications. Rankings can affect an oil company’s ability to find investors to fund a project in a state, North Dakota regulators have said. North Dakota had surpassed Alaska to take second place in oil production in 2012.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The State Medical Board of Ohio has renewed the medical license of a doctor who drew nationwide attention and derision for claiming COVID-19 vaccines were magnetizing recipients and had a connection to 5G wireless towers. Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, a state-licensed doctor of osteopathic medicine, first received her license in 1984, and it had been set to expire Oct. 1, on its regular two-year basis. Tenpenny spoke to the Ohio House Health Committee in June about her false vaccine claims. She is among the 12 most prolific disseminators of COVID-19 misinformation on social media, according to research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate. An anti-vaccine activist since the 2000s, Tenpenny has called vaccines a “method of mass destruction” and “depopulation”; charges $623 for her “boot camp” to train people how to convince others to refrain from vaccination; and sells her book “Saying No to Vaccines” for $578 on Amazon. State law allows the medical board, with the votes of at least six of its 12 members, to refuse renewal of any physician for “making a false, fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading statement” in relation to the practice of medicine.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state on Monday scheduled its first executions since it put lethal injections on hold six years ago following a series of mishaps. Included on the list of seven executions is Julius Jones, whose case has drawn national attention. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals scheduled Jones to die Nov. 18 by lethal injection for the 1999 slaying of Edmond businessman Paul Howell, who was shot in front of his family during a carjacking. The court set the date despite a Sept. 13 recommendation by the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board that Jones’ death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment without parole. The recommendation has received no decision by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who must make the final decision. Jones’ case was featured in 2018 on the ABC television documentary series “The Last Defense.” That drew the attention of reality television star Kim Kardashian West and numerous professional athletes with ties to Oklahoma, who appealed for clemency. Jones, 41, has consistently maintained that he is innocent of the killing. Oklahoma once had one of the busiest death chambers in the nation, but executions were put on hold following a botched lethal injection in 2014 that left an inmate writhing on the gurney and drug mix-ups in 2015.\n\nOregon\n\nDallas: The Oregon Medical Board has revoked the license of a doctor west of Salem for refusing to follow COVID-19 guidelines in his office, spreading misinformation about masks and overprescribing opioids. According to medical board documents, the board also fined Steven Arthur LaTulippe $10,000 on Sept. 2, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. LaTulippe sued the medical board in January after his license was suspended for placing patients in danger by disregarding COVID-19 mandates and asking patients to remove their masks. LaTulippe’s family practice, South View Medical Arts in Dallas, did not properly screen patients and relied on the receptionist’s ability to visually gauge whether visitors were sick, according to the medical board documents. At least 95% of patients did not use masks at the clinic between March and December 2020, LaTulippe told medical board officials. LaTulippe made bogus claims to patients that masks were ineffective against COVID-19 and could cause carbon dioxide poisoning, according to the medical board. LaTulippe also made anti-mask comments during a pro-Trump rally in Salem on Nov. 7, 2020. The Multnomah County Republican Party posted footage of his comments to YouTube, which removed the video for violating its community guidelines.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Supporters of a plan to open supervised injection sites to try to reduce overdose deaths urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday to review a court decision that bans the practice. The test case centers on a nonprofit group’s Safehouse project in Philadelphia, though officials in other states are watching closely as they debate similar programs. Nationally, more than 93,000 people died last year from drug overdoses, a sharp spike from just a year earlier. A divided U.S. appeals court had rejected the Safehouse plan in January, although Philadelphia’s Democratic mayor and top prosecutor endorse it. The city itself lost 1,200 people to overdoses last year. The nonprofit group’s plan to open a site was thwarted when former U.S. Attorney William McSwain, a Trump appointee now running for governor, argued that it violated a 1980s-era drug law aimed at “crackhouses.” The district judge rejected McSwain’s argument, but the appeals court agreed with him in a 2-1 decision that nonetheless called the goal of harm reduction “admirable.” Safehouse last month asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review that decision. The amicus brief filed Friday said Congress never intended the crackhouse statute to encompass harm reduction efforts offered by medical personnel.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is offering $4 million in grants to help communities build and expand recreation facilities. Democratic Gov. Dan McKee and the Department of Environmental Management announced Friday that the outdoor recreation matching grants would be available to local municipalities and Native American tribes seeking to acquire, develop or renovate outdoor recreational facilities in their communities. Grant applications are due by Dec. 17. The money is provided through a clean water and green bond approved by voters. McKee said the state’s network of bikeways, open spaces and other recreational assets help attract people and businesses to Rhode Island. “Access to green space and clean, functional recreation facilities improves health, promotes stronger social ties, and enhances neighborhood satisfaction and pride,” McKee said in a statement. Applicants can apply for smaller recreation development grants or larger acquisition grants, capped at $400,000.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLexington: A school board will consider asking the Legislature to drop what amounts to a ban on school mask mandates to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The State newspaper reports the Lexington County School District 1 board surveyed parents recently and found more than two-thirds supported a mask mandate. A similar percentage of district employees also backed a mandate. At its Tuesday board meeting, Lexington 1 board will consider asking lawmakers to repeal a part of the state budget that effectively bans school mask mandates by denying districts the funds to enforce them. “For months, we have heard from a small and vocal group of parents and staff on both sides of the mask debate,” school board chair Anne Marie Green said in an email to parents. “We wanted to know how our entire community truly felt about masking.” Green told The State she isn’t sure if the board would adopt a mask mandate immediately “because our numbers are going in the right direction.” However, she said the local school board is better positioned to respond to sudden changes than the Legislature, which won’t hold a regular session until early next year. The S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control reported 2,357 new confirmed COVID-19 cases and 17 coronavirus-related deaths Monday, according to the paper.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Musicals scheduled in the state’s two largest cities have been postponed or scrapped due to the pandemic. A show that was set to run this past weekend at the Orpheum Theater in Sioux Falls was postponed to Sept.29-30 after two cast members tested positive for the coronavirus. The production of “Lost in Vegas,” held by local theater company Lights Up, held its opening run last weekend in front of about 200 people each day. After one cast member had tested positive for the virus this past week, the show went on Thursday after officials blocked the first two rows and warned the 150 people in the audience about the results, director Brent Grosvenor said. “We did the right thing. We talked to the cast. The cast made an informed decision still to perform,” Grosvenor said. “We had understudies replacing sick actors, and that’s how the real world works.” After another cast member tested positive for the virus Friday, theater officials called off the rest of the weekend shows. In Rapid City, the Black Hills Community Theatre announced Friday that it had canceled all planned performances of “Matilda” following the increased spread of COVID-19 infections in the region. Theater officials told the Rapid City Journal many younger participants in the show are not yet eligible for vaccinations.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: State officials say donors have added 144 acres to a state park known for being the first east of the Mississippi River to be open to African Americans. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation said the expansion of T.O. Fuller State Park is the result of a donation by philanthropists Hugh and Margaret Jones Fraser and the Carrington Jones family of Memphis. Nonprofits groups The Land Trust for Tennessee and Wolf River Conservancy helped with the acquisition. The park, opened in 1938, was also only the second state park nationwide that was open to African Americans. In 1942 the park was named after Thomas O. Fuller, a prominent African American educator, pastor, politician, civic leader and author. The park includes 8 miles of trails, four shelters, 35 picnic tables, basketball courts, an interpretive center, and diverse landscapes with more than 200 plant species.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A doctor who said he performed an abortion in defiance of a new state law has all but dared supporters of the near-total ban on the procedure to try making an early example of him by filing a lawsuit – the only way the restrictions can be enforced. The state’s largest anti-abortion group said Monday that it’s looking into the matter after Dr. Alan Braid in a weekend Washington Post opinion column became the first Texas abortion provider to publicly reveal he violated the law that took effect Sept. 1. The law prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, which is usually around six weeks and before many women even know they are pregnant. Prosecutors cannot take criminal action against Braid, because the law explicitly forbids that. The only way the ban can be enforced is through lawsuits brought by private citizens, who are entitled to claim at least $10,000 in damages if successful. Legal experts say Braid’s admission is likely to set up another test of whether the law can stand after the Supreme Court allowed it to take effect. Braid wrote that on Sept. 6 he provided an abortion to a woman who was still in her first trimester but beyond the state’s new limit. “I fully understood that there could be legal consequences – but I wanted to make sure that Texas didn’t get away with its bid to prevent this blatantly unconstitutional law from being tested,” he wrote.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s newest license plate option features an outline of Utah and five hands of different colors holding it into place. The words “many stories, one Utah” are printed underneath, the Deseret News reports. Gov. Spencer Cox said he hopes someone will see it and think about what it represents. “I hope and believe because of the incredible artwork that it will inspire conversations,” Cox said. The new license plate unveiled at the state Capitol on Thursday honors the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr. While there are no direct links to his image or likeness – as a result of legal reasons from the King estate – the design itself is inspired by him and his work as a civil rights activist before he was assassinated in 1968. Utah’s work toward an MLK-themed license plate dates back to 2012, according to Simba Maponga, chairman of the state’s Martin Luther King Jr. Human Rights Commission. A 2020 bill led by Rep. Sandra Hollins, D-Salt Lake City, and Sen. Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, then paved the way for a license plate to recognize King’s work and life, with money from the plates going toward scholarships for “underrepresented or underserved” students. The winning design was submitted by Eleanor Smith, a former Timpview High School and current BYU student.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: The city’s hospital is seeking approval to build a $7.5 million expansion of its emergency department. The Northwestern Medical Center has been considering an upgrade to its emergency department, which was built around 1989, since before the start of the coronavirus pandemic, said Jonathan Billings, the hospital’s vice president of community relations. COVID-19 has clearly exacerbated the need, Billing’s told the St. Albans Messenger earlier this month. The emergency room currently has curtained treatment bays to separate patients. “If you have someone with active COVID-19, you can’t put them in a curtained treatment bay,” he said. The expansion would eliminate such use by updating those areas to increase patient privacy and safety and to better limit the spread of infectious airborne diseases, such as the coronavirus, through additional air quality-controlled rooms, Billings told the newspaper. The expansion would add six emergency department treatment stations, bringing the total to 20. About 2,400 square feet would be added, and 6,800 square feet of existing space would be renovated.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A Republican candidate for the House of Delegates has apologized after tweeting a derogatory comment about the appearance of House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn that some Democrats said was an antisemitic attack. The Washington Post reports that Hahns Copeland, who is running to represent the Norfolk-based 89th District, on Friday tweeted a response to a tweet by House Democrats that featured a video of Filler-Corn, who is Jewish, talking about a child care subsidy program. “I was surprised to see a pair of eyes and a mouth with that NOSE,” Copeland tweeted. He apologized in another tweet late Friday, calling the earlier tweet “immature and impulsive.” “It was never intended to be anti-Semitic or reference her ethnicity or religion,” Copeland’s tweet said. He conceded his earlier tweet was “inappropriate and insensitive.” Democrats said it was an antisemitic attack on Filler-Corn. The speaker’s staff said Friday that she had not heard directly from Copeland. “These types of hateful comments are unfortunately far too common today, and they are too often invoked instead of solutions to the real issues Virginians face,” Filler-Corn said in a statement. “I hope this candidate and his supporters choose to do what is right and acknowledge that words from those in office or seeking it have an impact.”\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: This has been a record-breaking year of drought in much of Eastern Washington, state officials say. In April, a huge volume of snow in the Cascade Range measured in at 132% of normal statewide, raising hopes of an abundant water year, the state Department of Ecology said in a blog post last week. But now 16 Washington counties, including 13 in Eastern Washington, are drier than they’ve ever been since record-keeping began in 1895, the blog said. According to the National Weather Service, from March to August the state saw just 6.90 inches of precipitation. Normal during that time is 13.03 inches. To end the current drought in the lower Columbia River area, Ecology Drought Coordinator Jeff Marti said the state would need 11 inches of rain by next April. The odds of that kind of rebound are low. “The question is, will we have a full recovery before next spring?” Marti said. “The odds for significant improvement of conditions are pretty good for Western Washington. But I’m less optimistic about the east side. Based on historic climatology, the odds for significantly ameliorating current conditions is about 1 in 5 across Eastern Washington. For a full recovery in Eastern Washington, the odds are about 1 in 20,” Marti said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A grassroots group is using newspaper advertisements to further push Sen. Joe Manchin to support issues it considers important to low-income West Virginians. The Poor People’s Campaign took out the full-page ads Sunday in the Charleston Gazette-Mail, The Herald-Dispatch in Huntington, The Parkersburg News and Sentinel and The Journal of Martinsburg. The group has repeatedly pressed the influential moderate Democratic senator in an effort that includes conducting a rally at the state Capitol in Charleston last month. Manchin has opposed a $15 federal minimum wage and an elections bill that he said he couldn’t support because it lacked bipartisan support. Senate Democrats unveiled a pared-back elections bill last week. The Poor People’s Campaign also had a news conference scheduled Monday to urge Manchin to help change Senate filibuster rules that have blocked passage of legislation. Scheduled participants include state organizers as well as the group’s national co-chairs. Manchin long has defended the filibuster as many of his Senate colleagues have shifted on the issue.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The retired conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court justice leading a Republican-ordered investigation into the 2020 presidential election released a video Monday threatening to subpoena election officials who don’t comply and saying the intent was not to overturn President Joe Biden’s relatively narrow victory in the battleground state. The unusual 6-minute video from Michael Gableman comes after election clerks were confused by an email his office sent last week that was flagged in at multiple counties as junk or a possible security risk and was not broadly forwarded to municipal clerks as he wanted. Gableman said Monday that if the state’s 1,900-plus municipal and county election officials did not cooperate with his investigation, he would “compel” them to comply. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos has said he would sign subpoenas requested by Gableman as part of the investigation. Vos hired Gableman at a cost of nearly $680,000 in taxpayer money to conduct the investigation. Vos declined to sign subpoenas sought by Rep. Janel Bandtjen, chair of the Assembly elections committee, seeking ballots, voting machines and other data in Milwaukee and Brown counties. Gableman said local clerks who run elections in Wisconsin will be required to prove that voting was done legally.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The city is considering offering employees a $250 incentive for getting fully vaccinated against COVID-19, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. City workers could also get $100 for dependents or spouses who get their inoculations, as well as $50 for booster shots, and the employees themselves would be eligible retroactively if they’ve already gotten their shots, according to the paper. The proposal is set to be considered at a City Council meeting Tuesday.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/21"}]}

(413 S. Bedford St., Georgetown): In November, Revelation announced it would be taking over the former 16 Mile Brewing, which closed in fall 2018. Revelation hoped to be open in Georgetown this spring, but that won't be the case. \"We have a tremendous amount of work to do but it is going to be an incredible finished project,\" says Amanda Robinson, Revelation's sales and marketing manager. The brewery now hopes to open by mid-to-late summer with a kitchen and outdoor seating area.\n\nThompson Island Brewing Co. (Route 1, near Rehoboth Beach): Earlier this month, beach-based restaurant group SoDel Concepts announced Thompson Island, a 250-seat brewpub currently being built alongside their Bluecoast restaurant in the Rehoboth Gateway shopping center. A fall opening is expected. The brewpub will have a 100-person beer garden and games such as bocce and ping pong. They brought in John Trogner of Hershey, Pennsylvania-based Tröegs Independent Brewing as a consultant to help with the build, recipes and staff training.\n\nBrick Works Brewing and Eats (36932 Silicato Drive, near Long Neck): Three years after Brick Works brewpub first opened as a joint venture between Abbott’s Grill and Mispillion River Brewing, it's time to expand the family. A second Brick Works is expected to open in March just off the John J. Williams Highway in Taormina Square, says Brick Works' Lauren Bigelow. Just like the Smyrna location, Mispillion River Brewing beer will be featured. Owners say the new brewpub will have a similar appearance to the Smyrna spot with an open kitchen.\n\nCrooked Hammock Brewery (316 Auto Park Drive, Middletown): In January of last year, La Vida Hospitality announced they would spin off their Lewes brewery and open a second location in Middletown. La Vida, which also owns Big Chill Beach Club in Bethany Beach and The Fork + Flask at Nage, among others, broke ground April 1. They hope to throw the doors opens to the 7,000-square-foot brewpub and beer garden this fall.\n\nHangman Brewing Co. (2703 Philadelphia Pike, Claymont): The Claymont brewery, Hangman, located in Town & Country Shopping Center on Philadelphia Pike, has been delayed because of a \"sudden death,\" Hangman owner Brad Wagner says. Wagner, who worked for years as an analytical scientist, sold his townhouse in Philadelphia's trendy Fishtown neighborhood in January 2017 and decided to open a brewery. The brewery will be 2,500-square-feet with space on the second floor for an additional 1,500 more. While the home brewer hoped to be open sooner, Wagner says Hangman should be brewing by the end of the year.\n\nAutumn Arch Beer Project (810 Pencader Drive, Suite C, near Glasgow): With 20-foot ceilings and a trio of garage doors that open in good weather, Autumn Arch has been slinging beers since early April. It's a family operation owned by Jimmy Vennard and his brother Daniel, with four other family members and friends. Inside the 5,400-square-foot brewery and taphouse, you'll find corn hole and just about any beer style you want. \"We boldly brew every style,\" says Vennard, an engineer with W. L. Gore and Associates who lives in West Grove, Pennsylvania. Live music is expected to start soon. Vennard says he was inspired to open Autumn Arch after visiting breweries in Asheville, North Carolina. He is busy working on an array of sour beers in their five-barrel brewhouse, which will debut this fall as an official sour beer program. The brewery has recently been experimenting with admitting dogs on Sundays. Even without a huge publicity push, Vennard says the brewery already has found plenty of customers: \"It's been beyond my expectations.\"\n\nFirst State Brewing Co. (109 Patriot Drive, Middletown): Considering Middletown's growth, it makes sense that a large brewery would move in. While the town is home to the small Volunteer Brewing Co., First State will be an 11,000-square-foot production brewery with a full kitchen serving casual foods to pair with their brews in the taproom. Justin Faulkner, the taproom and kitchen manager, says they hope to open this fall.\n\nVolunteer Taphouse & Backyard (116 W. Main St., Middletown): It's been nearly two years since Middletown's Kevin Schatz opened the tiny Volunteer in a converted two-car garage behind West Main Street's Wellbeing on Main, a wellness services center that he owns with his wife, Dawn. Now it's time to stretch out a bit. Earlier this month, Schatz unveiled plans for the Volunteer Taphouse & Backyard, which will be next door. (The neighbor moved and Schatz bought the property.) The taphouse will be in the existing historic home with a front porch, rear decks, a lawn and space for food trucks. After receiving town approval for his plan earlier this month, Schatz expects to open in late 2019 or early 2020.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Delaware's King of Beers is a behemoth compared to this small-batch brewpub located on the ocean block of Baltimore Avenue where the old Cellar Door restaurant once resided.\n\nCo-owner Milan Mljadan, a Canadian native, began as a winemaker, traveling around the world working in spots such as Argentina, Slovenia and Italy before landing at Harvest Ridge Winery in Marydel in 2012.\n\n\"A trick of the trade is that we always made a little batch of beer on the side,\" Mljadan says. \"During harvest, you did not want to drink wine. You're covered head to toe in grape juice. It's the last thing on your mind.\"\n\nThe brewery, which opened earlier this month, currently serves two house-made beers from their one-barrel system, along with an array of craft beers, including from local breweries such as Dogfish, Revelation, Twin Lakes and more.\n\nThey include Chupa, a gluten-free pale ale (5.8% ABV), and an amber IPA named Red Tide that clocks in at 7.2% ABV.\n\n\"We eventually want to have four available and they will all be experimental, one-off batches,\" Mljadan says. \"We're not going to have any flagship beers. They are always going to be unique and individual.\"\n\nHe hopes to not only draw his own followers, but also service the hordes of beer geeks drawn to town by Dogfish.\n\n\"They are a huge tourist draw. I think they are becoming a bigger tourist draw than the beach itself,\" he says. \"It was the only thing I knew about Delaware when I moved here. I didn't know about the beach or Rehoboth or The First State. I knew Dogfish.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the food, Beach Nomad has some of the finer dining items you would expect on Baltimore Avenue, such as herb salmon bake ($17), spicy Peruvian chicken ($16) and a peach-mango porch chop ($18).\n\nBut the real star of the show are the hamburgers to go with those beers, including a bison mushroom melt ($13) topped with provolone, sauteed mushrooms and caramelized onions.\n\nYou'll find some of his Canadian flair in the \"Montreal-style\" poutine ($8) appetizer.\n\nThe spot, with outdoor seating and live music, will always have vegan options available, as well as at least one gluten-free beer, he says.\n\nThe brewpub is located in the former dining hall of the old Epworth Methodist Church, giving it a dash of historic character.\n\n\"It has a really cool vibe. It's not your typical Rehoboth Beach storefront at all,\" he says of the space with a high ceiling and a bar made from the church's old pulpit. \"It was one of the first Methodist churches and we're using their pulpit now as a bar to serve up beers.\n\n\"Someone is turning over in their grave.\"\n\nHangman Brewing Co., 2703 Philadelphia Pike, Claymont. facebook.com/hangmanbrewingofficial. Opening early 2019.\n\nA taste of Fishtown is coming to Philadelphia Pike.\n\nAfter years of working in the pharmaceutical industry as an analytical scientist, Brad Wagner decided to sell his townhouse in Philly's trendy Fishtown neighborhood in January 2017 and open a brewery.\n\nWith costs high in the City of Brotherly Love, he decided to launch Hangman Brewing Co. in The First State instead.\n\nAnd after looking in Wilmington, he landed in Claymont's Town & Country Shopping Center after New Castle County code was amended in May allowing microbreweries to open in such spaces.\n\n\"I saw the laws were getting better for breweries and it just looked as if there was a niche in Delaware — an explosion of breweries popping up,\" says Wagner, who lives in Wilmington's Little Italy neighborhood. \"It seemed like an easy way to get started. In Philadelphia there is a lot of red tape and I'm sure the application fee is a lot steeper. Since it's all new to me, I wanted to start here.\"\n\nWagner, a home brewer, will split brewing duties with Brian Proctor, who formerly brewed at Milltown's Argilla Brewing Co. at Pietro's Pizza and is currently brewing at Philadelphia Brewing Co.\n\nThe 2,500-square-foot space is currently under construction. There's also room on the second floor to expand, adding 1,500 more square feet.\n\nWhen Hangman opens, you'll find an array of beers coming from his small system, including \"juicy\"/ \"hazy\" New England-style IPAs, as well as \"milkshake\" IPAs made with lactose.\n\nWagner, 42, says bands and food trucks will also live alongside his beers at the brewery. He's a musician himself, drumming for New Jersey-based alternative rock act Glenn Garr & The Last Chances.\n\nSo what's with the somewhat morbid name?\n\nHe says his first few ideas were already taken and when he saw Hangman was available, he jumped on it.\n\n\"I just thought Delaware needs a decent place to hang, man,\" he says.\n\nFirst State Brewing Co., 109 Patriot Drive, Middletown. firststatebrewing.com. Opening early 2019.\n\nMiddletown, get ready for your second brewery.\n\nAfter last year's opening of Kevin Schatz's tiny Volunteer Brewing Co. in a converted two-car garage, the still-growing town will soon also be home to a new 11,000-square-foot production brewery named First State Brewing Co.\n\nThere will be plenty of room for both their beer and cider, as well as a full kitchen serving casual foods to pair with their brews.\n\nExpect beer-friendly foods including Bavarian-style soft pretzels and charcuterie and cheese boards in the taproom, which will share space with the production brewery.\n\nIn terms of the beer menu, offerings will range from West Coast-style IPAs and Belgians to imperial stouts. Once they settle in, sours and ciders made with locally-sourced apples will be added.\n\nThe taproom will have communal seating as well as barroom activities both inside and out front on their patio.\n\nJustin Faulkner, the taproom and kitchen manager, is a Middletown native and knows firsthand the thirst that has been building in the town. After all, the population has jumped more than 400 percent over the past two decades with more than 21,000 now calling it home.\n\n\"I remember when it was 1,500 people and I could ride my bike and tell you who lives in every house,\" he says. \"Middletown is craving for something like this. When you go to Volunteer on the weekends, you see a line out the door. Kevin's place is packed and it's wonderful.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Long wooden tables are stacked in another area of the taproom, which will soon be set up inside and outside on the patio to replicate a German beer hall.\n\nAfter clearing a bulk of the hurdles which come with opening a business, Ben Brotman and Jamey Tielens can finally see the finish line as they prepare to launch Liquid State Brewing Company this fall in the West End District.\n\n“This place is unrecognizable compared to what it looked like when we first moved in,” Brotman said while standing in the taproom at Liquid State, which is located on 620 W. Green St. in a building previously used by Cornell Laundry. “We’ve always thought downtown has needed something more for craft beer, and we love this space and the location is fantastic.”\n\nWhile there is no official opening date, Brotman and Tielens said Liquid State could open by the end of October. Most of the brewing areas, backrooms and cooler are complete. The brewing system – ordered used from Japan – was fired up for the first time about three weeks ago and three batches of beer were in the fermenter during a visit on Oct. 4. The duo hopes to have four original beers on tap when the brewery opens.\n\nThe bulk of the work remains in the taproom and outside patio, which faces State Street.\n\n“We have a lot of space to grow, which is something we thought of when we were looking for a building,” Tielens said. “We have a few more permits to take care of, but we are close. We’re just tying up loose ends, waiting for beer to ferment, and then we’ll put it in kegs.”\n\nBrotman and Tielens both moved to the Ithaca area from the Pacific Northwest about 10 years ago and met while working at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Upon discovering their shared love of beer and brewing, they originally floated the idea of starting a brewery about six years ago. Brotman, who is from Philadelphia, is a former biologist and has worked at several local breweries in the area. Tielens, who is from Wisconsin, has a small hop farm in Trumansburg.\n\n“We both have science backgrounds, and a lot of science is involved in the actual brewing,” said Brotman, who has a small laboratory and workshop in the back. “There’s a lot of infrastructure we need when brewing on this scale.”\n\nThe duo became serious about starting a business two years ago and began renting the space on West Green Street last year. Brotman and Tielens have already reached out to local restaurants and plan to highlight local food trucks. The taproom and beer hall will host local events like live music, radio broadcasts, fundraisers, art galleries and more.\n\nLiquid State plans to serve up New England IPAs, barrel-aged sours and traditional German beers. In addition to their own beer, the pair plans to have local cider and wine on tap as well.\n\nBrotman and Tielens recently completed a successful Kickstarter campaign to help ease the cost of a newly installed sprinkler system throughout the brewery. Installing the system allows for more people and the ability to hold bigger community events. The campaign, which ended on Oct. 8, eclipsed its goal of $30,000 by $292.\n\nLiquid State also has strong ties with other local breweries because of Brotman and Tielens’ backgrounds.\n\n“It’s a pretty close community, and a bunch have already been here and seen what we’re working on,” Brotman said. “More breweries brings more people in and more tourism. That’s never a bad thing.”\n\nFollow @SteinTime44 on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2024/03/12/dewey-beer-co-wins-national-contest-best-brewpub-delaware-top-rated-beers/72929065007/", "title": "Delaware brewery with the state's top-rated beers earns a new honor", "text": "Less than a year after Middletown's First State Brewing Co. won a USA TODAY poll and was named the best new brewery in the country, a different Delaware brewery just won another best-in-the-nation honor by the same newspaper.\n\nDewey Beach's Dewey Beer Co. was named the best brewpub in nation on March 8, winning the USA TODAY 10Best Readers’ Choice Awards, which relied on reader voting and an expert panel to determine the top 10 brewpubs across the country.\n\nIt shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.\n\nThe brews from Dewey Beer, founded in 2015 by owners Mike Reilly, Brandon Smith and Scot Kaufman, are the top-rated of all Delaware-made beers on the popular beer-rating Untappd app.\n\n\"Just being nominated was incredible.

In this story, reporter Geoff Wilson looks at the state of dining in the Hudson Valley.\n\nThe Hudson Valley food scene is a crucial part of the region's identity, particularly in Dutchess County.\n\nAnd it's more than a brand. Dining is a driving force for tourism in the region, generating both jobs and money.\n\nRestaurants capitalize on local farms to provide a taste unique to the Hudson Valley. And craft beverage producers, from breweries to wineries to distilleries and more, offer a unique product as distinct as the region’s food.\n\nThis shows no signs of stopping in 2019, and the planned introduction of the county's first sake brewery looks to expand the craft beverage scene.\n\nOn the beat\n\nDevelopments and events tied to the Hudson Valley food scene are expected to continue into 2019, but whether the region will see growth or stagnation regarding restaurant openings is unclear.\n\nAsahi Shuzo's plans for a sake brewery in Hyde Park may not come to fruition in 2019, but the development still looks to broaden the craft beverage scene.\n\nThe project at 5 St. Andrews Road, the former location of a Stop & Shop, will be capable of brewing 332,640 gallons of sake a year.\n\nThe result of a partnership between the makers of Dassai Sake and The Culinary Institute of America, the brewery and tasting room will be an experimental facility benefiting the culinary school’s students and Asahi Shuzo's brewers.\n\nFoodie attractions such as Hudson Valley Restaurant Week at the Hudson Valley Wine & Food Fest are set to continue in the new year. The spring Restaurant Week is up first, staring in March with two weeks of fixed-price dishes.\n\nWith no major chain restaurant openings on the horizon, the question remains if Dutchess will see as many new options pop up as years prior.\n\nIn late 2018, Golden Corral reopened in the Town of Poughkeepsie after the first attempt at the chain quickly shuttered two years ago.\n\nLast year also marked the closure of Carl’s Jr., formerly Hardee’s, Tilted Kilt, Uno Pizzeria & Grill, Quiznos and Papa John’s Pizza.\n\nBut 2018 also saw the opening of many local restaurants highlighting the region’s strengths, including Melzingah Tap House, Lolita’s, Tiki Temple and Farmers & Chefs.\n\nAnd more openings are on the way. Mix n Mac plans to open in Wappinger early this year, Industrial Arts Brewing Company plans to open its Beacon taproom this spring and Grand Cru Beer & Cheese Market is in the process of reopening in the Town of Rhinebeck.\n\nWhy you should care\n\nThe restaurant industry serves as one of Dutchess County's many attractions, drawing in tourists with a robust selection of farm-to-table restaurants and craft beverages. With The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, the region benefits from graduates deciding to open businesses in the area.\n\nKey players\n\nKamel and Lena Jamal, co-owners River Valley Restaurant Group, are pillars of Beacon's dining scene. Their restaurants, Tito Santana Taqueria, Beacon Bread Company, Ziatun and Vegetalien offer quality dishes representing a diverse selection of cuisines.\n\nKazuhiro Sakurai and Hiroshi Sakurai, president and chairman, respectively, of Asahi Shuzo sake brewery, will shake up the mid-Hudson Valley's craft beverage scene with the introduction of a sake brewery in Hyde Park. While the opening will likely take place in 2020, a local sake brewery will add a whole new category to the options in the region.\n\nCortlandt Toczylowski, brewmaster at King's Court Brewing Company, demonstrates a mastery of beer styles, offering an array of options from the City of Poughkeepsie brewery.\n\nTim Ryan, president of The Culinary Institute of America, continues to lead at the institution responsible for many of the region's notable chefs. The school will provide new offerings to students in 2019 through its Mediterranean Cuisines and Japanese Cuisine & Culture concentrations.\n\nWhat to Watch For\n\nBags and bottles: Gov. Andrew Cuomo plans to include a bottle bill expansion and a plastic bag ban in the 2019 Executive Budget. \"To combat litter, help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the environment for future generations, the governor is advancing legislation to expand New York's Bottle Bill to make most non-alcoholic drink containers eligible for 5 cent redemption,\" according to the governor's office. Cuomo also said he will advance legislation to ban all single-use plastic bags.\n\nCompany moving: Food manufacturer Crepini will begin to move from its space in the Brooklyn Meat Market to the iPark 84 facility in East Fishkill this May, according to the company. The Brooklyn-based crepe and wrap maker will bringing about 108 jobs with it.\n\nNew development: A $10 million City of Poughkeepsie development calls for a fresh food market, a food hall, a craft brewery, apartments and more. The Hive, a partnership between MASS Design Group and R. L. Baxter Building Corporation, hopes to make the city's downtown a walkable, one-stop destination. The Hive will span 33 and 35 Academy St., and construction is expected to begin in 2019 with a 2020 opening.\n\nNew brew: The City of Beacon is getting a third craft brewery, but general manager Sofia Barbaresco said Industrial Arts Brewing Company's new taproom will complement existing options when it opens in the spring. The 150,000-square-foot facility will open at 511 Fishkill Ave. with an initial focus on establishing the taproom and outdoor seating. The second phase, scheduled for completion in 2020, will include a brewery capable of producing more than 50,000 barrels per year, a distribution center, an event center and smaller party spaces.\n\nKey dates\n\nMarch 11-24: The start date for Hudson Valley Restaurant Week, the biannual event highlighting Hudson Valley eateries through prix-fixe menus. The spring celebration will run two weeks and highlight restaurants from Westchester up to Albany.\n\nApril 27-28: TAP New York is one of the largest craft beer festivals in the region, featuring more than 100 breweries at Hunter Mountain.\n\nJune 18-20: Menus of Change: The Business of Healthy, Sustainable, Delicious Food Choices is an initiative from The Culinary Institute of America and Harvard T.H.

On Thursday, New Castle County Police became the largest department in Delaware to utilize the technology.\n\nThe county launched a pilot program it expects to expand through the whole department.\n\nUltimately, Attorney General Matt Denn said, \"Our goal is for every police officer in the state to wear one.\"\n\nDelaware NAACP President Richard Smith has been a loud proponent for the use of the technology.\n\n\"The NAACP started pushing for cameras about a year ago,\" he said, praising New Castle County Executive Thomas P. Gordon and county leaders for moving Delaware forward on the issue of responsible policing.\n\n\"I hope the state and city [of Wilmington] will follow suit,\" he said.\n\nThe Wilmington Police Department supports body camera use, said spokeswoman Sgt. Andrea Janvier said. The department has a number of body cameras in storage that are expected to be assigned to officers once policies are in place for their use, Janvier said.\n\nCounty officials – supported by an array of state and law enforcement officials – announced the project Thursday, the day after body-camera video led to a first-degree murder charge against a Cincinnati police officer.\n\nThe since-fired officer, who shot an unarmed driver in the head as he started to drive away from a routine traffic stop, initially said he got tangled in the driver's car and feared he was going to get run over.\n\nUnprecedented scrutiny of police behavior across the country – fueled by the fatal police shooting of an unarmed man in Ferguson, Missouri, and death of another while in Baltimore police custody – provided an unspoken backdrop for the county police announcement.\n\nIn Delaware, a Nov. 30 trial is set for Cpl. Thomas Webster, a Dover police officer who pleaded not guilty to a second-degree assault charge from a 2013 arrest. A grand jury indicted him after viewing video from a police dashboard camera that showed him kick an unarmed man in the head, knocking the suspect unconscious.\n\nGordon said the introduction of body cameras is not reactive, but because \"we believe in transparency.\"\n\nCounty Police Chief Col. Elmer M. Setting said, \"We welcome these cameras with open arms. ... This is one clear way to show these officers are out there doing the best they can.\"\n\nThis \"has been a year in the works,\" Setting said, \"and we have a long way to go.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, eight officers have worn the cameras. Those officers, assigned to the patrol and special operations units, were chosen because they have the most interaction with the public, said Officer First Class Tom Jackson.\n\nTwo additional cameras are being repaired.\n\nThe county's first 10 cameras were acquired with a state Justice Assistance Grant of about $10,000.\n\n\"We hope to have every officer equipped with a body-worn camera in the near future,\" Setting said.\n\nSetting and Delaware Police Chiefs Council President William Bryson, also chief of Camden's municipal police force, were among several leaders who said camera costs are minor compared with data storage, review and other issues.\n\nThe 42-member chiefs' council is developing a policy for body cameras, Bryson said.\n\n\"We're not rushing into getting cameras because we want to do it right,\" he said.\n\nNew Castle County's body-camera use, Bryson said, \"will be a pilot for the rest of the state.\"\n\nWilmington Police Chief Bobby Cummings is working with the council on the policy development, Janvier said, adding the city also is in the process of developing internal policies and procedures, as well as resolving matters of funding for maintenance and continued data storage.\n\nDelaware State Police is working with the chiefs' council, other law enforcement agencies and state justice officials \"to develop a statewide BWC program that will satisfy the needs of the law enforcement community and the Department of Justice as well as the community we serve,\" said state police spokesman Sgt.

Bratz in a statement.\n\n\"This is another new piece of technology and we will ascertain how to best evaluate the most beneficial way to utilize it and determine how will it fit into our mission,\" he said.\n\nThe Middletown Police Department already uses body cameras and expects to adopt the policy developed by the council in cooperation with the state Department of Justice, Chief Dan Yeager said.\n\nAll 31 officers in the department, including Yeager, have been using body cameras for the last couple of years, he said.\n\nRecordings have been helpful in prosecutions with no problems arising, he said, but on issues such as data storage, \"we're still fine-tuning.\"\n\nBryson said there are \"mixed feelings\" among officers about body cameras, \"but there were about dash cams, too.\"\n\nCamera costs vary by model, about $900 each for the county ones, said Capt. Pat Crowell. But equipping the county's approximately 300 non-administrative officers would cost $500,000 to $1 million, with ongoing costs of about $250,000 a year, not counting data storage, camera replacements and technology updates.\n\nRelated staff and storage costs remain unknown, Crowell said, but at least one officer would need to be assigned to manage recordings. \"That's one less officer on the street,\" he added.\n\nDenn also said each case's prosecutor will have to review all case footage not only for prosecution, but also for legally required disclosure of evidence to defense teams and redacting confidential material when recordings are released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nAdditional staff would be needed, he said, but there are no estimates yet of what statewide implementation would cost. Methods of secure storage of recorded data could be a major expense, he added.\n\nState Prosecutor Kathleen M. Jennings, who is involved in developing policy for camera use, said she supports body cameras with thoughtful introduction, careful study and a pilot program such as the one introduced by county police.\n\nBody cameras, she said, \"increase transparency and trust between the public and law enforcement.\"\n\nAlso supporting the pilot's debut were New Castle County Public Safety Director Joseph Bryant Jr. and Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5 President Michael Zielinski.\n\nZielinski says the FOP recognizes the importance of the \"groundbreaking piece of technology.\"\n\n\"We better get in front of this, he said, \"because of the magnitude of some of the things going on nationally.\"\n\nNAACP leader Smith acknowledged many issues still must be resolved about body-camera use. He said storage and control should be placed under an independent authority \"so you don't have the police policing the police.\"\n\nNoting national-level incidents including the officer's arrest Wednesday in Cincinnati make this \"the right time to come out with cameras,\" he said.\n\nContact robin brown at (302) 324-2856 or rbrown@delawareonline.com.

Her death shocked the city in 2014 and brought tens of thousands of people into the streets for a candlelight vigil.\n\nHeroin is a rising scourge in many Missouri communities, but the homeless in Springfield might have a new neighborhood in which to live.\n\nA decades-long feud between Springfield and Greene County over space at the jail might find resolution.\n\nA healthy economy could spur new growth in Springfield, while Greene County voters could decide whether to approve a tax increase to help fund county government.\n\nAnd on the state level, poachers might face some huge fines for killing Missouri wildlife illegally.\n\nThe News-Leader took a brief look at several of the events, issues and stories that will likely affect many in Springfield, Greene County and across Missouri in the coming year.\n\njump here\n\nGreene County voters will likely be asked to pass a sales tax hike\n\nThere are two things Greene County officials know about taxes.\n\nFirst, additional revenue is needed by the county that suffers from a severely overburdened criminal justice system and faces expensive environmental mandates from the federal government.\n\nSecond, Greene County voters regard taxes with suspicion and pass tax raises with reluctance, if at all.\n\nIn August, the Greene County Commission delayed a vote to put a ½-cent sales tax on the April ballot, citing public feedback.\n\nA ½-cent sales tax would bring in an estimated $25.5 million a year.\n\nCounty leaders have indicated they will revisit the idea of asking voters to pass a tax hike in the coming months, likely after the lawsuit with the city of Springfield over the Greene County Jail is resolved.\n\nGreene County has weathered grueling financial times in the past, and further budget challenges loom on the horizon. The commission is currently creating the 2017 budget — which cuts most department budgets back to 2015 spending levels.\n\nGreene County is heavily dependent on sales taxes for its general revenue fund. The last general revenue sales tax was passed in the county in 1984.\n\n— Alissa Zhu\n\nWill Pensmore Castle be torn down?\n\nPensmore Castle near Highlandville was designed to withstand the strongest tornadoes and even bomb blasts, but it was knowingly constructed with diluted materials, according to a lawsuit filed in 2015.\n\nPensmore Castle was meant to last forever, but the owner of the enormous structure wants it torn down and a new castle erected, his attorney told the News-Leader in May.\n\nIn July 2017, the case is slated to go before a jury in federal court, though most lawsuits are settled before they reach trial. If the case gets settled, the public may never know whether the castle was shorted of a unique steel reinforcement called Helix, as the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe lawsuit says there was supposed to be more than 200,000 pounds of Helix mixed into the castle's concrete, but more than 70,000 pounds never made it into the mixture. Instead, court documents said some of the Helix was used in different construction projects, including a house and a swimming pool.\n\nConstruction on the castle was halted in 2014 when a whistle-blower came forward, and a lawsuit proceeded when tests confirmed his claims, according to court documents.\n\nAn attorney for the construction companies disputed the allegations in the lawsuit.\n\nCastle owner Steven T. Huff is seeking $63 million from two companies that helped build the 72,000-square-foot castle, court documents show.\n\nAccording to his attorney, Huff has compared Pensmore Castle to the Roman Coliseum.\n\n— Giacomo Bologna\n\n2017 might be the year Missouri gets tougher on poachers\n\nThe new year brings a renewed effort to make Missouri a less appealing place for poachers.\n\nThere are three bills already filed in the Missouri House that would force poachers to pay restitution — in addition to any other civil or criminal penalties — for the illegal killing of turkey, deer, elk or black bear.\n\nThe toughest so far is HB 282, filed by Springfield Republican Sonya Anderson. Her bill would force poachers to pay $1,500 in restitution for each turkey illegally killed, $3,000 for each deer taken illegally and $7,000 for each elk or black bear killed illegally.\n\nMissouri currently has no poaching restitution law in place.\n\nA similar bill with much lower penalties failed to gain traction in the 2016 General Assembly session, but Reps. Donna Lichtenegger of Cape Girardeau and Jared Taylor of Nixa hope their bills — HB 46 and HB 250 — will see more support in 2017. Their bills call for a restitution payment of $750 for poaching a turkey; $1,500 for poaching a deer, and $3,500 for poaching an elk or black bear.\n\nIn all the poaching restitution bills, money from those payments would go into the state school fund.\n\n\"I am optimistic something will get done this session,\" Taylor said. \"I think it's crazy that for some people it's worth the risk of poaching in Missouri when the cost of getting an out-of-state hunting tag is less than the fine they might get for poaching an animal.\"\n\nA gruesome poaching case that happened in Shannon County a year ago might help garner support for the bills. Last December, someone shot and killed an elk near the Current River and used a chain saw to cut the antlers away from the animal's skull. The poacher left the rest of the elk to rot.\n\nThat incident is still unsolved and is a key element in a new fictional murder-mystery novel written by retired educator Eric \"Rick\" Mansfield that takes on the wide-ranging issues of poaching in Missouri.\n\nMansfield lives in Shannon County and took photos of the elk after it was killed and as game officials hauled away the carcass.\n\n\"I started the book last year and I thought it would be solved by now,\" Mansfield said. \"This whole poaching culture in Missouri inspired me to write it, and it's worse now than when I was a kid.\"\n\nThe self-published book is available on Amazon for $7.99, and Mansfield said all the proceeds will go toward the nonprofit Ozark Heritage Project, an organization that tries to preserve the best of Ozark culture and environment. Proceeds also will be used to help fund historical presentations, river cleanups and structural and environmental restorations.\n\n— Wes Johnson\n\nHigh-profile murder trials set for 2017\n\nA pair of high-profile murder trials are expected to be held in Greene County courtrooms this coming year.\n\nCraig Wood, 48, is scheduled to stand trial Oct. 23 — more than three years after he allegedly kidnapped, raped and killed Springfield 10-year-old Hailey Owens.\n\nHailey, a Westport Elementary fourth-grader, was abducted near her home on Feb. 18, 2014.\n\nPolice say her body was found hours later in the basement of Wood’s home on East Stanford Street.\n\nWood took the stand during a pre-trial court appearance in March and said he was high on meth during the time frame in which he is accused of committing the crimes.\n\nA jury will be brought in from Platte County to hear the case.\n\nNicholas Godejohn, 27, will also likely stand trial in 2017. He is accused of killing Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard in June 2015 in a home just north of the Springfield city limits.\n\nGodejohn’s co-defendant and online girlfriend, Gypsy Blanchard, pleaded guilty in July and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nGypsy Blanchard’s attorney said Dee Dee Blanchard forced her daughter into a wheelchair and held her prisoner for years before the slaying.\n\nGodejohn’s trial had been scheduled for Feb. 6, but it was recently pushed back. He has asked for a bench trial.\n\n— Harrison Keegan\n\nGalloway, once a village, is likely to keep booming\n\nA southeast Springfield neighborhood declared blighted and eligible for tax abatement by City Council in 2014 saw a surge of new development in 2016, with more possible next year.\n\nGalloway, little more than a railroad station and a quarry when it formed in the 19th century, was annexed to Springfield in the 1960s. In recent decades, it became popular due to public services including a renovated park, an Ozark Greenway trail and a recycling center.\n\nThat was just the beginning. In late 2015, a $10 million complex of luxury apartments called Township 28 opened. In May, Acacia, a 10,000-square-foot spa, set up shop down the street.\n\nBut a $17.5 million plan, Quarry Town, is the big fish. In August, City Council approved zoning changes that would allow this 10.8-acre development to proceed.\n\nSpearheaded by developer Matt O’Reilly, Quarry Town could eventually include 13,000 square feet of apartments, 13,000 square feet of office space, 15,000 square feet of retail and 22 single-family and duplex units — and a Tesla charger.\n\nThe News-Leader reached out to a representative for O'Reilly's company, Green Circle Projects, to learn when Quarry Town construction might begin, but has not yet received a response.\n\nBilly Jalili, a partner in Springfield's Touch, Flame and Black Sheep restaurants, also envisions putting a mixed-use development on two acres in Galloway, but no plan has been made public.\n\n— Greg Holman\n\nVoters likely to see $189 million school bond in April\n\nVoters in the Springfield school district are expected to be asked, as early as April 4, if they are willing to pay more in property taxes to renovate, expand or rebuild more than half of the district's buildings.\n\nThey will decide if the district can sell $189 million in bonds.\n\nThe ballot issue is about more than just financing the work, however. School board members have cast it as a referendum on the amount of public support for the district's new facility master plan.\n\n\"It's really about does the community support Springfield Public Schools and are they willing to support all of Springfield,\" said board member Tim Rosenbury. \"Are they willing to invest in the entire community and not just their own attendance area?\"\n\nThe board is expected to decide Jan. 10 whether the bond issue will be placed on the April ballot. Passage will require support from 57 percent of voters.\n\nIf approved, Springfield's record-setting bond issue — the first to break the $100 million mark — would provide nearly all the funding to complete the first of two six-year phases required to carry out the sweeping changes outlined in the facility master plan.\n\nThat plan calls for 40 projects over a 12-year period and carries a hefty price tag of $367.6 million. Here are the biggest changes:\n\n• Close four elementary schools: Bowerman, Campbell, Delaware and York.\n\n• Expand early childhood education programs to serve additional 600 students.\n\n• Replace seven elementary and four middle schools. This includes the creation of four elementary and middle school combination campuses.\n\n• Renovate, upgrade or expand 17 elementary, two middle, one K-8, five high school and four support buildings.\n\nBoard president Denise Fredrick said the proposed projects will improve equity across the district and ensure all school buildings meet \"optimal learning standards.\"\n\n\"Adopting the facility master plan is setting the course for the district, not just for the next generation but for the next several generations,\" she said.\n\nThe district estimates the total cost of the first phase to be $197 million and plans to invest $8 million, or $1.3 million a year, from its capital projects fund, along with the bond issue, to complete the work.\n\nCarol Embree, chief financial and operations officer, said the $189 million bond issue would require a 24-cent increase to the debt service levy, which generates revenue for capital projects.\n\nThe district is pursuing a staggered approach, adding 12 cents in 2017 and another 12 cents in 2018. Once fully implemented, the increase is expected to add $46 to the annual property tax bill on a house with a market value of $100,000.\n\nThe 24-cent increase would bring the district's debt service levy to 79 cents per $100 of assessed valuation.\n\nDick Bartow, executive vice president of George K. Baum & Company, which advises the district on its debt, said the levy increase is expected to give the district enough room in its bonding capacity to ask voters for another bond issue, almost as large as this one, in five or six years.\n\nHe said it would be a \"no tax increase\" bond issue, meaning it would extend the amount of time required to pay off debt but would not increase annual property tax bills.\n\n— Claudette Riley\n\nAuthorities grapple with heroin’s resurgence\n\nHeroin made its return to the Springfield drug market a few years ago, and it showed no signs of going away in 2017.\n\nIn 2015, Springfield police seized more heroin than in the previous three years combined. And through the first nine months of 2016, they had already seized 4,000 grams — more than 10 times last year’s total.\n\nLt. Eric Reece with the Springfield Police Department said the increase in heroin seizures is a concern heading into the new year. He said heroin cases are a priority for his detectives in the special investigations section because the drug has reportedly been responsible for at least 21 overdose deaths in Greene County over the last two years.\n\nMarlin Martin is the regional director for Behavioral Health Group, a local provider of opioid addiction treatment. Martin said there are about 460 patients consistently receiving treatment from Behavioral Health Group in Springfield, and the company is preparing to open a second location on the north side of town.\n\nIn a February bust, authorities allegedly seized six pounds of heroin hidden in a truck at a Springfield home.\n\nWhile heroin use has increased in Springfield, meth is still much more common. Springfield police had seized 22,232 grams of meth through the first nine months of 2016.\n\n— Harrison Keegan\n\nTiny homes project for homeless taking shape in north Springfield\n\nTiny homes for the homeless is an idea that is often tossed around but only implemented in a few cities across the nation like Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles and Portland.\n\nSpringfield will soon be added to that list.\n\nThe Gathering Tree, a nonprofit organization that operates as an evening drop-in center for homeless people, purchased a 4.5-acre tract of land in north Springfield to create a tiny-home community for disabled, chronically homeless people.\n\nEden Village, as it will be called, is located at 2801 E. Division St., the site of a former mobile home park near U.S. 65.\n\nGathering Tree co-founder Linda Brown said the first home has been purchased thanks to a $30,000 donation from Coldwell Banker Vanguard Realtors and will be delivered in February 2017. That first home will serve as a model, Brown said, to allow people to come see what the homes and the community will be like.\n\nAfter more homes are purchased and set up, Brown said she expects people will be able to start moving to Eden Village in the fall of 2017.\n\nBrown, who is also a real estate agent, said in an earlier interview that she had been looking for property for the tiny home community for some time.\n\nShe recently found the trailer park, which was already complete with concrete pads and utility and sewer hook-ups for the manufactured homes.\n\nThe city has confirmed to Brown that the property will not have to be rezoned.\n\nThe homes, which will be manufactured in Athens, Texas, are about 400 square feet with one bedroom, one bathroom and a kitchen.\n\nEden Village will also have a community building with laundry facilities and a large kitchen with space for entertaining up to 30 guests. Brown hopes to have the community building constructed in early 2017.\n\nEden Village will specifically house individuals who qualify as “chronically disabled homeless” by standards of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Residents, many of whom are on disability, will pay their own rent.\n\nResidents will have access to case management and services. It will be a gated community, with residents free to come and go as they please.\n\nThe total cost of the project, with the planned 30 homes and community center, will be about $1.8 million.\n\n— Jackie Rehwald\n\nCity leadership will change\n\nThe upcoming Springfield City Council election is unusual for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, after the election, up to seven of nine seats could be filled by someone different.\n\nUsually, only five council seats are up for re-election at the same time.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the Zone 2 seat would not be on the ballot this cycle. However, the current Zone 2 representative, Tom Prater, was appointed to fill a vacancy created when Justin Burnett resigned earlier this year. By city law, any appointed position will be up for a vote in the next election.\n\nAmong the candidates vying for the mayor’s seat this election are two current City Council members — Ken McClure and Kristi Fulnecky.\n\nNeither Fulnecky’s nor McClure’s seats, respectively General C and General D, are up for grabs this election. If one of them wins the mayoral race, council will appoint someone to fill their vacated council seat.\n\nSecond, a remarkable amount of money has been raised for the mayoral race.\n\nAccording to campaign finance documents filed in October, Fulnecky has raised about $90,000. McClure has raised about $26,000.\n\nThe documents show Fulnecky has paid campaign workers more than $32,000. Her campaign has also released a promotional video.\n\nContrasting personalities will make the mayoral race an interesting one to watch.\n\nThe soft-spoken McClure has decades of experience in politics and leadership. Fulnecky’s colorful personality and controversial actions have attracted ardent supporters as well as outspoken critics.\n\nIt appears that all the council members whose seats are up for re-election are interested in running again, except Mayor Bob Stephens.\n\nA full list of approved candidates will come out after Jan. 17. The election will be held April 4.\n\n— Alissa Zhu\n\nPossible resolution to lawsuit over the Greene County Jail\n\nThe city of Springfield, Greene County and the sheriff took their disagreement about the overcrowded local jail to court in July 2015.\n\nThe parties have presented their arguments to a judge, in hopes the court can resolve the dispute without having to go to a lengthy trial.\n\nThe city of Springfield wants Greene County Sheriff Jim Arnott to accept municipal inmates in the local jail, for free.\n\nArnott argues the sheriff is solely in charge of jail policies and state statute requires him to only take municipal inmates if there is room.\n\nThe Greene County Commission believes it should not be involved in the lawsuit at all because it has upheld its side of an agreement signed in 1997.\n\nThe contract was an intergovernmental agreement between the city and county that called for municipal inmates to be housed in the jail, in return for the city’s support of a law enforcement sales tax.\n\nThough the suit has been making progress, it’s unclear when it will be resolved.\n\n— Alissa Zhu\n\nNew year, new movie theater — and maybe, a new ordinance\n\nA movie theater opening soon may lead to changes in a Springfield city ordinance.\n\nAlamo Drafthouse Cinema, a Texas-based chain that features food and bar service, announced in May that it would enter the Springfield market despite a city ordinance approved by voters in 2011 that bans alcohol from “family-oriented” movie theaters.\n\nIn September, Alamo Drafthouse and AMC, another movie theater company operating in Springfield, pitched City Council to legalize the sale of alcohol in a wider range of movie theaters than currently allowed by the complex city ordinance.\n\nOpponents of changes include Jim Blaine, a Springfield-based emergency physician who has chaired the 35-member DWI Task Force since it formed in 1990. The citizen group drafted the ordinance.\n\nBlaine told the News-Leader in September that if movie theaters try to change the existing ordinance, “I’d be very happy to bring it to the DWI Task Force, and we'd be happy to give an opinion (to council), if we know specifics.\"\n\nSince September, Alamo has had no further “formal communication” with city government, city spokeswoman Cora Scott said in a recent email. “We think that Alamo folks are probably communicating with stakeholders and preparing to come back to City Council at some point.”\n\nMeanwhile, the opening date for the theater has been pushed back from its original estimate, sometime in February.\n\nIn a blog on Alamo Drafthouse’s website, the company indicated in a Dec. 21 post that the Springfield Drafthouse would have its grand opening in “Spring 2017,” which a representative confirmed Wednesday.\n\n— Greg Holman\n\nZone 1 Blitz to wrap up in 2017, officials hope improvements continue\n\nWhile the Zone 1 Blitz will come to its official end in December 2017, city officials say many of its programs will continue and hopefully be duplicated in other areas of Springfield.\n\nThe Zone 1 Blitz is the 18-month-long, city-led initiative to decrease poverty and improve quality of life for those living in the northwest quadrant of Springfield — Zone 1.\n\nMore than 120 organizations have partnered with the city for Zone 1 Blitz projects and programs, with several hundred individuals pitching in to participate in more than 60 projects, said Cora Scott, spokesperson for the city of Springfield.\n\n“We are thrilled at the momentum behind the Zone 1 Blitz,” Scott said. “We feel one of the biggest successes is it has spurred other people to try new and different things and to collaborate so that projects work well together and are not duplicated.\n\n“It’s been overwhelming in a good way how organizations have stepped forward,” she added. “This is by far the most heartwarming project I’ve ever worked on.”\n\nZone 1 Blitz projects focus on these areas: chronic nuisance properties, digital divide, food access, health care, housing, infrastructure and transportation, jobs and economic development, public safety, wellness and neighborhood engagement.\n\nProjects include constructing bus stops, adding community gardens, providing weatherization upgrades to homes, increasing home access to affordable internet access and expanding the Library's Wi-Fi hot spot program, and incorporating block watch (a smaller version of Neighborhood Watch).\n\nScott said by the end of 2017 about $8 million worth of infrastructure improvement projects will be completed in Zone 1, including the construction of some 13,700 feet of new sidewalks.\n\n“That is so important to people who rely on walking or biking to get where they need to go,” she said.\n\nScott said she is especially excited about the Zone 1 Blitz jobs and economic development programs like the new Missouri Job Center office, which opened inside the Cox Medical Tower at 1443 N. Robberson in November.\n\nPrior to the center’s opening, it could take a resident living in Zone 1 about two and a half hours to arrive at the Missouri Job Center’s main office at 2900 E. Sunshine St., if they were relying on public transportation.\n\nFor a complete list of the Zone 1 Blitz projects, visit springfieldmo.gov/ZoneBlitz\n\n— Jackie Rehwald", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/07/01/heavy-industry-eyes-return-claymont-under-cza-bill/428169001/", "title": "Heavy industry eyes return to Claymont under Coastal Zone Act bill", "text": "Keith Delaney and Kevin McGowan walked across a desolate expanse of broken concrete and rubble in Claymont on Friday with little concern for the high levels of arsenic, lead and DDT in the soil beneath their feet.\n\n\"There is no 5-second rule here,\" Delaney joked. \"If you drop your candy bar, leave it on the ground. And be sure you don't lick your boots.\"\n\nThe 71-acre industrial wasteland that once housed sulfuric acid manufacturer General Chemical Corp. serves as a grim reminder of the state's dwindling chemical manufacturing sector, which has seen employment decline 87 percent since 2001 – a loss of more than 15,000 jobs.\n\nBut Delaney and McGowan see only fertile ground that soon could give life to $1 billion in new heavy industrial development – projects made possible only by an amendment to Delaware's Coastal Zone Act, passed by state lawmakers Thursday.\n\nSTORY:Budget debate explodes in House, Republicans storm out\n\nSTORY:Huge cuts to education, nonprofits now on table\n\n\"This bill has transformed this site overnight,\" Delaney said. \"I think it will bring a lot of development to the area, and we want to be the first ones to get to the finish line.\"\n\nDelaney is the principal owner of the East Norriton, Pennsylvania-based real estate investment firm D2 Management. McGowan is the president of McGowan Corporate Real Estate Advisors, based in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n\nThey could be the vanguard of what many hope will be a surge in new heavy industrial development along Delaware's coastline – including 14 sites identified in the amendment, 13 of which are in New Castle County.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW MAP\n\nThe property has raised interest from Fortune 500 companies that have expressed interest in building either a biofuel factory or a petrochemical plant, Delaney said.\n\nThe door to that new development was opened by House Bill 190, which authorized the first major change in Delaware's landmark environmental protection law since it was enacted in 1971.\n\nSome civic groups and environmentalists consider the act to be Delaware's crowning achievement for protecting wetlands and wildlife habitat – along with the state's thriving beach communities – from pollution.\n\nBut business groups and unions have long characterized the law as an outdated measure that long ago achieved its original intent and say it has blocked job growth.\n\nFacing a more than $350 million budget deficit, a steady decline in manufacturing jobs and years of stagnant wages, Delaware legislators opted to undo some of the act's restrictions.\n\nThe amendment is now awaiting the signature of Gov. John Carney, a Claymont native who made reforming the Coastal Zone Act a central part of his campaign platform and pushed the General Assembly to pass a bill this session.\n\n\"We really needed the Coastal Zone Act modification to jump-start the industrial development,\" Delaney said. \"And Delaware's state legislators really came through for us.\"\n\nLess than 24 hours after the legislation passed, they received several calls and emails from prospective tenants, Delaney and McGowan said. They now will focus their attention on an aggressive campaign to market the property to heavy industrial companies.\n\nWhatever company is chosen will likely end up being the test case for the Coastal Zone's new \"conversion\" permitting process required before construction begins.\n\nRegulations must be in place by October 2019. But a provision in the amendment allows the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to issue permits sooner.\n\nEnvironmentalists expect DNREC will see a flood of permit applications during the two-year grace period before the regulations are in place.\n\nThat could force DNREC to develop application forms, vetting procedures, review guidelines and timetables on the fly –– without any additional staff or funding.\n\n\"[The legislation] is an unfunded mandate that lacks the clear criteria and guidance needed for implementation,\" said David Carter, who previously led Delaware Audubon Society after retiring from a two-decade career with DNREC.\n\n\"It will excessively burden DNREC with an impossible task, setting them up for failure. The details will be determined through costly legal actions and case law, with an ice-cold chilling effect on redevelopment.\"\n\nComing down the pike\n\nOf the 14 sites identified in the bill, only a handful are vacant and prime for redevelopment.\n\nThree are in Claymont, including the former General Chemical property, the nearby Evraz Claymont Steel site and a 45-acre slice of Sunoco Logistics' former oil refinery.\n\nAn idled chlorine and chemical plant owned by Occidental Chemical Corp. is just outside Delaware City, while a 46-acre site along Red Lion Creek was used by Metachem Products and its predecessor Standard Chlorine to produce toxic chemicals known as chlorinated benzenes used as pesticides and herbicides until 2002.\n\nThe loss of those businesses collectively cost the state 900 jobs and left heavily polluted sites. All are now in some form of a state or federal cleanup program.\n\nThe former Metachem property, for example, was placed on the federal Superfund \"priority list\" in 1988 and has become the state's most expensive public cleanup project ever, costing taxpayers in excess of $100 million.\n\nTo win a \"conversion\" permit, buyers will be required to submit plans for dealing with sea-level rise, offer environmental offsets for any new pollution their projects will create and provide financial assurances that the sites will continue to be cleaned up – in the event of an environmental disaster or if the business closes down.\n\nBefore the Coastal Zone bill's passage, state officials refused to release the names of any prospective companies that might take advantage of the change, citing those businesses' requests for confidentiality.\n\nBut Delaney and McGowan said the state knew all along that they were counting on the measure to clear the way for redevelopment of the Claymont site.\n\n\"We first brought our ideas to DNREC in 2014,\" he said. \"Gov. Carney took a tour of the property just a couple of months ago.\"\n\nStill, the business partners insisted the bill was not written specifically with them in mind.\n\n\"We didn't have much input at all,\" Delaney said. \"We tried to make suggestions. Some were heard. Some were not. ... But we really did not have conversations with legislators.\"\n\nState Rep. Ed Osienski, D-Newark, who authored the bill, said he was aware of potential activity at the former General Chemical site, but had few conversations with Delaney and McGowan about how the legislation would impact those efforts.\n\n\"I was told people were looking at that site and our bill would be beneficial,\" he said. \"But I was not told any of the specifics. I just looked at what was needed to benefit every one of the 14 sites.\"\n\nSea change in the making\n\nAmendments to the Coastal Zone Act could represent the dawn of a new age for Delaware industry, business leaders say.\n\n\"The Coastal Zone Act has been a major hurdle to seeing any meaningful redevelopment,\" said James DeChene, senior vice president of government affairs for the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. \"The fact that one of these sites is actively garnering interest on Day One shows that what we've been saying for years is proving out.\"\n\nYet environmentalists and civic groups who have fiercely defended the law for decades say the reforms will ultimately expose Delaware residents to new sources of pollution. They also suspect the amendment will prove to be the first step toward the act's ultimate demise.\n\n\"Once you start down this road, it's going to be death by a thousand cuts,\" said Ken Kristl, director of the Environmental & Natural Resources Law Clinic at Widener University's Delaware Law School.\n\n\"If we don't see this renaissance we've been promised from this bill, the proponents will say we didn't open the door far enough,\" he said. \"And eventually there will be nothing left, all because of some optimistic, pie-in-the-sky promises of jobs that are always just around the corner.\"\n\nSince its adoption under Republican Gov. Russell Peterson, the Delaware Coastal Zone Act has barred heavy industry from a roughly 2-mile-wide ribbon that runs the length of the state's 115-mile shoreline.\n\nChemical plants and other factories operating in the Coastal Zone when the act was passed were allowed to continue, but the law effectively froze in time both their physical footprint and their industrial use.\n\nA handful of those companies have closed in recent decades, leaving behind large swaths of polluted ground with scant interest in redevelopment.\n\nToday, the toxic chemical below the surface at the former General Chemical site is virtually all that remains of a century-old industrial complex that once employed hundreds to manufacture pesticides and sulfuric acids just yards from the Pennsylvania line.\n\nGeneral Chemical shut down in late 2003, citing chronic operating losses, millions of dollars worth of needed improvements and weak chemical markets. The closure resulted in more than 200 layoffs.\n\nWhile the property could have been redeveloped for any number of light manufacturing uses, a chemical plant was the only heavy industrial use allowed under the Coastal Zone Act.\n\nA year later, the site was declared abandoned and lost even that grandfathered protection, preventing a future owner from using a pier on the property to transfer bulk products from ship to shore and vice versa.\n\nThe bill that cleared the state Senate on Thursday eased those restrictions by creating an approval process that could restore the property's use as a heavy industrial site and reopen its pier – so long as the bulk products coming in are used by a business in Delaware's Coastal Zone and those heading out are made there.\n\nThat bulk product transfer provision, which impacts nine of the 14 sites, has been a major sticking point for the environmental community, which claims it's a spill waiting to happen.\n\nProponents of the measure argue such transfers are significantly safer today than when the original Coastal Zone Act was passed.\n\n\"The intent was not to gut the act but to allow for an extended brownfield program at those 14 sites so they could be cleaned up, reused and put back to work,\" said Brian McGlinchey, president of Delawareans for Economic and Environmental Development.\n\nThe coalition of labor, civic and business leaders has long championed Coastal Zone Act reform. A former projects director for then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden, McGlinchey also works as a lobbyist for McCarter Government Solutions, where his clients include Delaney and PBF Energy, owner of the Delaware City Refinery – another one of the 14 sites targeted by the new legislation.\n\nHe described the bill as \"critical\" to the redevelopment projects Delaney is pursuing in Claymont but insisted the legislation was not tailor-made for the proposed development.\n\n\"Hopefully, this will be a pilot project and shining example of cooperation in terms of a redevelopment use that is consistent with the integrity of the act and created in the governor's hometown,\" he said. \"But there is an approval process, and process is the keyword. This is not a fast track.\"\n\nCanary in the coal mine\n\nDelaney said the jobs promised are not some far-off dream. They are already here.\n\nAbout a dozen contractors were at the former General Chemical site this week, conducting site preparation work for what Delaney says will be the first of several development projects planned for the property.\n\nDrawbridge Claymont, a limited liability corporation managed by Delaney's real estate investment firm, purchased a portion of the site last summer. In May, the company won the blessing of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to build a 14-acre rail yard on the southern portion of the site.\n\nLocated just south of an existing Conrail freight spur, the yard will serve as an adjunct to the Braskem America's polypropylene plant just over the state line in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe facility will serve as a staging ground for up to 240 rail cars loaded with pellets of the petroleum-derived plastic before being sent to customers that convert the feedstock into materials used in everything from diapers to carpet fibers. A loading area also will allow the pellets to be moved onto trucks.\n\nBut first, Drawbridge will need to install a massive impermeable geo-synthetic membrane between the soil and the future rail yard to prevent security personnel, drivers and equipment operators from coming in contact with the polluted soil. That portion of the project is still awaiting final approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nA rail yard is one of the uses permitted by right in the Coastal Zone Act, and the project will not need a permit under the long-standing regulations or the new amendment to proceed, DNREC ruled.\n\nBut Delaney said he sees the rail yard as the first toehold that will help attract more investment to the former General Chemical site.\n\nOther projects may soon follow elsewhere in the Coastal Zone.\n\nCommercial Development Co. of St. Louis purchased the former Evraz Claymont Steel property in 2015. The 425-acre property off I-495 straddles Philadelphia Pike, the railroad and has frontage along the Delaware River with a barge slip.\n\nThe developer has proposed turning the property into an office, manufacturing and transit hub called First State Crossing that could bring as many as 5,000 jobs to the area. The plans also include a proposal for a port facility along the Delaware River, including a 1-mile bulkhead and space for a dry dock.\n\nSteve Collins, executive vice president of CDC, previously told community members that port project would likely require some exemption from the Coastal Zone Act. It is possible that project may move forward under the conversion permitting process passed by the Legislature.\n\n\"We are pleased the legislature seeks to balance economic as well as environmental concerns,\" Collins said via email. \"We will return the former Evraz Steel site to productive reuse, and feel revisions to the Coast Zone Act could be helpful.\"\n\nJust across the Pennsylvania line, Energy Transfer Partners is turning Sunoco Logistic's former refinery into a hub for the company's natural gas liquid pipeline network, a portion of which conceivably could be built on its Delaware property.\n\nRefinery officials did not return messages seeking comment. But Wilmington-based attorney David Swayze, who represents both Delaney's D2 Management and ETP, said last week that the owner of the natural gas liquids complex was watching the Coastal Zone bill \"with interest.\"\n\nShaky ground\n\nInterest in industrial redevelopment along the Delaware River may be at a 50-year high thanks to the new conversion permitting process. But it remains to be seen whether that translates into an actual boom along the Delaware River.\n\nKristl, the environmental law professor, said Delaware officials went down a similar path after the Great Recession, becoming susceptible to the misdeeds and broken promises of out-of-state companies also offering hundreds of blue-collar jobs.\n\nDelaware's most notorious bust came in the form of a $12.5 million state loan and a $9 million state grant to Fisker Automotive, marking the third-largest Strategic Fund outlay under former Gov. Jack Markell. The deal included few of the clawback provisions common to such state-led economic development efforts.\n\nFisker never built a car in Delaware. And only a small amount of the state’s money was returned.\n\nThe state also ponied up a $16.5 million grant to Bloom Energy in 2012, and lawmakers put Delmarva Power customers on the hook for 21 years' worth of surcharges – all with the promise that the fuel cell maker would generate 900 jobs. As of last fall, its total employment in Delaware was below 300.\n\n\"We've been down this path before with the state changing the rules in its never-ending quest for jobs, and look how that turned out,\" Kristl said. \"Hope springs eternal, I guess.\"\n\nSupporters of the Coastal Zone Act amendment, however, say they are certain the state's attempt to attract heavy industry will yield the desired results.\n\n\"The is palpable evidence that D2 [Management] is poised to begin a major expansion at the old General Chemical site,\" Swayze said. \"Obviously, it will take a while to transform the land and get businesses in place, but it's reasonable to believe they will do so.\"\n\nBill Freeborn, executive vice president of the Delaware Contractor's Association, said he is certain that project and others will help generate enough interest among heavy industries to pull the state out of its current \"economic malaise.\"\n\n\"Where there are one or two, there are 36 or 72 waiting in the wings,\" he said. \"When the door opens up and word gets out that Delaware is open for business, there will be people knocking down our door.\"\n\nJames Maravelias, president of the Delaware AFL-CIO, said he understands the doubts about whether heavy industry will actually come to Delaware.\n\n\"Look, I can't say for sure today whether this legislation is the answer, but after 46 years it's certainly a good start,\" he said.\n\n\"It can't hurt to try something that might create jobs, bring back industry and get some of the sites cleaned up rather than have them be a big wasteland,\" he added. \"How people can think that is better than having a productive plant, I just don't get it.\"\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2020/07/31/there-so-much-unknown-how-covid-19-has-impacted-commercial-real-estate-delaware-and-whats-come/5516802002/", "title": "How COVID-19 has impacted commercial real estate in Delaware ...", "text": "The first four months of the coronavirus pandemic has already led to a deluge of going-out-of-business sales, but those in Delaware's commercial real estate sector believe the worst is likely yet to come.\n\n\"It's still hard to predict exactly what the impact is going to be,\" said Greg Ellis, a principal at Patterson-Woods Commercial Properties.\n\nEarn rewards on your spending: Best credit cards for shopping", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/04/25/tractor-trailer-jake-brake-law-difficult-enforce/100874500/", "title": "Tractor-trailer jake brake law 'difficult to enforce'", "text": "Karl Baker\n\nThe News Journal\n\nA law designed to limit noise from heavy-truck engines passing through Delaware residential areas is difficult to enforce because of a “loophole” written into its recently-adopted text, a state police officer said Monday at a town hall meeting attended by irate residents who live along Del. 41.\n\nThe act, which bans the use of the cacophonous tractor-trailer braking system, known as jake brakes, passed the General Assembly last year. But a truck driver may still use the auxiliary engine-compression brakes, if there is an emergency, Delaware State Police Lt. Mike Wysock said.\n\n“Here’s what happens when you go to court…all you have to say is ‘your honor (the traffic light) was yellow, I didn’t want to run a red light,’ so it was an emergency and (the ticket) gets dropped,” Wysock said to the crowd of more than 100 residents, who for years have been petitioning the state to more strictly regulate the heavy trucks that pass by their houses.\n\n“Everyone thinks, ‘oh, he jake braked, so we can go and arrest him.’ Well, you can, but as soon as you stop him, he’s got a valid excuse that’s going to get (the ticket) dropped,” Wysock added.\n\nThe Monday-night meeting, which occurred at Cedars Methodist Church, was the latest in a series of public gatherings by residents who are fed up with what they describe as loud trucks that speed daily – and nightly – through residential neighborhoods along the Del. 41 and Del. 48 corridors between Wilmington and Hockessin.\n\nNoise and vibrations from the big rigs damage foundations of houses and other structures near the roadway, including Cedar Methodist, which is a block from Del. 41, said Bill Taylor, an area resident and trustee of the church.\n\nTruckers also rattle the nerves of residents when they use “the terror of all terrors, jake braking in the middle of the night,” said Taylor, to cheers of approval at the meeting.\n\nSTORY: Capital One to stay in Wilmington\n\nSTORY: Delcollo: Truck solution to make people equally unhappy\n\nRep. Kim Williams, D-Newport, the sponsor of the anti-jake braking bill last year, was perplexed that the law was not having its desired effect. Further legislation may be necessary, she said at Monday's meeting. She also expressed concern that any citation issued by an officer who is not part of the state police’s dedicated truck enforcement team does not show up as a demerit on a truck driver’s federal registration.\n\n”There was a little confusion there…my understanding is that they are issuing tickets and it affects their driving record,” she said.\n\nFrustration with the heavy trucks caused a feud over the last year between residents who live on Del. 41 and Del. 48, with each side insisting the other is more suitable for the trucks that pass between Wilmington and Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe neighbors angrily accused the others of menacingly manipulating the state transportation department into first placing, and then removing, signs that directed heavy trucks onto Del. 48.\n\nThe dispute also caused political ramifications statewide. Many observers say former Senate Pro Tempore Patricia Blevins was unseated after the November election because of her stance that traffic engineers, not politicians, should decide the issue.\n\nRepublican Sen. Anthony Delcollo took her spot to represent the district, which encompasses parts of both Del. 41 and Del. 48.\n\nBut the neighborhood infighting showed signs of diminishing Monday after many at the meeting sounded a conciliatory tone despite continued frustration over the trucks that avoid police scrutiny.\n\n\"The problem that we have now is going to take cooperation from everyone, 41 and 48,\" Taylor said.\n\nScorn appeared to have shifted away from fellow neighbors and legislators. Instead, it zeroed in on Delaware Department of Transportation officials, who were noticeably absent. Williams said she was \"embarrassed\" that DelDOT had not attended.\n\nRep. Gerald Brady, D-Hockessin, echoed the sentiment, asking rhetorically, \"is anyone here from the governor's office? Who is his cabinet secretary?\"\n\n\"In her absence, where is the executive branch of government? They make the decisions,\" Brady said.\n\nDelDOT Secretary Jennifer Cohan, in an email to the meeting organizer, Mary Ann Summers, said she could not attend because she is currently out of the country. It is unclear why another representative from DelDOT was not there. State officials attended numerous previous public gatherings on the issue during the past year.\n\n\"I will have a letter to you outlining the timeline and what we hope to move forward by tomorrow so you can share all those in attendance,\" Cohan said in the April 10 email to Summers. \"I will also try to get an update from the Port of Wilmington as well for you,\"\n\nSummers fears a proposed expansion of port operations near Wilmington will increase the number of trucks throughout New Castle County, and exacerbate their issues on Del. 41. A Federal Highway Administration report from last year shows the Port of Wilmington already is the 19th largest U.S. port, as measured by containerized cargo.\n\nTaylor also warned residents that more congested roads in the coming years will result from a planned development at the nearby Hercules Country Club.\n\n\"Another 265 commuters every morning and afternoon (will be) on route 41 and route 48,\" he said.\n\nAfter the 3-hour meeting came to a close, Delcollo said the state should immediately look into installing signs on Del. 41 that warn truck drivers of nearby traffic lights and should consider adjusting the speed limit.\n\n\"There are some things that would require minimal investment with infrastructure, (and) we could get to them very quickly,\" he said.\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

That’s all.\"\n\nThe Castle, Boccanfuso says, will be ready for move-ins by the end of this month. Rents start at $1,968 for a studio and $2,726 for a two-bedroom.\n\nHundreds of new luxury rental apartments will hit the Lower Hudson Valley market this year, and a few thousand more will follow in the coming years.\n\nThe luxury trend has been growing since the housing market collapsed in 2008. As loans for condominium construction dried up, developers switched to rentals, which turned out to be popular with millennials and empty-nesters.\n\nThe vacancy rate for rental apartments in Westchester was 3 percent in the third quarter of 2015, down 0.2 percentage points from the same period in 2014. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development says the national average is about 7 percent.\n\nHousing advocates say they're concerned that most new rental apartments are not affordable. The average monthly rent in Westchester for third-quarter 2015 was $2,037, up by 2.5 percent from the monthly average a year before, which was $1,988, according to HUD.\n\nLuxury rentals sprout\n\nEven during the normally slow winter months, apartment construction continues throughout Westchester. On Main Street at Midland Place in Tuckahoe, about a 10-minute walk from the train station, workers are building the 108-unit Quarry Place complex.\n\n\"We hope to have it completed by June, early summer,\" said developer Glen Vetromile of Glenco Group.\n\nConstruction is also running at full speed on Westerly Road in the village of Ossining. Ginsburg Development Cos., once known for its waterfront luxury condominiums, is building 188 rental apartments near the train station. The development, Harbor Square, is slated to start leasing in mid-April with the first move-ins in June.\n\nCompany founder Martin Ginsburg said easy access to public transit and generous amenities are important ingredients for successful rental apartments.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind, particularly with millennials, these people are not interested in living in the country,\" he said.\n\nAnother Ginsburg luxury rental complex, Riverside at Harbors at Haverstraw, began leasing its 106 apartments — ranging from studios to three-bedrooms — in June. About 70 percent have been rented, according to the company.\n\nNewlyweds Adam and Nicole Fallacaro, both 26, moved into a one-bedroom Riverside unit in October. They chose the complex because it offers an easy commute while being close to their families and friends, Adam Fallacaro said.\n\nNicole Fallacaro said, while renting, they want to learn more about Rockland County to see whether they want to stay.\n\n\"We didn't know where, exactly, we wanted to settle to buy a house, because it's a very large investment for us,\" she said.\n\nBefore getting married, they lived in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\n\"Hoboken is very expensive. And you don't get much space, square footage, compared to the space you could get here,\" Nicole Fallacaro said.\n\nThey pay about $2,000 a month, which includes reserved garage spots and access to Riverside's swimming pools and fitness centers.\n\nOther luxury apartments planned in Rockland include one on Orange Avenue in Suffern, about a three-minute walk from the Suffern train station. Construction of the five-story, 92-unit luxury building is slated to begin next month.\n\nAbout a dozen projects are in the pipeline throughout Westchester.\n\nBoccanfuso, developer of The Castle in Port Chester, said his first project in the village, The Mariner, a 100-unit complex in the heart of downtown and a short walk to the train station, has been fully occupied since it opened in 2012 by young professionals attracted by its convenient location and the area's \"Brooklyn vibe.\"\n\n\"We had some visions here, and we saw what’s going to happen, what people would want,\" Buccanfuso said. \"And it turned out to be we were right.\"\n\nResort-style living in demand\n\nAlong with millennials, luxury rentals are designed to attract empty-nesters, such as Steve and Wendy Lichtenthal.\n\nLichtenthal, 67, and his wife have been renting a 1,400-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment at Riverside in Haverstraw since November, after they sold their 18-room house in Palisades.\n\n\"We moved to make our life simple,\" said Steve Lichtenthal, recalling that the large house, where the couple raised their three children, required constant attention, from lawn care to swimming-pool maintenance.\n\nLiving in the complex \"feels like a hotel. It feels like we are vacationing, rather than living,\" he said. \"This is stress-free living.\"\n\nVetromile, developer of Quarry Place, said his apartments would cater to people like the Lichtenthals.\n\n\"It’s a type of housing — lifestyle — in strong demand. People don’t necessarily want to live in homes anymore, particularly when children are grown,\" Vetromile said. \"And if they find buildings that have a lot of amenities, they find it very attractive as an alternative to single-family-home living.\"\n\nGinsburg agreed, saying that his other upcoming luxury rental developments — 66 loft-style apartments in Hastings-on-Hudson and a 330-unit complex in Yonkers — both offer plenty of amenities, such as concierge service, a spa and a fitness center. Leasing at the Hastings complex is set to begin in June and Yonkers in the fall.\n\nNot affordable\n\nResort-style living comes with a high cost. For example, the monthly rent at Harbor Square in Ossining will range from $1,795 for a smaller one-bedroom unit to more than $5,000 for a large two-bedroom corner apartment with a balcony overlooking the Hudson River.\n\nThe expensive rents are worrisome to those who already live in the community, said Ann Gulian of Ossining.\n\n\"They are not geared toward the average-income people in Ossining,\" said Gulian, a music teacher who has been living in the village since 1991.\n\nThe scarcity of affordable housing has been a contentious issue throughout the Lower Hudson Valley. The Ossining village Board of Trustees in 2006 adopted an Affordable Housing Policy Statement, which requires a new development of six or more units to set aside 10 percent of the units as affordable. Such requirements are common in the region. In the case of Harbor Square, Ginsburg promised to reserve 19 units for tenants at 80 percent of Ossining's median annual income of about $66,000.\n\n\"The ideal scenario is a balance of both affordable and luxury housing,\" said Ossining Mayor Victoria Gearity. \"If there is enough affordable housing to meet the needs of our socioeconomically diverse community, then additional luxury apartments would not be perceived as a problem.\"\n\nGinsburg said the influx of new residents with disposable incomes would benefit the community because they shop and dine locally.\n\n\"The downtown of Ossining is the handsomest downtown of all the villages. Architecturally most attractive,\" he said, adding that his goal as a developer is to create destination places along the Hudson River to promote tourism. \"It's going to be a very special place for people to live.\"\n\nTwitter: @LohudAkiko", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/07/13/campaign-light-up-dover-crime/459779001/", "title": "Campaign launched to light up Dover's high-crime areas", "text": "When Lamotte McCallister opened his front door to four people wearing fluorescent yellow shirts bearing the phrase \"Lights-On Dover Strong,\" he didn't know what to expect.\n\nWhen he heard why they were there, he was all in.\n\nThe volunteers were among a group going door to door providing residents in central Dover energy-efficient LED lights for their front porches and solar-powered LED motion-sensor floodlights for their backyards. It is part of an effort to reduce crime in an area that has historically seen the highest numbers.\n\nUnder the program, residents on 14 streets – including New, Queen, Kirkwood, Bradford and Governors streets – can get the free lights if they pledge to turn them on every night.\n\n\"The goal is to increase security and empower residents to increase public awareness of criminal activity in these high-risk areas,\" said Chanda Jackson, community engagement specialist for Restoring Central Dover. \"Neighbors working together and talking to each other creates a sense of community. We hope it will demonstrate a unified community approach to public safety.\"\n\nVolunteers from the HELP Initiative Inc. and the Restoring Central Dover, along with interns from Delaware State University, have been out all week installing the lightbulbs and motion floodlights on houses whose owners signed a pledge to reduce crime during a kickoff block party at the end of June.\n\nSTORY: Three state hospital workers charged after patient dies\n\nSTORY: Smyrna hires firm to investigate police chief\n\nThe boots-on-the-ground effort also approaches owners in houses that are not already signed up to try to get full neighborhood participation. McCallister fell into that category.\n\n\"This is amazing,\" said McCallister, who lives on South Queen Street. \"I didn't know this was happening, but I think it might help deter people from going in backyards. I think this will help decrease crime in the area.\"\n\nThat's the hope of the Dover Police Department, a community partner in the campaign. Dover Police Chief Marvin Mailey Jr. believes the effort is a great prevention tool in some of the city's high-risk neighborhoods.\n\nThe area around South New Street, South Governors Avenue, South Bradford Street and South Kirkwood Street has seen more than its share of crime and is considered one of the worst areas in the city, he said.\n\nMailey said people there want to have a better quality of life.\n\n\"Typically, this is our high-crime area, and we are trying to change the landscape of the city,\" Mailey said. \"This program will definitely make Dover safer. Our bad guys don't like to stand under lights when they commit crimes.\"\n\nAccording to Dover police data, burglaries and robberies rose by double-digit percentages in 2016, as were violent crimes, including murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. A large number of those crimes are occurring in the campaign's target area, Mailey said.\n\nWhen the campaign was first discussed publicly in April, the goal was to reach 200 homes in a 75-block area. That number is now 500 homes, according to Jackson. She estimates the cost for materials is $9,000, with the labor being donated by volunteers.\n\nJackson said a number of partners have pledged money and labor, including the HELP Initiative Inc., Delaware State University, NCALL Research Inc., Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County, Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility, the Home Depot and Dover police.\n\n\"This is a community effort and the residents seem pretty receptive. So far, we've had positive reaction to the campaign,\" she said. \"We're getting calls from residents asking when they can get their bulbs. It's a matter of breaking the ice and building relationships.\"\n\nCharlie Kistler and Harold Stafford have been providing the installation labor this past week and will continue their efforts until all the houses in the target area have bulbs and motion sensors. Along the way, the founders of the HELP Initiative Inc. have been educating homeowners about the campaign and also about energy efficiency in general.\n\n\"The residents commit to leaving the lights on and also to keeping their neighbors aware that it is important to keep their lights on, too,\" Kistler said. \"When we go from house to block to neighborhood and then the city, we want to light it up to the point where we can reduce crime.\"\n\nBut the effort is about more than crime, Jackson said.\n\nRestoring Central Dover was adopted in 2014 as a comprehensive neighborhood revitalization plan. Jackson said the plan represents the community’s vision for restoring the vitality of Central Dover and lists recommendations for implementation over the next 10 years.\n\nResident input and priorities have been derived from a community survey, meetings, events, activities and community outreach, she said.\n\n\"Lights-On Dover Strong is just a piece of the puzzle,\" she said. \"Relationships are important in this campaign and all of our efforts.

News Journal\n\nThomas Matusiewicz opened fire inside the New Castle County Courthouse on Feb. 11%2C killing Christine Belford and Laura Mulford\n\nThe family has been embroiled in a longstanding custody battle over three girls\n\nThe sister of the girls%27 father is seeking guardianship\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. -- Since Christine Belford was shot to death by her former father-in-law inside a county courthouse in February, at least one relative has stepped forward and sought guardianship of her daughters.\n\nThe request, however, is being opposed by the Delaware Division of Family Services, which says the girls' aunt isn't \"related to the children\" and, thus, doesn't meet requirements for guardianship under Delaware law.\n\nThe girls -- ages 7 to 10 -- have resided in foster care since their grandfather, Thomas Matusiewicz, shot to death their mother, 39-year-old Belford, and her friend, Laura \"Beth\" Mulford, in the New Castle County Courthouse lobby on Feb. 11.\n\nThat day, Belford was on her way to attend a child-support hearing opposite ex-husband David Matusiewicz, with whom she had three daughters. As she entered the courthouse, David's father, Thomas Matusiewicz, killed Belford and Mulford, before taking his own life.\n\nThomas' daughter, Amy Gonzalez of Edinburg, Texas, wants to take responsibility for her three nieces. Gonzalez is the younger sister of David Matusiewicz and the only aunt to his three girls.\n\nFamily members usually receive preference when the courts consider the permanent guardianship of minors in foster care. But state officials are highlighting a Family Court order that, in 2011, terminated David's parental rights to his daughters, according to court records.\n\nThat order followed David's 2009 conviction on charges that he kidnapped the girls to Central America for a year and a half with the help of his mother, Lenore Matusiewicz. Both David and Lenore served prison time -- Lenore on her conviction on three counts of endangering the welfare of a child.\n\nThe day after the February courthouse shooting, a Delaware judge issued a no-contact order against Lenore, now 67, directing her to stay at least 1,000 feet away from her three granddaughters and to have no \"direct or indirect\" contact with them. David has been in federal custody since the shooting, currently serving a six-month sentence for violating his probation.\n\nWhen a mother or father loses \"parental rights\" to a child, that loss extends to the status of the parent's blood relatives for the purposes of preference in Family Court proceedings, said Jason Miller, spokesman for the state Attorney General's Office.\n\n\"It's as if the familial relationship never existed for purposes of preference in a Family Services hearing, and by extension, his blood relatives' relationship never existed,\" Miller said.\n\nIt also means that someone in Gonzalez' position has no right to information on the welfare of her nieces, where they're living or the identity of her foster family -- all of which is confidential under state law.\n\n\"Your email and multiple telephone calls seeking information have been referred to me for response,\" Deputy Attorney General Patricia Dailey Lewis wrote to Gonzalez by email March 1.\n\n\"You have no legal relationship to the children you seek information about; the rights of their biological father have been terminated; that termination was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Delaware. Any rights you may have had were extinguished. No information will be provided to you.\"\n\nDailey Lewis, head of the Attorney General's Family Division, directed Gonzalez not to contact her office or that of the state Department of Services for Children Youth & Their Families again.\n\nGonzalez says she had only emailed and called the Family Division once. She petitioned for guardianship of her nieces in February.\n\n\"I have no idea where my nieces are and will not be given any information when requested from Attorney General Beau Biden's Office and the Delaware child protective services,\" Gonzalez wrote in an email to reporters. \"I am deeply concerned for them.\"\n\nState law permits Gonzalez to petition for guardianship, but she receives no preference in regards to her relationship to the girls, according to state officials.\n\n\"If the parental rights have been terminated, then the court would look at that individual like a stranger, if they are not a foster parent or family member,\" said Frank Perfinski, adoption program manager for the Division of Family Services.\n\nThe state would remain the official guardian of the Matusiewicz girls until a judge appoints another legal guardian or the children are adopted.\n\nIn cases of terminated parental rights where the child remains in welfare, DFS updates the court at least twice a year on the child's welfare and the division's progress in seeking a permanent home for him or her, Perfinski said.\n\nGonzalez wants to know whether state officials or the courts have asked the girls whether they'd like to have contact with their father, she said by email.\n\n\"I hope the judges that have made these life-altering decisions for these families never have to experience another judge saying that you cannot contact your own children,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nOfficials would not comment specifically on the case of the Matusiewicz girls, citing confidentiality laws and the ongoing criminal investigation into their mother's death.\n\n\"We're aware of the children's status,\" said Miller of the AG's Office. \"They're in a loving family and being well cared for.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/05/07"}]}

All were in the second half. Of Stony Brook’s 285 yards on 51 offensive snaps, 216 came on nine plays of 10 yards or longer.\n\n“We’ve got to do a better job with the fundamentals,” said interim coach Dennis Dottin-Carter, Delaware’s defensive line coach and co-defensive coordinator. “It’s always going to be, when we watch the film, the big runs or the big plays are going to be preventable. They’re going to be situations where we knew we should have done this or we knew we should have done that. And then we’re going to try to get them fixed.’’\n\nBut the newest – and most impactful – culprit in Delaware’s demise was the fumble.\n\nFive lost fumbles were the Hens’ most since a 1995 win at Rhode Island. Delaware’s seven fumbles – it recovered two – were the most since a 1998 loss at Richmond. Stony Brook scored directly off one fumble and turned two others into touchdowns.\n\n“At the end of the day they’re all excuses,” Dottin-Carter said when asked if cool, wet, windy conditions played a role in the fumbles. “We need to do a better job holding onto the football. We’ll work on that in practice.”\n\nNo. 24-ranked Stony Brook (5-2, 4-0) moved into a first-place tie with idle James Madison in the CAA. It was the first-ever football meeting between Delaware and Stony Brook, which joined the CAA in 2013.\n\n“It’s just coming together and playing,” junior linebacker and co-captain Charles Bell said of what Delaware must do going forward. “We have to do a better job on both sides of the ball.”\n\nStony Brook took a 14-3 lead on its first possession of the third quarter when Carbone, unable to find an open receiver, escaped the pass rush into open field and dashed 24 yards for a touchdown. It was fourth-and-14. Delaware quarterback Joe Walker’s fumble, Delaware’s third, had given Stony Brook possession at the UD 49.\n\nThe Seawolves then added Bedell’s TD runs in the fourth quarter. He finished with 120 yards on 14 carries.\n\nIn a matchup of a Delaware rushing attack that was No. 2 in the CAA (270.8 ypg) and Stony Brook’s No. 2 rushing defense (105.7 ypg), Delaware was limited to 104 yards on the ground. Wes Hills’ 53 yards on 13 carries led the Hens but he fumbled twice, losing one.\n\nSt. Elizabeth High grad and ex-Delaware assistant coach Lyle Hemphill, Stony Brook’s defensive coordinator, had his unit ready for the Hens. Delaware’s rushing and total yards (238) were easily it fewest against an FCS foe this year.\n\n“Coach Hemp’s the man,” said defensive end John Haggart, who had 51/2 tackles for lost yardage and three forced fumbles, including the one teammate Jaheem Woods ran 55 yards for a touchdown. “He’s the reason why we’re all crazy savages every game. Coming into this game we knew how good they were running the ball so that was a huge factor and he had that to a ‘T’ all week.”\n\nIn difficult throwing conditions, Walker completed 12 of 26 passes for 134 yards. But he lost three fumbles himself, including the one Woods ran back for a second-quarter TD when he was hit trying to pass, and another came after a handoff to Jalen Randolph. As usual, several dropped passes haunted the Hens. Charles Scarff caught four passes for 71 yards.\n\nWalker was also sacked five times. Delaware had given up a CAA-low four sacks before Saturday but it had also thrown far fewer passes than anyone.\n\nThe Hens’ only points came on Frank Raggo’s 23-yard field goal with 3:56 left in the second quarter. But that was a missed chance, too, as Delaware ran five plays from the 6-yard line and closer, including three after a pass-interference call gave it first-and-goal at the 2.\n\nOther first-half UD possessions fizzled out at the Stony Brook 23 (Hills fumble), 38 (Woods’ fumble return for TD) and 12 (Walker dropped for 1-yard loss on fourth-and-2).\n\nThe last chance was set up when Bell recovered a Stony Brook fumble forced by Armen Ware and returned it 33 yards to the Seawolves 20 with 1:13 left in the first half.\n\nEach team only punted once in the first half. Stony Brook also had a first-quarter series thwarted by Malcom Brown’s fourth-down interception and a second-quarter chance foiled when Troy Reeder and John Nassib stopped Carbone two yards shy of a first down on fourth-and-3 from the UD 15.\n\nDelaware had just three first downs (out of 16 total) and 83 total yards in the second half.\n\n“We were moving the ball in the first half,” said center Brody Kern, “and I think the ‘O’ line coming out complacent thought, oh, we’re just going to keep doing our thing and they had a good defensive line. They could move and they were quick-twitch guys and they got the better of us. We’ve got to do a better job as a unit.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Delaware would have been in easily if it hadn’t lost 28-7 at Villanova.\n\nWhen the tourney field was revealed Sunday on an 11 a.m. ESPNU show, the Blue Hens (7-4) were not included.\n\nBut Colonial Athletic Association rival New Hampshire (7-4) was, for the 14th straight year, which fueled Delaware fury.\n\n“This is an injustice,” coach Danny Rocco said.\n\nThe Blue Hens had just watched the selection show in the Carpenter Center auditorium.\n\n“I cannot find any logical, sensible reason that New Hampshire trumps Delaware,” Rocco said. “There isn’t one statistical, data-driven reason.”\n\nDelaware and New Hampshire didn’t play each other.\n\nAgainst common opponents, Delaware was 4-2 (losses to James Madison and Towson) to UNH’s 3-3 (losses to James Madison, Stony Brook and Albany). UNH lost 15-0 at Albany on Saturday, a week after Delaware downed the Great Danes 22-3 at Delaware Stadium.\n\nThe Blue Hens had a better best win, over CAA runner-up Stony Brook, and New Hampshire had an inferior worst loss — 51-26 to Holy Cross (4-7, 3-3) of the Patriot League, whose champion, Lehigh, went 5-6. UNH did have a win over an FBS program, but it came against 1-9 Georgia Southern.\n\n“It’s our own fault for putting it in the hands of the committee,” Delaware senior center and captain Brody Kern said. “It’s kind of frustrating. After yesterday, we kind of thought the season was done. Seeing New Hampshire lost kind of brought hope. Now to come in and get let down again ...”\n\nDelaware was also above New Hampshire in the Jeff Sagarin Ratings, a computer-generated model, and had a better strength of schedule.\n\nNew Hampshire athletic director Marty Scarano is the CAA’s representative on the FCS committee.\n\n“It makes no sense,\" Rocco said. \"Now if their AD is on the board and if that’s a factor then shame on everybody for allowing that to once again factor in on the future and the opportunity that we present to our student-athletes.”\n\nRocco pointed out that it isn’t the first time UNH has been selected over a CAA rival with similar, if not better credentials, including his 2012 Richmond team and Towson in both 2012 and 2015.\n\n“This one here is very difficult to understand,” Rocco said. “It’s baffling.”\n\nRichard Johnson, the athletic director from Wofford who serves as selection committee chairman, said on the ESPNU telecast that Austin Peay and Delaware were the two teams that came closest to being selected but didn’t. South Dakota and Nicholls State were the final two teams to get in.\n\nAmong the other at-large qualifiers was Big South runner-up Monmouth (9-2), which also lost to Albany.\n\nNew Hampshire was ranked 21st in the final STATS media Top 25 national poll of the regular season announced Sunday. But the poll is not supposed to be a factor in the selections.

They also question whether the investments pay dividends in the long run.\n\nBut they all agree it’s a game Delaware – and other states – must play if they want to attract corporate jobs because no state can afford to back out now.\n\n“Look, everybody does it so we have to do it, too,” said Jim Butkiewicz, who heads the University of Delaware’s economics department. “It may not be the easiest fact of life to accept, but it’s a reality of economic development today.”\n\nHow Delaware outhustled other states to win DuPont ag unit\n\nSo why does Delaware and practically every other state in the country award money to corporations that rake in billions of dollars a year?\n\n“It’s not because the companies need [state help],” said Timothy Bartik, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\n“But in the highly competitive world of economic development, [corporations] are perceived as having location options and, therefore, leverage,” he said. “As a result, governors and mayors throughout the country are afraid of the political and economic consequences of not providing those incentives.”\n\nIn DuPont's case, for instance, those state payouts played a significant role in retaining a corporation that has been synonymous with Delaware for two centuries.\n\nLosing the company would have meant more than additional job losses. DuPont has been synonymous with Delaware for more than two centuries, providing not just tens of thousands of jobs, but building roads, supporting charities and providing for its extended family. Few people in Delaware are not touched in some way by the company.\n\nTo lose it would have been a psychological blow.\n\n\"DuPont was clear to us that this was a business decision and that company leadership had a duty to do what was in the best interest of shareholders,\" said Bernice Whaley, director of the Delaware Economic Development Office. \"So if they were to choose Delaware, they would need us to put forth a package that then allowed them to justify their decision to shareholders.\"\n\nBig money for big companies\n\nSome of the nation’s largest corporations have received some of the biggest payouts from Delaware's Strategic Fund, a pot of money set aside to provide incentives for job creation and capital development.\n\nSix Fortune 500 companies are among the 10 biggest recipients of those funds since 2009, according to an analysis by The News Journal.\n\nDelaware has committed about $92 million to those six businesses since Gov. Jack Markell took office – that is 37 percent of the roughly $250 million in Strategic Fund grants and loans awarded by his administration.\n\nIn November, for instance, JPMorgan Chase secured $10.5 million in state grants to support an expansion that promises to bring 1,800 new jobs to Delaware.\n\nThe deal brought the state’s total commitment to JPMorgan over the past three years to more than $22 million, making the nation’s largest bank the second-largest recipient of Strategic Fund dollars under Markell.\n\nThose payouts helped encourage JPMorgan to grow its local workforce from about 6,600 in 2012 to roughly 8,700 today – making the bank Delaware's second-largest private employer behind Christiana Care.\n\n\"Our firm is extremely appreciative of the supportive business climate in Delaware, and that’s a big reason why we have chosen to expand and invest here,\" spokesman Paul Hartwick said. \"We have grown significantly in Delaware over the last five years, and we believe the broader community has benefitted from our growth and investments.\"\n\nLast year, JPMorgan hit record profits of $24.4 billion. Delaware’s operating budget, by comparison, is $3.9 billion.\n\nCiting those massive profits, the Delaware Coalition for Open Government asked the bank to withdraw its most recent application for state support.\n\n“We don’t have a problem with the Strategic Fund in general,” spokesman John Flaherty said. “Our issue is that it’s used to subsidize financial institutions that obviously don’t need these grants.”\n\nAmazon in 2011 received nearly $3.5 million in state incentives, along with a 10-year municipal tax break, to support its 1.2-million-square-foot distribution center in Middletown. The deal was tied to the creation of 850 jobs. Amazon, which recorded $596 million in 2015 profits, does not release specific hiring numbers, but is believed to have roughly 2,500 workers at its Middletown plant today.\n\nJPMorgan Chase adding 1,800 jobs\n\nDuPont and the Dow Chemical Co. are now poised to collect $21 million in state and county grants over the next five years as an enticement for keeping their post-merger agriculture unit in Delaware.\n\nDuPont earned nearly $2 billion in profits in 2015, while Dow raked in nearly $11 billion.\n\nWhaley said closing those incentives off to major corporations would mean closing the state off to the jobs they bring.\n\nDEDO's active portfolio – deals in which benchmarks are still being monitored – has disbursed $92.1 million, with $39.5 million left to be distributed.\n\nTo date, those payouts to 500 businesses have led to the creation and retention of nearly 32,300 jobs – about 6,500 more than were promised, the agency says. That's a working population similar in size to the entire population of Newark at an average cost to taxpayers of about $2,850 per job.\n\n“[Markell] has discussed with other governors their mutual dislike of employment incentives,” Whaley said. “But as long as there are states that give these kinds of incentives, then Delaware must do so.”\n\nSome might call that corporate welfare.\n\nJohn Stapleford, who heads the libertarian-minded Caesar Rodney Institute, likens it more to bribes and ransom.\n\nBut even he concedes state incentives are so widespread that they now amount to the cost of doing business.\n\n“States are caught between a rock and a hard place,” he said.\n\n“It’s chump change to these companies, but if you don’t throw something on the table, it looks like you don’t care and that could kill a deal.”\n\nThe state of economic development\n\nEconomic development incentives are nothing new and their use extends well beyond Delaware.\n\n“Some use more and some use less, but I can’t think of any states that don’t use them at all,” said Bartik, who has authored several research papers on the topic. “It’s not even a liberal or conservative issue at this point.”\n\nBlue states like New York and New Jersey offer some of the biggest incentives, along with red states like Texas and Louisiana.\n\nEven states that once avoided using incentives have been lured in by the promise of jobs.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, created its first grant program tied to job creation in 2013. The program, capped at $2 million per award, committed to more than $13 million in grants the first year as part of an effort to create nearly 1,400 jobs at 26 businesses, according to media reports.\n\nSince Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval took office in 2011, Nevada has twice broken its record for incentives, packages that rely on targeted tax breaks instead of grants. More recently, Nevada approved a 20-year, $1.2 billion package in 2014 to land a Tesla battery factory, plus a $43 million deal to buy an existing road through a private industrial center.\n\nAt least 10 states have approved economic development packages of $1 billion or more, according to Good Jobs First, a labor-backed nonprofit that analyzes tax incentives.\n\nInside Nevada's $1.25 billion Tesla tax deal\n\n“Most of these things got started back when the South was attempting to attract industry after World War II,” Bartik said. “It then intensified with each economic downturn through the '70s, '80s and '90s.”\n\nDelaware’s Strategic Fund dates back to the mid-1990s under then-Gov. Tom Carper.\n\nAt the time, Playtex Products was being courted to relocate its Dover tampon manufacturing plant to Richmond, Virginia, by a promise of $6 million in incentives.\n\nDelaware’s economic development director recommended the state counter with a $3 million cash payment to the company.\n\nNow known as Edgewell Personal Care, the plant is still operating in Dover, where the company employs about 500 workers.\n\nAnother 250 new jobs are expected to be added at the site by 2017 thanks to its consolidation with a Montreal plant – a move facilitated by a $3 million Strategic Fund grant approved last year.\n\nA risky game\n\nLike most states, Delaware’s track record with high-dollar grants and loans for major corporations has been spotty, at best.\n\nThe First State’s most notorious bust came in the form of a $12.5 million loan and a $9 million grant to Fisker Automotive, marking the third-largest Strategic Fund outlay under Markell.\n\nAt the time, the California-based electric car maker was planning to build its Atlantic automobile line at General Motors’ shuttered Boxwood Road plant near Newport, a project that promised to bring more than 2,000 jobs.\n\nLevin: Fisker could return to Delaware\n\nFisker never built a car in Delaware.\n\nMonths of missteps cost the company access to a federal loan, leading the car maker to file for bankruptcy protection in 2013.\n\nOnly a small amount of the state’s money was returned.\n\nMore recently, Bloom Energy has come under fire for missing hiring benchmarks the company agreed to in 2012 when it received a $16.5 million grant tied to the creation of 900 jobs at its Newark manufacturing plant.\n\nBloom Energy, which relies on revenue from Delmarva Power surcharges, has blamed its slow growth on regulatory hurdles.\n\nDEDO has given Bloom until 2017 to make up any hiring shortfalls before being required to repay the state grant.\n\nDEDO also extended the deadline for specialty chemical maker Ashland to reach employment benchmarks set in 2012 when the state committed $10 million in grants tied to the creation and retention of 800 jobs.\n\nSince then, Ashland has sold its Delaware-based water technologies unit and paid back the roughly $334,800 received from the state.\n\nDEDO, meanwhile, extended $1.1 million in grants last year to Solenis, the new name of the Ashland spinout.\n\n“The truth is those examples are all pretty typical,” said Jonathan Justice, a public policy professor at UD. “Everyone has similar success or failure rates when it comes to these incentives and I don’t see anything that would suggest Delaware’s record is any worse than other states.”\n\nA questionable practice\n\nA mounting body of evidence indicates few, if any, of the incentives offered by states are achieving their goals.\n\n“The latest studies suggest the probability of these packages being the decisive factor in where a company locates is about 5 to 10 percent,” Bartik said.\n\nA state’s business climate, tax codes, regulatory structure, labor force and education systems are given considerably more weight by companies looking to move or grow their business operations, he said.\n\n“There are much bigger reasons why a company chooses where to locate and it ain’t $10 million to $20 million in one-time money,” Singleton said. “It would be a real embarrassment if these executives had to explain to their shareholders why they stayed or moved to a state and the answer was because they bribed you.”\n\nSingleton, who served as chief of staff to Wilmington’s mayor William T. McLaughlin from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, recently penned a column in The News Journal lamenting his role in helping to create what he says has become an incentive “monster.”\n\nThe city’s incentive program pre-dates the state's, beginning in 1977 with a loan to the developers of a Doubletree Hotel, followed years later with a deal to keep Hercules Inc. in downtown Wilmington.\n\n“Back then, incentives were a difference-maker because they weren’t available everywhere,” he said. “Now it’s an arms race with every state and most cities offering bigger and bigger deals because no one wants to call these corporations on their bluff.”\n\nA 2013 report by Good Jobs First found both the number of so-called “megadeals” – packages valued at more than $75 million – doubled nationwide in six years.\n\nCarper, for instance, used a $40.7 million package of grants and tax credits, along with $70 million in road improvements to convince the newly formed AstraZeneca to establish its North American headquarters in Fairfax in 1999. In exchange, AstraZeneca pledged to increase its workforce at the site from 2,400 to 4,000 by 2004.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company's employment hit a peak of 5,000 workers in 2005, only to have patent losses and a global recession lead to a major restructuring. Today, AstraZeneca has about 2,400 workers in Delaware.\n\nBut the sheer size of those \"megadeal\" incentives makes it increasingly unlikely states will recoup their investments through future property and payroll tax revenue.\n\n“The problem is states tend to overbid on these projects,” Bartik said. “It’s easier to explain why they paid so much to win a company than to explain why they didn’t after losing out to another state.”\n\nAn incentive for reform\n\nConcerns over whether ballooning incentive payouts are justified – and actually creating the jobs they promise – have led many states, including Delaware, to re-examine their programs.\n\nSome have started cutting back on incentives, imposing stricter accountability measures and responding to calls for increased transparency.\n\n“Some places don’t have any guidelines for achieving a return on investment,” Bartik said. “If there aren’t any rules, how can you have any limits?”\n\nA 2014 report by Good Jobs First ranked Delaware and three other states among the worst in terms of providing taxpayers with details about their economic development incentives.\n\nFor Delaware, $200M in corporate giveaways, little transparency\n\nDelaware offers virtually no reports of actual job creation numbers online and no independent evaluations are conducted to determine the state’s return on investment.\n\nThose issues helped lead the General Assembly’s Joint Sunset committee to review DEDO’s performance over objections from the Markell administration.\n\nThat 2015 review resulted in passage of a bill, later signed by the governor, that made small changes to DEDO’s reporting requirements.\n\nThe legislation required new annual reports on the incentives provided and jobs promised, but not actual jobs created. The first of those reports was released in December.\n\nThe measure also requires DEDO to develop a five-year comprehensive plan that details actual job creation and return on investment, along with the office’s strategies and objectives related to specific business sectors.\n\nThe first of those plans is due in 2019 – two years after Markell leaves office.\n\nDelaware jobs grants get more transparency\n\nThe governor, in recent years, also has cut funding for the Strategic Fund.\n\nMarkell in 2015 set aside $10 million to cover incentives for the fiscal year that began July 1, a 48 percent cut from the previous year. And his budget proposal for the coming fiscal year would hold the funding at the same amount.\n\nDespite questions of their true effectiveness, Whaley said Delaware’s use of incentives has been successful because it pursues the biggest bang for the buck.\n\n“We are competing against 49 other states, many of which have more resources than we do and are willing to spend more per capita than we do,” she said. “In order to maximize our chances of success, we have to be willing to compete for jobs from big and small companies.”\n\nNo end in sight\n\nWhile the use of incentives may be a factor in that job creation, it’s also possible investing those funds in other areas would pay larger dividends, Bartik said.\n\nA portion of the incentive package offered to DuPont and Dow, for example, includes $3.6 million in grants to support the creation of 400 jobs.\n\n“You could achieve the same magnitude by offering 200 small businesses $1,800 a year for the next five years to each add two new jobs,” he said. “The state investment would be the same but that kind of money would certainly be more impactful to those companies.”\n\nLeaders in the state’s bioscience industry called for exactly those kind of investments last year.\n\n“If your focus is on high-paying jobs that tend to more broadly support the locally economy, there are also other investments you could be making,” he said. “Customized job training, business incubators or simply investing in education, in the long run, would make a state more attract to employers.”\n\nThe problem, he said, is that no state wants to take the risk of giving up its economic incentive programs.\n\n“Once you’ve started down that road, how do you turn back,” he asked. “In the [European Union], these kinds of incentives are illegal, but it would take federal legislation to put a stop to it here, and I don’t see that happening any time soon.”\n\nStates now have little choice other than to keep playing a game everyone knows is flawed, Butkiewicz said.\n\n“If everyone stopped, it wouldn’t have any impact on the overall economy because companies would still move,” he said. “But if Delaware stopped on its own, I imagine it would lose out on every one of those deals.”\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/ud/2018/08/28/6-factors-could-make-break-delaware-football-2018/1117293002/", "title": "6 factors could make or break Delaware football in 2018", "text": "The University of Delaware opens a football season laced with promise Thursday night when Rhode Island visits.\n\nThe Blue Hens are ranked No. 15 nationally in the preseason, despite having not finished a season in the Top 25 since 2011 nor been there to start one since 2012.\n\nThe word is out that Delaware has the potential to contend for the title in FCS football’s deepest and most competitive league – the Colonial Athletic Association – and rejoin the NCAA playoffs it once frequented.\n\nThat optimism is built upon the Blue Hens’ experience, last year’s best-in-six-years 7-4 finish and second-year coach Danny Rocco’s reputation as a winner. Rocco is 97-46 in a dozen previous seasons at Liberty, Richmond and Delaware.\n\nBut status is truly earned only through performance on the field. Here are six factors – three of each – that could make or break the Blue Hens in 2018.\n\nMAKE\n\nThat defense. There is no limit to its potential nor its aspirations.\n\n“I know this defense won’t stop until we can consider ourselves one of the best in the country,” said fifth-year senior safety Malcolm Brown, who was named a team captain Tuesday along with quarterback Pat Kehoe, joining spring electees Charles Bell, Troy Reeder and Joe Walker.\n\nReeder and fellow senior safety Nasir Adderley have drawn NFL scouts to practice almost daily.\n\nThe linebacker corps alone – with sophomore Colby Reeder and senior Ray Jones flanking Bell and Troy Reeder – may be peerless. But the secondary also features a returning starter at one cornerback in Nijuel Hill and a senior, Tenny Adewusi, at the other, along with Adderley and Brown.\n\nUp front, the Blue Hens have bolstered a unit depleted by graduation with the addition of FBS transfers Frank Burton (Ball State) and Caleb Ashworth (Cincinnati), the return of Cam Kitchen from a foot injury and the contributions of versatile senior Armen Ware, long one of the Blue Hens’ unsung heroes on defense.\n\nDelaware was 10th nationally last year in scoring defense (16.8 points per game allowed), 10th in turnover margin (plus-one), 15th in total defense (305.5 yards per game), 18th in passing efficiency defense and 29th in rushing defense (126.2 ypg).\n\nThose are statistics on which the Blue Hens could actually improve.\n\nBREAK\n\nInjuries are the unpredictable factor that can cripple a football team.\n\nSometimes they come in bunches, such as the first week of preseason camp when Delaware had seven defensive linemen out (four have returned and the other two will). Sometimes they don’t come at all.\n\nDelaware once had back-to-back seasons in which it had injuries at virtually every position one year and then lost just one starter the next.\n\nThe Blue Hens’ defense could handle a few losses to injuries. It was fortunate last year that, when Bell and Kitchen suffered season-ending injuries in game No. 4 against James Madison, seniors Jalen Kindle and John Nassib stepped right in and were very good.\n\nDelaware has less experience in its defensive depth this year, particularly at linebacker, where three of the four back-ups are freshmen. Certainly, Delaware has some talented young players, but the Hens would rather not have to call on them full-time yet.\n\nMAKE\n\nDelaware has some serious potential weapons on offense.\n\nA few of those NFL scouts who’ve come to take a peek at Reeder and Adderley have had their attention grabbed by wideouts Walker, the converted quarterback, and Jamie Jarmon, the senior who returned to football after three years as a minor-league baseball player. Each has the athletic tools to give Delaware big-play potential, as does the Blue Hens’ third receiver, Vinny Papale.\n\nDelaware is so fond of its running backs that it listed four on the two-deep – Kani Kane, Khory Spruill, Kareem Williams and the lone newcomer, DeJoun Lee. Each will want to make the most of his chances.\n\nRocco also loves to make use of his tight ends, and the group led by 6-foot-6 senior Charles Scarff also has loads of potential.\n\nBREAK\n\nKehoe, a third-stringer the last two years, won the quarterback job because he proved more adept at passing the football to those guys within the structure of the UD offense.\n\nHe has to be able to carry that from practice to games, which is a considerable difference, having never thrown a pass in a college game before, especially with two quarterbacks behind him – J.P. Caruso and Darius Wade – who have.\n\nDelaware’s inconsistency moving the football in the air, whether in an effort to balance out the running game or fight from behind, has often been its primary downfall the past several years. It cannot let the Hens down again.\n\nLikewise, the offensive line, with depth and talent that Rocco has complimented, needs to be formidable in giving Kehoe every chance to be the quarterback coaches foresee. It’s also incumbent upon offensive coordinator Matt Simon and his staff, which has a great wild card in former QB Walker, to create and call the right plays.\n\nMAKE\n\nThat defense has players who’ve started an astounding 166 games at Delaware, and 13 more at other places if you count Troy Reeder’s 11 at Penn State and Ashworth’s two with the Bearcats.\n\nWhile the offense can’t match that, it’s also a proven unit, with Kehoe, sophomore left tackle David Kroll and junior center Collin Wallish the only first-time starters.\n\nNot surprisingly, Delaware’s most successful football seasons have been those in which it had the biggest senior cast and the best veteran leadership, and this group has both. That’s a sturdy foundation upon which to build a memorable season.\n\nBREAK\n\nDelaware certainly has the experience of playing, but it doesn’t have the know-how of winning.\n\nThat’s what made last year encouraging but, at the same time, so discouraging to fans.\n\nDelaware scored tremendous wins over nationally ranked Stony Brook 24-20 and Richmond 42-35 in overtime, putting itself in position to make a run at an NCAA playoff spot. A 31-17 win at Maine was no picnic either.\n\nYet the Blue Hens stumbled against two of their biggest rivals, losing at Towson 18-17 and, in particularly stunning fashion, 28-7 at Villanova in the season’s final four weeks. Towson and Villanova were 5-6 teams.\n\nWinning is an acquired habit the Blue Hens have yet to procure.\n\nOn Thursday, Delaware's first of 11 games arrives. What the Blue Hens really want, need and have the potential to do is to play at least a dozen.\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

The Blue Hens lost to James Madison and Towson while the Wildcats fell against JMU, Stony Brook and Albany, the latter a 15-0 defeat Saturday one week after the Hens handled the Great Danes 22-3 at Delaware Stadium.\n\nDelaware was also above New Hampshire in the computer-generated Jeff Sagarin Ratings, had a better strength of schedule and was ranked 21st to UNH’s 31st in the NCAA’s Simple Ratings System, similar to the Ratings Percentage Index used in basketball and other sports.\n\n“We were, without a doubt, the fourth team in our league,” said Rocco, referring to other CAA qualifiers JMU, Stony Brook and Elon. “There was no statistical data that would have supported a thought that there was a fourth team more worthy, so I really have struggled with that.”\n\nWofford athletic director and FCS selection committee chairman Richard Johnson, in a telephone interview with The News Journal, pointed out the Blue Hens’ blemishes in comparison to UNH.\n\n“They didn’t have an FBS win,” Johnson said, referring to the Hens’ 27-0 loss Sept. 9 at Virginia Tech, a Top 25 team then and now.\n\n“The two losses they had were to teams just recently that did not have winning records and that hurt them. In our RACs [regional advisory committees] they were a little bit below the teams in the field that made it. That’s not the determinant. That’s a factor that we look at.”\n\nMost would agree Delaware’s losses at Towson 18-17 on Oct. 28 and Villanova 28-7 on Saturday were inexcusable for a team with tournament aspirations. But when Rocco learned late Saturday afternoon New Hampshire had also lost at Albany, his first thought was, he said Sunday, “We are back in this thing.” Numerous other losses by tournament hopefuls had put Delaware squarely on the bubble for tourney selection.\n\nBut the committee preferred UNH, giving significant weight to its 22-12 win at Georgia Southern on Sept. 9. The Statesmen, members of the Sun Belt Conference, got their first win 52-0 Saturday against South Alabama. South Dakota and Nicholls State were actually the final two teams to get in and Austin Peay and Delaware were the first two out, Johnson said.\n\nIronically, last year Albany had a 7-4 record and wins over UNH and FBS Buffalo but didn’t make the field.\n\n“They had an FBS win over Georgia Southern,” Johnson said of this year’s Wildcats, “and then, on top of that, they beat Elon when Elon was number six in our rankings, so it literally comes down to those differences.”\n\nNew Hampshire handed Elon its first CAA loss 16-6 on Nov. 11, with Elon subsequently losing to JMU and finishing third in the league behind the Dukes and Stony Brook, which didn’t play JMU or Elon.\n\nAsked about Delaware’s superior record against common foes, Johnson, oddly, replied, “Delaware didn’t play Elon or UNH, so that conference record is skewed in that regard.\n\n“We don’t look at Sagarin,” Johnson added. “We do look at the Simple Ratings System, but Simple Ratings is one tool in the tool box. If you look at UNH, they had an FBS win. Their quality win over Elon was, at that time, a better quality win than the one Delaware had over Stony Brook.”\n\nDelaware won 24-20 at Stony Brook on Oct. 7. Stony Brook ended up ahead of Elon in the CAA standings, Sagarin Ratings and the Simple Ratings System.\n\nThe committee’s failure to place greater emphasis on the Simple Ratings System baffled Rocco.\n\nFor leagues that had multiple bids, FCS selectors followed SRS rankings in choosing Missouri Valley, Southern and Big Sky conference teams for the NCAA playoffs. For the Southland, they did until opting for Nicholls State, which was 28th, over McNeese State, which was 19th. But Nicholls beat McNeese.\n\nAmong CAA schools, however, Delaware was 21st in the SRS to UNH’s 31st. Richmond (6-5) was actually ahead of UNH, too, at 25th.\n\n“In what world are you living in where that is an acceptable reality?” said Rocco.\n\nA week after winning at Georgia Southern, New Hampshire lost 51-26 at Holy Cross, a fact that seemed to have been ignored by selectors.\n\nHoly Cross went 4-7 overall and 3-3 in the Patriot League, whose champion, Lehigh, finished an unsightly 5-6.\n\nAthletic directors Marty Scarano of New Hampshire and Nathan Pine of Holy Cross both serve on the selection committee.\n\n“Marty has been as objective a committee member as we’ve had,” Johnson said, adding that members whose schools are being discussed must leave the room. “ . . . Nobody was voting New Hampshire because of Marty. They voted based on the criteria we have in that manual and how those teams fit into that.”\n\nDelaware and New Hampshire were competing with a bunch of other 7-4 teams that also lost Saturday for at-large spots, including South Dakota, Furman, Northern Arizona, Montana, plus 9-2 Monmouth that lost Saturday and Nicholls State that fell Thursday to finish 8-3.\n\nJohnson referred to it as “The Saturday Massacre.”\n\n“Everybody got beat,” he said. “It muddied the waters, made everything even that much harder. I’ve been on this committee for five years and this was, by far, not even close, to being the toughest one ever,” Johnson said.\n\nTwo Saturday winners -- Eastern Washington (7-4) and Austin Peay (8-4) -- were also viewed as candidates.\n\nIn addition to UNH, teams among the aforementioned that made the field were Northern Arizona, South Dakota, Furman, Monmouth and Nicholls State.\n\n“When I came in Sunday morning,” Rocco said, “and I did all the research, there was nothing that would lead me to think that we would not be in the field. The CAA merits four teams.”\n\nThe CAA got its quartet, but Delaware wasn’t one-fourth.\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Their full answers were sent in emails and appear in their entirety below.\n\nSean Barney:\n\nQ: Is gun violence a problem in the nation that can be addressed through legislation? If yes, should that legislation be at the federal level, the state level or both? If no, what is the solution you see that best reduces the frequency of gun violence episodes? What do you think gun laws should be?\n\nA: When I was policy director to our [Gov. Jack Markell], we passed a smart package of gun safety measures that closed longstanding loopholes in our gun laws here in Delaware. But state laws alone won’t fix the problem because most firearms used in crimes come from out of state.\n\nThat is why I am the only candidate in this race to have prepared a comprehensive policy proposal for addressing gun violence at the federal level. My plan would require universal background checks, ban military-style assault weapons, make gun trafficking a federal offense, and close loopholes to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and terrorists. We also need to address the root causes of violence, which is why my plan calls for support for a new and comprehensive youth violence reduction partnership in Delaware, drawing on examples from successful programs in cities like Philadelphia and Richmond, CA. You can read my full online at seanbarneyforcongress.com/AddressingGunViolence or by texting the word “Sean” to 86329.\n\nQ: Why would a Congressman or Congresswoman from Delaware be a good voice to add to the national debate about gun violence? What is your personal connection to the issue? Are you a gun owner, and what is your personal experience handling/purchasing firearms? What is your standing with the NRA?\n\nA: As someone who survived being shot through the neck, the issue of gun violence is personal to me. But while I volunteered to join the Marines – knowing full well the danger that might entail – no one volunteers to have their neighborhood turned into a war zone.\n\nThe NRA can’t accuse me of being weak on guns. I shot guns for sport as a boy, I became a marksman in boot camp in preparation to serve my company, I’ve been shot at, and I’ve been shot. I know the difference between a gun designed for hunting or personal protection, and one designed to inflict the greatest amount of damage possible. I have the credibility that’s required to accomplish common sense reform.\n\nQ: What are the failures/successes on a national and state level in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre? What should national/state gun laws look like today, and can you point to a specific vote or bill in Congress you’d have supported/opposed which demonstrates your point of view?\n\nA: I’m proud that when I was policy director to Governor Markell, we responded to the tragedy at Sandy Hook by passing common sense gun violence legislation here in Delaware. But 61% of guns seized by Delaware law enforcement come from out of state. That’s why we need action on the federal level and why I’m the only candidate in this race to put out a comprehensive policy proposal to address gun violence.\n\nMy comprehensive gun violence proposal is much too long to relate here, but you can read it in full online at seanbarneyforcongress.com/AddressingGunViolence or by texting the word “Sean” to 86329. As one specific example, I would join Senator Carper and Senator Coons in advocating for legislation like the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, which would prohibit those on the Federal Terrorism Watchlist from buying firearms or explosives.\n\nQ:Are Americans numb to violence? Is there a culture changes that has to take place, and what would that shift look like in terms of laws, public action and education? Are episodes of mass violence the “new normal,” and would citizens be safer with more or less access to firearms?\n\nA: Too many in Washington have become numb to the senseless violence sweeping our nation. Weapons that are built for Marines fighting overseas have no place on the streets of Wilmington, and news headlines that sound like a dispatch from a reporter embedded with a platoon in Fallujuh should not be coming out of places like Newtown, Aurora, or Santa Barbara.\n\nThat’s why we need leaders with credibility on this issue and a proven track record of getting the job done. As someone who has handled firearms, who has been shot at, and who has been shot through the neck while serving my country in Iraq, I have the credibility needed to get Washington working again.\n\nQ: If you were sitting in Congress, what do you believe your role could/would be on the issue of gun violence? Where does it fit into your list of priorities? Is this a partisan issue? How can you make a difference?\n\nA: I will make addressing gun violence in Delaware and across our nation a top priority in Congress. No one ever asked us in the Marines if we were Democrats or Republicans; they just expected us to work together to get the job done for the good of the country. That’s the attitude I’ll take when tackling this issue. As someone who has handled guns, both for sport and in service of my country, and as someone who has been shot, I have the credibility needed to break the gridlock in Washington and get results. We did it at the state level when I was policy director to Governor Markell and I will fight to get results at the federal level when I am elected to Congress.\n\nRose Izzo (responses sent through campaign spokesman Kevin Izzo):\n\nThe Izzo campaign did not answer The News Journal's questions in a format which designated answers for particular questions. Her camp's full response to the five questions is as follows:\n\nUnfortunately the gun issue is driven by lobbyists, special interests and yellow journalism.\n\nAverage citizens, like Rose Izzo and her neighbors are concerned with national security, securing our borders, job opportunity for Americans and supporting our military and veterans.\n\nAs the first Congresswoman elected in the state of Delaware, Rose Izzo's focus will be on the needs of our citizens, not lobbyists and political sugar daddies.\n\nGrandstanding on poll tested issues is no solution for Delaware.\n\nRose Izzo's solution: A job that pays a living wage.\n\nRose Izzo understand how hard it is to live on a small income and the fear that there is more money going out than there is coming in. This is why Rose Izzo is in favor of better jobs with higher wages, and the quality education needed to improve our economy.\n\nRose Izzo is very familiar with the safe handling and operation of home protection devices.\n\nNicknamed \"Pistol Packing Rosie\", Rose Izzo had the honor of receiving special training using high capacity handguns and semiautomatic rifles.\n\nCare for our veterans & military personnel trump meaningless gun legislation everyday.\n\nIt's on record that retuning Wounded Warriors are unemployed, homeless, hungry and suicidal.\n\nLet's help them first, before flushing our second amendment down the toilet.\n\nMike Miller:\n\nQ: Is gun violence a problem in the nation that can be addressed through legislation? If yes, should that legislation be at the federal level, the state level or both? If no, what is the solution you see that best reduces the frequency of gun violence episodes? What do you think gun laws should be?\n\nA: Yes I believe gun violence is a problem in our nation, legislation should be enacted at the federal level with a mandate to state and local levels. Federal, State, and local government has to work hand and hand to implement and solve this issue.\n\nQ: Why would a Congressman or Congresswoman from Delaware be a good voice to add to the national debate about gun violence? What is your personal connection to the issue? Are you a gun owner, and what is your personal experience handling/purchasing firearms? What is your standing with the NRA?\n\nA: We need a congressman who will take a practical approach to solve gun control, I believe there are to many men and woman in congress who are worried about upsetting the apple cart, (the NRA) or losing there house of representative or senate seat. Over half of them are afraid they might lose there campaign contribution. I do not own any guns, rifles, automatic weapons or assault rifles. Not sure what standing I would have with the NRA.\n\nQ: What are the failures/successes on a national and state level in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre? What should national/state gun laws look like today, and can you point to a specific vote or bill in Congress you’d have supported/opposed which demonstrates your point of view?\n\nA: Some Americans think you are trying to take there guns, this is not the case, when the Second Amendment came about our fore fathers did not think about assault rifles, ak 47's, machine guns. There primary focus was to give you the right to bear arms and protect yourself and your family. The weapons that existed then was muskets, hand guns and other various weapons. This Amendment right was not for todays laws and weapons. The success is, I believe the American people are beginning to realize that something has to be done, and now there is some type of dialog.\n\nQ:Are Americans numb to violence? Is there a culture changes that has to take place, and what would that shift look like in terms of laws, public action and education? Are episodes of mass violence the “new normal,” and would citizens be safer with more or less access to firearms?\n\nA: No Americans are not numb to violence. Episodes of mass violence is not the new normal, at least I pray not.\n\nQ: If you were sitting in Congress, what do you believe your role could/would be on the issue of gun violence? Where does it fit into your list of priorities? Is this a partisan issue? How can you make a difference?\n\nA: We need real comprehensive reform on gun control and take a hard relook at what the second amendment guarantees us. I am for a ban on assault rifles and machine guns, you may own 1 assault rifle but not 2,3,4 or 5. This is a partisan issue. This is priority of mine and ranks in my top\n\nHans Reigle:\n\nQ: Is gun violence a problem in the nation that can be addressed through legislation? If yes, should that legislation be at the federal level, the state level or both? If no, what is the solution you see that best reduces the frequency of gun violence episodes? What do you think gun laws should be?\n\nA: Law abiding citizens are able to own firearms for protection and sport in accordance with the Second Amendment. Since 2007, the number of concealed handgun permits has risen and yet murder rates have fallen. In Congress, I would support H.R. 923-The Constitutional Concealed Reciprocity Act of 2015, allowing interstate handgun permits.\n\nQ: Why would a Congressman or Congresswoman from Delaware be a good voice to add to the national debate about gun violence? What is your personal connection to the issue? Are you a gun owner, and what is your personal experience handling/purchasing firearms? What is your standing with the NRA?\n\nA: I am a military veteran with twenty years of service, so of course I have a background in handling and using firearms responsibly. I am a gun owner and a NRA member. The Second Amendment protects all other rights.\n\nQ: What are the failures/successes on a national and state level in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre? What should national/state gun laws look like today, and can you point to a specific vote or bill in Congress you’d have supported/opposed which demonstrates your point of view?\n\nA: Our nation is blessed with many retired military veterans and police officers. They can and should be used in our schools for protection. We have school resource officers and more would be beneficial. An armed teacher or school resource officer could have potentially reduced the number of victims at Sandy Hook. Gun free zones are places where criminals go to shoot people. Sandy Hook and other similar tragedies are also stark evidence that our mental health system is underfunded, understaffed and totally inadequate for today’s complex world. We must also be careful to not characterize terrorist acts (San Bernardino, Fort Hood) as random mass killings.\n\nQ: Are Americans numb to violence? Is there a culture changes that has to take place, and what would that shift look like in terms of laws, public action and education? Are episodes of mass violence the “new normal,” and would citizens be safer with more or less access to firearms?\n\nA: Americans are never numb to violence. This is a particular problem in Delaware where Wilmington has one of highest murder rates in the nation. Often, these crimes go unsolved and this is a terrible burden on the victim’s family. Crimes committed with illegally obtained firearms (and those prohibited from owning a firearm) should be prosecuted and those charges should not be pled down. Additionally, drug dealers with weapons should be prosecuted and low level drug offenders referred to treatment.\n\nQ: If you were sitting in Congress, what do you believe your role could/would be on the issue of gun violence? Where does it fit into your list of priorities? Is this a partisan issue? How can you make a difference?\n\nA: The gun violence issue needs to be de-politicized. It is a concern to everyone. We all agree that mental illness is a major factor in all of the mass shootings. Families need to have resources so that they can report and manage individuals that they know are struggling. Too many times we learn that everyone knew that the person had a problem but there was no one to help. As a Congressman I would support H.R. 2646 –Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015. This bill allows the protected health information of an individual with a serious mental illness to be disclosed to a caregiver under certain conditions. This Act could save many lives.\n\nLisa Blunt Rochester:\n\nQ: Is gun violence a problem in the nation that can be addressed through legislation? If yes, should that legislation be at the federal level, the state level or both? If no, what is the solution you see that best reduces the frequency of gun violence episodes? What do you think gun laws should be?\n\nA: Addressing gun violence requires local, state and federal involvement. But government action alone is not the answer. We need to be having conversations with our families and communities about suicide prevention and the dangers of gun violence. And maybe most importantly, we need to call this what it is: an epidemic. Over 30,000 Americans die each year from gun violence. To put that in perspective, approximately 40,000 women will die of breast cancer this year in America. And look at the focus, resources, team work and attention that has coalesced, rightly so, around eradicating that disease.\n\nWe need to figure out long-term solutions to gun violence by putting much tougher restrictions on who can own a gun and what those guns can do. Any long-term solution needs to be a mix of legislation and educating our culture that gun violence can be prevented.\n\nBut, right now, we need to quickly close loopholes that allow criminals to get their hands on guns with ease, increase background checks on everyone who wants to purchase a gun, mandatory reporting for lost and stolen guns, increased funding for mental health treatment and protections for women against abusers and stalkers with guns - including clear relinquishment procedures for gun owners who are later deemed prohibited for whatever reason. I also think it’s irresponsible to prevent government institutions like the CDC from properly studying the root causes of gun violence and understanding the full impact of our current gun policies. We need to address gun violence prevention with the same tools that we would tackle any other serious health problem.\n\nWhile we're at it, we also should address the role of suicides in gun fatalities by making mental healthcare a priority and working to identify and deliver care to people suffering from mental health conditions. Two-thirds of people in this country who die from guns die by suicide. To quote President Obama when he highlighted this recently, \"Our work is to prevent people from hurting themselves.\"\n\nQ: Why would a Congressman or Congresswoman from Delaware be a good voice to add to the national debate about gun violence? What is your personal connection to the issue? Are you a gun owner, and what is your personal experience handling/purchasing firearms? What is your standing with the NRA?\n\nAs a mother of two, I worry about gun violence more than I ever should. The NRA has spent millions of dollars scaring politicians in Washington into inaction. Their money has bought them votes and left far too many families attending funerals instead of graduations. I’m running to stand up to the radicals who are putting campaign contributions above the lives of our children.\n\nSixty-one percent of guns confiscated in Delaware from 2010-2014 came from other states. Trafficking is a real problem that impacts Delaware disproportionately considering our location along the I-95 corridor, otherwise known as the \"iron pipeline\" for guns. It’s a national problem and requires federal legislation in order to be properly addressed.\n\n\n\nQ: What are the failures/successes on a national and state level in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre? What should national/state gun laws look like today, and can you point to a specific vote or bill in Congress you’d have supported/opposed which demonstrates your point of view?\n\nA: After the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary, the country looked to Congress for a response and something extraordinary happened: nothing at all. Republicans in Congress’ inaction during this time was criminal. In the wake of utter failure in Washington, many states have made progress including Delaware.\n\nIt's not politics as usual to praise one's opponents during the course of a campaign, but recently I publicly praised Sean Barney for his plan to reduce gun violence. In addition to Sean's plan, I support doing more to address the role of suicides as stated above. Beau Biden championed legislation in 2013 that would’ve made it harder for the dangerously mentally ill to purchase guns. That bill, HB 88, unfortunately failed. Nearly every member of the State House voted for Beau’s legislation. If elected, I will champion similar legislation in Congress.\n\nIn addition, Delaware does not prohibit the sale or transfer of military-style assault weapons or large-capacity ammunition magazines. In past Congresses, I would have voted to extend the Assault Weapons Ban and supported any legislation to ensure that thorough federal background checks are in place for gun purchases and to close loopholes like the gun show loophole at the federal level. In our current Congress, I would’ve supported legislation like the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act that would prohibit the sale of firearms to people convicted of stalking or those under a restraining order.\n\nQ: Are Americans numb to violence? Is there a culture changes that has to take place, and what would that shift look like in terms of laws, public action and education? Are episodes of mass violence the “new normal,” and would citizens be safer with more or less access to firearms?\n\nA: As I’ve talked to families up and down the state who’ve lost family members and friends, I can tell you we are not numb to gun violence. And there are definite changes that we need to make in our culture along with tougher restrictions on gun ownership and gun trafficking. As a mother, the sheer fact that some consider mass violence a “new normal” is both appalling and sad to me. Our children deserve to grow up in communities where they can feel safe.\n\nIf you were sitting in Congress, what do you believe your role could/would be on the issue of gun violence? Where does it fit into your list of priorities? Is this a partisan issue? How can you make a difference?\n\nA: Gun violence isn't simply a partisan issue. It knows no bounds. Americans agree with common sense solutions to gun violence – yet the gun lobby and their allies in Congress continue to stonewall progress and accomplishing anything can seem impossible at times. We need to honor the American spirit of compromise and bring people together towards results-oriented action in Washington. I will be a strong voice for common sense gun violence prevention in Congress.\n\nBryan Townsend:\n\nQ: Is gun violence a problem in the nation that can be addressed through legislation? If yes, should that legislation be at the federal level, the state level or both? If no, what is the solution you see that best reduces the frequency of gun violence episodes? What do you think gun laws should be?\n\nA: Gun violence has reached epidemic proportions in this country, but I firmly believe bold legislative action is part of the solution to reversing this troubling trend. When we research diseases like cancer, we do so knowing full well that we won't instantly thwart all cancer deaths. But we do it anyway, because we know that over the long term, we will make progress. In the same vein, we know strengthening our gun laws won't suddenly end gun violence or take all guns off the street. Yet over time, we can make real progress.\n\nI am proud to have worked with colleagues in Dover to close Delaware’s gun show loophole and prevent straw purchases. Majority Leader Longhurst, Rep. Osienski and I will be introducing legislation this session to close the delayed transaction loophole, to keep guns out of the hands of individuals like the South Carolina church shooter - who committed that heinous crime with a gun he purchased before the federal government had completed its background check.\n\nUnfortunately, these laws are made less effective if our neighboring states don’t enforce similar regulations. That’s why in Congress, I will fight to expand background checks on all gun purchases and demand the FBI enforce existing laws. I also support strengthening reporting requirements, and lifting the federal ban on gun violence research.\n\nBut to drastically reduce the number of Americans killed through senseless gun violence, I believe we need to do even more. We know that the majority of gun deaths in this country are a result of suicide. In Congress, I would push for additional mental health resources as well as responsible gun storage. And we know that urban gun violence cannot be solved without long-term investments in our cities and our citizens, including ensuring every child, regardless of their zip code, has access to a world class education and overcoming other systemic issues like poverty and racial bias.\n\nQ: Why would a Congressman or Congresswoman from Delaware be a good voice to add to the national debate about gun violence? What is your personal connection to the issue? Are you a gun owner, and what is your personal experience handling/purchasing firearms? What is your standing with the NRA?\n\nA: I have never been supported by the NRA and I suspect I never will be. The NRA doesn’t speak for the vast majority of gun owners, who overwhelmingly support universal background checks and other gun safety measures. Delaware is one of the only states in recent years to pass common sense, bi-partisan gun safety legislation and I was proud to be a part of those efforts. I am not a gun owner, but I also believe that's a personal decision. Gun owners are not precluded from fighting for stronger gun laws. In fact, we need their voices to advance these efforts. In Congress I will continue to work with responsible gun owners and gun safety advocates to promote common sense solutions.\n\nQ: What are the failures/successes on a national and state level in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre? What should national/state gun laws look like today, and can you point to a specific vote or bill in Congress you’d have supported/opposed which demonstrates your point of view?\n\nA: In the wake of the tragedy at Sandy Hook, our biggest failure was partisan gridlock that blocked us from enacting common sense solutions, even though they enjoyed broad popular support. The Senate filibustered a watered-down expansion of background checks. And while politicians paid lip service to the connection between mental health and gun violence, they refused to push for additional funding for mental health services and treatment. I believe Congress should look to Delaware as a model for the types of gun safety legislation that we should enact at the federal level.\n\nQ: Are Americans numb to violence? Is there a culture changes that has to take place, and what would that shift look like in terms of laws, public action and education? Are episodes of mass violence the “new normal,” and would citizens be safer with more or less access to firearms?\n\nA: Sandy Hook, in my mind, was a pivotal event, not just for the sheer horror it represented, but because Congress had a clear choice between taking meaningful action, or ushering in a new normal of gun violence in this country. I think Americans remain outraged over that, and that outrage is renewed each time we see one of these senseless mass shootings unfold on national TV. I do think we're becoming numb to the epidemic of urban gun violence, and that is shameful. We can curb mass shootings with stronger, smarter gun laws, but in order to reduce urban gun violence, we need much more comprehensive progress on the systemic things that drive violence - reducing poverty, reforming our criminal justice system, creating jobs and improving our schools.\n\nQ: If you were sitting in Congress, what do you believe your role could/would be on the issue of gun violence? Where does it fit into your list of priorities? Is this a partisan issue? How can you make a difference?\n\nA: I respect America's firearm tradition and have no interest in taking guns from lawful Americans who own them. I would hope that would be a signal to gun owners and non-owners alike who want to see less blood on our streets to coalesce around me as someone who has the legislative experience in working on common-sense gun-safety laws supported by a diverse group of stakeholders. This is a deeply emotional issue for which progress requires passion. But we also must be willing to consider pragmatic, enforceable legislation that greatly reduces gun violence, knowing we can't eliminate it overnight. We did it in Delaware, and I believe I'm the kind of problem solver who can replicate those efforts in Washington.\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 319-1855 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com.

He declined to say which cities were still in the running.Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Washington were among those that had been receiving serious consideration. Probst said earlier the USOC wanted to trim to two or three cities but wouldn’t get specific about the number on Tuesday.The last U.S. city that bid for the Olympics was Chicago, which finished last in the voting for the 2016 Games.Since then, the USOC has been on a mission to rebuild its international reputation. Among factors that point toward a successful bid are the USOC’s recent restructuring of a contentious revenue-sharing deal with the IOC, and the IOC’s recent $7.75 billion extension of its TV deal with its favorite American partner, NBC.Ex-NASCAR car owner Donlavey dies RICHMOND, Va.

It was around 2:45 p.m Tuesday, and after a months-long search, he was about to reveal one of his biggest campaign decisions to the woman who would make history.\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden called all the women who were finalists in his search for a running mate, including Sen. Tammy Duckworth and Rep. Val Demings. He talked about his decision and ultimately informed them he had chosen someone else.\n\nOn the former vice president's desk was a framed photo of the classic cartoon \"Hagar the Horrible.\" In one frame, Hagar, a disheveled Viking, says,\" Why me?!\" In the next, the gods above reply, \"Why not?\"\n\nThe tenuous and drama-filled process that left politicos and voters alike on the edge of their seats was over. He'd made his decision.\n\nHe called Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Zoom.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n\"You ready to go to work?\" Biden asked her.\n\n\"Oh my God. I am so ready to go to work,\" Harris replied.\n\n'Open and shut':Kamala Harris argues case is clear against Trump in introduction as Biden's running mate\n\nWho is Kamala Harris? A look at Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate\n\nAt 4:14 p.m., the Biden campaign broke the news in a mass text message to supporters. Harris, a first-term senator and one of his former Democratic primary opponents, was his long-awaited pick in a move elevating the first Black woman and first Asian American to a major party presidential ticket.\n\nSupporters close to Biden described a \"deliberative\" process that encompassed several weeks, 11 serious candidates, 120 hours of interviews and, eventually, one name.\n\n\"He knew exactly what he was looking for in a VP because he's been a VP,\" said Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., national co-chairman of the Biden campaign. \"He was doing an analysis of one, who he could work with; two, who could help him win; three, who could help him govern. And who he clicked with.\n\n\"I think he uses the word 'simpatico.' I think he really spent time figuring that out.\"\n\nYou have to win first:What Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris tells us about Biden\n\nWhat comes next:Joe Biden won't travel to Milwaukee for 2020 DNC because of coronavirus concerns\n\nA groundbreaking choice and a secret to keep\n\nThe selection of Harris, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, came amid increasing pressure to choose a woman of color for the Democratic ticket, particularly during a period of heightened racial polarization touched off by the death of George Floyd that triggered nationwide protests over police brutality and racism.\n\nWhile groundbreaking, the selection of Harris was also conventional, with Biden opting for Washington experience, a senator and ticket balance. Harris is 55 years old, 22 years younger than Biden, 77, and hails from the West Coast in contrast to Biden's East Coast roots.\n\nIn the hours before Biden broke the news, he called a number of close advisers and told them the secret talking heads across the country spent weeks speculating about.\n\nRichmond was one of the few. \"He was excited. I was certainly excited. And it was, 'Now let's go win.' \"\n\nOpinion:Joe Biden's VP choice of Kamala Harris signals return to American values and competence\n\nOpinion:Why Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would be a disastrous duo in the year of George Floyd\n\nRep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., whose endorsement helped turn around Biden's floundering primary campaign, was another who got the early heads-up. He said keeping the news quiet from his three daughters was difficult.\n\n\"Hopefully they'll forgive me for not letting the cat out of the bag,\" Clyburn said with a smile in a video call with reporters Tuesday.\n\nFor Harris' part, she didn't give any public indication in the days leading up to Tuesday that she knew she was Biden's pick.\n\nSouth Carolina state Rep. J.A. Moore, a supporter of Harris' primary campaign, received a call from her Sunday, but it wasn’t to talk politics, he said. Instead, she called to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to Moore's daughter, who had just turned 1.\n\n“I look at her as an auntie,” Moore said, adding that they have checked in several times since the senator ended her presidential bid.\n\nA running mate search process unlike any other\n\nMaking this vice presidential search different from others before it, Biden in March vowed to choose a woman. The vetting process was also constrained by a global pandemic, with virtual meetings replacing some that might normally occur in person.\n\nThe selection followed more than 120 hours of meetings via FaceTime between Biden's vice president selection committee co-chairs – Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., former Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Cynthia Hogan, Biden's legal counsel when he was vice president – and Democratic activists, party leaders and interests groups.\n\nThe group also met with organizations that specialize in getting women elected to office to prepare for hurdles that a male vice presidential candidate wouldn't face.\n\nFrom rival to running mate:What 'fearless fighter' Kamala Harris brings to Joe Biden's ticket\n\nSplitting into pairs, the co-chairs met virtually with an initial group of more than 20 vice presidential contenders, asking each a list of uniform questioning that included, \"What would you want your agenda to be? What do you think Trump's nickname for you will be?\"\n\nBiden's selection committee submitted their findings and assessments to Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, who played a central role. The larger list was whittled to 11 finalists, who underwent a deep vetting.\n\n\"He said: ‘I’m not looking to make a demographic or a political or a geographic choice, I’m looking for the best partner in governance. I’m looking for the right vice president,' \" Garcetti told USA TODAY, describing Biden's directions to kick off the nearly four-month search process. \"He was very clear about that.\n\n“Second, he was very protective about everybody in the process. He’s been through this himself. To have Joe Biden ask you to help him find a vice president is like Michael Jordan asking you to find a shooting guard to be alongside him.”\n\n'Do not hold grudges':Biden's notes reveal several talking points about Kamala Harris\n\nRichmond said he believes picking a woman of color went into Biden's thinking, but it wasn't the overriding consideration.\n\n\"Since George Floyd, this country has been in a real inflection point,\" Richmond said. \"I don't think that was the major factor. But did he notice she was a woman of color? Absolutely.\"\n\nAlong with Harris, Demings and Duckworth, the 11 women vetted were Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Rep. Karen Bass, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, voting rights activist Stacey Abrams, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin.\n\nAlthough Biden never eliminated any of the 11 from consideration, he zeroed in closest on Harris, Bass, Duckworth, Whitmer and Rice, with whom he had worked in the Obama administration, according to people familiar with Biden's thinking.\n\nLeading the vetting process was Bob Bauer, lead counsel for the Biden campaign, Lisa Monaco, President Barack Obama's former Homeland Security adviser, and Dana Remus, deputy White House counsel under Obama. More than a dozen attorneys worked pro bono to conduct a deep dive of the candidates and their backgrounds.\n\nBiden met with all 11 candidates – some in person, others virtually – before ultimately choosing Harris, long considered one of the front-runners for the job. Among those he met in person were Rice and Whitmer. As a whole, the search committee did not make a final recommendation to Biden, but some senior campaign officials made a strong case for Harris.\n\n\"I think there's a deep bond there – of course momentarily frayed, maybe, in the the campaign,\" Garcetti said, referring to the desegregation attacks Harris torpedoed Biden with on the debate stage last year.\n\nDuring the first Democratic debate last year, Harris went after Biden on his civil rights record and Biden touting his ability to work with Republicans, including segregationist Sens. James Eastland and Herman Talmadge. She went on to criticize his opposition to school busing in the 1970s, telling the story of a girl in California who was part of just the second integrated class in her school.\n\n\"That little girl is me,\" Harris said in a moment that went viral and was credited with helping give her a short-lived bump in the polls.\n\n\"He moved on from that the moment after it happened. I just kind of reminded him that I thought that they had that bond that, he's running because of Beau's memory, I think, as much as anything else,\" Garcetti said, referring to Biden's oldest son, who was close with Harris before his death in 2015. \"And she's the one who's the quickest route to that. That can't be (overstated).\"\n\nThe drama before Biden's announcement:Tense and teasing online moments lead up to Joe Biden's announcement on Kamala Harris\n\nLike other search committee members, Garcetti said he learned Harris was the pick from Jill Biden on Tuesday – but he had a \"strong sense\" that was the direction in the final days. The decision became clearer when he started to get phone calls from other candidates who were just told they didn't get the nod.\n\n\"I would say sometime between Monday morning and Tuesday morning is probably when he said, 'Let's go.'\"\n\nHours of interviews and deep dives into history\n\nThe process was grueling and at times emotional for the candidates, even more so for those who had not been through such rigorous vetting for a White House position, according to those who were close to the process. Candidates had to block off large portions of their schedules to go through every aspect of their public and private lives, often unable to rely solely on staff because many details are held only by the candidates themselves.\n\nSome candidates reached out to members of Biden's inner circle for informal advice as they moved through the process. A source familiar with the process said several of the candidates, including Harris, talked with Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a longtime Biden confidante. Coons would sometimes pass along noteworthy comments to the Biden campaign after those conversations, the source said, but noted Coons would typically direct the candidates to the campaign's official channels.\n\nMost of the women considered appeared to leave the process with a sense of gratitude and honor.\n\n“It was amazing to be associated with all of them, and I know that all of them share the same ceiling that I do, which is deep respect and honor as having been a part of the process,” Bass told USA TODAY.\n\n'There is no playbook':How Trump and Biden are trying to run virtual campaigns during coronavirus\n\nAfter Biden called her Tuesday afternoon with the news she was not his choice, Bass said she was excited and knew Biden would pick \"the strongest choice.\"\n\n\"I think that the vice president, having served as vice president, knows exactly who is the best person for the job, and he made that choice,\" Bass added.\n\nBaldwin said she was similarly \"excited\" about Biden's selection. In Harris, with whom she serves in the Senate, Biden had found someone who \"would be ready on Day One.\"\n\nAccording to people familiar with the candidate meetings, the selection committee was impressed with Harris' command of issues and confidence in her ability to take on Trump. Harris also \"spoke powerfully\" about her friendship with Beau Biden. The two developed a bond when Harris was attorneys general in California, and Beau Biden held the same role in Delaware. Harris' personal story, the daughter of immigrants who has experienced the \"American success story,\" resonated as well.\n\nIn the end, sources said Biden saw Harris as someone who could be a \"governing partner\" – much the way Biden saw his role with Obama. Biden felt a \"personal connection\" to Harris and saw her as experienced to serve as president if needed.\n\nClyburn said he'd talked with Biden more over the past four or five days \"than I’ve talked to him all year.\"\n\nClyburn, the House majority whip, said he and Biden spent the calls discussing the host of candidates and their potential liabilities to his campaign. That included Harris' past as a prosecutor, Clyburn said, explaining he advised Biden that many of the attacks on past careers were unfair. Some on the left have challenged Harris' persona as a \"progressive prosecutor\" and argued she was on the wrong side of several policy issues as a district attorney and then California attorney general.\n\n\"I do not wish to see people's professions held against them,\" Clyburn said he told Biden. \"This whole notion that if you become a chief of police or you become a prosecutor, you ought not be considered. People ought to be considered for how well they conduct themselves in their chosen professions. How can we ask to have police chiefs of color, prosecutors of color and then hold that against them?\"\n\nClyburn said he did not recommend any single candidate, only offering his views on each of the finalists, who he said appeared to have narrowed down to Harris, Rice and Bass over the past two or three days.\n\n\"I said to him, 'I'm glad it was not me that had to make the choice,' \" Clyburn said.\n\nCoons, who has known Biden for at least 30 years, applauded the choice, calling Harris a \"comforting and supportive\" friend.\n\nHe said the campaign had looked for someone with the \"experience and background\" for the role, a person who, along with Biden, would be able to represent the \"range and the diversity\" of America, and someone with whom Biden had \"simpatico,\" or a close relationship.\n\nA sort-of audition process for Harris\n\nIn what proved to be auditions for vice president, Harris had a dozen Biden campaign appearances since he became the presumptive Democratic nominee, giving her a chance to stump for Biden.\n\nOn June 26, Harris participated in a virtual roundtable with Jill Biden for a Wisconsin audience to hear about President Donald Trump's efforts to invalidate the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“Obviously, this administration is trying to take health care away from millions of Americans. That's it. It's actually not more complex than that,” Harris said. “We need what (Joe Biden) so uniquely has, which is empathy for the American people and an understanding of what suffering is like.”\n\nA month earlier, Harris joined a Women for Biden call May 21 to discuss what was at stake for women in November. She recounted her friendship with Beau Biden and how it opened her to a different side of Joe Biden.\n\n\"I got to know (Joe) mostly as a human being and as a person, as opposed to what I knew of him as a leader – a longstanding public servant, a committed public servant,\" Harris said.\n\nThat's the ticket:Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate\n\nHow the president responded:Trump criticizes Joe Biden's VP process, saying he disagreed with pledge to consider only women\n\n“And I'll tell you guys the kind of love, it was a very special relationship that I witnessed between a father and a son and a son and a father, both of whom were public servants.\"\n\nShe pointed to the \"horrendous loss\" and suffering Biden has endured, adding that America not only needs a president with a \"lifelong commitment to public service\" but someone who is compassionate and \"feels a sense of responsibility\" to help those in pain.\n\n\"Joe's a fighter,\" Harris said, sounding like a running mate back in May. \"He fights for people, and that's what we need right now.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/13"}]}

For the last quarter-century, his grandson Bernard \"Bud\" Knudsen has carried on the tradition out of a 200-year-old shop on an idyllic spot here in Morris County, where the river spills over a wide, gentle waterfall.\n\n\"This location is insane,\" Knudsen said during a visit to the shop on North Main Street. Now, he's preparing to leave it all behind.\n\nStory continues after gallery.\n\nAfter 50 years of firing, pounding, welding and bending iron and steel into gates, fences, window guards and more, all with artistic flair, Knudsen is ready to hang up his hammer and enjoy retirement. A final sale began on Jan. 1 and will continue as long as there is leftover inventory to offer.\n\n\"I have commitments that will probably take me through the spring and into the summer, but I'm not taking on any more big jobs,\" said Knudsen, 65, who has already bought a retirement home in Delaware.\n\nTringali Iron Works put its stamp on NY history\n\nKnudsen, a trained architect, and his cousins took over the business from his father and uncle, who had succeeded his grandfather, the ironworks' founder. Liborio Tringali was an experienced blacksmith and farrier (a craftsman who shoes horses). He took over a shop in lower Manhattan in 1923 after emigrating from Italy to Brooklyn.\n\nOne could almost trace the history of New York from the products forged by the Tringali Iron Works, which operated out of a location that was a city block in length.\n\nEarly work there included the fashioning of metal \"diamond plates\" to cover New York's wooden floors and prevent fires \"when it was a booming industrial city,\" Knudsen said.\n\nLater, in the 1940s, Tringali put up rails and fire escapes on brownstones. In the 1950s and 1960s, when the crime rate was rising, the business answered a demand for iron window bars.\n\nWorld War II also brought work for the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The war was an \"all-hands-on-deck\" time for the entire family as Tringali pitched in to support the Allied efforts. Knudsen's mother, Jean, \"became sort-of a Rosie the Riveter,\" he said, referring to the iconic poster that encouraged women to enter the workforce on the homefront.\n\nDuring the lengthy Statue of Liberty renovation that started in 1986, Knudsen said, his was one of \"maybe a hundred\" metal shops contracted to work on various aspects of the project. Tringali's contribution was to create \"artsy cafeteria tables\" for the national park facility.\n\nEventually, the business thrived by manufacturing ornate tree guards for city streets, work that continues to this day.\n\nRockaway River paradise\n\nAfter the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, Knudsen's cousins withdrew from the business, and the original shop — now a neighbor to Robert De Niro's Tribeca Films studio — was put up for sale not long before the 9/11 attacks. It was eventually purchased by \"a celebrity buyer\" whom Knudsen declined to name. At that point, he had begun his search for a new location across the Hudson.\n\n\"It kind of fell to me to keep it going,\" Knudsen said.\n\nHe found the shop's new home by accident. During one scouting trip, he was detoured from Parsippany into the Boonton area. He found his way onto North Main Street, where he discovered his future riverside paradise and bought the circa-1820 building.\n\nLocal news:Boonton Township school, town hall renovations could boost taxes almost $1,000 a year\n\n\"I just fell in love with the place,\" he said.\n\nOver the years, Knudsen learned that the site had been used as an oil depot and as a factory for making buttons and munitions during the Civil War.\n\n\"You can still find buttons and bullets outside in the ground,\" Knudsen said.\n\nOne-of-a-kind bargains\n\nHis remaining inventory features a variety of antique metal grates, frames and window guards, including some saved from renovations of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York's Financial District. There's also a good supply of glass-and-metal artwork he has tinkered with of late, including custom \"wizard sticks\" — decorative staffs that \"people really enjoy.\"\n\nOn a recent visit, a customer, Bridget Burke Weiss of Boonton, was making a return trip, shopping for an ornamental window grate for her home.\n\nThe items she bought during her previous trip, including handcrafted spinners, were intended as gifts. \"But I ended up keeping them,\" Weiss said.\n\n\"I saw the sale sign and I was so sad, because it's such a neat space,\" she said. \"It's magical. I hope something neat comes in here. It's got such a great vibe.\"\n\nHeated metal and heavy muscle\n\nKnudsen's main workshop is equipped with hydraulic cutting and bending machines that allowed him to shape his increasingly artistic metalcrafts without the need for heated metal and heavy muscle. The building sits on multiple stone foundations with walls as thick as 3 feet in some places.\n\n\"People always ask me about flooding,\" Knudsen said of his spot above the notoriously flood-prone Rockaway River. \"These foundations are built right into the riverbed. So we don't get a lot of flooding. I got an inch or so during the last rainstorm, but everybody on the river does.\"\n\nHe still uses his grandfather's old anvil to pound certain pieces into shape. The fourth generation of the business was represented by his niece, who worked there as a welder for three years.\n\nNow he's on his own at the shop, except for his dog and shop mascot, Paddy. The building was \"put quietly on the market,\" Knudsen said, but has not yet been listed.\n\nBusiness is still good, he added. Continuing referrals bring steady work from Manhattan, and local walk-ins commission additional projects.\n\nBut a half-century of pounding is enough for Knudsen.\n\n\"It's hard work, backbreaking work,\" he said. \"When I realized we were coming up on 100 years, I wanted to do that. That was very special to me. But now that we made it, I'm ready to do something else.\"\n\nWilliam Westhoven is a local reporter for DailyRecord.com.

Later, Broadkill Creek was dammed to provide power for a sawmill and gristmill.\n\n“Much of the economy of Milton is already on display,” Fabbri said.\n\nThe new exhibit will feature the diary and handiwork of Aleta Clark, a weaver who lived in Milton in the late 1700s.\n\nAlso on display will be a pair of 1890s “counterpanes” — decorative handmade bedspreads that were typical of the era.\n\nAnd the new exhibit will include a child’s casket, built by the Atkinson Casket company.\n\nThe museum’s introduction to “Made in Milton” summarizes the exhibit thusly: “The residents of Milton have long used their hands to craft materials for personal and home use. This exhibit largely focuses on the social and cultural objects that were handcrafted by residents in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. It looks at objects that were used daily by Miltonians for comfort and play.”\n\nMilford, a community that straddles Kent and Sussex counties, was settled in the late 17th century but it was nearly 100 years later when the Rev. Syndenham Thorne built a dam across the Mispillion River to generate power for a gristmill and sawmill.\n\nMeanwhile, enterprising merchants began producing and selling household necessities, including silverware and pottery.\n\nThe Milford Museum exhibit will feature both — the work of an early 19th century silversmith named Daniel Neall, and that of John Denny, a potter from the same era who produced functional “earthenware” bowls, plates, cups and pitchers.\n\nOther merchants produced typical necessities like horse saddles and harnesses, baskets and crates.\n\nMORE: Former World War II POW finally gets a hero's welcome home\n\nMORE: Doctor's office prescribes reading for children, handing out free books\n\nClaudia Leister, executive director of the museum, said the exhibit also will feature some unusual products. One Milford firm made bedsprings; another, corn husk mattresses.\n\nDemco Foundry made Delaware license plates.\n\nThe L.D. Caulk Co. made synthetic porcelain for false teeth.\n\nT.H. McMichael’s Milford Brick Yard produced the obvious: bricks. Many of Milford’s streets were once made of local bricks.\n\nGeorge Grier set up a foundry in 1849 and later patented steel street car wheels.\n\n“He was quite the inventor,” Leister said.\n\nMilford also had a vibrant shipbuilding presence with at least seven companies building boats.\n\nFor Milford shipbuilding, according to the town history, “the high point came in 1917 when the four-masted, 174-foot long Albert F. Paul was launched from the William G. Abbott shipyard. “\n\nUnfortunately, the ship was sunk by a German torpedo in 1942.\n\nOne of the original builders, the Vineyard Shipyard, was known for its elegant wooden cruisers. Vineyard still exists, with part of the business devoted to a marine museum, which displays some of its early craft.\n\nMORE: Delmarva's black Civil War soldiers: Casting off slavery, then the South\n\nPerhaps one of the most unusual Milford products was invented by John Mulhollan. After moving to Milford in the 1920s, he invented a wooden spoon to accompany small Dixie cup portions of ice cream.\n\nWith an extensive amount of research and array of photographs and artifacts, the Milford Museum provides an amazing glimpse of the community’s commercial heritage.\n\n“We bet you will even learn something new about Milford,” the museum’s introduction said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2016/12/08/delaware-main-course-washington-food-event/95048152/", "title": "Delaware is the main course at Washington food event", "text": "Patricia Talorico\n\nThe News Journal\n\nWASHINGTON - When Sen. Chris Coons took office in 2010, he noticed something was missing from the Capitol Hill party scene: There was no bash showcasing the great state of Delaware and its cuisine.\n\nVermont has a party. So does Hawaii. And New York has several.\n\nCoons took matters into his own hands. He and his staff rustled up some longtime favorite, and iconic, Delaware culinary delights — Grotto Pizza, Capriotti's subs, six-packs of Dogfish Head beer — and threw a small, impromptu get-together in a conference room in the Russell Senate Office Building on Constitution Avenue.\n\nFree food and drinks, always hard to resist, attracted others. From that humble beginning, a new tradition was born.\n\nThe annual party, hosted by Coons and the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce and open to the public, now brings several hundred people to the building's Kennedy Caucus Room. It is usually held near or on Dec. 7, also known as Delaware Day, which honors the day in 1787 when Delaware became the first state to ratify the Constitution.\n\nIt's also a way of showing off what Delaware has to offer, all in one room, that's not actually in Delaware.\n\nThis year, more than 20 Delaware establishments, including purveyors of food, beer, baked goods and distilled spirits, plus culinary students from Delaware Technical Community College and Delcastle Technical High School, presented sips and munchies at the Sixth Annual Taste of Delaware.\n\nSTORY: Gingerbread men evoke spirit of holiday\n\nSTORY: Wine merchant Linda Collier has spent 35 years living the dream\n\n\"I like coming,\" said Billy Rawstrom of Maiale Deli and Salumeria in Wilmington, who offered everything from homemade turkey sausage with drunken cranberries to bacon cheeseburger sausage.\n\n\"It's good to get out and expose what we do. Delaware's not the largest state, but we have so much to offer. I like to see the different chefs and see what they're doing. It's a prestigious event.\"\n\nRawstrom said, however, he decided early on that one topic of conversation would be off the table: No chatting about politics in the world's most political city.\n\n\"I don't share my views with anyone,\" he said.\n\nSome attendees to the D.C. event were newcomers like Delaware natives Alex Sianni and Gretchen Brizendine, owners of De La Coeur Cafe Et Patisserie in Wilmington. The couple poured samples of their new product, Civil Cider, a hard cider that they have begun producing from honey crisp apples. The couple recently signed a lease to open a new cidery and tasting room at Fifth and Shipley streets in downtown Wilmington. They hope to welcome patrons either summer or fall 2017.\n\nSianni said he and Brizendine were invited to the event by a staffer from Coons' office who frequently dines at De La Coeur Cafe. Sianni said it was the perfect showcase for the new business. \"We're happy to be here,\" he said.\n\nDoug Ruley, corporate chef for the SoDel Concepts restaurant group based in Rehoboth Beach, has been coming to the party for several years. He and staffers from SoDel's newest restaurant, Matt's Fish Camp in Lewes, offered bites of pastrami-cured steelhead trout with apple sauerkraut, mustard seeds and rye crumbles.\n\n\"It's an honor to come to Capitol Hill and just showcase what our small state can do,\" Ruley said.\n\nJ. Burke Morrison, director of sales and marketing for Twin Lakes Brewing Co. in Newport, handed out cups of the company's signature Twin Lakes Pale Ale and Jubilicious, a hearty, seasonal ale.\n\n\"We're all about Delaware history and just the fact that Sen. Coons sent an invitation to us, it's an honor,\" Morrison said. He said participation in Taste of Delaware over the past few years has helped build the company's brand.\n\n\"We've been seeking a lot of interest on our website from outside the state. It's a lot of 'Hey, I had your beer. Where can I get it?' \"\n\nMorrison said construction delays have pushed back the opening of the brewery's new tasting room 405 E. Marsh Lane in the Newport Industrial Park. While owners had hoped to open this fall, the tasting room is now scheduled for a February opening.\n\nDuring the more than three-hour cocktail party, some of Delaware's business and political leaders chatting and chewing included Chip Rossi, Bank of America's Delaware Market President, as well as Rep. Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth, speaker of Delaware's House of Representatives, and Delaware Technical Community College President Mark Brainard.\n\nSTORY: Senators pay tribute to Vice President Biden\n\nPolitical wonks looking for big names had to come much later to the party that started earlier than its scheduled 4 p.m. start. For a while, the biggest Delaware celebrities in the room seemed to be Wilmington Blue Rock mascots, Mr. Celery and Rocky Bluewinkle.\n\nThe majority of the party guests seemed to be young Capitol Hill aides loading up on the gratis eats.\n\n\"Did you have that cookie? It's kind of hard,\" said one well-dressed man to his friend.\n\n\"Yeah, it is,\" said the friend. \"But, it's OK. It's free,\"\n\nWhile there was talk that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would be making an appearance as well as New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and Sen. John McCain of Arizona as well as Delaware's own congressional delegation, a celebration nearby for Vice President Joe Biden by his former Senate colleagues went well over its scheduled hour of tributes and delayed some expected guests.\n\nBut then Gov.-elect John Carney strolled in and was greeted enthusiastically by the crowd. Asked if he should be called Congressman or Gov. elect, Carney joked, \"Just call me John.\"\n\nHe was soon followed by Sen. Tom Carper, who said his favorite Delaware food is the \"whole grain blueberry pancakes I make at home.\"\n\nAt home? \"At home,\" he said. Does his plate ever include scrapple, one of Delaware's best-known foods?\n\n\"I think it's probably more turkey sausage,\" Carper said, chuckling, \"I think the scrapple people are going to be mad at me.\"\n\nSen. Coons, who came to the party along with not-so-surprise guest Vice President Biden, joked that everyone attending can easily become an honorary Delaware resident.\n\n\"Just a little bit of Dogfish Head, some Painted Stave and some Capriotti's and you can be a Delawarean, too,\" Coons said.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food-dining/2024/02/15/best-restaurants-of-the-year-across-usa/71909704007/", "title": "Best restaurants in the US: 47 spots you need to visit in 2024", "text": "USA TODAY Network\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWe get the question all the time: What restaurant should I try?

Glass walls, lush greenery and midcentury decor give the airy dining room the feeling of a mod terrarium, while the tropical back bar offers a secret garden escape. Chef Terrence Daley, a Culinary Institute of America graduate who worked in fine-dining kitchens across the country, landed in wife Laura’s hometown during the pandemic. He began making bread and pasta for home delivery. Now located in a historic downtown building, The Daley Trade has transitioned into a marketplace and restaurant. Look for an ever-changing menu inspired by the Daleys’ world travels and featuring seasonal, locally grown ingredients, often served with house-made pasta and sourdough bread. − Suzy Fleming Leonard, Florida Today\n\nDetails: 12306 46th Ave. W., Cortez, Fla.; 941-794-1243, starfishcompany.com\n\nStar Fish Company restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the exceptional Gulf seafood with a view of the bay.\n\nNestled along Sarasota Bay in the fishing village of Cortez, Star Fish Company offers exceptional Gulf seafood with a generous serving of Old Florida charm.

However, the restaurant is particularly renowned for its mullet, a fish best enjoyed fried or blackened with a side of cheese grits. − Wade Tatangelo, Sarasota Herald-Tribune (Fla.)\n\nDetails: 2000 PGA Blvd., Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.; 561-408-3685, StagePGA.com\n\nStage Kitchen & Bar restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the creative modern Indian fare.\n\nStage, with the clean, modern lines of its spacious dining room and leafy outdoor patio, brought big-city buzz to a once monotone patch of Palm Beach County. A lively vibe spirits you through the dining experience, but it is chef/co-owner Pushkar Marathe’s creative, modern-Indian plates that will bring you back. Those bites include a bruleed chicken liver pate spiced with cardamom, green ginger and fenugreek, local fish served in Bengali-style sauce, tandoori churrasco, plus an eclectic array of small plates. Marathe’s innovative cooking earned Stage national acclaim, including a 2023 James Beard Award semifinalist nod.

With Cotton and Rye, Shultz created a warm industrial space in which to savor elevated comfort foods that seem both achingly familiar and entirely new with each bite. Executive chef Caleb Ayers assembles artful charcuterie boards filled with house-made sausages and cured meats.

The twinkling lights of Tinker's patio entrance welcome diners to a celebration of food, starting with flutes of complimentary champagne dubbed the Tinker Toast. Where a lesser restaurant might call good enough good enough, Main and company fastidiously experiment and, fittingly, tinker with every dish until it's meticulously crafted to delight.

Since Laura Lee Brown and Steve Wilson, known for founding 21c Museum Hotels among other ventures, opened Barn 8 in 2020, the place has become a go-to for locals and visitors alike. And why not? What could be more Kentucky than tables available inside horse stalls and surrounded by stacks of bourbon barrels? While the 19th-century structure maintains the frame of a barn stuck in time, the space is modernized with decor, artwork, leather chairs and upscale details. From the seasonal menu, consider the cast iron cornbread, which requires a 15-minute wait to be made from scratch, and go from there. Simple dishes such as house-made bread, spaghetti and burrata shine, while the pork loin and duck breast entrees are favorites. Dessert options also change frequently, but a banana date cake is a top recommendation during the winter. − Amanda Hancock, The Courier-Journal (Louisville, Ky.)\n\nDetails: 835 E.

When he arrived in New Orleans, he found familiar flavors. The city’s Creole cooking, like the food he grew up eating, often relies on layered, slow-cooked dishes. At Dakar NOLA, his first restaurant, Mbaye mines the connections between the two cuisines. Guests sit at communal tables, and the prix fixe dinner is as much a performance as a meal. With each course, Mbaye comes out of the kitchen and offers a story. The intensely flavored black-eyed peas with palm oil, for example, were inspired by the last meal fed to enslaved Africans before crossing the Atlantic. His jollof rice, an African staple, is delicious evidence of the origin of Louisiana’s jambalaya. Mbaye, a quiet perfectionist, can also leave the room speechless with the confidence of his cooking. − Todd A.

The pair moved to Maine from Washington state in August to run their special event restaurant. They collaborate with a local brewery, winery or cidery for a four-course pairing dinner. Their menus are very much a taste of Maine, from local oysters to freshly caught arctic char to native mushrooms or black garlic. Ronspies' dishes are layered with flavors and textures: contrasting meats and vegetables, greens and grains.

In the decade that followed, the New American restaurant has become a pillar in midtown, which is now a hotbed for some of the city’s most popular restaurants, and a beacon for Detroit’s culinary scene at large. The Selden Standard team has racked up six James Beard nominations and in 2015, the restaurant was named the Detroit Free Press/Metro Detroit Chevy Dealers Restaurant of the Year.

At the downtown Minneapolis restaurant, chef Sean Sherman provides a vision of what modern Indigenous food can be. It's not about re-creating traditional dishes but rather removing colonial ingredients and supporting Indigenous food producers through delicious, healthful menus featuring food native to North America. That looks like tepary bean dip, pheasant tacos and a smoked bison ribeye dripping with flavor that shouldn't be missed. Go ahead and order a selection of the tasty sauces to take everything to the next level. By its nature, much of Indigenous food is plant-based and friendly to restricted diets.

Sometimes you're seated a little too close to the kitchen. But what Louis' does offer is a taste of Old Nevada, where customers dine at communal tables on fare that sustained the Basque shepherds − soup, beans and bread, lamb, steak and oxtail with fries to sop up the savory juices.

Big mistake. Paterson has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country and some of the most delicious Middle Eastern eats. The best of them all? Al-Basha, a quarter-century-old Palestinian restaurant, which arguably offers the best hummus in the region, if not, well, the planet. Scoop it up with torn pieces of warm, fluffy pitas. They are reason enough to trek to Al-Basha. But then again, nearly every mezze item is a standout: the crisp falafel, the flavor-packed muhammara, the creamy labneh, the refreshing tabbouleh. Fans know to leave room for the generous array of grilled meats that arrive on big wooden boards. They also know that this is a strict no-booze spot; reward yourself instead with a tall glass of delicious mint lemonade. Bring along the family and lots of friends. This food is meant to be shared.

Each week, one dish comes off each menu, never to return, and is replaced with something new. But in the best of both worlds, this high-end fare is served in an approachable, airy space with an open kitchen, chef’s table, mismatched chairs, pops of greenery and a book nook packed with beloved cookbooks, making Heirloom Kitchen a true hidden gem that remains in the unassuming strip mall, even on the heels of astronomical success and two additional restaurants. − Jenna Intersimone, Courier News (Somerville, N.J.)\n\nDetails: Address provided upon reservation, Ridgefield, N.J.; sushibysea.com\n\nSushi by Sea restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the intimate, 12-seat spot that serves 17 courses of globally-inspired sushi to two rounds of guests a night.\n\nGood luck finding Sushi by Sea from the street − New Jersey’s most hush-hush omakase restaurant has no signs, no parking lot and no address on its social pages.

Cheers to Life\" handwritten on a beam near the bar. But it’s not just the interior that sets this intimate, 47-seat restaurant apart. It’s the commitment to local and authentic Mexican ingredients that makes it a standout. Chef-owner Joana Herrera is passionate about using what’s available from local farms and what she finds on her \"día de plaza,\" market days, all of which are listed on the dining room blackboard. Herrera also grows some of her own ingredients on-site. Her commitment to her Mexican birthplace − and its food − is contagious, making for a memorable meal that she often comes out of the kitchen to briefly educate you about.

Instead, Fyr serves dishes using locally sourced ingredients that are cooked with techniques he learned in his native Argentina. That includes six types of fire: direct or indirect, in embers or on them, in a wood-fired oven or smoked. The result is dishes such as a 45-day dry-aged tomahawk steak, cooked for three hours near indirect flame and finished on the grill.

But before Mebruka Kane made her first batch of berbere-spiced, wafer-crisp and unendingly juicy Ethiopian fried chicken in the spring of 2021, it’s fair to say nothing like it existed in the world. “Fried chicken is not traditional in Ethiopia,” she said. But her American-born children loved Chick-fil-A, so she added her own twist. Sure, you could die of tender heartbreak while tasting Kane’s fresh-built shawarma or long-simmered doro wot chicken leg at Doro Bet, the clean-lined West Philly fast-casual Ethiopian chicken house Kane shares with her sister, Hayat Ali. But it’s their fried chicken that made them famous for hundreds of miles: breaded with the nutty pop and crackle of teff and tapioca flours, marinated in buttermilk with earthy-fiery berbere spice mixed by a sister in Ethiopia. Like it mild? The gentle turmeric in the mild “alicha” fried chicken, also found in Doro Bet’s heavenly collards, will soothe you into submission.

Caviar and doughboys is an homage to the state's deep-fried savory treat. The smoked scallop rolls spiced with jalapeños will make you forget lobster rolls. Paired with desserts like a cake in a cup and refreshing cocktails, Gift Horse makes a meal to remember. − Gail Ciampa, The Providence Journal (R.I.)\n\nDetails: 318 N.

What’s all the fuss about? At Potchke, chef Laurence Faber, an alum of Tennessee's renowned Blackberry Farm, explores his roots in Ukraine through delicious food with a story in a relaxed environment. Babkas, lox bagels and matzo ball soup are among fan favorites at this pop-up-turned-permanent fixture of Knoxville’s dining scene. — Ryan Wilusz, Knox News, Knoxville, Tenn.\n\nDetails: 2305 12th Ave. S., Nashville, Tenn.; locustnashville.com\n\nLocust restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends exceptional dumplings, clams on buttery toast and oysters with far too much caviar.\n\nEverything about Locust is disarming by design. The chefs, who will also turn out to be your affable, knowledgeable servers, shout boisterous “Hellos!” from the open kitchen as you walk through the door. The 36-seat dining room of blond wood and big windows feels airy and open. The soundtrack ranges from The Pogues to Pantera. You might be encouraged to have a bracing shot of horseradish vodka at lunchtime. You should. James Beard-nominated chef Trevor Moran is behind the tiny restaurant with the huge following, all chasing after a menu so mutable it could change a couple of times in one day. But you can bet on reliably excellent tartare to roll in toasted nori, exceptional dumplings, and some other sumptuous thing such as clams on buttery toast or oysters with far too much caviar. But beyond the stellar ingredients and obvious talent is an X-factor that makes Locust special: It's a really fun place to be. − Mackensy Lunsford, The Tennessean (Nashville)\n\nDetails: 5811 Manor Road, Austin, Texas; 512-270-8021 mumfoodsatx.com\n\nMum Foods Smokehouse and Delicatessen restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends the brisket, ribs and sausage that make Mum one of the best barbecue joints in the city.\n\nGeoffrey Ellis’s Mum Foods has been drawing lines for more than a decade, beginning with local farmers markets. But late last year, the chef opened a full-size restaurant serving, yes, his market-famous brisket and pastrami, but also peppery pork ribs, fiery sausage links, corned beef and more. The brisket, ribs and sausage make Mum one of the best barbecue joints in the city, and the corned beef and pastrami sandwiches make it one of the city’s best delis. The pastrami is popular, but the coriander-buzzed corned beef is my favorite. It’s steamed to a tender finish but doesn’t hit the smoker, giving it a purer, beefy, deli meat taste. Stacked high, draped with Swiss cheese and served on a slightly malty and sweet house-made sourdough rye, it makes for the perfect sandwich. − Matthew Odam, Austin American-Statesman (Texas)\n\nDetails: 939 S. Second St., Milwaukee, Wis.; 414-763-5881, oddduckrestaurant.com\n\nOdd Duck restaurant review: Our local food writer recommends this vibrant small-plates restaurant with a globe-trotting menu.\n\nFor more than a decade, this vibrant small-plates restaurant has effortlessly blended a crafty, globe-trotting menu with pure Midwestern charm. You see it in the handwritten notes left at your table on a special-occasion dinner. You feel it in the vibrant dining space filled with perky potted plants and dozens of duck figurines tucked into the decor. You taste it in the ever-evolving menu, where dishes like Filipino-style pork belly lechon kwali with peanut kare-kare, Haitian beef short rib joumou and chicken-fried oyster mushrooms with Nashville hot sauce share space in artful cohesion. A 2022 James Beard Award semifinalist for outstanding restaurant, the eatery effortlessly doubles as an after-work hangout or a celebration spot where everyone can feel at home. — Rachel Bernhard, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nOther restaurants that make our food team swoon\n\nThough most of the restaurants on our list are in the communities in or near where we live and work, our writers love to travel, and when they do, they seek out great meals.\n\nThe following are places our writers continue to crave, months after vacation is over.\n\nDetails: 3655 S. Grand Ave. Unit C9, Los Angeles, 213-986-9972, holboxla.com\n\nDoes a restaurant need to be white-tablecloth fancy and over-the-top expensive to earn national accolades? No, and certainly not if that restaurant is Holbox. The counter-service eatery in a Los Angeles food hall serves fresh California seafood inspired by chef-owner Gilberto Cetina’s native Yucatan Peninsula. Cetina, a 2023 James Beard finalist for Best Chef: California, opened the restaurant in 2017 in South Central LA’s Mercado La Paloma. Eight restaurants share a common dining area in the converted garment factory that also houses shops and nonprofits. The Holbox menu features dishes such as Ceviche Mixto with Yucatan octopus, wild Mexican shrimp and Baja striped bass; house-smoked kanpachi tacos with queso Chihuahua, salsa cruda, avocado and peanut chili oil; and Camarones al Mojo de Ajo with roasted local shrimp, garlic butter, cilantro rice, black beans and grilled bread.\n\nDetails: 3127 Fillmore St., San Francisco Calif.; 415-440-0460, ateliercrenn.com.\n\nAt Atelier Crenn, chef and owner Dominique Crenn unites her French heritage with California’s natural bounty to create an unforgettable 14-course pescatarian tasting menu.

Atellier Crenn is a meat- and dairy-free restaurant with produce supplied by Crenn’s Bleu Belle Farm in Sonoma.

Broadway, Manhattan; 646-692-8300, ernestosnyc.com\n\nLet’s begin exactly as you should at Ernesto’s, a darling Basque restaurant that has wowed critics and diners alike since it opened nearly four years ago in a rather remote part of Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Order the restaurant’s signature dry, 5-finger Martini, a delicious concoction made with two kinds of sherry and blanc vermouth, garnished with three plump olives on a thin skewer. Leisurely enjoy your drink and then slowly move on to those delectable bar snacks called pintxos: cheesy, shredded chicken croquetas; skewers of sweet and spicy green peppers, green olives, and umami-rich anchovies called gildas; spicy house-made Basque sausage; and that Insta-famous mound of crisp, house-made chips covered with Iberico ham. You can make a meal out of these small plates − and many do − but then you’d miss out on the roasted meats and grilled fish that in the hands of chef Ryan Bartlow may have you swooning. The menu changes frequently. Many of these dishes may no longer be available when you show up. No matter. When a chef is this talented, your only worry is how many dishes you will be able to eat.\n\nDetails: 2350 E. Union St., Seattle; 206-391-8140, communionseattle.com\n\nThey call it Communion for a reason. Chef-owner Kristi Brown’s grandmother was a deacon and a pastor, and her mother was a church pianist, so the name of this “Seattle Soul” restaurant pays homage to her religious roots. But the restaurant itself brings about communion, a convergence of spirits. It’s about people coming together, feeling intimate and close in this space − all copper and rich blues and browns − and about bringing Seattle itself to the table. Brown, a caterer for many years before opening the restaurant in 2020, has created her own style of cuisine by sourcing ingredients from her city’s neighbors, including immigrants from Southeast Asia and East Africa. She combines that with culinary influences from her childhood and local ingredients − especially seafood − and turns out delightful dishes like coconut clams with Laotian sausage, coconut milk and lemongrass, and a seafood-and-panko stuffed trout with a decadent Bernaise sauce.

The conglomerate behind Skippy and Jennie-O turkey says it can’t make Spam fast enough and is increasing production capacity.\n\nSpam is a trending ingredient on TikTok and on the menu at fine-dining restaurants in coastal cities. In 2019, a limited-edition Spam pumpkin spice flavor sold out in minutes. (You can still buy it on Ebay, where it goes for up to $100 per can.)\n\nWhat is behind this phenomenon? Why does this slab of cooked pork that has long been stigmatized as fake meat, linked to wartime rations and hilariously spoofed on Monty Python now have cachet with foodies?\n\nSpam’s popularity in Hawaiian, Asian and Pacific Island cuisine has influenced its growth in the United States. As more immigrants came to the United States and fusion dishes and ethnic cuisines entered the cultural mainstream, Spam has reached new, younger foodies, say Hormel, food analysts and researchers.\n\nEdgy and clever advertising campaigns also have helped Spam attract a broader customer range than the Baby Boomers who grew up eating it, sometimes reluctantly.\n\n“Spam has undergone a reputation makeover,” said Robert Ku, an associate professor of Asian and Asian American studies at Binghamton University and the author of “Dubious Gastronomy: Eating Asian in the USA.” “A lot of celebrity chefs have been Asian and Asian American, and reintroduced Spam to a new audience.”\n\n‘Miracle meat’\n\nMore than 100,000 visitors stream into the Spam museum every year in Austin, Minnesota, with stories to tell about Spam and recipes to share, said Savile Lord, the manager of the museum in the brand’s hometown. Visitors most often ask her and other museum “Spambassadors” how Spam got its name and what the heck is in it.\n\nA family peruses the history of Spam at the Spam museum. Josh Noel/Minneapolis Star Tribune/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nSpam first hit shelves in 1937 as a 12-ounce, 25-cent, convenient and long-lasting protein in a tin can during the lean years of the Great Depression. Spam contained nothing but pork shoulder, chopped ham, water, sugar and sodium.\n\nIt was a concoction of George Hormel and his son, Jay, meatpackers in Austin. The Hormels had been working on the “problem of canning a nonperishable pork product for a good many years and at last we solved it,” Jay told The New Yorker in 1945.\n\nThey offered a $100 prize for the best name for the food. It needed to be short for display purposes and to fit on one-column newspaper advertisements. It also had to pronounceable in any language.\n\nThe brother of a corporate executive threw out “Spam,” a combination of “spice” and “ham,” at a party, and Hormel “knew then and there that the name was perfect.”\n\nFrom the beginning, Spam was marketed as a time-saver and a food for any meal: Spam and eggs. Spam and pancakes. Spam and beans, spaghetti, macaroni and crackers. Spamwiches.\n\nA pie made with Spam-brand canned meat, potatoes, scallions, and cream of mushroom soup during the 1950s or 1960s. Tom Kelley/Getty Images\n\n“Never have you imagined a meat could turn into so many interesting uses. Morning, noon or night – cold or hot – Spam hits the spot!” read one early advertisement. Spam was a “miracle meat,” the company told consumers in newspaper spots and radio ads.\n\nAnd then came the United States’ entrance into World War II in 1941, the decisive moment in Spam’s growth.\n\nAt many Pacific outposts, which had little refrigeration or local sources of meat, American and Allied troops relied on the canned meat that could be stored away for months and eaten on the go.\n\nHormel says more than 100 million pounds of Spam were shipped overseas to help feed the troops during the war. Uncle Sam became known as Uncle Spam, much to the dismay of troops forced to eat it every single day.\n\n“During World War II, of course, I ate my share of Spam along with millions of other soldiers,” Dwight D. Eisenhower later wrote to Hormel’s president. “I’ll even confess to a few unkind remarks about it – uttered during the strain of battle.”\n\nFor the citizens of conflict-wracked countries in the Pacific struggling with hunger and famine during the war and rebuilding years, however, Spam was a symbol of access to American goods and services. Sometimes, it was the only protein source available. After US troops left, Spam remained, becoming an ingredient in local dishes.\n\n“Spam became part of Asian culture,” said Ayalla Ruvio, a consumer behavior researcher at Michigan State University who studies identity and consumption habits. “It represented a piece of America. It’s like Coca-Cola or McDonald’s.”\n\nAmerican troops also introduced Spam in Korea during the Korean War in the early 1950s, and Budae Jjigae (Army Stew) became a popular Korean dish. Spam also remains a common ingredient in dishes almost anywhere US soldiers were stationed, such as Guam, the Philippines and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nIn Hawaii, where the US military has long been a major presence, more Spam is consumed per person than any other state. It’s stacked on a block of rice and wrapped in seaweed to make Spam musubi and sold at fast-food chains like McDonald’s in Hawaii. There’s even an annual Waikiki Spam Jam festival.\n\nSpam musubi and tacos\n\nMany US soldiers returning from World War II vowed never to eat Spam again, and the brand became linked to rationing and economic hardship. But Spam has appealed to new consumers in the United States in recent years.\n\nSpam musubi, a common Japanese lunch dish that was created in Hawaii. Glenn Asakawa/The Denver Post/Getty Images\n\n“When I first started getting into the brand, we started to notice this transition to a stronger multicultural set of consumers,” said Brian Lillis, who has been product’s brand manager for six years. “They brought with them the traditions of utilizing the product in their home country or where maybe their ancestors came from.”\n\nHormel has worked with chefs at Korean, Taiwanese and Vietnamese restaurants to get Spam on menus. As more people have been introduced to these dishes, they go home and try to make their own versions, Lillis said.\n\nSpam highlights its versatility in dishes on social media and TV advertisements. There are ads for Spam and eggs, as well as Spam fried rice, Spam musubi, yakitori, and poke.\n\nSpam has made a comeback in the United States because Asian and Asian American chefs such as Chris Oh have tried to reinvent it in their own ways, said Ku, the Binghamton University professor. “They brought some of the culinary influences of Asia and the Pacific and upscaled it.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2019/12/23/delaware-restaurant-openings-and-closings-2019/2564360001/", "title": "These are the Delaware restaurants that opened and closed in 2019", "text": "As usual, 2019 was a year of comings and goings.

Perdue founded Perdue Farms, a poultry company in 1920. That same year, he and his wife Pearl would welcome a son into their world, Franklin Parsons Perdue.​\n\nAfter a short-lived college baseball career, Frank Perdue left Salisbury State College, as it was called then, to join his dad at the company in 1939. Frank may have left school, but he did not leave his love for baseball behind.\n\nOver the next few decades, Perdue Farms grew and began to change the poultry industry. Frank had become the face of the business with his commercials in the 1970s, most of which ended with the famous slogan, “It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken.”\n\nBy the time the 1990s came around, Frank was less in love with chicken and more in love with baseball. He often attended Baltimore Orioles games, but desperately wanted a team right in his backyard in Salisbury.\n\nFrank cared about bringing a professional baseball team to the Eastern Shore just as much, if not more, than he cared about his chicken business. Frank ate, slept and breathed baseball. Without him, it is easy to say that the Delmarva Shorebirds would not exist.\n\nAt the very least, they most certainly wouldn’t be celebrating their 20th season on the Eastern Shore.\n\nJIM PERDUE, Perdue Farms’ chairman and advertising spokesman: My dad was always a lover of baseball, ever since he went to Salisbury State College. He played on the team there back in 1939. Unfortunately he didn’t have the God-given gifts to do well, so as he said, he always picked up more lumber on the bench in his britches than he did with a bat.\n\nGARY MACKES, former Wicomico County Director of Recreation and Parks:\n\nFrank Perdue loved the game of baseball. He often cited how difficult it was for residents of the Eastern Shore to attend baseball games in Baltimore. By the time local fans returned home from a night game, it would be in the early hours of the morning and they’d be faced with returning to work with limited rest. It was his vision to bring professional baseball to Salisbury.\n\nPERDUE: When the new stadium was built at Camden Yards, dad got a box there. He shared it with another company, but that other company wanted it as a place to take customers, and dad said, “Look, I’m just here to watch baseball.”\n\nPETER KIRK,majority partner of Maryland Baseball: Frank was at an Orioles game after Camden Yards had opened, and he was sitting in the luxury suite that belonged to the Maryland Stadium Authority and (Maryland) Gov. (William Donald) Schaefer was there. They started talking baseball and Frank told the governor that he would really like to have a minor league team on the Eastern Shore. Frank had made some contacts in baseball but told the governor that he was frustrated because he was unable to make anything happen.\n\nKENT BAKER, former Baltimore Sun reporter:Kirk built Frederick first. Then, at the time, they had a Double-A team in Hagerstown, and they were going to move them to Bowie, but they didn’t have a stadium. So their first season, they played at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore while that was being built. Then came the Shorebirds. The Orioles at that time were trying to move all of their affiliates closer to Baltimore.\n\nKIRK: The governor introduced us and we really hit it off and as a result Frank became part of our Maryland Baseball partnership. Very few people knew that, but in that way he learned about the business of minor league baseball and together we started putting plans together to try and bring an Orioles’ affiliate to the Eastern Shore.\n\nDOUG FLEETWOOD, former head coach of Salisbury University baseball: The thing with minor league baseball is the financial commitment that has to come from the community. It’s not like the Orioles are just building these teams and stadiums everywhere. They needed help and commitment from different people, like the Perdue Family.\n\nKIRK: Frank was definitely the one that got the ball rolling. We had not considered having a team on the Eastern Shore at the time. Frank was just way ahead of us.\n\nMACKES: Maryland Baseball was connected in the industry and they were capable of obtaining a team and putting together a good product.\n\nKIRK: Because of the teams in Frederick and Bowie, and because the Eastern Shore was not a strong enough market for a Triple-A team, that left us with two possibilities with either pursuing a New York Penn League short season team, or a South Atlantic League team. We went out and spoke with both of those leagues and the South Atlantic League team had a team in Albany, Georgia – the Albany Polecats – that was for sale and was available to be relocated.\n\nTROY MATTES, pitcher, Albany Polecats; 1995, Delmarva Shorebirds; 1996: From what I remember, we had a two-year deal with Albany and the team just didn’t draw well there at all. So after the first year, they told us the Delmarva stadium should be just about ready and, I’m not sure if they were prepared to have a team there, but they sped things up and got it ready.\n\nKIRK: We went down to Georgia and signed a contract with the owner of that franchise which had a player development contract with the Montreal Expos at that time. We went through the labyrinths of baseball approvals and Maryland Baseball was able to acquire the franchise and were able to get the approvals to move it to Wicomico County.\n\nA team was coming, Frank Perdue and Maryland Baseball just needed a stadium. On a February night in 1994, more than 600 people attended a public hearing hosted by the Wicomico County Council.\n\nMACKES: The Wicomico County Council was approached by Maryland Baseball to construct a minor league baseball stadium which would be owned by the county. The 22-member panel headed by Victor Laws III concluded that the stadium would be a viable asset to the county. The contract was extremely favorable. It wasn’t going to cost the citizens any money, thanks to the generosity of Frank Perdue.\n\nMACKES: Frank Perdue paid a substantial amount of money to build that stadium. The price tag was about $10 million and with county and state money combined we had $4.2 million. Frank came up with the rest out of his pocket, plus he gave us the 39 acres of land that was very valuable real estate because it’s at that intersection of Route 50 and the Route 13 bypass.\n\nPERDUE: I remember as a kid, there was a dirt road that came all the way back (to where the stadium is now) and there were two chicken houses out there.\n\nMACKES: The construction schedule was ambitious and met as the stadium opened 15 months later in April 1996. The stadium was financed with $2.1 million in both state and county funding. Maryland Baseball came up with the balance of the funds. The stadium cost over $10 million.\n\nIn January 1995, the Wicomico County Council halted the construction of the stadium because, due the Major League Baseball strike, Maryland Baseball was unable to obtain the Albany Polecats.\n\nMACKES: There was a little uncertainty with Major League Baseball at the time as far as what the outcome or effect was going to be on us obtaining on a minor league franchise. When you’re building something like that with public dollars, we had to be sure that we were going to be able to get a team. It didn’t really last long though.\n\nFour months later, the strike ended and Kirk and his group announced that they would have a team for the 1996 season.\n\nMACKES: We had a very protective agreement that the franchise’s use of the facility would continue and if that wouldn’t happen then Maryland Baseball was going to be responsible for paying the county back what it invested in the stadium, which was very unusual, but that’s what Frank agreed to do.\n\nAt the intersection of Route 50 and Hobbs Road, chicken houses were removed and the building of a baseball stadium had begun. Frank Perdue’s dream of having a professional baseball team on the Eastern Shore was just starting to be realized. A team was coming, but there was still work to do. Maryland Baseball had a staff to fill, a schedule to map out and a team and a stadium without a name.\n\nGAIL POTTS, Shorebirds’ accounting manager since 1996: I had on my mind that I would like to apply there and work in baseball. I recently had just left another job and I thought it would just be fun to do, so I called and found out where their office was, and found out they were looking for a bookkeeper and applied.\n\nBOB SOCCI, Shorebirds’ play-by-play voice; 1996-1998: It was an opportunity for me to go to Delmarva and establish myself and be the voice of their inaugural season. I knew that there was a solid and stable ownership there, and there was also an opportunity for me to go across the (Chesapeake Bay) and do some (Naval Academy football and basketball) games.\n\nGILL DUNN, president of the Shorebirds’ fan club: When they first started talking about putting the team in town they had a lottery system for season tickets. I was able to pick out my own seats and I got four of them right behind the dugout.\n\nPERDUE: I think the county asked dad about naming the stadium and he wanted it under his father’s name, Arthur W. Perdue. There was nothing else in the area that would really help remember his name, and dad wanted that.\n\nDICK “DOC SHOREBIRD” PASSWATER, season ticket holder: I’ve been here since Day One. We were going to be an Orioles team, so it had to be a bird. Then we’re on the Shore, so, yea, Shorebirds. And we wanted it to be regional, not anything too local, so we picked Delmarva.\n\nPERDUE: We didn’t have a say in the name of the team. It was put out to the public and they came up with a great name.\n\nKIRK: In the first season it was too late to go through the next step, which was to exchange the player development contract with the Expos for the Orioles. So the first season we were an Expos affiliate, but very few people knew that because we had Orioles colors, uniforms and the name was Shorebirds.\n\nPASSWATER: Salisbury Polecats? Don’t laugh, it could have happened.\n\nSOCCI: We were originally in temporary offices and it was not the operation that I expected it to be. New management came in including the late (former Shorebirds’ general manager) Keith Lupton. I can’t say enough about the good that Keith did those first couple of seasons to establish the right culture at the ballpark and behind the scenes and for the fans.\n\nKIRK: Starting the team, getting it going and everything, none of that would have happened without Keith Lupton. He was our go-to guy. He was the guy who made the success really happen.\n\nMATTES: We went on a road trip when the season started and as we were gone they finished some things up. The clubhouses were halfway done and the concourse was still being worked on too.\n\nKIRK: Right before the stadium opened, when all the pieces were coming together, the carousel was delivered and Keith Lupton and I walked out of the office and there was Frank Perdue, riding the carousel and sitting on the chicken. And the two of us looked at each other and tried to find a camera, but no one had one.\n\nAlthough it had a carousel that received Frank Perdue’s approval, Arthur W. Perdue Stadium wasn’t quite finished in time for the start of the Shorebirds’ inaugural season in the South Atlantic League. But after a road trip to begin the season, the stadium was good enough to get the green light for the first professional baseball game that had been played in Salisbury in many years. In front of a crowd of 5,787 people, the Shorebirds topped the Columbus Redstixx by a score of 4-2 on April 17, 1996. To start the night off, the man that made the idea of minor league baseball on the Eastern Shore become a reality threw out the first pitch.\n\nBAKER: Frank Perdue threw out the first pitch. It was a big deal.\n\nPERDUE: My dad was always a little self-conscious about baseball, so during that day he had one of the sales people bring their mitt out and they practiced throwing all day long so he made sure that it got to home-plate, which it did. He didn’t want to miss.\n\nSOCCI: The stadium was not complete. The press box was wide open, we had office dividers between the two radio teams, the windows weren’t in place yet, I was sitting on milk crates, but it was awesome because the fans were so passionate.\n\nKIRK: When the team went on the road, the contractors would scurry back and continue to work. It was actually fun because when the team came back after each road trip it was like you could see something new each time.\n\nPOTTS: We were over on Mt. Hermon Road and our offices were in townhouses. Then we moved here in July of 1996, and for each game we had to set up lights and everything for the ticket office. It was a little rough for the first few months.\n\nBAKER: That stadium was built better than Frederick and Bowie. Delmarva always struck me as a nice and tidy stadium.\n\nMO BLAKENEY, Delmarva Shorebirds outfielder; 1996: Being in the outfield and seeing all the signs was cool. The billboards were like targets during batting practice.\n\nPERDUE: I don’t know if it was supposed to be planned this way or not, but the Expos loaded that team with some unbelievable and really talented players.\n\nKIRK: The Expos, for not having a lot of money, really ran a wonderful minor league system.\n\nMATTES: Chemistry-wise it was a pretty awesome team. Everyone got along with each other.\n\nBLAKENEY: I played with Javier Vasquez and Orlando Cabrera. They were really cool guys and it was the first time I had really played with Latin players.\n\nMACKES: The thing with minor league is that, if someone is doing really well, then they’re going to get moved up, that’s the whole goal. But Frank actually went to the Montreal Expos and says, “Hey, I want you to keep my team together because we want to win the championship in our first year.” I don’t know if they listened, but that’s Frank Perdue, and for the most part, that team stayed intact there and these guys all stayed.\n\nMATTES: It was really Cabrera’s first chance to get some extended playing time. He was brought in as a backup infielder and our first couple of years playing he was sitting behind first- and second-round picks. It was fun to see him get some legitimate playing and to see the talent finally be let out.\n\nSOCCI: The team that the Expos put in Delmarva was extremely likable and extremely talented. We had Michael Barrett and Brian Schneider, who wound up having long catching careers, then Javier Vasquez and Orlando Cabrera. It was really talented team who lost in the championship series.\n\nKIRK: I remember after the very last game of the season I was sitting in the dugout with Michael Barrett and everyone had left and I was talking to Michael and he said, “This place is really wonderful. I have to figure out a way to get traded to the Orioles so I can come back here.”\n\nIn their first season, the Delmarva Shorebirds set the SAL attendance record with 315,011 fans coming to Arthur W. Perdue Stadium that year. On Sept. 1, 1996, they attracted the largest crowd of the season with 10,293 fans. Arthur W. Perdue stadium was voted as the best playing field in the SAL. Javier Vasquez led the team with 14 wins, 173 strikeouts and an earned-run-average of 2.68. He was joined on the SAL all-star team by four other Shorebirds.\n\nMATTES: The fans really embraced the players on that team. Everyone recognized you and it felt like you were a celebrity in a small town. We felt like royalty, but we were eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and riding on buses for eight to 12 hours at a time.\n\nSOCCI: The fans were really attached to that Expos team. 1996 was a tough act to follow.\n\nOn Sept. 26, 1996, the Delmarva Shorebirds officially became an affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nKIRK: After we announced we were switching it was sort of ho-hum. It was like, “Well, of course it’s becoming an Orioles’ team.”\n\nPOTTS: There wasn’t really any change in here in the front office when we went from Expos to Orioles.\n\nIt was hardly noticed by the fans and the people who worked in the stadium, but the switch from Expos to O’s had taken place. The people of Delmarva said their goodbyes to future MLB players in Orlando Cabrera, Javier Vasquez and then fan favorites like Troy Mattes and Michael Barrett. The question now was, would they be as welcoming to a new batch of players?\n\nThere was one player on that 1997 team that Delmarva essentially adopted as its own. His name was Ryan Minor and in his only season on Delmarva he helped lead the team to a league championship while hitting for an average of .307, blasting 24 home runs and notching 97 RBI’s in 134 games. Standing at 6 feet and 7 inches, he towered over third base.\n\nMinor grew up in Oklahoma and became a two-sport varsity athlete at the University of Oklahoma, starring on the diamond and the hardwood. As a junior basketball player he averaged 23 points and eight rebounds per game and earned All-American honors. On the baseball field, he was a member of the OU team that won the College World Series in 1994.\n\nMinor’s NBA draft stock fell after his senior season and he was taken in the second round by the Philadelphia 76ers. The Orioles also drafted him that summer, but not until the 33rd round.\n\nRYAN MINOR, Delmarva Shorebirds third baseman; 1997: I picked both sports to start with. I went to the NBA Summer League first and ended up playing 30 or so games in Bluefield, which was (the Orioles’) short season team at the time, and then I went to pre-season camp with the Sixers and then played a bit in the (Continental Basketball League) in Oklahoma City. Then the Orioles offered me a contract to just play baseball exclusively.\n\nCALVIN PICKERING, Delmarva Shorebirds first baseman; 1997: It was really nice here, especially coming from Bluefield, West Virginia. The year before we won the championship in Bluefield and they kind of kept that team together and moved us all to Delmarva, so we had really good chemistry.\n\nMINOR: I really didn’t know much about the Eastern Shore. Being from Oklahoma I had no idea where I was going. The stadium was just about brand new.\n\nSOCCI: I remember the first game of the 1997 season, for whatever reason, that team didn’t shower at the ballpark, they showered at the hotel. So, I get on the air for the postgame show and I walk out and I see the bus pulling away from the stadium and I’m like, “Where are they going?” Fortunately, that was the last time that happened.\n\nBAKER: (The Baltimore Sun) didn’t cover games full time, but several times a year we would come down. I was down there on Delmarva a few times a year, usually doing features and stuff like that instead of game coverage. We were interested in who might get to the big leagues, like Minor and Pickering and the big sluggers.\n\nDUNN: You had two home run hitters in Ryan and Calvin and then awesome players around them.\n\nMINOR:Calvin was a big and strong first basemen and had a great personality. He always had a smile on his face, but when the game started he was really competitive.\n\nSOCCI: Calvin Pickering never became the player that he was forecast to be but there are a lot of guys like him. Ryan Minor was really popular player on that team.\n\nPICKERING: We had Ryan and I as the one-two punch, and with the other guys around us we were very good. We had a lot of confidence coming to Delmarva after Bluefield. We had speed, power and good defense. Everyone did their part.\n\nMINOR: We ran into Bill Murray once. He was the part owner of the Charleston team down in South Carolina and we were playing a night game there. He was in the crowd hooting and hollering and was giving stuff out to the kids. He came down to us after the game and talked to us and he signed a bat for me and I gave it to my wife.\n\nSOCCI: I remember that. (Bill Murray) was on the field playing catch after the game. He was an investor to that team and after the game he hopped on to the field over on the third base side and started playing catch with the guys.\n\nRight after fans were introduced to the new team, they were introduced to a new room in Arthur W. Perdue Stadium that included decades of history.\n\nA half-century before the Shorebirds arrived on Delmarva, there was the Eastern Shore League, and through its stints of active play from 1922 to 1949, many prominent players played in the league. Guys like Frank “Home Run” Baker, Jimmie Foxx, Red Ruffing, Mickey Cochrane, Don Zimmer and Jack Sanford played for teams that stretched from Cambridge, Easton, Crisfield, Dover, Rehoboth, Milford, Pocomoke, Federalsburg and Salisbury.\n\nIn a 1996 interview with Maryland Magazine, Frank Perdue talked about how much of his love for baseball was forged during the Eastern Shore League’s 1937 season. Salisbury’s team, a Washington Senators affiliate, started that season with a 21-6 record but forfeited their wins due to using an ineligible player. But the team fought on, and climbed its way back into contention and won the league pennant that year after Joe Coleman pitched a no-hitter to close the season.\n\nThe history of baseball on the Eastern Shore was rich, but the memories of those teams and players in the forms of photos, scorecards, uniforms and other memorabilia didn’t have a home. But when Arthur W. Perdue Stadium was being built, an extra room was installed.\n\nOn May 24, 1997, the Eastern Shore Baseball Hall of Fame opened its doors for the first time.\n\nDUNN: The stadium was a great location for the Eastern Shore Baseball Hall of Fame and it was important to fans. You got to give the people who planned the stadium out credit for including that in the stadium so you could see all the older guys who played ball back in the day when baseball was really big here.\n\nMACKES: The idea was to put the Hall of Fame at the Henry S. Parker complex, but when the stadium came into fruition it was a no-brainer to move the location to the stadium. Frank included that space at no cost to the Hall of Fame. The only thing we had to do was secure a state grant for $100,000 to furnish that space and equip it. The late senator Joe Long was very involved in helping us secure that money.\n\nKIRK: As we met with the local business leaders, politicians and the baseball leagues, we found that there was a group there that had an archive of old memorabilia and when we met with them they were looking for a home. We all just decided that the natural place would be to have a room in the stadium to have that entire memorabilia to be displayed.\n\nSOCCI: The fact that they were building this museum at the stadium was unlike anything I had been a part of in the minor leagues. Other teams didn’t care about the past history of their region. It wasn’t the typical minor league experience. It helped bring back to life this great baseball history of the Eastern Shore and places like Easton and Cambridge.\n\nSTEVE “SUPERFAN” MORAN, season ticket holder: I think it was really important to have that here. It goes back into the history of baseball on the Eastern Shore and it shows people all of the guys that played here, some of which made it to the major leagues.\n\nMINOR: I know a lot of guys that have been inducted into the Hall of Fame here. It’s pretty neat to be able to walk through and see the history of some of the baseball that has been played here on the Eastern Shore.\n\nPASSWATER: They say that it’s one of the Eastern Shore’s best-kept secrets. Most people aren’t aware of it. They walk by and they say, “Well, how much does this cost?” and they figure out that it’s free and they go in and really enjoy it. There is some amazing stuff in there.\n\nFLEETWOOD, Eastern Shore Baseball Hall of Fame Inductee; 2014: If you go back into the old Eastern Shore Baseball League, you had some big dogs playing in those games. To be able to go to the stadium and walk through that is really cool. To me, that’s part of the whole experience.\n\nAs the 1997 season went on, Pickering and Minor truly became a lethal one-two punch in the middle of the lineup. With other solid players on the team like Carlos Casimiro, Luis Matos and Scott Eibey the Shorebirds were rolling towards wins, and a spot in the SAL playoffs seemed like a sure thing.\n\nPerdue always had a front row seat to all the action, often setting himself up in the press box next to Socci.\n\nPERDUE: Dad loved watching those guys and he wanted to know who was doing what, who was batting and what the stats were. That was the place to do it, to sit right next to the play-by-play man.\n\nSOCCI: Frank was really a fan. He wanted to know about different players that the Shorebirds were playing. He’d sit there with a stat sheet and drink his soda right in the press box.\n\nPERDUE: Dad didn’t need that red phone to call down to the dugout to find out something.\n\nKIRK: Frank used to call Peter Angelos at like 7 a.m. and would be saying, “The closer you gave us last night blew the game, you got to give us a new one.” He was so into the baseball aspect of things.\n\nPERDUE: Dad would go to all of the away games, which was nice, because the more he was with the Shorebirds, the less he was with the business. He wouldn’t ride with the team, but he would meet them there, especially if it was a playoff game.\n\nMINOR: I saw him around the ballpark a few times and we would occasionally see him on road trips. Frank was very interested in and involved with the ball club.\n\nPICKERING:I saw Frank a couple of times at the field and different functions. He would invite the whole team to his house for parties. He was a good guy.\n\nMINOR: Back then teams usually left players in one spot. So if you started the year out somewhere teams kept you there unless you were at the higher levels. So I stayed here the whole year and we ended up winning the championship.\n\nKIRK: We kind of really struggled through the playoffs. We had a bunch of rainouts because a big tropical storm came through.\n\nMINOR: I don’t know if it was a hurricane or what, but we missed a few doubleheaders. We played in the championship series at Greensboro, and I know we had to wait a couple of days because of the water that came through the stadium. It filled up the dugouts and took a few days to dry out.\n\nRyan Minor was named to the SAL All-Star team and led the Shorebirds in RBI’s with 97 and hits with 150. Calvin Pickering blasted 25 home runs and ended the season with a slugging percentage of .554. In front of a crowd of 1,414 in Greensboro, North Carolina, the hard-throwing Gabe Molina struck out two batters with the bases loaded in the eighth inning and the Shorebirds scored two more runs in the ninth to go on and win the game, 8-1, and their first SAL title.\n\nKIRK: That was a fantastic season. Winning a championship at any level of baseball is awesome. It doesn’t happen often. It takes a lot of hard work, but it also takes a lot of luck.\n\n1997 was a fun ride for Kirk, Perdue, Lupton and the Shorebirds. Not only had they brought baseball to the Eastern Shore, but they brought a winning product that fans enjoyed. However, the next two seasons wouldn’t be full of so many wins. Still, fans were able to enjoy the early playing days of future MLB players such as Jayson Werth.\n\nKIRK: Jayson Werth was this clean cut and skinny catcher.\n\nSOCCI: I always liked Jayson. He was a guy who was really talented. He was a catcher back then, but he was a guy who was a bit misunderstood. The impression was very contrary to what my experience was with him.\n\nDUNN: Werth had the funny stance with his knees together and feet spread out at the bottom. I thought, “How in the world can somebody hit like that?” But he did. You wondered with how fast he was and, with his height, if would stay as a catcher.\n\nSOCCI: He was trying to be a catcher, but a catcher who could run. He ran into some health issues, but he persevered. People realize now that there was a lot of substance behind his style.\n\nIn an effort to establish a fall baseball league here in the United States, Major League Baseball reached out to Kirk, Lupton and Maryland Baseball about forming a small league. There were four teams and one of them was the Delmarva Rockfish. The Maryland Fall League, as it was named, lasted just one season, and in that time the Rockfish went 21-20 while the Frederick Regiment won the league's only title. Milton Bradley, an MLB All-Star in 2008, played with the Rockfish and hit for the league’s highest average with a .330 mark. However, Bradley was suspended at the end of the year for a confrontation with umpire Matt Schaeffer.\n\nKIRK: We were approached by the commissioner’s office who had this idea of a domestic fall league. We had our fall and winter leagues outside of the country, but they wanted a domestic one. So we put together a four-team league with Delmarva, Bowie, Wilmington and Frederick, and the major league teams did a grouping, so each one of those teams had like, six major league clubs to it made up of their best young players.\n\nPOTTS: We did everything for that team too, because it was still Maryland Baseball. I did the same kind of bookkeeping for that team as I did for the Shorebirds.\n\nMINOR: I didn’t play for them because I was playing in a fall league in Arizona at the time, but my brother played on that team.\n\nKIRK: Milton Bradley had an interesting reputation. I got a call from Keith saying, “He just blew up at an umpire.” I wasn’t there, but I think he actually threw a punch.\n\nDUNN: I was here for that. Bradley was going after coaches, umpires, he just didn’t care. You didn’t know what he was going to do next.\n\nMINOR: Yea, I heard about that. He had some issues with umpires every once in a while. I actually played with Milton in Montreal when I got traded there.\n\nPOTTS: It was very cold though. One night we did a glove giveaway at the last minute. We went to all the hardware stores and bought up the gloves and gave those away so people could keep their hands warm.\n\nLike the baseball players he talked about on the radio, Socci had done his time in the minors and he was ready to move on. He continued to be the voice of the Naval Academy’s football and basketball teams for a number of years while also calling minor league games in Frederick and other areas. He is now the lead play-by-play man for the New England Patriots.\n\nSHANE GRIFFIN, Shorebirds’ play-by-play voice; 1999-2003: It was always a dream of mine to do play-by-play announcing. I put together a resume and tapes and sent them to every team in Low and High-A ball and the only call I got back was from the Shorebirds. Bob Socci was heading out and the position opened up.\n\nIn 1999, the Shorebirds not only welcomed future MLB All-Star Brian Roberts and the South Atlantic League All-Star Game to Delmarva, but it was also the year that the team’s mascot, Sherman, was hatched.\n\nKIRK: I can’t remember when we introduced Sherman, but it wasn’t initially. Keith had a theory that you didn’t do too much too quickly and that you allowed the team and the fan base to develop its own personality.\n\nDUNN: I remember the guy that was in the costume was a little daredevil. He would be on the roof of the stadium, sliding across the dugout, I don’t how he didn’t kill himself. He smashed into the railing a few times. He was a soccer player at Pocomoke.\n\nPASSWATER: The first Sherman was crazy. He was something. He would be on the roof, on the fence, he would mimic the batter on deck – that really irritated the other teams. But the fans loved him. He drove in sometimes on this three-wheel all-terrain thing. He never did anything sane, safe or sensibly. He would risk himself quite a bit for a laugh.\n\nDUNN: I don’t think he was here a full season. Roberts was one of those guys where you could see right away that he was going to be a star. They moved him up pretty quickly.\n\nKIRK: The All-Star game is always fun. We brought the league officials and front office people into town. At that time we had the highest attendance of any team in the league. It wasn’t just the game, but the host city got to run seminars and things for all of the other teams.\n\nGRIFFIN: The All-Star game that year was pretty cool. Those few days were just amazing. Boog Powell came down and I introduced him at the All-Star luncheon, which was a highlight for me.\n\nDUNN: We had started the fan club in 1998, and the front office had asked us if we would help set up for the All-Star game, so I remember being out there putting up balloons and helping out with ushers. They didn’t have a large staff. I sat next to the snack bar and was blowing up balloons all day.\n\nAfter a tough 1999 season, the Shorebirds got back to their winning ways at the turn of the century. 2000 didn’t bring any stars to Delmarva, but the team was a solid group that won more games than expected.\n\nJoe Ferguson was introduced as the manager and during his time on Delmarva he amassed a record of 211 wins and 205 losses. In 1999, then Orioles director of player development Tom Trebelhorn told the Daily Times that, “Of all our guys, Joe is probably the most rounded as a teacher and in-game management.”\n\nIn Ferguson’s first season, the Shorebirds’ earned a wild card berth into the playoffs that ended in dramatic fashion right in Arthur W. Perdue Stadium.\n\nGRIFFIN: That year was incredible because in 1999 we finished dead last. So we went worst to first. That was a special team. It wasn’t full of stars, but we had guys like Willie Harris, Matt Riordon and Napoleon Calzado who knew their role and did their job.\n\nHarris, who would go on to have a 12-year career in Major League Baseball, set the Shorebirds’ team record that season for runs scored with 106.\n\nGRIFFIN: Calzado was there pretty much the whole year and was a staple at third base. Most of those guys stayed at least 75 percent of the season at that time. Erik Bedard was a big part of that pitching staff in 2000, too. He was solid.\n\nBedard led the Shorebirds in strikeouts with 131 and finished the season with a 9-4 record.\n\nGRIFFIN: We caught fire near the end of the season. They just gelled at the right time. We just seemed to get the timely hits and the timely pitching.\n\nKIRK: That 2000 Championship was special for our fans. Except for maybe Hagerstown, the other teams really aren’t close enough for them to visit.\n\nDUNN: A strikeout on a wild pitch. Ray Cabrera was on third, he was like a cheerleader for the team, a fan favorite, and he came home and scored.\n\nPASSWATER: Mike Seestedt struck out and we had runners on first and third. The ball went past the catcher and Mike just stood there, so everyone is yelling, “Run Mike! Run!” And finally he takes off, and he would’ve been out, but the first basemen came up to cover the catcher. By the time the second basemen came over, Mike, who wasn’t the fastest guy in the world, had already gotten to first. Game over, we won the championship.\n\nKIRK: To win the championship at home was extra special.\n\nPeter Kirk and Maryland Baseball had been in Delmarva for five years. By teaming with Frank Perdue, they brought professional baseball to a region that longed for a team of its own for some time. But everyone has a price.\n\nPERDUE: My dad continued to have a close relationship with (Kirk and Lupton) at Maryland Baseball for a number of years until he felt it was time to get out of the business side of it. But he still continued to come here and go to the games, so much that they named the press box after him.\n\nKIRK: Comcast had owned a basketball team and a hockey team already and they really wanted to get into baseball. They came to us and made us an offer that we could not refuse. They bought the three teams in Delmarva, Frederick and Bowie in a package.\n\nGRIFFIN: It was a pretty seamless change. I remember Frank Miceli (Comcast Vice President of Minor League Operations) coming in and sitting us down behind home plate and just telling us that they were going to continue with the way things have gone, but that they were going to make a few changes to try and be a bit more profitable and bring better shows to the fans.\n\nPOTTS: It was a bigger organization, but I didn’t notice much of a difference.\n\nGRIFFIN: There were obviously some other changes that I wasn’t aware of that was above my paygrade. But the day-to-day things for me didn’t really change.\n\nFLEETWOOD: When Comcast came in it was really more business oriented. It really wasn’t as much focused on the community, at least I didn’t think so.\n\nDUNN: The Maryland Baseball guys were pretty nice people. Comcast didn’t really have a big interest in it being a baseball team. I think a lot of people felt the same way and that it was just another thing to own and if we lost money they didn’t care. They really didn’t take care of the stadium and the attendance and services dipped down, too.\n\nComcast’s reign over the Shorebirds didn’t bring many star players on Delmarva, or many winning seasons. But, future Oriole and Atlanta Brave Nick Markakis spent some time in Salisbury in 2004, playing in 96 games and hitting for an average of .299.\n\nPASSWATER: Nick actually used to be a pitcher. He had a 90-mile-per-hour heater with some good control. So that’s why he had that great arm from right field. When they drafted him, the question was should we develop him as a pitcher or an outfielder?\n\nWALT McCABE, season ticket holder: You could see who wasn’t going to be here very long and Markakis was one of those guys. He was really good here and then he went on to play in the Olympics that year for Greece.\n\nSalisbury native Randy Scott took over as the play-by-play man in 2005 and as he tells it, the Shorebirds didn’t have many names on their roster that stuck out over the next few seasons, but they often played teams with future MLB all-stars.\n\nRANDY SCOTT, Shorebirds play-by-play voice; 2005-2009: The 2005 team was full of guys who didn’t really have a chance, but were solid together at that level. I think the Orioles’ minor league system was a lot different then. They picked up players to have decent minor league teams, just to fill rosters, but weren’t really guys who they had planned on being the future of the Orioles. I think that quickly changed the next year. In 2006 it seemed like they were drafting with a little bit more of a purpose and they were changing their philosophy. They started to actually build the minor league system because the Orioles weren’t doing very well.\n\nThe 2005 Shorebirds won 72 games. Jason Fransz led the team in hitting with a batting average of .308, 22 home runs and 111 RBI’s. Erik Bedard did a rehab stint in Delmarva, pitching five innings and striking out nine batters in a win.\n\nSCOTT: Andrew McCutchen was great. He came to Delmarva in 2006. He was coming up with the Hickory Crawdads. You could tell right away that he was a talent.\n\nAt 19 years old, McCutchen played in 114 games with the Crawdads, who were a Pittsburgh Pirates affiliate in 2006. McCutchen hit 14 home runs, stole 22 bases, notched 62 RBI’s and batted for an average of .291. Playing in three games at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium that season, he notched five hits and stole a base. Current Oriole Steve Pearce also played for the Crawdads in 2006.\n\nSCOTT: There were some decent Shorebirds during that time that made it up. Brandon Snider had a cup of tea in the bigs. Pedro Florimon had a walk off hit (on Aug. 18, 2015) for the Pirates the other night. He’s a guy that was good.\n\nPedro Florimon played in 192 games for the Shorebirds between the 2007 and 2008 seasons. Snider played in 156 games for the Shorebirds between the 2006 and 2007 seasons and hit 14 home runs, drew 53 walks and knocked in 78 runs in that time.\n\nDuring Scott’s time as a broadcaster for the Shorebirds was also when Steve Moran became “Superfan” as the season ticket holder became notorious for hanging glasses on the net behind home plate after bad calls from the umpires.\n\nMORAN: I hang glasses up here behind home plate when there is a bad call. I started doing that probably around, 2007. I have 13 pairs of glasses that I bring with me. There’s a guy in West Virginia that throws toast in the air when a pitcher strikes someone out, and I hang glasses for bad calls from the umpire. There’s this book on the various minor league teams, and when you get to the Shorebirds’ page it says other than Sherman, you have to check out the Superfan, and that’s me. It was something fun to do.\n\nAfter owning the Shorebirds for a few seasons, Comcast was ready to sell. In November 2006, 7th Inning Stretch LLC purchased the Delmarva Shorebirds and has owned them since. To many of the staff members and fans, the switch in owners and general manager was noticed right away. 7th Inning Stretch made the impression on Delmarva that they cared about the team, the fans and the community.\n\nThe face of their efforts was Chris Bitters, a California native who has been the team’s general manager since 2006.Under the direction of Bitters, the Shorebirds saw attendance increase, a new stadium sound system installed, a kids play area expansion, an upgraded parking lot, playing surface, stadium structures and new logos were introduced in addition to 7th Inning Stretch playing a big role in hosting numerous baseball and non-baseball events at the stadium for the community.\n\nCHRIS BITTERS, Shorebirds’ general manager since 2006: I came here in the fall of 2006 and you could tell that it was a team that the community was passionate about.\n\nFLEETWOOD: When Chris Bitters and his people came in it got back to that family thing like what it was before under Maryland Baseball.\n\nSCOTT: There was definitely a change of the guard in philosophy, because it was more than just a general manager change – there was an ownership change, too.\n\nDUNN: When Chris came in it went in the complete other way of where Comcast was. The attendance started to go up again. I think he does a great job. They take care of the fans the best that they can.\n\nBITTERS: I was a “come here” and I’m about as far as you can come, but I knew the team was embraced by the community and my job was to really ramp that up and I think we have done a really good job over my nine years of engaging the community even more.\n\nSCOTT: It was just more focused on the team and not the owners and management. Chris really emphasized that it was going to be about the team and the community. Our fans don’t care who own the team.\n\nFLEETWOOD: In my opinion, this community is very fortunate to have Chris Bitters and Ryan Minor around. It’s not all about the team. They really care about the community. He and Ryan Minor have been the faces of the team since they got here.\n\nMACKES: We’ve gone through three owners of the franchise, and I got to say, Maryland Baseball was very good, but the people we have right now in 7th Inning Stretch is just as good.\n\nBITTERS: There was one night where I was watching the game and I was standing behind home plate. Sherman used to ride around and toss candy into the stands and there was this dad, probably about my age, and his daughter, probably 4 or 5 or so, sitting behind the net behind home plate. And Sherman is riding around, but he can’t throw the candy way up over the net, so the little girl gets upset and starts crying. So I radio over to whoever was with Sherman and told them to bring a big handful of candy. So Sherman walks up to the little girl and dumps a pile of candy into her lap. Those kinds of experiences are what I enjoy most.\n\nArthur W. Perdue Stadium has played host to several events in its 20-year history. Artists like Kenny Chesney, the Blues Brothers, Martina McBride, Montgomery Gentry and Lynard Skynard have performed concerts there. It has been a host for baseball events like the Bayside Conference High School Championship, the Bi-State rivalry – a slate of games played between Maryland and Delaware high school baseball teams – and the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Baseball tournament, among other events.\n\nBITTERS: We were involved on the ground level when the county first got involved with bringing USSSA here in 2007. It was like 60 or 80 teams and we thought bringing that many teams to Wicomico was a big deal and then it doubled the next year and we started hosting the opening ceremonies here at the ballpark.\n\nPERDUE: This stadium has been a great venue for other things too. Softball, concerts, boxing, anything.\n\nBut the one night at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium that many people remember vividly wasn’t a baseball game or a concert. It was a boxing match. More than 5,000 people flooded the diamond to get close to the ring where Parkside-high product Fernando Guerrero earned the NABO Interim Middleweight title on an October night in 2009 with an impressive 10 round majority decision over Ossie Duran.\n\nHAL CHERNOFF, boxing trainer: We got a lot of feedback from the community that, as nice as it was to do the fights at the Civic Center, people wanted to be able to drink an alcoholic beverage during the event. The people at the Shorebirds’ stadium were very easy to work with and it just made sense to give it a try.\n\nBITTERS: It was during the two-year run where he did a lot fights locally.\n\nFERNANDO GUERRERO, professional boxer, Salisbury native: It just made sense to have it there. The stadium is massive and families go there so much that it was just a no-brainer.\n\nSCOTT: His fights were always big inside the Civic Center, but you expected that. This just had a cool and different feel because it was outside on this baseball diamond.\n\nPOTTS: I didn’t really go outside much for the fight. I was in the office mostly dealing with the boxing people. It was exciting, though. Just something different.\n\nSCOTT: We were able to cover that for what used to be 95.9 The Sports Animal. The crowd was wild, it was a fun night.\n\nBRET LASKY, Shorebirds’ play-by-play voice; 2009-2013: It was pretty interesting. Chris and the team were trying to grow the events outside of baseball and Guerrero was a big name in Salisbury and it was cool to bring something else to the ballpark.\n\nBITTERS: The boxing ring was right on top of the pitcher’s mound and we had seats right on the field. It was really cool.\n\nSCOTT: They had to deal with some moisture on the mat, so there were definitely some variables that they weren’t used to.\n\nCHERNOFF: When the dew started to settle on the mat it became very slick and it was causing a problem. It certainly caused Fernando to make an adjustment. Can you imagine holding a boxing match on a frozen pond? That’s basically what we had. Everything turned into a delicate process of trying to fight without slipping.\n\nGUERRERO: I went to throw a punch and I slipped and they called it a knockdown. My legs just got tangled up because it was so slippery.\n\nCHERNOFF: It was colder there than any indoor venue in the country would have been. Ossie’s corner was putting a ton of water on him, so much that the commission threatened to stop the fight if they put any more water on him because it got to the point where they were dumping water on him to make the condition of the mat even worse. When they saw Fernando slip, they started going with that. Ossie would position himself on the canvas of the mat that wasn’t painted and Fernando was on ice.\n\nSCOTT: I remember the lighting being a bit of issue, too, but the atmosphere was electric. Fernando was a hot prospect then and the community was really behind him.\n\nGUERRERO: It was the first time I fought for a title and it was outdoors and the whole experience was awesome. It was like my Muhammad Ali “Thrilla in Manilla” moment.\n\nCHERNOFF: We pulled it off and got a win. People really enjoyed watching a fight there.\n\nLASKY: For me, it was cool to learn how baseball teams generate revenue outside of baseball. Before I came to the Shorebirds I just knew broadcasting and a little bit about media relations. Then all of a sudden I was learning how to run non-baseball events. It wasn’t just about the 60 or 70 home games.\n\nGUERRERO: Winning there kind of made me feel like I was a part of the baseball team. The Shorebirds have always been big for me. That’s the team I rooted for growing up. A couple of players were at the fight. Then after all that we did the Guerrero “Bobble Gloves” night. I have a lot of good memories in that stadium. Of course, you can never forget their fireworks.\n\nAcross the country there are towns that have a minor league baseball team and a collegiate baseball team. Often, those two teams will play against each other in an exhibition game. But for the first 14 years of its existence, two teams that shared significant bonds to Frank Perdue - the Delmarva Shorebirds and the Salisbury University Sea Gulls - never shared the same field.\n\nThat changed in 2010, when the efforts of Bitters, Ryan Minor and Doug Fleetwood paid off.\n\nFLEETWOOD: Ryan Minor always wanted to do it because they don’t play under the lights in spring training.\n\nMINOR: The front office had been asking the Orioles to do it for years, and they finally gave them the ok to do it.\n\nBITTERS: That was something that we had wanted to do since I got here in 2007 and it just took a little while to get it lined up between the Orioles and Salisbury and Coach Fleetwood.\n\nDUNN: You get a lot of students out for that game, almost half the crowd, which is great. They’re here for most of the spring season so you love to see them out there.\n\nBITTERS: Every minor league team I have worked with likes to do that, to have an exhibition against a local college. Its great exposure for the college guys and it’s great for the community to see two local teams. It’s really a community event.\n\nFLEETWOOD: He told me one year that he had a couple of guys from the Dominican Republic that had never played under the lights.\n\nMINOR: It gives us a chance to acclimate to the environment. It’s a bit colder up here than it is down in Florida after spring training.\n\nFLEETWOOD: They kind of played by our rules. I remember the first year doing it, Ryan Minor and I were standing at home plate with the umpires before the game and we were talking about collision plays at second base, because in college you can’t hit the guy and in the pros you can knock them into left field, and Ryan said they would back off. They went out of their way to make it work. Now, we do play by their rules with the bats. Our kids play with wooden bats in the summer anyways, so it wasn’t a big deal.\n\nBITTERS: For us as an operation it’s kind of a warm-up, so when we had around 3,000 people show up that first year we did it we were completely stunned. The community really embraces that game.\n\nThe 2011 team might have been the most fun team the Shorebirds ever had. That season, with Ryan Minor as the skipper, the Delmarva Shorebirds had two future Orioles in Manny Machado and Jonathon Schoop sharing a middle infield and playing in Salisbury.\n\nThe two players are very close friends now who share a unique handshake that was birthed in the dugout at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium. Machado was the number two overall pick from the previous season’s MLB draft, but while fans bought their tickets and poured into Arthur W. Perdue Stadium to see him play, they couldn’t ignore Schoop either.\n\nIn a short time, both players would bulldoze their way through the minors and make themselves into vital cornerstones for the Baltimore Orioles.But anyone from the Eastern Shore will be quick to remind others that, with Machado and Schoop, it all started in Salisbury.\n\nJONATHON SCHOOP, Delmarva Shorebirds infielder; 2011: The year before I came to Delmarva they said I was going to be playing shortstop, but then they drafted Manny.\n\nMANNY MACHADO, Delmarva Shorebirds shortstop; 2011: (Schoop and I) met at spring training. We were both out there catching grounders at shortstop, so we had time to chat and get to know each other.\n\nBITTERS: That was an awesome season.\n\nLASKY: We got a lot of requests from the local and national media for him and Manny was fantastic with all of them. It was just cool to ride the bus with him and be a small part in his early development. I think everyone knew that he was a special kid and that he was going to be a star.\n\nMACHADO: I wasn’t sure if I was going to Delmarva. I got drafted and went to rookie league and then I wasn’t sure if it would be Delmarva or Frederick.\n\nFLEETWOOD: The year Machado was here he didn’t play against us. I think the Orioles said, “Oh no. Don’t let him get around those college guys. They might stumble into him or something.”\n\nDUNN: Everyone knew about Manny, so his first game everyone came out and you could already see that this kid was the real deal. He was something special.\n\nMACHADO: Delmarva was fun. We got a pretty decent crowd most nights. It was a great first experience in professional baseball.\n\nDUNN: Jonathon Schoop was at second and Manny was at shortstop and you could just see that those guys were special.\n\nMATTES: It was just fun watching those guys. You look at that middle infield and there is Schoop and Machado. Within the next two years, there in Baltimore. The same year they were in Delmarva, you had Jurickson Profar playing in Hickory and Bryce Harper in Hagerstown. It was an awesome year for the league.\n\nMINOR, Delmarva Shorebirds’ manager; 2010-2012, 2014-present: Manny had a great work ethic at such a young age and it was impressive to see him handle the spotlight and the media pressure at just 18 years old.\n\nSCHOOP: Ryan Minor was a really good manager. He let you play the game. He just let you be you. He was big for me because that was my first full season.\n\nMACHADO: He wants you to play the game, but to be yourself. Ryan Minor taught me how to be a professional.\n\nBITTERS: Machado had a lot of hype around him, but not quite as much as Harper because he was the number one overall pick. But Machado was awesome. He’s a great guy and was really willing to do whatever we wanted.\n\nLASKY: I just remember Manny being a guy that everybody liked. He was everybody’s best friend. I’m sure sometimes I was a pain in his rear, but he helped me with whatever I needed.\n\nDUNN: I always like the way he carried himself and the way he played. He didn’t have a big ego. Which was nice, because Bryce Harper was playing for Hagerstown that same year and he was the opposite.\n\nMINOR: Manny was so good in a lot of different ways. He was swinging the bat well and we were playing here on a Saturday night once and it was packed. He had a 3-0 count and I gave him the green light. Usually you don’t swing on 3-0 but he was hitting so well so I let him swing away and he hit it over the scoreboard here. In this ballpark, that’s tough. You don’t see that very often.\n\nMORAN: When Machado hit one over that scoreboard? Man, that was incredible. Even Calvin Pickering never hit a ball that far. It went right over the CareFirst sign.\n\nMACHADO: That was one of the best games of my career. I was swinging the bat well, I had a hot week, and he gave me the green light. That’s the first time I’ve ever swung 3-0 and I think that’s one of the hardest balls I’ve ever hit.\n\nLASKY: That was the one. I think I still have that radio call. When that happened Steve Melewski from MASN asked me for the call and put it up on his blog. That’s a moment I’ll never forget. He just absolutely crushed the ball. It sailed over the scoreboard. I’ve never seen anybody hit a ball that hard in my life and I’ve watched a lot of baseball games. That was by far the farthest ball I’ve ever seen anybody hit.\n\nPASSWATER: When Manny was injured and Schoop got his opportunity, there were some of us who were under the impression that Schoop was a better shortstop than Manny while the two were here.\n\nMINOR: He started playing third base and played some second base as well, but when Manny got hurt Jon did play shortstop before he moved up. He was just one of those guys that could play anywhere on the infield and he has a really high baseball I.Q.\n\nLASKY: Jonathon was a heck of a kid. I really liked being around him. He had a young personality and was always joking around. You knew he was going to be a star. He was amazing at third base and then they shifted him around everywhere. His arm was incredible.\n\nSCHOOP: I was a little nervous at first to move to third, but Minor and my teammates helped me out. We had a great team that year.\n\nMACHADO: Did the handshake start there? I think it did. I don’t think it was as defined then as it is now. We started doing it after double plays.\n\nPASSWATER: That was quite a year. Those two became really close friends here.\n\nIn addition to having a roster that featured Machado and Schoop, it was also the year that the Shorebirds would host the South Atlantic League All-Star Game. They hadn’t done so since 1999 and a lot changed in years since. Bitters and his staff started planning a year away and teamed with an old friend, Perdue Farms, to sponsor the event.Perdue Farms, the Shorebirds and other SAL Teams raised over 250,000 meal equivalents for local food banks. Fans engulfed Arthur W. Perdue Stadium for the game and autograph sessions featuring SAL All-Stars Machado and Bryce Harper, and also Orioles’ legends like Earl Weaver.\n\nBITTERS: With Bryce Harper and Manny Machado I think we had one of the coolest All-Star games ever here. There are quite a few guys that played in that game that are in the big leagues now. It was kind of weird that Schoop didn’t make the all-star team, but he was great for us.\n\nLASKY: It was just a really long process. We started probably a year before and we never stopped. Even a year out, we were having weekly meetings about this all-star game.\n\nDUNN: We helped with some of the decorations before, but Chris was like, “I’m not going to use you guys during the game because you guys are the fans and you deserve to watch the game.” That’s one thing about Chris, he knows we’re fans first and he looks out for us.\n\nBITTERS: It was a big crowd and we had great events surrounding it. We were really able to showcase the community during that run. I think we did Delmarva proud that night.\n\nMACHADO: That weekend was fun. It was my first career all-star game. To start your career off with an all-star game in the town you’re playing for was a great experience.\n\nLASKY: I remember standing by Manny and Bryce Harper and those guys and the line was from the visitor’s club house all the way down to where cars come in so fans could get an autograph from these guys. When I was standing by Bryce there was this one lady who brought up four or five different items, but we had to limit the items just to move the line along.\n\nBITTERS: I always felt like the fans and the media were bashing (Harper) pretty hard, but every interaction I had with him was great. He signed autographs before our games here and after the games he would sign for like a half hour. It still wasn’t enough for the fans, apparently. From my perspective, the criticism of him wasn’t warranted.\n\nSCOTT: Bryce Harper wasn’t the nicest guy off the field with the media, but he had an appreciation for the fans.\n\nBITTERS: We had Earl Weaver here signing autographs here. The line was from the center concourse all the way to the right field foul pole.\n\nLASKY: I was walking Earl from the concourse over to Scott Abraham for a live shot that night and it had to be at a certain time. So we’re walking through and some fan comes up to Earl and it was very crowded and the fan says something like, “Hey Earl, sorry to bother you,” and in typical Earl-fashion he says, “Well then don’t bother me.” And he didn’t mean it in a bad way, but it just personified him. He ended up signing the autograph for the lady anyway. I didn’t grow up an Orioles fan, so I didn’t realize how much people adored him. So that was cool to see.\n\nBITTERS: I always joke that the first professional all-star game that Manny Machado and Bryce Harper played together in was right here in Salisbury.\n\nMachado, Schoop, Harper and the SAL All Star Game were all in Delmarva in one season. But, 2011 wasn’t over just yet for the Shorebirds. What way could they make that season better?\n\nBitters and his staff came up with the most Eastern Shore promotion night that one could think of.\n\nOn Aug. 12, 2011, the Shorebirds hosted a salute to scrapple.\n\nBITTERS: We made these t-shirts and they were similar to the “I HEART NY” shirts, except we replaced NY with a picture of scrapple. We bought the shirts for the staff just to wear, but the fans loved them. One guy came up to me and was like, “I’ll give you $40 for the shirt off your back, right now.” I wish I would’ve bought thousands of them to give away in the gift shop.\n\nSCOTT: I love scrapple. I still have the t-shirt.\n\nMINOR: I do like scrapple. I had no idea what it was until my wife introduced me to it when I first moved here, but living here since 1997 I’m real familiar with scrapple. I remember the eating contest and all of that here.\n\nBITTERS: We did a salute to scrapple right before the start of the game. Everyone had a toothpick with a little piece on it and that was the unofficial world record for the most people eating scrapple in one place at one time.\n\nPASSWATER: They had a scrapple-carving contest and fans would vote on scrapple sculptures. You got free scrapple too, it was delicious. I went back two or three times.\n\nMcCABE: That’s a local thing. I’m a “come here” and we don’t eat scrapple, with all due respect.\n\n2011 was going to be a tough act to follow. Machado and Schoop had moved on by then, but the Shorebirds and their fans had to brace themselves for another player with star power. His name was Dylan Bundy and he was a pitcher taken by the Orioles with the fourth overall pick in the 2011 MLB draft. Play-by-play man Brett Lasky described the nights that Bundy pitched in Salisbury as “an event.” People who usually didn’t come to Arthur W. Perdue Stadium were coming out just to see Bundy take the mound.\n\nIn eight starts for the Shorebirds, Bundy pitched 30 innings before the Orioles promoted him to Frederick. He registered one win, struck out 40 batters, gave up just five hits and left Delmarva with an earned-run-average of zero.\n\nMATTES: On any given pitch, Bundy could hit 100 miles an hour. He had unbelievable control for how old he was.\n\nLASKY: His 30 innings here were ridiculous. He was dominating everybody.\n\nDUNN: Once the word got out about Bundy and people knew who he was, every game he pitched those nights were very well attended. He was awesome.\n\nMcCABE: Bundy didn’t play a whole lot. He was only 18, so they would pitch him for a few innings, then take him to the dugout and throw a jacket on him.\n\nMINOR: That was the thing with Dylan. He was on an innings limit to start the year.\n\nPASSWATER: A few games of three innings and a few games of four innings and then he was off to Frederick. He was electric.\n\nMORAN: They had guys sitting right here next to me (behind home plate) counting pitches for Bundy to make sure he didn’t go over his limit.\n\nMINOR: He had that hitless and scoreless streak going on for a long time. Dylan dominated here. He had an above average fastball and his breaking ball was advanced.\n\nLASKY: Every time Dylan pitched I knew that more people were listening. It was a big deal when he was pitching. It just felt more important.\n\nMcCABE: Whenever Bundy pitched it was “Bun-day” night. Chris Bitters liked when he pitched because we were selling more tickets and more hot dogs.\n\nOn Sept. 2, the Shorebirds concluded 20 years at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium with a 7-1 victory over the Hickory Crawdads. The win capped off a five-game home sweep of the Crawdads for the Shorebirds and they moved to 69-64 on the year. Matt Grimes struck out two batters and secured his 10th win of the season. The night was highlighted by Steve Wilkerson’s three-run homer. Doug Newton, who took over for Brett Lasky after the 2013 season as the lead play-by-play voice of the Shorebirds, called the game on Fox Sports 960 and after the final out, he topped it off with his trademark call.\n\n“Goodnight, Irene!”\n\n20 years of minor league baseball in Delmarva had come and gone.\n\nFor the first time in many years, the Shorebirds will receive major updates to their home, beginning this offseason. The first order of business will be to upgrade the playing surface, then a new video board will be installed and the concourse will be extended in addition to a flurry of other upgrades. Arthur W. Perdue Stadium has, and will continue to, serve as a great venue for professional baseball. 10 years after his death, it is safe to say that Frank Perdue’s dream has been realized. Eastern Shore folk don’t have to go to Baltimore or Washington to see good baseball.\n\nBITTERS: Frank Perdue’s original vision was that, on a Thursday night you didn’t have to make the drive all the way to Camden Yards to see professional baseball, you can do it right here in your backyard, have a good time and still get to work the next day.\n\nPERDUE: At this point, I’m a fan. I don’t have the total passion that my dad had, but I try to get out here a few times a year. I don’t sit in the press box like he did.\n\nMACKES: Before Frank died, he called me on my cell phone and he was perplexed. He asked me a question and he said to me, “Gary, can the county ever change the name of the stadium?” And in the agreement, the county council and the executive hold that authority where they could do that. The only thing I could say to Frank was, “I don’t feel that this community will ever do that to you and your name knowing that this facility and this sport mean so much to you.” Frank loved baseball, but more importantly, he didn’t want his employees and the people of Delmarva to have to drive to Baltimore if they loved baseball and wanted to enjoy the game. This is something that he really wanted to give to this community.\n\ntnortham@dmg.gannett.com\n\n410-845-4643\n\nOn Twitter @primetimeMitch", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/13"}]}

These ...", "text": "Laura Conover, Miriam Aroni Krinsky and Leo Beletsky\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nOn Aug. 31, 2018, Heather Crimaldi asked her brother Christopher to buy her heroin in McHenry County, Illinois. While under the influence that night, Heather fell in the shower at his apartment and died. Christopher was taken into custody. Now, nearly four years later, he has been convicted of drug-induced homicide (DIH) and sentenced to six years in prison, despite having advanced cancer. He says he only has a few months to live.\n\nThe Crimaldi family exemplifies the cruelty and futility of drug-induced homicide convictions. Christopher is “tormented” by his sister’s death, according to their mother, who is quoted in the Northwest Herald stating, “I lost my daughter. Now I am losing my son.” Both siblings struggled with substance use; tough-on-crime drug policies didn't change that.\n\nIllinois' Good Samaritan Law didn't save Christopher Crimaldi, who called 911 when he found his sister. While the state’s statute was expanded in 2021 and now protects individuals who seek medical help during an overdose from drug-induced homicide charges, the amendment was not applied retroactively. But incidents like this clearly show the need for prosecutors to help those with substance use disorders instead of pushing for incarceration.\n\nFatal drug overdoses on the rise\n\nIn the United States, fatal drug overdoses increased by 539% between 1999 and 2021, a crisis that has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLast year, more than 107,000 Americans died of drug overdoses, the highest ever in a 12-month period and more than the fatalities from car crashes and gunshots combined.\n\nColumn:Fines, fees used to fund criminal justice too often come from those disenfranchised by it\n\nAs overdoses have climbed, too many elected leaders have defaulted to ineffective and costly tough-on-crime responses. This includes drug-induced homicide laws and prosecutions, which reframe accidental overdoses as homicides.\n\nDrug-induced homicide prosecutions involve charging individuals with homicide when they supply drugs that result in a fatal overdose, even if there was no specific intent to kill. Originally introduced in the 1980s, these homicide laws have become more popular and expanded to 23 states, Washington, D.C., and the federal system.\n\nAdvocates for these statutes argue that drug-induced homicide laws target high-level distributors, hold drug manufacturers accountable and deter trafficking. In practice, however, DIH prosecutions often stray from their stated intent and do more harm than good, exacerbating the tragedy of overdoses in the United States.\n\nCall for help or risk getting prosecuted\n\nDrug-induced homicide statutes force people into the unimaginable situation of deciding whether to call for help and risk prosecution for homicide or allow their friend or loved one to die of an overdose.\n\nColumn:How big will legal weed get? 2 factors limit market size, even if US legalizes cannabis.\n\nWhile 47 states and Washington, D.C., have Good Samaritan Laws granting immunity from prosecution to individuals who call for medical assistance in an overdose emergency, most provide protection only from low-level drug charges such as possession. Delaware, Illinois, Rhode Island and Vermont offer immunity from drug-induced homicide charges if a person tries to get help during an overdose – but those states are among the exceptions and not the rule.\n\nDiscouraging people from seeking assistance in the midst of a crisis is a dangerous and deadly policy choice. Indeed, one study found that more media attention on these homicide prosecutions was associated with an increase in overdose deaths, underscoring that these prosecutions could aggravate the crisis they purport to address.\n\nEvidence-based drug policies that save lives\n\nIn many cases, it is family members or close friends who are charged with DIH, not high-level traffickers. Like Christopher Crimaldi, these individuals commonly struggle with substance use themselves. These prosecutions can tear families apart after they’ve already suffered an unthinkable loss.\n\nThere is also no evidence that punitive drug laws have any impact on demand or use of drugs. A Pew analysis found that there was no relationship between higher rates of drug imprisonment and lower levels of drug use or overdose deaths.\n\nColumn:Samaria Rice wants us to remember her son, Tamir. I've watched her fight to make sure we do.\n\nIn the United States, the rate of incarceration surpasses that of many other nations. And we have a far higher overdose death rate than many peer nations. Harsher sentencing has cost millions in taxpayer dollars while doing nothing to address and prevent problematic drug use.\n\nDrug-induced homicide laws also divert limited resources from investigating and prosecuting serious crimes without providing any public safety benefit. A county in Ohio reported spending at least $750,000 a year on drug-induced homicide cases while overdose deaths in that county went up drastically over a four-year period ending in 2016.\n\nAnd like nearly every aspect of the criminal legal system, DIH prosecutions exacerbate racial disparities, with people of color tending to receive longer sentences for DIH convictions than white individuals.\n\nOur View:Attitudes on cannabis legalization have shifted, including ours\n\nAnother view:Legalizing marijuana? Stay wary of health risks and commercialization.\n\nAs long as these laws are still on the books, elected prosecutors have the power to choose a different paradigm. They can embrace a public health response and harm reduction approaches over punitive carceral responses. Most important, they should not charge individuals who supply drugs that lead to an accidental fatal overdose with homicide, either through drug-induced homicide or felony murder statutes, and they should seek to remedy past DIH cases with unjust results.\n\nProsecutors must also decline to prosecute cases involving possession or distribution of lifesaving medications like naloxone and low-level drug possession, and advocate for proven harm reduction strategies – including medication-assisted treatment and overdose prevention sites.\n\nWe have already lost too many lives these past few years. Now it’s time for our elected leaders to implement evidence-based drug policies that save lives. Thoughtful strategies to address our overdose crisis are needed, and they do not include simply putting more people behind bars.\n\nLaura Conover is the county attorney in Pima County (Tucson), Arizona. Miriam Aroni Krinsky, a former federal prosecutor, is the executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution, which recently published an issue brief on ending drug-induced homicide prosecutions.

Headers have been added for ease of reading.\n\n[0:00] Welker: A very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you're ready, let's start.\n\nAnd we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific: how would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\nTrump and Biden on COVID-19\n\n[1:03] Trump: So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune. Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We're now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n[3:05] Welker: OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[3:12] Biden: 220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives. And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.\n\n[5:00] Welker: President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you're referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?\n\n[5:12] Trump: It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.\n\n[5:21] Welker: Can you tell us what companies?\n\nTrump: Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.\n\n[5:34] Welker: Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?\n\n[5:52] Trump: No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.\n\n[6:12] Welker: Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?\n\n[6:25] Biden: Make sure it's totally transparent. Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer. We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.\n\n[6:53] Welker: President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan.\n\n[6:55] Trump: I don’t think it’s going to be a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he's saying, ‘Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.’ But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.’ Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.\n\n[8:09] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response?\n\n[8:10] Biden: My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe hkim a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, ‘Oh, don't worry. This is all going to be over soon.’ Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.\n\n[9:02] Welker: President Trump, your reaction?\n\n[9:03] Trump: I did not say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that. And here’s — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.\n\n[10:09] Welker: And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.\n\n[10:19] Biden: Can I respond to that?\n\n[10:20] Welker: 30 seconds please, and then I have a question.\n\n[10:22] Biden: Number one. He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous. When's the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? Tell the people, is it dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility.\n\n[10:55] Welker: Let me talk about —\n\n[10:56] Trump: Excuse me.\n\n[10:57] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[10:58] Trump: I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves\n\n[11:15] Welker: Vice President Biden. as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.\n\n[11:16] Biden: The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened? What did the President say? He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it’s going to be gone by Easter. Don't worry, the warm weather. Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose 200,000 more people\n\n[11:42] Welker: President Trump.\n\n[11:43] Trump: Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You’re xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't —\n\n[12:12] Biden: I didn't say either of those things.\n\n[12:13] Trump: You certainly did.\n\n[12:16] Biden: I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.\n\n[12:23] Welker: All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.\n\n[12:26] Trump: He thought I shouldn't have closed the border. That’s obvious.\n\n[12:30] Welker: Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?\n\n[12:33] Biden: No.\n\n[12:33] Welker: OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?\n\n[12:51] Biden: What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned. Those other concerns are real. That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.\n\n[13:21] Welker: You haven't ruled out more shutdowns\n\n[13:24] Biden: Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now\n\n[14:03] Welker: Let's talk about schools. President Trump —\n\n[14:05] Trump: Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.\n\n[14:07] Welker: Please, and then I have a follow up.\n\n[14:08] Trump: Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it's like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it’s their immune system.\n\n[14:46] Welker: Let me follow up, President Trump. You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?\n\n[15:04] Trump: I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country. You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down. He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.\n\n[15:49] Welker: Vice President Biden, your —\n\n[15:51] Biden: Simply not true. We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come on.\n\n[16:37] Welker: President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.\n\n[16:39] Trump: I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York.\n\n[17:34] Welker: Vice President.\n\n[17:34] Biden: Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans. They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money's already been passed to do that. It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened.\n\nTrump: New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing.\n\n[18:00] Welker: President Trump, what about —\n\n[18:02] Trump: When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen. We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases.\n\n[18:42] Welker: Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?\n\n[18:58] Trump: I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, ‘don't wear masks.’ He did say, as you know, ‘this is not going to be a problem.’ I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay. He said, ‘this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.’ When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I'm not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, ‘don't wear masks.’ Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words: ‘This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.’ So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.\n\n[19:43] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\n[19:45] Biden: My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us — Americans don't panic. He panicked. Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, ‘this is a really dangerous thing,’ and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, ‘sell short, because we gotta get moving. It's a dangerous problem.’\n\n[20:30] Trump: Well this is —\n\n[20:31] Welker: I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.\n\n[20:33] Trump: I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street. Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don’t tell me about wall street.\n\n[21:15] Welker: All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on.\n\n[21:17] Biden: Average contribution, $43.\n\nOn national security\n\n[21:18] Welker: All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[21:48] Biden: I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking a lot. I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it. And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn. He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.\n\n[23:45] Welker: President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. You're gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[23:56] Trump: Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. He got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO. You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia. I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.\n\n[26:01] Welker: Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.\n\n[26:06] Biden: I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them. 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. So what's going on here? Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?\n\n[27:04]Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\n[27:06] Trump: First of all, I called my accounts — under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that.\n\n[27:42] Welker: Did your accountant tell you —\n\n[27:44] Trump: Excuse me. And it wasn't written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do. I don't make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not. But you're the big man, I think. You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible.\n\n[28:22] Welker: All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this. I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?\n\n[28:35] Trump: I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid.\n\n[29:04] Welker: I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.\n\n[29:12] Biden: At some point I want to respond.\n\n[29:13] Welker: Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.\n\n[29:15] Biden: Why do he — He's been saying this for four years. Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr. President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low. When last time he said what he paid, he said, ‘I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system.’ Come on, come on, folks.\n\n[29:42] Welker: Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you.\n\n[29:46] Trump: I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.\n\n[30:41] Welker: All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?\n\n[30:56] Biden: Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal. With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China. I have not had it. The only guy that made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China.\n\n[31:58] Welker: Let me ask my question to you.\n\n[32:00] Trump: Could I just — one thing.\n\n[32:01] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[32:02] Trump: His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month. Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest.\n\n[32:27] Welker: I’m going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.\n\n[32:31] Biden: No basis for that. Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.\n\n[32:35] Welker: OK, President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?\n\n[32:52] Trump: I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.\n\n[32:26] Welker: OK.\n\n[32:27] Trump: Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —\n\n[33:54] Welker: We do need to move on. I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China. Let's talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?\n\nBiden: What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%. We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said ‘we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.’ I said, ‘we're gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention.’ They have to play by the rules, and what's he do? He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. We make up only — we’ re 25%. 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules. You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically. That's the way I will run it. And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president.\n\n[35:33] Welker: All right, let's talk about North Korea.\n\n[35:35] Trump: Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.\n\n[35:37] Welker: OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have...\n\n[35:39] Trump: His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —\n\n[35:41] Biden: Not true.\n\n[35:42] Trump: — after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.\n\n[35:56] Biden: That is not true.\n\n[35:56] Welker: President Trump, on China policy, though. What are you gonna do? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay?\n\n[36:03] Trump: First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion.\n\n[36:07] Welker: Through sanctions?\n\n[36:08] Trump: I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.\n\n[36:12] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:14] Trump: It’s what?\n\n[36:15] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:16] Trump: No, the taxpayers. It's called China.\n\n[36:20] Biden: Not true.\n\n[36:20] Trump: China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers. Our great farmers, because they would target it. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry\n\n[36:42] Welker: OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?\n\n[36:49] Biden: This isn't about me. There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they’re bald, because we have to wait another month. Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college? They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot. They're in trouble. We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.\n\n[37:26] Welker: I wanted to say, I want to tell —\n\n[37:28] Trump: That is a typical statement. Just 10 seconds, please.\n\n[37:29] Welker: 10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds.\n\n[37:31] Trump: Just a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that.\n\n[37:40] Welker: All right, let’s talk —\n\n[37:40] Trump: I’m not a typical politician, that’s why I got elected.\n\n[37:44] Welker: Let’s talk about —\n\n[37:44] Trump: Let’s get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better.\n\n[37:48] Welker: We're gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times. You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship? Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.\n\n[38:12] Trump: When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of relationship. We have a very good relationship, and there's no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, ‘oh there's going to be trouble.’ I said, ‘No, they're not. Because he's not going to do that.’ And I was right. :ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war, and I have a good relationship.\n\n[39:05] Welker: Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?\n\n[39:15] Biden: Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root. I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, ‘Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces? Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?’ I said, ‘Because North Korea is a problem. And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up. And help if not, it's going to continue.’ What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.\n\n[40:05] Welker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?\n\n[40:12] Biden: On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.\n\n[40:21] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families.\n\n[40:24] Trump: Kristen, they tried to meet with him.\n\n[40:24] Welker: Very quickly. 10 seconds, President Trump.\n\nTrump: They tried to meet with him, he wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it.\n\n[40:32] Welker: OK, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond.\n\n[40:33] Trump: They tried, he wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what, North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don’t understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.\n\n[40:43] Welker: President Trump, we have to move on. We have a lot of questions to get through.\n\n[40:43] Biden: We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we’re gonna talk about denuclearization, we’re not gonna legitimize you, we’re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us.\n\n[41:10] Trump: And it didn’t happen.\n\n[41:12] Welker: Let’s move on and talk about American families.\n\n[41:14] Trump: Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess.\n\n[41:18] Welker: We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump.\n\n[41:22] Trump: Remember the first two or three months. There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.\n\nOn the economy\n\n[41:47] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that's most important to them is health care, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It's headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the supreme court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nTrump: First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminate it; it's gone. Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, ‘Run it as well as you can’ -- to my people, great people -- ‘Run it as well as you can.’ I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it is much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House at that time. And I think we're going to win the House, okay? You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won't even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job with health care. And we're going to do even better.\n\n45:12 Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nBiden: What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option -- become Bidencare. Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's going to happen. Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That's why I did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions. None, zero, you can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. There is no -- he's never come up with a plan. I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact that -- I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he’s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre existing conditions. What are they going to do?\n\n47:20 Welker: I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said. He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government?\n\nBiden: What he’s saying, it's ridiculous. It’s like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan? Look, the difference between the president -- I think health care is not a privilege, it's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick? Because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do.\n\nWelker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: Excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it. He was now there as Vice President for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking -- ‘We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.’ Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, ‘Oh, we're gonna have fracking.’ And you never asked a question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say. But by the way, somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year --\n\n49:24 Welker: We do have a number of -- we have a number of topics.\n\nTrump: No, no, but that's a question --\n\nWelker: We're gonna get to it --\n\nTrump: It’s the same thing with socialized medicine.\n\nWelker: Vice President, your response.\n\nBiden: My response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period. Period, period, period. And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. What we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing.\n\nTrump: Kristen, when he says --\n\nWelker: Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill\n\n50:08 Trump: When he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he’s destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work --\n\nWelker: Let's see if --\n\n50:31 Trump: -- it was impossible --\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\n50:34 Biden: He thinks he's running against someone else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he's running against. And the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy Medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, ‘If in fact’ -- and, social security -- ‘If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it. This is a guy who's tried to cut Medicare. So I don't know. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on.\n\nTrump: He tried to get rid of --\n\nWelker: Vice Presiden, Mr. President, I’m going to have to go on to another question --\n\nTrump: -- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security you've got --\n\n51:28 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next question.\n\n51:31 Trump: They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash.\n\nWelker: OK, let's move on to the next question.\n\nBiden: May I respond?\n\nWelker: Very quickly.\n\n51:40 Biden: The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars. $700 billion more dollars. Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?\n\n52:11 Trump: 401k’s are through the roof. 401k --\n\nWelker: All right, let’s move on.\n\n52:14 Trump: -- are through the roof. And he doesn't come from Scranton. That's like, what -- he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --\n\nWelker: We're gonna move on --\n\nTrump: And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that.\n\nWelker: -- to my next question, gentlemen. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here.\n\nTrump: Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do.\n\nWelker: But you're the president.\n\nTrump: I do. But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one she doesn't want. It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.\n\nWelker: All right, Mr. Vice President --\n\nBiden: You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't -- he will not pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?\n\nWelker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President\n\nTrump: If we made a deal, we’d have --\n\n53:32 Welker: Let me ask Vice President Biden the question. You are the leader of the Democratic Party. Why have you not [] Democrats to get a deal for the American people?\n\nBiden: Well, I have and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. This is like -- it's not new. It's been out there. The HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, ‘Let him go bankrupt. Let him go bankrupt.’ Come on. What's the matter with these --\n\nTrump: The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And what that does, and I'd love to do that, I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.\n\nWelker: I want --\n\nBiden: All right, if I get elected, I'm not gonna -- I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble. They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue. Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.\n\nWelker: I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage.\n\nBiden: I do, because I think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You’ve got one in six of them going under. They're not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money that’s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely. Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. But this, these guys will not help them. He is not giving them any of the money.\n\nWelker: We are going to move on --\n\n56:35 Trump: For small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. So it's very important. We have to help our small business --\n\nWelker: You said --\n\nTrump: How are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages. What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen\n\n57:03 Welker: Well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour --\n\nTrump: Say again?\n\nWelker: You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that still the case?\n\n57:10 Trump: What I’d really like, I would consider it to an extent. I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 --\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, thank you. Quick response, Vice President Biden\n\nBiden: Two jobs, one job below poverty. People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that put you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business. That is simply not true.\n\nOn immigration\n\nWelker: We're going to talk about immigration. We're going to talk about immigration, now, gentlemen, and we're going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids, You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?\n\nTrump: Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it’s easy to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger border as we've ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.\n\nWelker: But how will you reunite these kids with their families?\n\n58:48 Trump: Let me just say. They built cages. You know, they used to say I built the cages. And then they had a picture in the newspaper. There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, ‘Look at these cages, President Trump built them.’ And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him.\n\nWelker: Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?\n\n59:08 Trump: Yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response and then another question to you.\n\nBiden: These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big real tough, really strong. And guess what? They cannot -- it’s not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation.\n\nWelker: Let me ask you a follow up --\n\nTrump: Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy. They did it. We changed it. They set up the cages. They -- who built the cages?\n\nBiden: So let's talk about --\n\nTrump: Who built the cages, Joe?\n\n59:58 Biden: Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go, nowhere to go. It's criminal. It's criminal.\n\nWelker: Let me just --\n\nTrump: Let me say this. They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean --\n\nWelker: But some of them haven’t been reunited --\n\nTrump: But just answer one question. Who built the cages? A big ask of that, who built the cages?\n\nWelker: Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?\n\nBiden: Because we made a mistake. It took too long to get it right. Too long to get it right. I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is, and I’ve made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before. I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it’s and it's illegal. You say ‘Oh, no, Mom, leave me here. I'm not gonna go with you.’ They’ve been here. Many of them are model citizens. 20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them.\n\n1:01:51 Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: He had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with. But he had eight years he was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.\n\nWelker: Vice President, what’s your response?\n\nBiden: The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? If in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested. They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what, they showed up for the hearing. This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before. That’s never happened before in our country. You come to the United States and you make your case. That’s how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law. They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.\n\n1:02:55 Welker: President Trump, there is --\n\nTrump: It’s so important. It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back.\n\nBiden: Not true.\n\nTrump: We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, ‘Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really -- I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\nTrump: You don’t know the law, Joe.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\nBiden: I know the law. What he's telling you is simply not true.\n\nTrump: They don’t come back.\n\nBiden: Check it out.\n\nWelker: All right, let's move on --\n\nTrump: But we don’t have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it\n\n1:03:59 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next section --\n\n1:04:04 Biden: You have 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.\n\nTrump: Go ahead.\n\nOn race in America\n\nWelker: All right. Let's talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called “the talk.” It happens regardless of class and income -- parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nBiden: I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And she's written a lot about this. She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on. When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel. And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said we've never lived up to it. Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal? Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it. We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion. This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.\n\n1:06:32 Welker: President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nTrump: Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it -- super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they're out saying, ‘Gee, we have to defeat him.’ Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said-- I said, ‘What are you doing after three years?’ I said, ‘Why do you keep coming back?’ ‘Because we have no funding’. I said, ‘You don't have to come back every year’, ‘We have to come back’, because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, ‘I think you need more’. And I said, ‘The only bad part about this is I may never see you again’, because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved colleges and universities.\n\n[1:08:28] Welker: OK. And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?\n\n[1:08:33] Biden: My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail,’ and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, ‘not enough people’. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities. This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people’s sentences. We committed over 1,000 people’s sentences. Over 1,000. The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.\n\n[1:10:04] Trump: But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn't you--\n\n[1:10:10] Biden: I am not--\n\n[1:10:10] Trump: You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.\n\n[1:10:19] Biden: We did--\n\n[1:10:20] Trump: You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you.\n\n[1:10:34] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that? And then I do have some questions for both of you.\n\n[1:10:38] Biden: Well, I’ll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I'm anxious to see this take place. I am-- the character of the country is on the ballot. Our character is on the ballot. Look at us closely.\n\n[1:11:00] Welker: Let me ask them some follow--\n\n[1:11:01] Trump: Excuse me--\n\n[1:11:04] Welker: Please respond and then we’re gonna have follow up questions.\n\n[1:11:05] Trump: If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--\n\n[1:11:19] Biden: Nobody says--\n\n[1:11:20] Welker: President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We're talking about the issue--\n\n[1:11:21] Trump: It’s the laptop from hell. The laptop from hell.\n\n[1:11:25] Welker: President Trump, we’re talking about race right now and I do want to speak on the issue of race. President Trump---\n\n[1:11:29] Biden: Nobody-- Kristen, I have to respond to that.\n\n[1:11:30] Welker: Please, very quickly.\n\n[1:11:32] Biden: Look, there are 50 former National Intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him, his, and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.\n\n[1:11:51] Trump: You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You gotta be--\n\n[1:11:58] Biden: That’s exactly what-- That’s exactly what--\n\n[1:12:00] Trump: Is this where you’re going? This is where he’s going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?\n\n[1:12:03] Welker: Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay--\n\n[1:12:05] Trump: You have to be kidding here. Here we go again with Russia.\n\n[1:12:09] Welker: Mr. President, we're gonna continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?\n\n[1:12:32] Trump: Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting ‘Pigs in a blanket’, talking about police, ‘Pigs, Pigs’, talking about our police, ‘Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon’. I said, ‘That's a horrible thing’. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:03] Welker: What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric?\n\n[1:12:06] Trump: I don't, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person. I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience. I’m the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:35] Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you.\n\n[1:13:39] Biden: Abraham Lincoln. Here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to them about the ‘Poor Boys’, last time we were on stage here. He said, ‘I told him to stand down and stand ready’. Come on. This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn.\n\n[1:14:12] Welker: President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question.\n\n[1:14:16] Trump: He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean--\n\n[1:14:19] Biden: You said you were Abraham Lincoln.\n\n[1:14:21] Trump: No, no. I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community. I didn’t say ‘I'm Abraham Lincoln’. I said, ‘Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community’. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--\n\n[1:14:42] Biden: Oh, God.\n\n[1:14:42] Trump: Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because it you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what’s happening out there.\n\n[1:14:50] Welker: All right, let me-- Let me ask Vice President Biden about-- Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. Crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?\n\n[1:15:20] Biden: One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment across the board. That's what we should be spending money on. That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. That's what we've been trying to do. That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug. But they were not in the crime bill.\n\n[1:16:12] Trump: But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk no action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it? ‘That's what I'm gonna do when I become president’. You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done? Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe.\n\n[1:16:34] Biden: We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-- We got 38,000 prisoners left from--\n\n[1:16:39] Trump: You got nothing done\n\n[1:16:40] Biden: 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. We have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency. We-- in fact, we’re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.\n\n[1:1:08] Trump: I just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, ‘I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this.’ You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama? You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.\n\n[1:17:29] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section.\n\n[1:17:34] Biden: We had a Republican Congress. That’s the answer.\n\n[1:17:37] Welker: OK.\n\n[1:17:39] Trump: Well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe. Sometimes you gotta talk ‘em into it.\n\n[1:17:43] Welker: All right, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-\n\n[1:17:44] Trump: Like I did with criminal justice reform. I had to talk Democrats into it.\n\nOn climate change\n\n[1:17:48] Welker: Gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we gotta get on to climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[1:18:15] Trump: So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can’t do-- Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally. We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.\n\n[1:19:50] Welker: Vice President, Biden--\n\n[1:19:51] Trump: And we haven't destroyed our industries.\n\n[1:19:52] Welker: Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted.\n\n[1:19:55] Biden: Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time. We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years. Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble. Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. In the meantime, China's doing that. We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That's what's happening. And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.\n\n[1:21:47] Trump: President Trump, your response --\n\n[1:21:48] Trump: They came out and said very strongly, ‘$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan’, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it? AOC+3. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, they’re real play costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend $100 trillion. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It’s $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. And many other things--\n\n[1:22:47] Welker: All right-- Okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions. So let's hear from the Vice President. I have a number of more questions.\n\n[1:23:11] Biden: I don't know where he comes from. I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion? Give me a break. This plan was-- This plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group. Labor. Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath. And they know they're good jobs in getting us there. And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I’m proposing.\n\n[1:24:00] Welker: President Trump-- Please respond and then I have a follow up.\n\n[1:24:00] Trump: Excuse me. We are energy independent for the first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it’s very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China. And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing--\n\n[1:24:36] Biden: Find me a scientist that says that.\n\n[1:24:38] Trump: Solar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--\n\n[1:24:47] Biden: False.\n\n[1:24:47] Trump: So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. You want-- And what about fracking?\n\n[1:25:01] Welker: All right. Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond--\n\n[1:25:04] Biden: I have never said I oppose fracking.\n\n[1:25:06] Trump: You said it on tape.\n\n[1:25:08] Biden: I did? Show the tape. Put it on your website.\n\n[1:25:10] Trump: I’ll put it on.\n\n[1:25:11] Biden: Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying.\n\n[1:25:15] Welker: Would you rule out banning fracking?\n\n[1:25:17] Biden: I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that.\n\n[1:25:44] Welker: I have one more question--\n\n[1:25:48] Trump: Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. ‘I am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania? He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.\n\n[1:26:00] Biden: Fracking on federal Land, I said. No fracking or oil on federal land--\n\n[1:26:05] Welker: Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?\n\n[1:26:26] Trump: The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.\n\n[1:27:22] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.\n\n[1:27:26] Biden: My response is that those people live on what they call ‘Fence Lines’. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window. That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? And you impose restrictions on the pollution, that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities.\n\n[1:28:12] Welker: OK, I have one final question--\n\n[1:28:14] Trump: Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?\n\n[1:28:17] Biden: I would transition from the oil industry. Yes.\n\n[1:28:19] Trump: Oh, transition.\n\n[1:28:21] Biden: It is a big statement because I would stop--\n\n[1:28:22] Welker: Why would you do that?\n\n[1:28:24] Biden: Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —\n\n[1:28:27] Trump: That’s a big statement.\n\n[1:28:31] Biden: Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry-- I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry?\n\n[1:28:52] Trump: We actually do give it to solar and wind--\n\n[1:28:54] Welker: All right, we have one final question--\n\n[1:28:56] Trump: That’s the biggest statement. In terms of business. that's the biggest statement.\n\n[1:28:59] Welker: All right, we have one final question-- Mr. President--\n\n[1:29:00] Trump: Because basically what he’s saying is he’s going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio?\n\n[1:29:07] Welker: Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden?\n\n[1:29:12] Biden: He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production. By 2050, totally.\n\n[1:29:25] Welker: All right. One final question--\n\n[1:29:26] Trump: Is he gonna get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it?\n\n[1:29:27] Welker: No, we're finished with this. We have to move on to our final question.\n\n[1:29:30] Biden: No, I’m going to rejoin the Paris Accord and get China to abide by what they agreed to\n\n[1:29:33] Trump: But that’ll cost you $1 trillion.\n\nFinal question\n\n[1:29:34] Welker: This is about leadership, gentlemen, and this first question does go to you, President Trump..

Isabel Rubio, who has led the Birmingham-based organization for 20 years, will be replaced by chief operating officer Carlos Aleman, who went to work for the group as deputy director three years ago. The coalition, which advocates for Latino and immigrant families in Alabama, helped lead opposition and provided community services when the state passed a restrictive law dealing with immigrants a decade ago. Court challenges later gutted the law. Growing from a staff of one, the coalition said it now has a staff of more than two dozen bilingual workers who serve more than 5,000 people annually. Rubio has raised more than $19 million to support the Hispanic community with small business development, citizenship, college and home ownership.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A popular strip club that once beckoned customers off a busy highway leading into Anchorage is now a church offering salvation – instead of temptation – behind the daughter of a former exotic dancer. Linda Dunegan believes divine intervention played a hand in transforming the building that housed Fantasies on 5th into the start-up Open Door Baptist Church, turning the show floor into a sanctuary and trading the dancer’s pole with a pulpit. “This church came about because I prayed for five years,” said Dunegan, who tried to buy the building before but walked away – for good, she thought – when she and the owner couldn’t come to terms. Then the owner gave a real estate agent a week to sell it and suggested the agent call Dunegan. This time, the deal went through. “God has been very good to me,” Dunegan said, “to give me a family, a wonderful husband, food on the table, a place to live.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:An Arizona Republican official said ballots stored for the review of the Maricopa County 2020 election were not damaged by water leaking from the ceiling at a state fairgrounds building during Phoenix-area monsoon thunderstorms. “No ballots are at risk,” Randy Pullen, representing state Senate Republicans who ordered the election review, told the Arizona Republic. Pullen said he was at the building when leaks began. He said workers covered boxes with tarps for protection and moved them away from the leaks inside the Weslin Bolin Building as rain poured outside. Pullen identified four leaks above where work is taking place, as well as leaks in other parts of the building. He told the Republic he called fairgrounds management to fix them. The Bolin building is an exhibit hall usually used for trade shows. It is not air-conditioned. The ballot review moved to the building earlier this month after the state Senate’s lease ended at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, also on the fairgrounds property.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: COVID-19 continues to rage through Arkansas as new day-over-day cases topped 2,000 for the first time since February. State health officials reported 2,015 new cases Saturday as the highly contagious delta variant swept across the state, prompting the state to resume weekend daily updates. Another 1,022 were reported Sunday. Forty-eight more COVID-19 cases required hospitalization over the weekend, and 13 more deaths were reported. The state averaged 626 new cases a day per 100,000 population over the past two weeks, an increase of 140.7% and a rate that topped the nation’s states, according to Johns Hopkins University research data. Although the Arkansas vaccination rate has been among the nation’s lowest, State Epidemiologist Jennifer Dillaha told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that 32,466 first doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered last week, the most since late April.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The state has given the University of California, San Diego $35 million to build a coastal research vessel that will focus on such pressing topics as sea-level rise, the health of marine fisheries, ocean acidification, El Nino and the atmospheric rivers that periodically bring damaging storms to California. The university’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography will oversee the design and construction of the 125-foot vessel, which will have a hydrogen-hybrid propulsion system, an emerging technology meant to limit the release of greenhouse gases. The vessel – whose funding comes from the state’s general fund – will primarily sail in California waters, and also will be able to operate with diesel fuel. The ship will be used for research and education, replacing the research vessel Robert Gordon Sproul, which is nearing the end of its 40-year service life. Scripps also operates two large research ships, the Sally Ride and the Roger Revelle, and a small, near-shore vessel, the Bob and Betty Beyster.\n\nColorado\n\nLa Junta:Nine Otero County restaurants received nearly $622,000 in federal COVID-19 relief funding from Restaurant Revitalization Fund grants. The Restaurant Revitalization Fund was designed by Congress as part of this year’s American Rescue Plan Act. About $28.6 billion worth of grants were awarded to restaurants, bars and food trucks throughout the nation. Nearly $500 million was awarded to Colorado alone, according to Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper. Otero County restaurants receiving grants included Copper Kitchen, Eagle’s Lanes & Eagle’s Nest, El Azteca Mexican Restaurant, Felisa’s Mexican Food and Lounge and JJ’s Inc. in La Junta. RPF grants were also given to Frontier Diner in Cheraw, Majestyk, Inc. in Manzanola, Tamarack Grill in Fowler and Rocky Ford’s China Kitchen. No businesses in Crowley or Bent counties received such grants.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Connecticut could lag behind most states in regaining hotel jobs lost during the coronavirus pandemic, according to projections by a national trade group. The American Hotel and Lodging Association predicted the state will have regained a little less than 72% of its roughly 26,000 direct hotel industry jobs by year’s end. The projected 7,400 unfilled jobs is a more dire forecast than the group made in May, when it predicted a gap of about 5,900 jobs. The group predicted only four states – Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York – and the District of Columbia will regain smaller percentages than Connecticut by the end of 2021. It estimated the hotel industry will end 2021 down about 500,000 jobs compared to 2019 levels. Direct hotel jobs include positions such as housekeeper and front desk attendant but don’t include jobs such as restaurant or retail workers or other small businesses supported by the hotel industry. Experts said vacation and leisure travel in Connecticut has rebounded but business travel has lagged considerably. Business travelers account for roughly 60% of the hotel industry’s customer base.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:No Delaware hospitals – including the state-run psychiatric facility – are complying with federal regulations to post prices on their websites, according to a recent report. This month, Patient Rights Advocate published a report that found that 94.4% of U.S. hospitals are failing to follow the hospital price transparency rule that was put in place during the Trump administration. The list included all of the acute care hospitals in Delaware, as well as a number of behavioral health organizations. In January, hospitals were required to post the costs of services for all payers and plans and have a list or price estimator that calculates the 300 most common services. Before this law went into effect, the hospital industry sued to prevent posting prices but ultimately lost. President Joe Biden earlier this month issued an executive order that told the secretary of Health and Human Services to “support existing hospital price transparency rules.” ChristianaCare, the largest health system in Delaware, said in a statement that it has been “committed to price transparency” and launched its price website in 2018, years before the federal mandate.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:D.C. officials are asking people to stay out of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers as summer heat sends many toward local waterways, WUSA-TV reported. “The entire river is inherently dangerous because it looks calm,” said D.C. Fire and EMS Captain Paul O’Conner. “But underneath the moving water ... that looks easy to swim in (are) many obstructions.” Agency spokesperson Vito Maggiolo said three people have accidentally drowned in D.C. waters this year. The most dangerous area is on the northwest edge of the city near Fletcher’s Boathouse, according to Maggiolo. “Strong currents, they’ll pull you under,” he said. “Rocks, you’ll get tossed around. It’s almost like a vortex, being in a washing machine.” If that’s not enough, there’s another reason not to jump into the rivers: It’s illegal. DCFEMS and DC Police confirmed swimming in the Anacostia or Potomac rivers is against the law.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: There’s a new Ernest Hemingway look-alike in Key West. Zach Taylor of Ambrose, Georgia, won this year’s contest to celebrate the author during the island’s annual Hemingway Days festival. The 63-year-old business owner beat out 136 other entrants at Sloppy Joe’s Bar, the Key West saloon where Hemingway frequently drank. Competing in the contest is a family affair for Taylor. His late father-in-law, Carlie Coley, was the winner in 2000. His wife and mother-in-law shared his victory celebration Saturday night. “Hemingway has been a fixture of ours since we started coming down to the contest,” Taylor said. “And you know, I think ‘Papa’ would be proud of what’s been accomplished in his name in a town he loved so well.” Saturday night’s competitors paraded across Sloppy Joe’s stage, trying to impress the judging panel of former winners, while the audience cheered and applauded. In 2020, the contest was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Like Taylor, most 2021 entrants attempted to emulate the “Papa” persona adopted by the author in his later years. Some pleaded for victory through poems or song fragments including finalist David “Bat” Masterson, who accompanied his original tune on the harmonica. As well as resembling Hemingway, Taylor said he shares the Nobel Prize-winning author’s passion for fishing, hunting and the life of an outdoorsman.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: The demolition and removal of an overturned cargo ship along the Georgia coast is inching closer to completion. Crews on Thursday began cutting through steel to remove a sixth chunk of the Golden Ray and take it away on a barge to a facility in Brunswick. Roughly two-thirds of the ship has been removed since demolition began in November. The cut that started Thursday will be the second-to=last one on the project, the Brunswick News reported. Section 6 is about 73 feet long and weighs approximately 3,700 metric tons. The South Korean-owned Golden Ray capsized with more than 4,200 automobiles in its cargo decks shortly after departing the Port of Brunswick on Sept. 8, 2019. Investigators concluded the ship tipped over because unstable loading left its center of gravity too high. The entire crew was rescued safely but the ship was deemed a total loss. Demolition of the ship has been slower than officials predicted. The project reached the halfway mark with removal of the fourth section in April. The fifth chunk was cut away in early July.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Testing of drinking water at Hawaii’s public schools found at least 93 faucets and fountains have elevated concentrations of lead. The contaminated water was found among 2,232 sampled taps at 58 schools on Maui, Kauai and the Big Island, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Testing on Oahu began in July, and the results will be released as they become available. An additional four taps with elevated levels of lead were found among 100 sampled sources at 70 child care centers in the state. The results show elevated lead in about 4% of the samples collected so far, officials said. The water testing returned lead concentrations above a project action level of 15 parts per billion. State officials said the compromised fixtures were taken out of commission, and the facilities were notified. Faucet fixtures appeared to be the problem in most cases, but follow-up testing will reveal if plumbing is to blame, said Michael Miyahira, acting branch chief of the Department of Health’s Safe Drinking Water Branch. This is the first time Hawaii’s public schools have been comprehensively tested for lead in drinking water. The state received a $222,000 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant to do the testing.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials are working on a hemp plan to submit to federal officials this fall so that farmers can grow it next year. State Department of Agriculture Deputy Director Chanel Tewalt told the Capital Press last week that the state intends to submit its plan to the U.S. Department of Agriculture by Sept. 1. Idaho lawmakers earlier this year approved the growing and selling of hemp products containing 0.3% or less of THC, the cannabis compound that gives marijuana its high. The State Department of Agriculture plans to submit the hemp plan in early August to Republican Gov. Brad Little and the State Police for their approval. Little, who signed the bill approving hemp in Idaho into law in April, and law enforcement officials have expressed concern that hemp could be used as a cover for growing or transporting marijuana. The overall effort is to align state law with federal law contained in the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp. Idaho is the only state that still treats hemp like marijuana. That has prevented Idaho framers from growing hemp, which backers say can be a lucrative crop.\n\nIllinois\n\nWayne: A tick species native to the southeastern part of the United States has been found outside Chicago. Three Gulf Coast ticks were located earlier this month in the Dunham Forest Preserve in Wayne, according to The (Arlington Heights) Daily Herald. Wayne is roughly 40 miles west of Chicago. The species is more likely than others to carry the pathogen causing Tidewater spotted fever, which could cause a headache, muscle aches and rash, among other things. “Don’t be scared, be prepared. We don’t need to freak out,” said Holly Tuten, vector ecologist for the Illinois Natural History Survey Medical Entomology Lab at the University of Illinois. The ticks have previously found in more than a dozen Illinois counties, but in small numbers. Then last year, 780 were found in Illinois after researchers found a new way of searching for them, Tuten told the newspaper. However, only adults have been found, suggesting they might not be able to survive Illinois winters. Experts said Gulf Coast ticks can be avoided in the same ways as other ticks. Experts recommend remaining on the center of nature trails and wearing protective clothing when in grassy areas.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington:Public beaches along the Lake Monroe shoreline remained closed Friday more than a week after multiple rounds of heavy rain passed through south-central Indiana. The beaches at Fairfax and Paynetown state recreation areas were closed by lake officials after several days of heavy downpours caused widespread flooding in the area. Michael Prier, an office worker at the Paynetown office at Lake Monroe, told The Herald Times that lake waters on Thursday were up 6 feet from typical levels. Days earlier, the lake was 10 feet above normal. Lake Monroe’s public fishing docks also remain closed because of the high water. Some county roads that are used to travel around the lake additionally remain underwater, according to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Boaters are encouraged by the IDNR to use “extreme caution” on the lake because of possible floating debris and hidden obstacles in the lake. All boat ramps and campgrounds near Lake Monroe remain open.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:More than 100 people gathered outside the state Capitol on Saturday to rally against mandates requiring people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, such as the ones some Iowa hospitals have issued. One of the speakers at the rally, Republican state Rep. Jeff Shipley, called vaccine mandates “a crime against humanity.” People in the crowd held signs that read “stop vax bullying” and “mandates belong in socialist countries.” The event was organized by a group called Informed Choice Iowa that opposes mandatory coronavirus vaccinations and vaccine passports. Brei Johnson with that group told the Des Moines Register that she believes vaccinations should be discussed between a health professional and patient, not made a condition of employment. “You can take off a mask but you can’t undo a vaccine. That’s a slippery slope to what comes next,” Johnson said. Earlier this month, the owner of seven MercyOne hospitals and related clinics said all employees would be required to get vaccinated or risk termination. The hospitals and clinics are in Clinton, Dubuque, Dyersville, Mason City, New Hampton, Primghar and Sioux City. The Iowa Department of Public Health said nearly 47% of Iowa residents have been fully vaccinated against the virus.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A retired University of Kansas professor received Poland’s Medal of Valor this weekend more than 75 years after he fought with the Polish resistance against the occupying forces of Nazi Germany during World War II. Polish Air Force Major Gen. Cezary Wisniewski who is based at the Polish embassy in Washington, visited Jarek Piekalkiewicz’s home in Lawrence on Saturday to give him Poland’s second-highest combat honor on his 95th birthday. Wisniewski said the honor was overlooked during the war and then the post-war communist government of Poland refused to honor the country’s wartime resistance fighters. The recommendation that Piekalkiewicz receive the medal for his efforts was recently discovered in Poland’s archives, according to the Lawrence Journal-World. Piekalkiewicz joined the Polish resistance at age 16. Two years later, he was promoted to platoon sergeant and commanded 1,000 men during the bloody uprising of 1944 when roughly 6,000 resistance soldiers were killed before the resistance surrendered in October when its forces ran short of ammunition and food. Piekalkiewicz said he then became a prisoner of war at a German labor camp, and he tried to escape three times before he finally succeeded. Later, he served with the U.S. Army and British military. After the war, he earned his bachelor’s degree and met his wife at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, before coming to the United States and earning his doctorate. He went on to teach at KU from 1963 to 2000,\n\nKentucky\n\nIrvine: State officials have celebrated the opening of a $14.7 million technology center serving Estill, Powell and surrounding counties in eastern Kentucky. The center will serve high school and technical college students and provide training for displaced workers seeking new career paths. Gov. Andy Beshear participated in the recent grand opening, along with state Education Commissioner Jason Glass and Senate President Robert Stivers. Beshear praised the “forward thinking of leaders that laid the groundwork” for the project. The Estill County Area Technology Center will serve about 300 students from Estill, Powell and surrounding counties, Beshear’s office said. It will house six career and technical programs and will be home to the Estill County Success/Virtual Academy. “Technical centers, like the new Estill County Area Technology Center, are key to preparing the future workforce of Kentucky,” Glass said. “Our students will develop the latest and most in-demand skills in high demand areas, including health and computer sciences.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Republican U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins, a critic of mask mandates and public health restrictions during the pandemic, said he, his wife and son have contracted the coronavirus. He made the announcement on Facebook on Sunday night. He said he and his wife had been infected last year, but this time around is much more difficult. He has not said whether he has been vaccinated. “This episode is far more challenging. It has required all my devoted energy,” he said. “We are all under excellent care, and our prognosis is positive.” Higgins is the second member of Congress to announce in the last week that they contracted the virus. Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican who represents parts of southwest Florida, said July 19 that he had tested positive. Buchanan said he had been fully vaccinated and was experiencing mild symptoms. Higgins has said he doesn’t support mask mandates or mandatory vaccines. In a May Facebook post, Higgins said: “If you want to get vaccinated, get vaccinated. If you want to wear a mask, wear a mask. If you don’t, then don’t. That’s your right as a free American.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Some unemployment claimants in Maine and elsewhere will soon have to submit proof that they were employed when they lost a job because of the coronavirus pandemic. The federal government is requiring the proof of employment by Aug. 4 for people who have received Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. The rule applies to anyone who has received the benefits beginning with the week that ended Jan 2. The Maine Department of Labor said claimants must submit the proof of employment as soon as possible to avoid a denial of benefits. Overpayment of benefits would require the claimant to repay benefits, the department said. There were 100 initial claims filed for federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance in Maine in the week that ended July 17.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Colleges and universities in Maryland are adjusting computer software and hiring additional staff to manage vaccination records for COVID-19 ahead of the fall semester. The Baltimore Sun reported administrators are devising plans to verify compliance with vaccine mandates and to process applications for an exemption. Earlier this year,14 schools across the state said they would require students and employees to receive a COVID-19 vaccine before the fall. Some schools have collected immunization records for years. But they’re now doing so on a larger scale and will include employees. Unvaccinated students who lack an exemption might not be allowed to live on campus or access campus facilities. Some could also see their registration for courses canceled.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Rachael Rollins, who has pushed for progressive criminal justice reforms as the first woman of color to serve as a district attorney in Massachusetts, has been nominated by President Joe Biden to become the state’s top federal prosecutor. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Rollins, who has led the Suffolk County district attorneys office since 2019, would become the first Black woman to serve as U.S. attorney for Massachusetts. Rollins defeated the district attorney candidate backed by the longtime incumbent and police groups in the 2018 Democratic primary on a promise to decline prosecution for certain low-level crimes. She argued people shouldn’t be jailed for crimes that result from mental health or addiction problems and said she wanted to focus her attention on serious crimes, like homicides. Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, who recommended Rollins for the job, said they are “certain that she will be a tremendous U.S. attorney” and pledged to work to make sure she’s confirmed as quickly as possible.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:The National Weather Service said tornadoes struck near Detroit and near Flint on Saturday night. The EF-1 tornadoes touched down in Genesee County’s Clayton Township about 6:30 p.m. and in Oakland County about 7:45 p.m., the weather service said. Damage from both storms was consistent with winds of 100 mph and they traveled about 1.8 miles, damaging trees. One person suffered minor injuries. Thousands of utility customers in the Detroit area had no power Sunday following a night of severe storms. DTE Energy reported nearly 135,000 customers in Oakland and Macomb counties had no service at 10:20 a.m. because of wind damage. Consumers Energy reported more than 650 customers without power in Oakland County’s Holly Township at 9:45 a.m. DTE had more than 500 crews in the field and “will be working around the clock to restore power to impacted customers as quickly and safely as possible,” the utility reported on its website.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Minnesota officially adopted regulations championed by Gov. Tim Walz to encourage the switchover to electric vehicles. The “clean car” rules published in the State Register take effect in 2024 with the 2025 model year. They will require manufacturers and dealers to supply more electric vehicles for the Minnesota marketplace. The Walz administration said the rules will lead to cleaner air and help fight climate change by increasing the choices Minnesotans have for purchasing electric cars. It said the changes will protect public health and save Minnesotans money at the pump. But Scott Lambert, president of the Minnesota Automobile Dealers Association, said the rules put California in charge of writing Minnesota’s regulations because the state is essentially adopting California’s standards, and can’t modify them under federal law. He said the changes will swamp Minnesota dealers with more electric vehicles than customers want to buy, and force up car prices for everyone.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Education will temporarily move out of its headquarters in the old Central High School building in downtown Jackson so repairs can be made to alleviate repeated leaks and flooding. The department will lease office space at South Pointe Business Park in the Jackson suburb of Clinton, officials said in a news release Monday. Some employees will start working there sometime in mid-August, and others will work remotely. The department said phone numbers and email addresses for all staff will remain the same. This is the second time in recent years for the Department of Education to temporarily move to South Pointe. The first time was in 2015, when a fire in a downtown Jackson hotel damaged the old Central High building. Those repairs were completed after a year. The Legislature will have to set aside money for the new repairs.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The St. Louis area has become one of the first in the country to reinstate mask requirements amid a rise in cases that health officials are blaming on low vaccination rates and the highly contagious delta variant. Despite pushback from some elected officials, face coverings became mandatory Monday in indoor public places and on public transportation in St. Louis city and St. Louis County for everyone age 5 or older – even for those who are vaccinated. Wearing masks outdoors is strongly encouraged, especially in group settings. “For those who are vaccinated this may feel like punishment, punishment for doing the right thing,” St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, a Democrat, said at a news conference Monday. “I’ve heard that and I feel that frustration. While the vaccination can protect against serious illness, it can’t protect you from being infected with COVID-19 and passing it onto someone else, someone who may be more vulnerable.” The decision came as both of Missouri’s urban areas have seen a big uptick in coronavirus hospitalizations that began in rural areas of the state, especially in southwestern Missouri. Missouri ranks fourth nationally in the most new cases per capita in the past 14 days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nCascade:The Cascade County Sheriff’s Department has issued a pre-evacuation warning for “everything south of Cascade” in advance of a wildfire, Sheriff Jesse Slaughter said in a text Sunday afternoon. “A pre-evacuation warning has been issued for the Sheep Creek Lane area, everything south of Cascade,” Slaughter said in the text. “Deputies are being called in to make notifications.” Also, the County Sheriff’s Department and the Montana Highway Patrol were conducting pre-evacuation warnings for the northern part of the Belt Creek Drainage as well as the town of Monarch being threatened by another wildfire as of 6:47 p.m. Sunday. According to the Inciweb website, that fire started Friday at about noon by lightning about 10 miles southeast of Cascade and has since grown to 3,623 acres. It is east of the Dearborn Rest Area on Interstate 15 at the Cascade-Lewis and Clark County Line. A total of 132 firefighting personnel were on the scene, including two Type 1 hotshot crews and three Type 2 Initial Attack Crews, along with three bulldozers and five fire engines. The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation is coordinating with the Cascade County Sheriff’s Department and multiple volunteer fire departments in Cascade County.\n\nNebraska\n\nBellevue: Four people were injured when a second-floor outdoor deck collapsed during a barbecue, trapping the people and leaving serious burns on one woman when a hot charcoal grill fell on her. First responders said the incident happened about 9 p.m. Sunday at a home in Bellevue. Several people were on the deck when it collapsed, officials said, causing them to fall 10- to 12-feet to the ground. Four people, including the woman with first- and second-degree burns, were taken to local hospitals. Officials said some people at the scene declined treatment.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:The airport serving Nevada’s second-largest metro area faces a shortage of jet fuel that could force the cancellation of cargo and passenger fights, potentially restricting the flow of tourists and essential goods into the northern part of the state. Nevada’s political leaders issued a statement late Saturday pledging to minimize disruption at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport and ensure the aerial fight against Western wildfires isn’t hampered. Besides serving Reno, a popular gambling destination, the airport is the nearest passenger terminal to Lake Tahoe. “To be clear, further failure to secure adequate fuel supplies is unacceptable,” wrote Gov. Steve Sisolak, Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, and U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei. Airport officials across West have voiced concerns about jet fuel shortages and their effect on what is shaping up to be a busy wildfire season. Jet fuel demand declined sharply and supply chains atrophied during the coronavirus pandemic, according to aviation supply companies, jet fuel transport companies and others. They have yet to bounce back in the West even as the economy picks up and people flock to airports for long-delayed trips.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMoultonborough: Parents are demanding answers after a summer camp that called itself one of the best in the nation unexpectedly shut down after just six days this month. Officials at Camp Quinebarge notified parents in early July that they needed to pick up their children after delays in food shipments made it impossible to continue, The Boston Globe reported. All remaining sessions for the overnight camp were canceled. But some parents told The Globe that problems appeared to go beyond food deliveries. Stories surfaced about counselors who were hired days before camp with little training. Campers reported that multiple meals were served on dirty dishes. Some parents said their children were quarantined after they vomited and that the parents were not notified. The camp’s executive director, Eric Carlson, apologized to parents but said the closure was tied to industry-wide staffing and supply chain problems and not because of any long-term problems with the camp’s operations. The camp had been licensed to operate by the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, but it closed before an in-season inspection was performed, a department spokesperson told The Globe. Some parents have said they deserve a full accounting of what happened at the 85-year-old camp, which costs $3,400 for two weeks. Although some defend the camp, some have swapped horror stories on a Facebook group for aggrieved parents.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHackensack:Advocacy groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security against the Bergen County Jail on behalf of 15 current and former inmates, with allegations of sexual assault, medical and physical abuse, religious discrimination, COVID-19 negligence and generally “deplorable” conditions. The complaint called for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end its agreement with the jail and release all immigrants detained at the facility. Freedom for Immigrants, the Center for Constitutional Rights and UnLocal jointly filed the complaint. It includes testimonies from current and former inmates, some who kept anonymous because of fear of retaliation. One inmate told Freedom For Immigrants’ hotline that a correctional officer sexually assaulted him, and then was told by the officer “you can’t do anything about it.”At least three inmates complained of medical neglect. One man said he was diagnosed with HPV and diabetes while in jail, and since then has been denied proper treatment for both ailments. Another said he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013, but after having an X-ray conducted by a doctor at the jail, he was told everything was “fine,” despite feeling constant pain. The Bergen County Sheriff’s Office had previously denied similar allegations. Regarding this complaint, the sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Indian Resources Development at New Mexico State University, in partnership with Navajo Technical University, received a four-year, $250,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture to develop experiential learning opportunities to increase retention and graduation of Native American students at New Mexico land-grant institutions. Housed in NMSU’s College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, Indian Resources Development and NTU were awarded the grant with support of Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, American Indian Chamber of Commerce, Flower Hill Institute and the Navajo Nation Department of Natural Resources. The project will offer experiential learning opportunities that foster connections between Native American students’ cultural background and their academic experiences along with relevant real-world internships, professional development and career exploration opportunities. Mentors from regional land-grant institutions, Tribal entities and Native professionals also will collaborate on the project.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city will require all of its municipal workers – including teachers and police officers – to get coronavirus vaccines by mid-September or face weekly coronavirus testing, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The rule is expected to affect about 340,000 city employees, making the city one of the largest employers in the U.S. to take such action. Although it isn’t a vaccine mandate – no workers will be forced to take a shot – officials hope the inconvenience and discomfort of weekly tests will persuade many to overcome a reluctance to get inoculated. “This is about our recovery. This is about what we need to do to bring back New York City,” de Blasio said. “This is about keeping people safe.” The Sept. 13 deadline coincides with the start of public school, when the Democratic mayor has said he expects all pupils to be in classrooms full-time. City health care workers and employees in congregate setting such as group homes will face earlier deadlines. The move came as the city fights a rise in COVID-19 cases fueled by the highly contagious delta variant. Since the end of June, the daily average of new cases has increased by more than 300%.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: Officials said no one was seriously injured when a small airplane flipped over onto its roof shortly after landing at the Ocracoke Island Airport on North Carolina’s Outer Banks. The incident happened about 1:30 p.m. Sunday, a news release from the Cape Hatteras National Seashore said. The single-engine airplane came to rest in grass near the end of the runway, and emergency officials responded. Neither the pilot nor passenger required transport to a hospital, according to the news release. The Federal Aviation Administration was notified and no further details were immediately available.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The North Dakota Department of Transportation has added dozens of self-serve kiosks across the state to help residents avoid what can sometimes be a long wait at motor vehicle stations. The DOT has completed adding 44 kiosks, an effort it began earlier this year. Residents can now use 52 kiosks to renew a license, request a replacement license or ID card, schedule a road test, pay a reinstatement fee, change an address and edit donor registry information, the Bismarck Tribune reported. They also can check the status of their license, driving record and commercial driver’s license medical card. An initial REAL ID card isn’t available at the kiosk, but its renewal is possible. “The new driver’s license kiosk upgrades add another convenient option for customers doing business with the NDDOT and also expands services into rural communities,” DOT Director Bill Panos said. Motor vehicle registration renewals, nonresident temporary registration requests and applying for a mobility impairment placard are also available at the kiosks.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state doesn’t plan to mandate masks in schools this fall, but health officials strongly recommend students and staff wear face coverings if they aren’t vaccinated against COVID-19, the Department of Health’s chief medical officer said. That and other recommended steps are essential to protecting children and ensuring a successful school year as students return to classrooms, Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff said. Some of Ohio’s largest districts, including Columbus and Cleveland, already decided to require masks for everyone when the school year begins. Others are still navigating the complicated decision-making and polarization around mask rules as the delta variant spreads and cases rise. The health department is strongly urging school employees and eligible students age 12 and older to get vaccinated. That is the best protection, Vanderhoff said. Health officials also are recommending schools continue additional measures that have proven helpful, such as keeping extra distance between people indoors, improving ventilation, sanitizing and encouraging good hand-washing.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTaft: A state prison inmate serving a sentence for escape was recaptured less than five hours after escaping a minimum security prison in eastern Oklahoma on Saturday, according to the State Department of Corrections. Robert Youngblood, 41, was taken into custody about noon after escaping the Jess Dunn Correctional Center in Taft about 7 a.m., according to a statement from the department. The department said Youngblood was seen by staff leaving the prison grounds on foot. The department said Youngblood was serving time for escape from a Logan County jail. DOC records showed Youngblood’s previous convictions included drug possession and distribution, false personation, obstructing an officer and robbery.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Rescue teams continued their search Sunday for a Salem climber who plummeted several hundred feet while descending Mount Jefferson on Friday. The \"intense\" search for Steven Vanpelt, 33, was in its third day after Marion County Sheriff's deputies initially responded to a call from the Pamelia Lake trailhead just off Oregon Highway 22 at 11:36 a.m. Friday. Linn County Sheriff’s Office took over command of the operation at about 3:30 p.m. that day. Linn County officials said Vanpelt was descending Mount Jefferson when he fell \"among extreme mountainous terrain.\" A witness told deputies they lost sight of Vanpelt after he plummeted several hundred feet. Vanpelt has not yet been found because of the dangerous terrain consisting of snow, cliffs, large boulders, crevices and rock scree, which calls for technical mountaineers, officials said. Search-and-rescue efforts on and near the mountain often require multiple counties because of the resources needed and county borders in the area. Corvallis Mountain Rescue, Eugene Mountain Rescue, Deschutes Mountain Rescue and Portland Mountain Rescue are helping with the efforts, Linn County Sheriff's Office authorities said. LifeFlight crews and the Army National Guard have also conducted multiple flights to search the terrain in the days following the initial report.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nTredyffrin Township:A Republican candidate for governor has denied he caused an accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike last week in which a Bradford County motorcyclist was killed. Charlie Gerow, 66, was involved in an accident Wednesday night in Chester County. A highway construction worker told Spotlight PA that he saw a car later identified as Gerow's traveling on the other side of the turnpike with a motorcycle wedged into its grill. State police closed the turnpike for 7 hours after the accident. No charges have been filed. The Chester County coroner’s office said the victim was Logan Carl Abbott, 30. The cause of death was multiple blunt impacts and toxicology tests on the victim are pending, Chester County Coroner Christina VandePol told the Associated Press. Gerow’s campaign posted a statement to its website on Friday that said he is “cooperating fully with the investigation and will continue to do so.” The statement said Gerow “looks forward to the State Police completing their investigation and is confident that the investigation will confirm that he was not the cause of the accident.” The campaign statement said Gerow has been advised to not discuss the accident until police have completed their investigation. State police released a crash report that did not identify anyone involved, but reported that a fatal crash occurred in the turnpike’s westbound lanes in Tredyffrin Township at about 9:50 p.m. Wednesday. Police said the crash involved a Honda motorcycle and a Mercedes Benz 300. The westbound lanes were closed until 4:45 a.m.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNarragansett: The easing of rules on outdoor dining that proved to be a crucial lifeline for many Rhode Island restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic were extended Monday during a ceremonial bill signing by Gov. Daniel McKee. The law signed outside Meldgie’s Diner in Narragansett puts a moratorium until April 1 on enforcement of municipal ordinances or zoning requirements that would penalize restaurant and bar owners for modifying their premises to allow for outdoor dining. “When something works and makes sense, you continue it,” the Democratic governor said at the ceremony attended by the legislative sponsors of the bill as well as several bar and restaurant owners. “That is what this legislation is all about: allowing these outdoor seating arrangements to continue so we can support small, locally-owned restaurants that have faced numerous challenges since the outset of the pandemic.” Mark Eldridge, co-owner of three Meldgie’s Diner locations, said the challenges of COVID-19 have been “overwhelming,” but his restaurants have stayed afloat thanks to local, state and federal aid programs.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: The Spartanburg County Council voted to ends its $25-a-year road fee in the wake of a state Supreme Court decision tossing a similar fee out in neighboring Greenville County. There have been other attempts in recent years to repeal the fee passed in 2005 to pay for road and bridge maintenance, but the high court ruling sealed its fate, County Council Chairman Manning Lynch said. The County Council will need to vote two more times to officially end the fee, the Herald-Journal of Spartanburg reported. The fee generates about $7 million a year and Lynch said he thinks the county can find money in its general budget to replace the fees.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen:A federal contempt of court trial involving three members of the U.S. Marshals Service has been moved from Aberdeen to Sioux Falls, according to court documents. Three supervisory marshals, including the agency’s Chief of Staff John Kilgallon, were accused of allowing a deputy marshal to leave the courthouse in Aberdeen with prisoners in tow on May 10after the marshal refused to tell the judge whether she had been vaccinated against COVID-19. The trial was originally set for Sept. 13 in Aberdeen, but will now begin Dec. 14 in Sioux Falls. U.S. District Judge Brian C. Buescher, who is presiding over the case, said Sioux Falls is a more convenient place for proceedings for all parties involved in the case, the Aberdeen American News reported. U.S. District Judge Charles Kornmann, who filed the criminal contempt of court and obstruction of justice charges, has dropped out of the case. Buescher is based in Nebraska. In court documents recusing himself from the case, Kornmann wrote that Department of Justice policies should not trump lawful federal court order and the case “has nothing to do with requiring anyone to be fully vaccinated.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:The Tennessee Department of Transportation said it will likely be early August before the Interstate 40 bridge between Arkansas and Tennessee can reopen to traffic. Contractors are working on Phase 3 of the repairs that began after a crack was found in May in the Hernando DeSoto Bridge over the Mississippi River. Transportation Commissioner Clay Bright previously said construction was expected to run into at least late July. The department said Friday it would have a more schedule information this week about reopening. All interstate traffic in the Memphis area is being diverted to I-55. The 47-year-old, six-lane bridge was shut down May 11 after inspectors found a crack in one of two 900-foot horizontal steel beams crucial for the bridge’s structural integrity.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: Party attendees beat a man to death with bricks early Monday after he opened fire, police said. Another person was shot and killed and three were injured. Fort Worth police were called to the 5600 block of Shiloh Drive about 1 a.m. Witnesses told police that a small gathering was being held in a backyard. One of the attendees became upset and left the gathering before returning with another person. Both started arguing with other partygoers, authorities said. Police did not describe what caused the initial altercation. The party attendee pulled a gun and shot one person, authorities said. The victim was not seriously injured. Other people at the party chased the shooter, authorities said. While the shooter turned and fired at the crowd, a group picked up landscaping bricks and started throwing them at the shooter. The shooter ended up on the ground – it’s not known whether he tripped or was tackled – and continued shooting. One person was killed by that round of gunfire, and another was injured, authorities said. “The shooter was struck multiple times with at least one landscaping brick and was pronounced dead at the scene,” authorities said. Police have not released the identities of anybody involved, nor have they said whether any charges will be filed. A handgun was recovered by police.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The water levels at the Great Salt Lake have hit a historic low, a grim milestone for the largest natural lake west of the Mississippi River that comes as a severe drought grips the region. On Saturday, the U.S. Geological Survey announced average daily water levels had dropped about an inch below the previous record of 4,191.4 feet, which was set in 1963. The new record came months earlier than when the lake typically hits its lowest level of the year, indicating water levels could continue to drop further, said Candice Hasenyager, the deputy director of Utah’s Division of Water Resources. Receding water already is affecting a nesting spot for pelicans, which are among the millions of birds dependent on the lake. Sailboats have been hoisted out of the water to keep them from getting stuck in mud.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The city council has postponed a vote on whether to allow people experiencing homelessness to camp in city parks. Late last week, the council discussed a proposed policy looking at the needs of the homeless and the city, including where emergency sleeping would be located when the local shelter is full, WCAX-TV reported. The proposal also addressed what park staff should do if they find someone sleeping in an unapproved location, such as on school grounds, private property or near a public path, the station reported. The goal is to protect the homeless while adding boundaries, officials said. “If the shelters are open and there’s a place for someone to go, and they’re camping in a high sensitivity area, we would ask them to leave that area, so they can go to a shelter that’s more appropriate and safe,” Montpelier Homelessness Task Force staff representative Cameron Niedermayer said. The Homelessness Task Force will be considering suggestions from the public and working with the parks commission before the council’s next meeting on Aug. 18.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Lifeguards in Virginia Beach are warning people against diving into murky and shallow water at the oceanfront in the wake of three people reporting spinal cord injuries this year. Tom Gill, chief of the Virginia Beach Lifesaving Service, told The Virginian-Pilot last week that if “you can’t see what you’re diving into, you shouldn’t dive into it.” Chad Rosenbrock dived into the surf in June and reportedly hit his head. The impact broke several vertebrae. The 46-year-old Navy veteran was paralyzed from the chest down. Virginia Beach saw six suspected spinal injuries in 2020, three in 2019, two in 2018 and seven in 2017. Most injuries are fairly minor. And less than 10% result in paralysis. But doctors say they’re all preventable.\n\nWashington\n\nBainbridge Island:A juvenile male sixgill shark measuring more than 9 feet long washed up on Rockaway Beach, and the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife responded to conduct a necropsy. “It was such a surprise to me,” said John Keller, who lives next to Mackenzie. “I fish out here and have fished out here a long time. I’ve never believed or even thought that there were sharks in the water other than dogfish. I’ve been out salmon fishing, I’ve caught more than my share of dogfish, but to see something like this … that’s just an amazing critter out here in this water.” Lisa Hillier, a biologist with the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, was among those who examined the shark and found that the shark was killed after ingesting fishing gear, with lead weights and hooks. The shark was the third to wash up on a beach in the region this year, she said. “We do get washups occasionally, sometimes one or two a year. Having three is not unusual, but let’s just hope that it stops there,” Hillier said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nSouth Charleston: Coupon books are now available offering discounts on lodging, dining, activities and merchandise at West Virginia state parks. The coupon books cost $25 and are available for purchase online and at park and forest gift shops across the state, the Department of Commerce said in a news release. Among the offers are 30% off lodging at a state park; a 50% discount on a second Pipestem Peaks Zipline Tour when a first one is purchased; 30% off any item at any state park gift shop, and 15% off any breakfast, lunch or dinner for two at Tygart Lake State Park’s Lodge Restaurant. “One of the greatest parts of vacationing in our state parks and forests is that it’s affordable and this coupon book is going to make trips even better,” said West Virginia State Parks Chief Brad Reed. Coupon books ordered online will be mailed within three business days. The state parks system includes 35 parks, nine forests and two rail trails.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A southeastern Wisconsin school district failed to properly investigate a parent’s allegations of racism at its high school last year, the state Department of Public Instruction concluded. DPI officials concluded that the Cedarburg School District failed to establish enough facts to make any determinations and ordered the district to launch a new investigation. According to the DPI decision, parent Jessie Mchomvu filed a complaint with the district in October alleging her bi-racial child heard another high school student praise Kyle Rittenhouse and vowing to drive a vehicle through a Black Lives Matter protest. Rittenhouse, who is white, shot and killed two people during a protest over police brutality in Kenosha last August. He’s set to stand trial in November on homicide charges. Mchomvu also alleged that her child frequently heard a racial slur for Black people in the hallways, students displayed Confederate flags on their vehicles and wore clothing with messages supporting police and Donald Trump. The district hired an outside investigator to look into the complaint. The investigator determined there was no evidence of racial harassment or bullying after interviewing Mchomvu and one district employee. The district adopted the investigator’s conclusion.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A recently retired U.S. senator from Wyoming remained hospitalized in uncertain condition Monday, three days after a bicycle accident outside his hometown. The accident Friday night near Gillette sent Mike Enzi, 77, to a hospital, where he was stabilized before being life-flighted to a hospital in Loveland, Colorado, Enzi’s family said in a statement. Details of the accident and the extent of Enzi’s injuries remained unknown, the statement said. Reached by phone, officials at UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland, didn’t immediately have an update on Enzi’s condition Monday. Enzi’s son, Brad, disclosed the accident Saturday on Twitter. Enzi, a Republican, retired in January after four terms as senator. He previously was a state lawmaker and mayor of Gillette, where he owned a shoe store.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/25/grasshopper-invasion-curls-cancer-wildfire-tourism-news-around-states/117212516/", "title": "Grasshopper invasion, Curls for Cancer: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: Kieran Moise’s afro, at 19 inches long, was a huge part of his personality. But after six years of growth, the 17-year-old bound for the U.S. Air Force Academy knew he and his hair would soon be parted. So in memory of a friend who died from cancer, he cut it off and donated it to the nonprofit Children With Hair Loss, which provides human hair replacements to children and teenagers facing medically related hair loss due to cancer treatments, alopecia and burns. “I knew I wanted to send a message,” he said. He did – and many responded. Moise printed out flyers and spread the word on social media for an event held by the nonprofit at a brewery in Huntsville. There, family, friends, and even some of his elementary and middle school teachers took turns cutting his hair in braids. His story was widely shared online. “It’s good to see good news and see … that people are still doing good things because all it does is inspire others,” he said. “That’s really what I want to come out of this: I want other people to (say), ‘Hey, if he’s doing this, so can I.’ ” Moise also launched a fundraiser through St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which had helped his late classmate, Josh Quist, who died when they were in middle school. Initially, Moise hoped he could raise $19,000, or $1,000 per inch of hair. “Kieran’s Curls for Cancer” has exceeded expectations and has already raised nearly $35,000 for St. Jude.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state is trying to dispose of a 58-year-old ferry and even has offered to give it to the government of the Philippines for free. Gov. Mike Dunleavy offered to give the Malaspina ferry away in a letter last month to the Philippines consul general in San Francisco, CoastAlaska reports. “This vessel is surplus to our fleet, is in need of some repairs, but does have some service life left,” according to Dunleavy’s letter dated May 20 and obtained by the Alaska Public Media in a routine public records request for the governor’s correspondence. “We would be willing to provide the vessel to the Philippine government or to a private ferry company in the Philippines free of charge,” the letter says. The Malaspina, built in 1963, last sailed in 2019. Instead of paying at least $16 million in needed steel work, the state put the ferry into cold storage. The state Department of Transportation has estimated it would cost up to $45 million to overhaul the ferry, including installing new engines. The state is paying about $450,000 a year to keep it in storage. Alaska Marine Highway System General Manager John Falvey said there was only tepid interest in buying the ferry, matching the struggles the state experienced in disposing of three other ferries recently. One went to a scrap yard in India, and two others were sold to a Spanish ferry company.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The University of Arizona has been asked to investigate failures involving its animal research programs that led to the deaths of two sheep and caused it to temporarily halt surgical procedures on mice. In a letter to University President Robert Robbins, the animal rights organization Stop Animal Exploitation Now called for the university to look into five incidents involving animal research in 2020 that resulted in a response from the federal government. Michael Budkie, co-founder of Stop Animal Exploitation Now, urged that staff involved in the incidents be banned from future work with animals and that UA officials terminate the projects during which the incidents occurred. Last year the University of Arizona self-reported four incidents that had a negative effect on the health and well-being of animals involved in research to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, part of the National Institutes of Health. In one incident Nov. 1, 2020, the sheep area of the Campus Agricultural Center was broken into and vandalized. Two sheep were injured, and veterinarians at the center determined they needed to be euthanized. UA said it fixed the problem by implementing additional security measures at the site, according to its response to the federal government.\n\nArkansas\n\nCabot: A sheriff’s deputy shot and killed a 17-year-old boy during a traffic stop early Wednesday, but authorities didn’t say what led to the fatal shooting. The Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office said it has turned the investigation of the shooting that occurred about 3 a.m. over to Arkansas State Police. That agency said the circumstances of the traffic stop and what led the deputy to fire his gun at Hunter Brittain after stopping the truck he was driving “will be documented in the investigation.” The shooting occurred outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, state police said. The city of about 26,000 people is about 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. State police said Brittain was from McRae, a small town about 15 miles northeast of Cabot. Later Wednesday, the sheriff’s office identified the deputy as Sgt. Michael Davis, who has been with the sheriff’s office since 2013. The office said Davis will be on administrative leave pending the outcome of the state police’s investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Dozens of tule elk at Point Reyes National Seashore have died from starvation and dehydration in the past year because the animals couldn’t get past a fence that the National Park Service placed to stop them from competing for food and water with cattle, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the federal government. Three California residents and the Animal Legal Defense Fund sued the park service in federal court in San Francisco, claiming it is being negligent, and more animals will die if the agency is not ordered to provide food and water during the drought. “The National Park Service has a responsibility to protect and preserve these beautiful animals. The idea that depriving them of food and water somehow fulfills that responsibility isn’t just absurd; it’s undeniably inhumane,” said Kate Barnekow, of Harvard Law School’s Animal Law & Policy Clinic, who is representing the plaintiffs. Point Reyes National Seashore spokeswoman Melanie Gunn said she couldn’t comment on pending litigation. Tule elk are a subspecies native to California. The 700-pound animals, hunted to near-extinction in the 1800s, were reintroduced to the park in 1978. According to the lawsuit, 152 elk – more than a third of the population – have died since last year, and necropsies show the emaciated elk died of starvation and/or dehydration.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: More than 4.5 million visitors journey to Rocky Mountain National Park annually for views of wildlife along the roads, snow-capped peaks and refreshing waterfalls. But this year they will have the opportunity to marvel at the power of the largest wildfire scars in the park’s 106-year history. Last year’s East Troublesome and Cameron Peak fires burned about 10% of the park’s 265,769 acres and 15% of its 350 miles of trails. While the devastation will cost the park nearly $4 million over the next three years in trail renovation, the burn scar should be a destination rather than a deviation for visitors. Much of the burn scar is located in backcountry wilderness areas closed to visitors due to the severity of the fire. But enough of it can be seen from roads and on trails to offer visitors a once-in-a-lifetime view of the fire’s delicate stroke and insensitive brush. “In some areas we are seeing aspen shoots and beautiful wildflowers in green meadows and waterfalls we have never seen before,” said Doug Parker, the park’s trails supervisor. “In other parts, mainly on the west side, it’s completely black.” Parker said park staff last fall began the arduous task of assessing the damage and rebuilding trails and bridges where they can. Still, he said, park visitors will be shocked at some of the devastation. “Visitors will have a moment to look like a wildland firefighter because when they hike into some of those areas, they will come out with black legs and clothes that are all black and dirty,” he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMystic: The Mystic Aquarium plans to auction off the chance to name three of its five recently arrived beluga whales to raise money for their care and to offset the cost of transporting them from Canada. President and CEO Stephen Coan said the Sea Research Foundation has teamed with New York-based auction house Guernsey’s to hold a fundraising auction Aug. 19 at the aquarium, which it operates. “The three whales will get what we refer to as stage names, and they would be referred to by those names going forward,” he said. The Mystic Aquarium hopes to raise $4 million at the auction, which will also include donated art, perhaps a boat or vintage car, and some unique experiences – such as educational dive trips with scientists to places such as the undersea Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean, Coan said. It will cost the aquarium about $5 million a year to care for the belugas, he said. That includes about $250,000 a year to pay for food and veterinary care for each animal, as well as costs associated with running the habitat and research. The foundation also spent millions of dollars last month transporting the whales from their previous home at Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario, using custom-made stretchers and special tanks inside a C-130 cargo plane, Coan said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: House lawmakers on Wednesday approved a spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 that adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the budget that Democratic Gov. John Carney proposed in January. House members voted 38-1, with two abstentions, for a $4.77 billion general fund operating budget for fiscal 2022. That is an increase of almost 5% over the current year’s budget and roughly $65 million more than what Carney had recommended. House members also voted unanimously for a “supplemental” budget bill of one-time expenditures that brings the increase over the current year’s $4.5 billion operating budget to more than 10%. With state revenue estimates having skyrocketed since January, lawmakers included more than $221 million in one-time funds for a variety of expenditures next year. The budget bill, which now goes to the Senate, includes $22.7 million for across-the-board pay raises of $500 or 1%, whichever is higher, for state employees. They also approved almost $15.3 million for $500 bonuses to government retirees. Other one-time expenditures include $20 million for state employee health insurance costs and $5 million for a loan program that helps volunteer fire companies upgrade equipment and improve facilities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A pedestrian bridge collapsed over a highway in the nation’s capital Wednesday, sending five people to the hospital and snarling traffic. The collapse happened just before noon along Interstate 295 in Northeast Washington. The bridge was found to be in poor condition at an inspection just a few months earlier. Investigators believe a truck struck the bridge, causing it to come loose and collapse, said Chris Geldart, deputy mayor for public safety and justice. Several other vehicles were also involved in the collapse. He cautioned that the investigation was still in its preliminary stages. The five people taken to the hospital had non-life-threatening injuries, Geldart said. Chunks of concrete and other debris were strewn across the highway, and both directions of traffic were expected to be closed at least until late Friday. The bridge was lying atop the truck, which was leaking diesel fuel along the roadway, officials said. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Wednesday afternoon that there were no recent reports of structural concerns about the bridge. But Geldart said in a statement later Wednesday that the mayor was incorrect. He said the bridge was inspected in February, and a subsequent report May 25 rated it in poor condition. He said the rating – 4 on a scale of 9 to 0 – marked a threshold prompting a multiyear planning process to replace the bridge.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Wildlife officials have removed 250 alligators from Disney properties in the five years since a 2-year-old boy was killed by an alligator at the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, a newspaper reports. The company has worked with trappers contracted through the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to remove the gators, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Most of the nuisance gators taken from Disney properties are euthanized and sold for their hide and meat, Tammy Sapp, spokeswoman for the wildlife agency, told the newspaper. Some are also transferred to alligator farms, animal exhibits and zoos, she said. Those less than 4 feet long are relocated, she said. Trappers receive $30 for every captured gator, plus the proceeds from any leather and meat sold, the newspaper reports. After Lane Thomas Graves was killed in June 2016, Disney installed a wall and put up reptile warning signs along waterways throughout its resorts. Disney guests said they’re glad the resort is proactively removing gators from its properties. A biology expert agreed, adding that the removals should have a minimal impact on the Florida alligator population.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTybee Island: More summer visitors are flocking to the state’s largest public beach, and that means local officials are writing more tickets for violations. Police on Tybee Island in recent months have been reporting high numbers of citations for beach rule violations such as littering, having glass containers on the beach and climbing on sandbars, WTOC-TV reports. City Manager Shawn Gillen said one particular violation has shown a huge increase: people bringing dogs onto the beach, which the city doesn’t allow. “We’ve written more dog tickets in the last year than we have in the last four years combined,” Gillen said. “It’s one of those things where we’re getting more and more signage to let people know about the rules, and we ask people to go to our website, look at the beach rules and understand them because the code enforcement will be writing a ticket if they see the violation.” Gillen said it’s not just more people coming to the beach that’s driving up citations after the coronavirus pandemic slowed tourism last year. He said the island also has a full staff of code enforcement officers patrolling the beach, which wasn’t the case during the height of the pandemic.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: As some on Maui become overwhelmed by an influx of visitors, the first in a series of sustainable tourism town halls this week focused on lessons learned at another Pacific tourist hot spot. Orion Cruz, a Maui attorney who worked with the government of Palau on tourism issues, participated in the virtual panel, The Maui News reports. Cruz, a former legal counsel to the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Tourism of the Republic of Palau, said the Western Pacific island nation encourages environmentally friendly visitors and enacted measures to ensure sustainability funding. There is a $100 “Palau Pristine Paradise Environmental Fee” added to every international airline ticket, Cruz said. “This hundred dollars supports the country in a variety of ways, but a substantial portion goes to fund Palau’s protected areas network, which is kind of like their national park system,” Cruz said. Tourists also sign the “Palau Pledge” and agree to act responsibly both environmentally and culturally. The virtual panel was hosted by Kelly King, chairwoman of the Maui County Council’s Climate Action, Resilience and Environment Committee. “The community wants action to ensure a future for the visitor industry that protects the people, culture and environment,” King said in a statement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will continue playing a $4,551-per-month housing stipend to the governor for now, a special legislative committee has decided, but the panel will reconsider the matter later this year. The Governor’s Housing Committee voted unanimously to keep the stipend in place, the Idaho Press reports. “We really need to be talking about should we be doing this, should we be doing it at this rate, is it still needed, what are some of the other states doing,” said Sen. Abby Lee, R-Fruitland. The panel will meet again in November or December to consider possible changes. “Does it still make sense today? I don’t know,” said House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian. “I certainly didn’t have enough information to make a decision other than let’s maintain where we’re at.” Idaho is one of just five states that does not provide an official residence for its governor. Some states have historic governor’s mansions, and some require their governors to live in those homes. Idaho hasn’t had an official residence for its governor since the hilltop Simplot mansion, donated to the state by potato magnate J.R. Simplot’s family in 2004, reverted back to the family in 2013. No Idaho governor ever lived in the mansion. Then-Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter was J.R. Simplot’s ex-son-in-law and opted to stay at his ranch in Star rather than moving to the Boise residence. The Simplot family demolished the house in 2016.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The City Council on Wednesday confirmed the appointment of Chicago’s first Black female fire commissioner. Annette Nance-Holt was serving as acting fire commissioner after the retirement earlier this year of Richard Ford. When she appointed Nance-Holt acting fire commissioner, Mayor Lori Lightfoot noted she had more than three decades of proven leadership and a passion for public service. Nance-Holt, who joined the department four years after the first women joined the ranks, will take over an agency with a history of racism and sexism. Earlier this year, Chicago’s inspector general issued a report recommending the department put in place stronger policies to deal with the sexual harassment and racial discrimination. Last month, Nance-Holt welcomed 42 new members to the department, including 13 women and 15 from minority communities. It was during that ceremony that Lightfoot nominated her for the top post. “Graduates, look to Commissioner Nance-Holt’s exemplary example of sacrifice and service, even in the face of her own personal pain and tragedy,” Lightfoot said. “She is the real deal.” Nance-Holt first gained public notice when her 16-year-old son, Blair Holt, was shot to death in 2007 on a city bus shielding a classmate from gunfire. She went on to establish the nonprofit Purpose Over Pain, which helps parents who have lost children to gun violence.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In just a week, teenage workers will no longer have to obtain work permits from schools, expediting hiring at a time when the service industry is desperate for workers. “Now we can interview, make the decision to hire, and they can technically start working that day,” said Matt Eckert, the president of Holiday World, a theme park in southern Indiana where many of the employees are teenagers. The requirement for teenagers to get a work permit from a school has been frustrating for the theme park, not only because it delayed hiring but also because students from Kentucky had to find a school in Indiana to provide that permit, he said. The change in state law will be a help to businesses that rely on younger workers but won’t do much to improve enforcement of labor laws for underage workers, some labor experts say. The elimination of such work permits was part of a wide-ranging bill targeting teenage employment that passed in 2020 with bipartisan support. The bill also increased the number of hours 16- and 17-year-olds could work from 30 to 40 during school weeks and up to 48 hours during non-school weeks. It also eliminated a requirement for breaks. While most of the changes took effect last year, the elimination of the work permit was delayed until this July.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A blaze that badly damaged a former City Hall building and destroyed a makeshift memorial to Black children was being investigated as “suspicious,” according to fire officials. The fire early Wednesday destroyed a memorial created last summer by the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement to honor Black Iowa youth who have died in recent years. Lt. Rick Thomas of the Des Moines Fire Department said the fire was still under investigation, and its cause had not yet been determined, but investigators believe the cause is “suspicious.” Investigators were reviewing video of the fire, reported about 5 a.m. Wednesday. The memorial was at the entrance to the 132-year-old former North Des Moines City Hall, which has been unoccupied for many years. North Des Moines was once its own city but now is part of Des Moines. The memorial, embellished with flowers, candles, signs and other items, has been a site for vigils and marches. About 100 people marched from a park to the memorial June 12 to honor Black and transgender women and children killed in the state and across the country. A statement from the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement said the organization is heartbroken and believes the fire may have been set intentionally.\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: Health officials have identified the bacteria that caused a outbreak of illnesses at a splash park near Wichita. State and Sedgwick County health investigators said Wednesday that the Shigella bacteria caused a diarrheal illness in at least three infected people who visited Tanganyika Wildlife Park. Those people were the three original cases linked to the park, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and Sedgwick County Health Department said in a news release. Several other visitors to the park have reported becoming ill. The Shigella bacteria is spread from person to person through exposure to contaminated feces, the public health agencies said. That can occur through swallowing contaminated water, touching contaminated items and then touching one’s mouth, or cleaning up after someone using the bathroom or changing diapers. An investigation began Friday when several people reported becoming ill after visiting the park. More than 200 people have responded to a survey designed to identify Tanganyika visitors with symptoms of fever, diarrhea or vomiting. It is not yet clear how many of the respondents may be connected to the outbreak at Tanganyika’s Splash Park, The Wichita Eagle reports.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Overhauling the state’s outdated technology for processing jobless claims could take up to three years, Kentucky’s labor secretary said Tuesday as lawmakers delved into problems with the pandemic-stressed unemployment insurance system. The state is in the “latter stages” of selecting a contractor to take on the task of “reworking and rebuilding” the claims-processing system, Labor Secretary Larry Roberts said. “If we can modernize our system, that’s going to make a big difference,” he told the legislative task force that began reviewing problems with the unemployment system. In the meantime, Kentucky labor officials are looking for ways to make more immediate improvements, he said, because of the longer timeline needed to replace the system’s antiquated computer system, which is expected to cost roughly $40 million. “It may take two to three years to make that an outcome,” Roberts said. Like other states, Kentucky was overwhelmed by record waves of claims for jobless assistance caused by the pandemic. Tens of thousands of Kentuckians found themselves in limbo for months as they waited for claims to be processed. Even with most coronavirus restrictions now lifted, lawmakers continue to forward complaints from constituents awaiting jobless aid. Some date back to last spring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: After being missing for 60 years, the gravesite of former Gov. Joseph Walker has been found in Rapides Parish. Walker was the 13th governor of Louisiana, serving from 1850 to 1853. Local historians found the gravesite off Bayou Rapides Road in the city of Alexandria, in central Louisiana, after searching for the landmark since the 1950s, KALB-TV reports. They are hoping a historical marker will be placed at the site. “The fact that the graveyard had been missing for so long is because the tombstone or the markers that we know from that time period are not where they used to be,” said Benjamin Fuselier, a metal detectorist. When Walker died in 1856, he was buried in a family graveyard located on his property in Rapides Parish. In 1864, his former home burned to the ground. A century later, nobody could find the grave. “Something happened around 1960 in which the graveyard was plowed under to use for cultivation of plants. It is a great loss to our state’s history,” said local historian Michael Wynne. Historians said aerial maps, artifacts and witness statements helped pinpoint the location of Walker’s burial site several weeks ago.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The number of people who died from drug overdoses in the state rose to an all-time high last year, surpassing 500 for the first time in the midst of the pandemic, officials said Wednesday. The 504 deaths in 2020 represented a 33% increase over the previous year and easily surpassed the state’s previous high of 418 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the annual report. Gov. Janet Mills said the jump in deaths represents “yet another example” of how the coronavirus pandemic hurt the state. “My heart breaks for every single life lost to a drug overdose. Those we lost are friends, loved ones and community members – people with meaningful lives,” Mills said in a statement. While officials blamed the pandemic for the spike in deaths, the exact correlation was unclear, wrote Marcella Sorg, the report’s author at the University of Maine’s Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center. An estimated 91% of the deaths were accidental overdoses, the number of suicides remained flat, and only one of the victims with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 actually tested positive for the virus, the report said. “We are doing more research to explore whether characteristics of the pandemic, such as isolation, access to medical services” or other factors, contributed to the spike in deaths, she wrote.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Carryout alcohol service will come to an end in this beach resort town just as the Eastern Shore gets ready to celebrate Independence Day, according to officials in Worcester County. And one county over in Wicomico, officials are meeting next week to consider the continuation of carryout alcohol. Gov. Larry Hogan initially allowed establishments to sell carryout alcohol under specific rules to aid struggling restaurants and bars during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hogan used his state of emergency declaration to circumvent county liquor boards. The service became very popular. During the 2021 legislative session, the Maryland General Assembly approved the permanent sale of carryout alcohol, but the new law requires that individual counties opt in. In Worcester County, officials announced Tuesday that carryout alcohol service would be discontinued once Maryland’s state of emergency is lifted July 1. The Wicomico Board of License Commissioners is set to hold a public hearing on carryout cocktails at 1 p.m. Tuesday. The body will open the floor to discuss formally opting in to takeout and delivery, as well as outline drafted regulations for such permitting.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The town has approved creating a fund to pay reparations to Black residents. The Amherst Town Council on Monday voted 12-1 in favor of setting up the fund and requiring a two-thirds vote of the council to authorize any spending from it, The Daily Hampshire Gazette reports. Town Manager Paul Bockelman said establishing the fund means the town can now begin accepting contributions for the effort and decide on a plan to finance reparations work going forward. The council is weighing a proposal to designate more than $200,000 in surplus budget funds as an initial seed investment. The council on Monday also approved creating the African Heritage Reparations Assembly, to develop the town’s reparations plan by Oct. 31, the newspaper reports. It will be made up of six Black residents and one representative from Reparations for Amherst, a local advocacy group. Councilor Mandi Jo Hanneke voted against the fund because she said it was premature to establish it before forming the assembly. Michele Miller, the cofounder of Reparations for Amherst, said Thursday that her group hopes to establish a private fund to bolster the town’s efforts. “We look forward to supporting the African Heritage Community to implement a robust and sustainable reparative plan,” she said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A bipartisan group of lawmakers announced a package of bills Wednesday to curb opioid overdose deaths in the state, which experts say spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement came during a media conference to mandate supportive practices in hospitals and increase access to life-saving medications. Before the pandemic, the state had seen some success in reducing the number of opioid-related deaths, even making it a goal to cut the number of deaths in half by 2024. In 2019, opioid-related overdose deaths decreased by 13.2% from 2018, according to the state. However, from January to June of 2020, opioid-related overdose deaths increased by 20% from the same months in 2019, jumping from 874 to 1,045 deaths. An average of five Michiganders a day died from an opioid overdose in 2019, said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan’s chief medical officer. “Unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic means we’ve had to fight two crises at the same time, and early data, unfortunately, suggests that we actually saw an increase in overdoses in 2020,” Khaldun said. “These deaths are absolutely tragic, but they are preventable as well.” One bill in the package expands access to Naloxone, a drug used to reverse an opioid overdose, for community organizations.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A new report shows a growing number of law enforcement agencies are using drones to help with search and rescue efforts, investigations and public safety. The legislative report says 93 agencies statewide either maintained or used a drone in 2020, with 1,171 flights recorded. The report is the result of new regulations lawmakers passed last year. The bipartisan law prevents an agency from deploying a drone with facial recognition technology unless authorized by a warrant or in exceptional circumstances including an emergency situation that involves the risk of death or bodily harm to a person, KSTP-TV reports. Each time a law enforcement agency uses a drone for one of those purposes, it must be documented and submitted to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which compiles the annual report for the Legislature. The law also prohibits law enforcement agencies from equipping drones with weapons and limits how long drone video can be retained. The aerial equipment gives Cottage Grove police an advantage from above when every moment matters, said Sgt. Michael McCormick. “The whole initial idea of it was to save lives,” McCormick said. “We’ve got parks and water everywhere, so really the idea was to have an extra set of eyes above to assist with officers.”\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A new training facility for people who want to learn coding is coming to the Gulf Coast. The University of Southern Mississippi’s School of Computing Sciences and Computer Engineering and Mississippi Coding Academies are opening a Biloxi location, according to a press release. Applications are open for the new Biloxi Cyber Center, scheduled to launch in early August. Mississippi Coding Academies offer tuition-free 11-month courses. The program was founded in 2017 as a joint project between Innovate Mississippi and the Mississippi Development Authority, a state agency tasked with recruiting new businesses and promoting economic growth. The program’s goal is to offer a nontraditional path to getting into the software field and to offer economic mobility for residents, particularly those from disadvantaged and underserved communities. “Most participants come from under-served families and are either not college bound or found that college did not provide the desired economic independence,” the program’s website says. “Most only have a high school education and are typically earning part time minimum wages.” The program has three other training locations, in downtown Jackson, Starkville and south Jackson.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge ruled Wednesday that a ballot measure to expand Medicaid in the state is unconstitutional, meaning hundreds of thousands of newly eligible low-income adults won’t be able to access the health insurance program July 1 as promised. Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem wrote that the voter-approved amendment unconstitutionally sought to force lawmakers to set aside money for the expansion. Under the Missouri Constitution, lawmakers can’t be forced to make appropriations unless the ballot measure includes a funding mechanism. Beetem wrote that the amendment “indirectly requires the appropriation of revenues not created by the initiative and is therefore unconstitutional.” Voters approved Medicaid expansion last August, passing a constitutional amendment by 53% of the vote. It was set to take effect July 1. But Republican Gov. Mike Parson declined to provide coverage for an estimated 275,000 newly eligible low-income adults after the GOP-led Legislature refused to provide any extra funding to do so in the state budget. Three low-income women, including two mothers, sued the state to try to force Parson’s administration to give them the health insurance coverage. The plaintiff’s lawyers said they will appeal Beetem’s decision.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A punishing drought in the West is drying up waterways, sparking wildfires and leaving farmers scrambling for water. Next up: a plague of voracious grasshoppers. Federal agriculture officials are launching what could become their largest grasshopper-killing campaign since the 1980s amid an outbreak of the drought-loving insects that cattle ranchers fear will strip bare public and private rangelands. In central Montana’s Phillips County, more than 50 miles from the nearest town, Frank Wiederrick said large numbers of grasshoppers started showing up on prairie surrounding his ranch in recent days. Already they’re beginning to denude trees around his house. “They’re everywhere,” Wiederrick said. “Drought and grasshoppers go together, and they are cleaning us out.” Grasshoppers thrive in warm, dry weather, and populations already were up last year, setting the stage for an even bigger outbreak in 2021. Such outbreaks could become more common as climate change shifts rainfall patterns, scientists said. To blunt the insects’ economic damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week began aerial spraying of the pesticide diflubenzuron to kill grasshopper nymphs before they develop into adults. Approximately 3,000 square miles in Montana are expected to be sprayed, roughly twice the size of Rhode Island.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Federal regulators have ordered a rancher and Cherry County officials to clean up a remote stream after it was deluged with enough sand and sediment to change the shape of the waterway. The Environmental Protection Agency said the Snake River had been a deep and narrow creek until an estimated 1.6 million tons of sand washed into it, turning a 3-mile stretch into a wide, shallow and sandy waterway, according to the Omaha World-Herald. That’s enough sand to fill an area the size of a football field about 540 feet deep. The stream is a popular fishing and canoeing spot in the Sandhills, a desolate region of grass-covered sand dunes in north-central Nebraska. The sand and sediment flowed into the Snake River after a 2.5-mile ditch was excavated to the river to drain water from a flooded pasture and road. Federal officials said the sand was deposited into the stream without proper permits. Under the federal Clean Water Act, the sand and sediment are considered pollutants. On June 14, the EPA ordered rancher Dick Minor of Gordon, Nebraska, and Cherry County officials to stop the erosion and create a plan within 60 days to permanently stop the flow of sediment into the stream. Minor and the county were also ordered to restore the stream’s deep channel “to the extent technically feasible.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state has agreed to pay $175,000 in legal fees to settle a lawsuit with a rural church over COVID-19 capacity caps on religious gatherings that a U.S. appeals court found illegal in December. But while no COVID-19 restrictions have been in place since June 1, a second church is continuing to press for a federal court order declaring Gov. Steve Sisolak’s earlier limits unconstitutional. Lawyers for Calvary Chapel Lone Mountain in Las Vegas filed a motion in U.S. District Court on June 11 seeking permission to amend its complaint against Sisolak, Attorney General Aaron Ford and Justin Luna, chief of the Nevada Division of Emergency Management. They said a formal ruling is necessary to prevent the state from enacting similar illegal orders in the future and to force compensation for the harm suffered by the church’s parishioners and other businesses deemed nonessential under the governor’s emergency directives. “Unless and until injunctive relief is granted, plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm for which they are left without an adequate remedy at law” and “be fearful of exercising their right to peacefully pray, assemble, engage in business and to be treated for COVID-19,” the motion says. Last year, indoor religious gatherings in Nevada were subject to a hard cap of 50 churchgoers, while attendance limits at many businesses, including casinos, were based on a percentage of the buildings’ fire-code capacities.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth College has relaxed many of its COVID-19 rules, including no longer requiring people who are fully vaccinated to wear masks and lifting physical distancing and dining restrictions. Provost Joseph Helble said Wednesday that Dartmouth was easing protocols in light of the fact that 83% of the students who will be on campus this summer have already been vaccinated, the Valley News reports. The college announced in April that all students will be required to be vaccinated ahead of the fall term. Dartmouth also is requiring employees to be vaccinated by Sept. 1. Employees can request religious and medical exemptions, but those who remain unvaccinated will be subject to wearing personal protective equipment, maintaining physical distancing and being tested more frequently for the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTeaneck: With flag twirlers, a gospel choir and seemingly endless proclamations from local officials, Teaneck and Englewood named streets after the Isley Brothers in the towns where the musicians lived in their heyday. “It’s a ‘wow’ moment,” Ernie Isley said. “This is a spectacular culmination of a lot of dreams and a lot of prayers.” The suburbs a few miles across the Hudson River from New York City held dual ceremonies Thursday to honor the legendary group that scored hits with songs including “Shout,” “Twist and Shout,” “It’s Your Thing,” “That Lady” and “Fight the Power.” Ron Isley lived in Teaneck and Ernie in neighboring Englewood during the 1960s. Another brother, Rudolph, lived in Irvington, about 12 miles south of Teaneck. The brothers helped put Teaneck on the map when they launched the T-Neck record label, known to generations of music fans for the distinctive orange dust jacket on its 45 rpm records. A local music fan, Teaneck resident Ira Buckman, hit upon the idea of renaming part of Van Arsdale Street as Isley Brothers Way two years ago, inspired by watching a rerun of the movie “Animal House,” which iconically features “Shout.” The town’s council approved it and, after a delay due to the coronavirus pandemic, unveiled the new sign Thursday on Isley Brothers Day. Former bandmates and neighbors reminisced about befriending the brothers in the ’60s and ’70s. Neighbors recalled swimming in Ron Isley’s family’s backyard pool all summer long and never being turned away, or hearing the group’s new songs before they were released to the general public.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Many communities are behind the curve when it comes to investing in drinking water infrastructure as persistent drought threatens supplies, and the state’s fragmented funding process makes it hard to know what taxpayers are getting for their money, legislative analysts said Wednesday. New Mexico provided roughly $876 million for water projects over a five-year period. But the analysts told members of the powerful Legislative Finance Committee during a meeting that communities aren’t doing enough to leverage federal and local dollars. A review of the state’s numerous financing mechanisms for water projects found that New Mexico over the past decade made proportionally more grant and loan funding available for water projects than any other state in the U.S. But inconsistent vetting and piecemeal funding put projects at greater risk of being delayed or derailed, according to the review. About one-third of the state-funded local water projects that were examined did not meet their intended purpose – even several years after the initial funding was issued. In the village of Maxwell, for example, $1 million was spent to drill and equip a new drinking water well that could be used in times of drought. A $30,000 shortfall resulted in the well not being hooked up to electricity, leaving the project unfinished and unable to yield any public benefits. Similar issues were found with projects in Lovington and Pecos.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New-York Historical Society is creating a new archive that will focus on “marginalized communities and inclusive voices” in the city over the past quarter-century. The Diamonstein-Spielvogel Institute for New York City History, Politics, and Community Activism will chronicle “important political, social, and cultural moments from the mid-1900s to the present,” the historical society announced Thursday. “We are so grateful for the initiative and support of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Foundation for this new endeavor, which will help scholars and the general public to understand how political and social movements, focused on balancing individuals’ right to self-determination with their responsibility to one another, have shaped our city’s history,” Dr. Louise Mirrer, the society’s president and CEO, said in a statement. Initial contributions to the archive will include documents on the building of the High Line in Manhattan. The archive also will include materials already available at the society, including those on Occupy Wall Street. Dr. Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, the foundation’s chair and a former commissioner of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and former chair of the New York State Council on the Arts, is contributing her own papers to the archive.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state would end offering supplemental benefits from the federal government to the unemployed in roughly a month under legislation finalized Wednesday by Republicans in charge of the General Assembly. But House and Senate Democrats voted almost unanimously against the compromise hammered out by GOP leaders from both chambers, signaling a possible veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The legislation would do away with the $300-a-week Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation benefit for at least 200,000 displaced workers in the state. A $100-a-week additional payment for self-employed workers also would end. Both coronavirus aid programs already are set to expire nationwide in September, but Republicans have agreed with business owners’ concerns that the extra benefits are a disincentive for some to return to the workforce after being months at home. Twenty-six states, all but one with Republican governors, have already decided to withdraw early from the program, according to the National Employment Law Project. By ending the $300 weekly supplement benefit, the final legislation sides with what the House approved earlier this month.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A longtime animal doctor from Hettinger has been named the new state veterinarian and animal health division director, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring announced Wednesday. Dr. Ethan Andress will take over for Dr. Susan Keller, who is retiring after serving the state for 23 years. Andress will start July 12. Andress is owner and partner of West River Veterinary Clinic in Hettinger, where he has worked as a mixed animal practitioner for 24 years. He graduated from South Dakota State University in 1994 with a bachelor’s degree in biology. He earned his doctor of veterinary medicine degree from Iowa State University in 1997. “Dr. Andress brings valuable experience in the field of veterinary medicine and extensive knowledge of bovine, equine and bison medicine,” Goehring said. “His business background will also be an asset to our animal health programs and the state.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state that launched the national movement to offer millions of dollars in incentives to boost COVID-19 immunization rates concluded its program Wednesday, still unable to crack the 50% vaccination threshold. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s May 12 announcement of the incentive program had the desired effect off the bat, leading to a 43% boost in state vaccination numbers over the previous week. But numbers of shots administered have dropped since then. “Clearly the impact went down after that second week,” DeWine acknowledged Wednesday. About 5.5 million residents had received at least one shot of a vaccine as of Wednesday, or about 47% of the population. About 5 million people, or 43% of the population, have completed the process. While the incentive’s success was short-lived, it got Ohioans who either were straddling the line or had no plans to get a shot to make a move, the governor said. As evidence, Jonathan Carlyle of Toledo, an Amazon delivery driver who won the second $1 million prize June 2, said the next day: “When y’all announced the Vax-a-Million, as soon as I heard that, I was like ‘Yes, I need to go do this now.’ ” DeWine continues to urge Ohioans to get vaccines, saying the end of state social distancing requirements, the return to in-person school classes in the fall, and the multiplying of coronavirus variants remain concerns.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Efforts to build a new food distribution warehouse on the property of Ebenezer Baptist Church experienced an unexpected obstacle related to a hot-button, widely misunderstood topic: critical race theory. The Rev. Derrick Scobey said a professional land surveyor entered into a contract with the church but refused to honor it because he disagreed with the preacher’s views on critical race theory. Scobey, who is African American, said Bob Manley, with The Manley Co., agreed to provide land surveying services for the warehouse project, with work to be completed no later than June 14. The minister said staff from Manley’s company came out to the church and did some work, and all the company had left to do was submit the necessary drawings to the church. However, Scobey said Manley, who is white, contacted him to say that he had no plans to finish his part of the project. Scobey said when he asked why, Manley said it was because Scobey was among a group of Black ministers who met with Gov. Kevin Stitt to urge him to veto a measure effectively banning critical race theory from Oklahoma classrooms, a few days before Stitt ultimately signed the measure into law last month. Attempts to reach Manley for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s aviation authority tried to circumnavigate Oregon’s land-use system in adopting a plan to extend the runway at Aurora State Airport, the state’s Court of Appeals determined. The Land Use Board of Appeals’ decision to uphold the aviation board’s plan was flawed because “there is no evidence in the record to support LUBA’s erroneous findings” in the case, the court said in reversing and remanding the body’s decision. The court said the Land Use Board of Appeals “misunderstood its task” and mistakenly relied on testimony from Department of Aviation staff and associated businesses around the airport when making its decision. The airport, located just outside the Aurora city limits, is the third-busiest in Oregon and one of 28 the state owns. For years, the state and associated businesses advocated to extend the runway to 6,004 feet from its current 5,004 feet, arguing it wouldn’t be used for allowing bigger aircraft but would allow the planes that currently use it to fly out with larger fuel loads.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Lawmakers made a final vote Thursday to approve a bill to let parents decide whether to have their children repeat a year of school, a measure designed to help children catch up after a year of schooling disrupted by the pandemic. The Senate voted 50-0 for the proposal, which also would permit students in special education to return for another year, even if they have reached the maximum age of 21. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has not taken a stand on the bill, though his office said Thursday that there are concerns about how it might affect schools’ finances, staffing and programming. “We will review the bill when it gets to the desk,” said Wolf press secretary Lyndsay Kensinger. Under the bill, parents would have to decide by July 15 whether their child should repeat a grade. Students could participate in extracurricular activities but would not get another year of eligibility to play sports if they have already maxed out. Students who have reached age 18 would be able to make their own decision about whether to repeat a year. “Some students have struggled, and it makes sense to give parents a stronger say in whether their child should advance to the next grade level or repeat a grade to make up for learning loss,” said the sponsor, Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, R-Centre.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Years of “noes” have culminated in the Legislature saying “yes” to a proposal that would remove lawmakers’ authority over approving who has permission to officiate marriages. Lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a proposal that would end the General Assembly’s role in deciding who gets to officiate a wedding in Rhode Island. The bill awaits the signature of Gov. Dan McKee, who has said he supports it. Currently, people who are not either a member of clergy or a judge need special permission from the Legislature before they can perform a wedding in the state. But that can be a time-consuming and confusing process, said those who supported the change. “It is an inconvenience to the people of Rhode Island that they need to seek a formal act of law just because they want a friend or family member to officiate at their wedding,” Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey, who introduced the bill in the Senate, said in a statement. There have been multiple attempts in recent years to amend the law. Supporters of the bill also argued that the current law allowed opponents of gay marriage to deny marriage bills for LGBTQ couples.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWest Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster again said the state is recovering better from the COVID-19 pandemic than just about any other as he held a ceremonial signing Thursday of a bill preventing people from suing companies over the coronavirus. The new law protects businesses and other groups as long as they follow guidelines to protect people from the virus. Dozens of other states have passed similar measures. McMaster headed less than 2 miles across the river from his Statehouse office to Cafe Strudel, whose owner praised him and the Legislature for taking steps to reduce his risk from reopening after the worst of the pandemic. The governor again said his decision to resist closing restaurants and other businesses and allow them to reopen more quickly meant South Carolina suffered fewer economic problems. “As a result a lot of other states are struggling to get out of the holes they were in. We’re ready to blast off,” McMaster said Thursday before signing the bill that he initially signed April 28. COVID-19 has killed more than 9,800 people in South Carolina since March 2020. Only about 37% of the population has been fully vaccinated against the disease. After the bill signing, McMaster said he wasn’t worried about the low vaccine rates or new coronavirus variants. “We’re always on alert,” the governor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Shipping delays from China and record-breaking sales from last year are having an impact on fireworks supplies this Fourth of July, according to industry experts. Douglas Bellinger, owner of Extreme Fireworks in Rapid City, said a shortage is limiting the amount of products he can sell this year. “It’s quite a shortage on the 24-shot artillery shells and a lot of our littler stuff that we sell,” he told the Rapid City Journal. According to Bellinger, fireworks supplies from China normally take 30 days for shipping, but this year it’s taking 60 days. “There’s also trouble when they hit the docks and yards in California; getting a truck here is taking longer, too,” he said. The fireworks industry was not immune to the coronavirus pandemic that caused closures and staffing problems in the supply chain. “For example, we ordered seven containers and only got two of them, so we are five short,” Bellinger said. “Each container holds 800 to 1,000 cases, so the supply issues are impacting how much we have to sell.” And Bellinger said fireworks have been in high demand since last year when more people celebrated Independence Day at home. “Last year was a great year. They were wanting to get out and were tired of being cooped up,” he said. “It ran the supplies short here and emptied a lot of the warehouses.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Residents can now search the full records of many state Supreme Court cases through an online database thanks to the Tennessee State Library and Archives. The opinions have long been available electronically, but the associated case files were stored in more than 10,000 boxes in the attic of the Capitol building, according to a news release from the Administrative Office of the Courts. For more than a decade, Library and Archive staff has been cleaning and indexing these records. Today, about 85% of the collection is available online. Court of Appeals Judge Andy Bennett, through his leadership role in the Tennessee Supreme Court Historical Society, helped make the project happen. “You can open up a book and find the opinion, but you don’t have the briefs. You don’t see the arguments. You don’t have the depositions,” Bennett said. “If you really want to go behind the opinion, these documents are great.”\n\nTexas\n\nMcKinney: A grand jury has declined to indict eight jailers over the in-custody death of a Black man after struggling with detention officers. But the Collin County grand jury also issued a rare statement Tuesday calling for the creation of a work group to study the March death of Marvin Scott III to prevent something similar from happening again. “We sincerely hope that the loss of Marvin Scott III will not be in vain,” the statement said. “We are therefore recommending that a work group be convened as soon as practicable to study the events of March 14th for lessons learned in an effort to avoid any similar future tragedy.” The grand jury found no probable cause to charge the eight jailers with a crime in connection with Scott’s death, which was ruled a homicide in April. A medical examiner found that Scott died of “fatal acute stress response” while struggling with officers who were trying to detain him. The medical examiner said Scott was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his family has said Scott was likely in a mental health crisis at the time. Scott was arrested March 14 at an outlet mall in Allen on a charge of possessing less than 2 ounces of marijuana, authorities have said. Allen officers took Scott to a hospital because he was reportedly acting erratically. He was released, and police took him to the county jail, where he was placed on a restraint bed, authorities have said. Deputies used pepper spray and covered Scott’s face with a spit mask, which authorities have said fit over his head. Scott became unresponsive at some point and later was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The city has issued a fireworks ban as drought conditions worsen throughout the state. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said Tuesday that the ban covers fireworks including smoke bombs and sparklers. Mendenhall also issued an open burning ban that prohibits people from starting any fires outside. Utah is experiencing its worst drought in decades. About 90% of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories. “Our foothills, our open spaces, and even our yards and park strips are dry and could be ignited by a single spark,” Mendenhall, a Democrat, said in a statement. “These conditions present a very real, immediate threat of fire.” Fireworks are banned on all state and unincorporated business lands, but Republican Gov. Spencer Cox has said he does not have the legal authority to enact a statewide ban. It is unclear if state law allows cities to outright ban fireworks, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Public safety code prevents local governments from prohibiting explosives around July’s Independence Day and Pioneer Day holidays, except “in certain areas with hazardous environmental conditions.” Republican legislative leaders have avoided taking action to ban fireworks statewide and instead have encouraged local governments to implement their own restrictions.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The Norman Rockwell Museum of Vermont is planning to close its doors at the end of the year, almost half a century after its opening. The museum recently reopened after being closed for months because of the pandemic. Business has been slow amid the decline in tourism and travel during the past year, the Rutland Herald reports. Co-owner Colleen Schreiber said the museum is trying to sell its retail stock, but there is no definitive closing date for now. Schreiber also cited personal health concerns as a reason for closing the museum. “We’re in our 80s,” Schreiber said. “We have our health issues and nobody to turn it over to.” Currently, the museum owners are trying to find a new home for the art collection in Vermont before the official closing, which Schreiber said will be before the fall. She said the museum had been open for more than 40 years and housed 2,000 of Rockwell’s commercial art works. “It would appear at this time there’s not a market for (the museum), which is a shame because the Norman Rockwell legacy is a Vermont signature,” said Lyle Jepson, executive director of the Chamber & Economic Development for the Rutland Region.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Three entities have already expressed interest in acquiring two statues of Confederate generals from downtown parks, including one that was the focus of a violent white nationalist rally in 2017, according to city officials. Earlier this month, the City Council voted unanimously to remove the statues of Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. Virginia requires a 30-day window for the city to offer the statues to any museum, historical society, government or military battlefield. Officials say three entities have submitted statements of interest so far, according to The Daily Progress. City Manager Chip Boyles said at Monday’s council meeting that two of the interested entities are in state and one out of state. The offer expires July 7. Downtown business owner Cali Gaston urged the council to remove the statues as quickly as possible and place them in storage until arrangements can be made. “Please don’t give them to just any organization offering to pay. They need to be in the hands of an organization that is trusted to speak for the whole community,” Gaston said. “One that will help shift the narrative to one that is inclusive and anti-racist.” White supremacist and neo-Nazi organizers of the August 2017 “Unite the Right” rally said they went to the city to defend the statue of Lee. They clashed with counterprotesters before a white supremacist plowed his car into a crowd of people, killing a woman.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A local lawmaker wants to condemn a city-owned park with a large homeless encampment next to a courthouse and declare the area a public safety hazard or nuisance property. Under the proposal by King County Councilman Reagan Dunn, the county would acquire the park from the city of Seattle and request that Executive Dow Constantine relocate the park’s dozens of residents to transitional or permanent housing, provide additional security, and fix damage to the park, The Seattle Times reports. The proposal came after the fatal stabbing June 17 of a 31-year-old man in the park. Seattle police Sgt. Randy Huserik, a spokesperson for the department, said police responded to 100 calls of service at City Hall Park between April 13 and June 20, including assaults, robberies, warrant arrests and public disturbances. “The city of Seattle has no one to blame except for themselves for failing to abate the nuisance and keep that area safe,” Dunn said. “People have the right to a safe county courthouse, and we shouldn’t have to fight this hard for it.” The adjacent King County Courthouse belongs to the county, and taking over City Hall Park would allow it to be policed by the King County Sheriff’s Office instead of the Seattle Police Department, he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The University of Charleston and Bethany College both say COVID-19 vaccinations will be required for the upcoming academic year at the private schools. University of Charleston President Marty Roth told news outlets that it is the school’s responsibility to provide a healthy environment for the 1,500 students expected at the Charleston campus and 200 at the Beckley campus. The way to do that is to require students to be inoculated, he said. Students at the university won’t have to wear masks, but 3 feet of social distancing will be required in classrooms and public spaces, Roth said. Bethany College’s vaccination requirement was decided by the college’s Pandemic Response Team in accordance with Centers for Disease Control guidance, the school said. “I applaud our community for its commitment to protecting one another, and I believe strongly that our decision to require the vaccine will maximize the Bethany experience even more,” Bethany President Tamara Nichols Rodenberg said in an email announcing the update.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s tourism and entertainment businesses, hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, are getting some financial help to recover. Gov. Tony Evers said Thursday that more than $140 million in federal grant money will be available for the lodging industry, movie theaters, live event venues, minor league sports, and other entertainment and tourism businesses. The grants from the federal economic stimulus bill passed by Congress earlier this year will be administered by the Wisconsin Department of Administration and Department of Revenue. “Last year, local venues kept their doors closed to help protect their communities,” DOA Secretary Joel Brennan said. “Now that nearly half of all Wisconsinites have received at least one dose of the vaccine, life is returning to normal. Minor league ball games are welcoming back families, theaters are reopening, and concert venues are booking new shows. These investments will ensure our communities bounce back stronger than before.” The lodging industry will receive $75 million in funding, with $12 million reserved for small businesses that host live events and about $11 million for movie theaters.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: The risk of wildfires is growing with more warm, dry weather in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. The fire danger in Yellowstone is rated as “high,” and in Grand Teton it’s “very high.” The scale tops out with “extreme” fire risk. The parks aren’t there yet, but more hot and dry weather is in store for the weeks ahead, Grand Teton officials warned Wednesday. Already this year, firefighters in the Grand Teton area have put out 52 unattended or abandoned campfires, up from 18 at this time in 2020, park officals said. They discouraged visitors from having campfires. Those who do should have plenty of water on hand to douse and stir their fires until the fire pit or ring is cool, they said. Fireworks are prohibited in the parks and surrounding areas. Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service has begun efforts to control an invasive grass in the area of a massive wildfire last fall in Medicine Bow National Forest, among Wyoming’s biggest wildfires in recent memory. A helicopter began spraying herbicide Monday to reduce cheatgrass in burned areas. Spraying will continue for about two months, forest officials said. Cheatgrass is a nonnative species that can proliferate in disturbed environments and burns readily, destroying sagebrush and other native plants.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/06/02/wolfgang-van-halen-slams-eddie-van-halen-death-special-autopsy/7489351001/", "title": "Wolfgang Van Halen slams 'disgusting' Eddie Van Halen death special", "text": "Wolfgang Van Halen and his mother Valerie Bertinelli are pushing back against an upcoming TV special that examines the demise of late Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen.\n\nThe special is part of the Reelz docuseries “Autopsy: The Last Hours Of...” which seeks to reveal “the truth behind the controversial deaths of global icons” by reconstructing the famous person’s “final hours using crucial medical evidence” from their autopsy, according to Reelz’s official website.\n\nThe episode on Van Halen’s father Eddie, set to air Sunday, will feature commentary from Dr. Michael Hunter, a forensic pathologist who will analyze “every detail of Eddie Van Halen’s life in order to piece together what else may have been going on in his body, ultimately leading to his untimely death,” a description of the episode reads.\n\nLook back:Eddie Van Halen, legendary guitarist, dies of cancer at 65\n\nOn the road:Wolfgang Van Halen says rock is 'on its way back' as he launches tour with Dirty Honey\n\nNeed a break?

Although Macon County has asked a court to give it the deed to a downtown square where the memorial has stood for 115 years – potentially a key first step toward taking down the statue – the United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the square legally and wants the monument to remain, said Jay Hinton, an attorney for the group, in its first public response to the court fight. “All of those members have ancestors who are honored by that monument,” he said. The monument, located in front of the county courthouse in a city of 9,400 that is 97% Black, has been the subject of on-and-off protests and attempts to remove it for decades. The monument went up at a time when groups all over the South were erecting Civil War memorials to honor rebel troops and portray the cause of the Confederacy as noble. Hundreds have been taken down in recent years as they came to be seen as symbols of racial oppression against Black people.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Alaska could receive more than $1 billion from the recently passed federal infrastructure package for high-speed broadband networks, which an official with the Alaska Telecom Association said would be “transformational.” Christine O’Connor, the association’s executive director, also told Anchorage television station KTUU that the funding represents a significant opportunity to make investments in broadband. “We’ve never seen an environment like this before for broadband,” she said. O’Connor was a member of a broadband task force established by Gov. Mike Dunleavy that recently released a report on improving internet access. The federal package, supported by Alaska’s congressional delegation, is expected to provide more than $1 billion to the state for high-speed broadband. Funding also is expected for tribes across the country.\n\nArizona\n\nWintersburg: Emergency sirens designed to alert nearby residents of a problem at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station about 50 miles west of Phoenix were scheduled to be tested Wednesday. The 70 sirens located within a 10-mile radius of the plant near Wintersburg will sound for three minutes at noon and again at 12:30 p.m. Maricopa County will also test a system that send alerts to cellphones once at 12:15 p.m. The system will only send signals to devices in the test area. The sirens or cellphone alert systems notify people in the area that they need to turn on their radios or televisions to get news and instructions on how to respond. The tests are required by federal regulators and overseen by state and local emergency management agencies. The agencies will have people near each of the sirens to ensure they are operating and that the wireless alert system is working correctly. The Palo Verde plant is the largest power plant of any kind in the U.S. and has three nuclear reactors that were completed in the mid-1980s. It is operated by Arizona Public Service Co. and is owned by APS and a consortium of other power companies.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he will call the Legislature back into session next week to take up a tax cut plan, and that he hoped lawmakers would hold off on efforts to enact an abortion ban similar to one in neighboring Texas. Hutchinson said the planned special session was set to begin Dec. 7, with its focus primarily on the tax cut package that calls for reducing the state’s top income tax rate from 5.9% to 4.9%. The package, which also includes corporate tax cuts and a low-income tax credit, would cost the state $135 million in the current fiscal year and grow to nearly $498 million when fully implemented in 2026. Hutchinson is pushing for the tax cuts after the state ended its fiscal year in July with a nearly $1 billion surplus. A coalition of advocacy groups earlier Tuesday called on the Legislature to focus on funding needed services rather than a tax cut they said would primarily benefit higher earners. Hutchinson said the state has been increasing funding for services, even with the tax cuts it’s enacted over the past several years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThousand Oaks: A helicopter crew rescued a man who tumbled down a steep Southern California hillside after his car ended up teetering on the ledge, authorities said. After stopping his car just short of the slope, the man got out, lost his balance and fell about 200 feet into Bell Canyon, the Ventura County Star reported. Multiple agencies including fire and sheriff’s departments and the California Highway Patrol assisted with the rescue in the area on the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. The man didn’t appear to have life-threatening injuries, officials said. He was taken to a hospital to be checked out. Authorities didn’t immediately say how the motorist ended up off the road at the edge of the canyon.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:A Fort Collins Police Services K-9 who helped apprehend a barricaded suspect near the Old Town Square on Monday night went home uninjured because of a vest that protected the dog when police said the suspect tried to stab him. Police responded to a call about 8:15 p.m. Monday that a man had approached another man in the Old Town Square and threatened him with a knife, according to a news release from Fort Collins police. Shortly after the 911 call, police located a suspect, identified as 29-year-old Matthew Bishop, nearby the Old Town Square still armed with a knife, and police said Bishop threatened them with it. Officers used a less-lethal SAGE launcher, which deploys 40mm hard foam batons, to try and safely resolve the situation but Bishop fled the area, according to the news release. Police spokesperson Kate Kimble told the Coloradoan that Bishop barricaded himself in an emergency escape staircase in a building at the northwest corner of College Avenue and Olive Street. Fort Collins SWAT responded to the scene, and crisis team members worked to convince Bishop to surrender, according to police. At about 11:20 p.m., police said Bishop exited the stairwell but tried to run, so K-9 officer Inox was deployed to apprehend him. Bishop allegedly attempted to stab Inox, but Inox’s protective vest saved him from injury. “Inox was not injured, fortunately,” Kimble said in an email. “The vest protected him from the stabbing and likely saved his life.” Bishop was arrested on suspicion of five felony charges, according to police. Court records showed the charges have not been formally filed by the district attorney’s office as of Tuesday night.\n\nConnecticut\n\nUncasville: Gov. Ned Lamont said he does not plan to mandate booster shots for certain workers or reissue statewide indoor mask mandates in stores and restaurants. That’s despite new COVID-19 infection numbers that are the highest in nearly a year and news of the omicron variant being identified in different parts of the world. The Democrat, however, said he does expect that masking requirements in schools will remain in place for now. Lamont said he doesn’t see a need yet to require certain workers to get a booster shot, noting Connecticut ranks among the top 10 states for people getting the third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The governor said encouraging people to get the additional shot is easier than issuing mandates and requirements. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average of daily new cases has increased by 267.4 infections, or 70.8%, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins. One in every 791 people in Connecticut tested positive for COVID-19 in the past week.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Delaware workers’ compensation insurance rates will drop by about 20% in December, according to the Department of Insurance. The voluntary market is seeing an average 20% decrease in voluntary market loss costs, and residual market rates are also decreasing by an average of 20%, according to a press release from the Department of Insurance. It’s the fifth year in a row that workers’ compensation rates have dropped. This year’s decrease, which was decided by the Delaware Compensation Rating Bureau, will go into effect on Dec. 1. Policyholders will see rate changes upon renewal. Savings vary by policy. Lower premiums do not change how much a worker can get in compensation insurance, but it does affect employers. The rates that employers pay help cover medical treatment or lost wages if a worker gets injured on the job. Delaware businesses can save even more money on workers’ compensation premiums through the Department of Insurance’s Workplace Safety Program. Eligible businesses can get up to a 19% discount on insurance, and last year’s total savings was about $7 million, according to the department.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Former President Barack Obama and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, visited a children’s vaccination clinic in Washington to encourage children to get a COVID-19 shot. Speaking to children and parents at Kimball Elementary School waiting to get their second dose of the vaccine, Obama called the pediatric vaccinations “one more thing to be thankful for” during the holiday season. “Nobody really loves getting a shot,” Obama said. “I don’t love getting a shot. But I do it because it’s going to help keep me healthy.” After their surprise appearance in the school gymnasium drawing audible gasps, Obama and Fauci greeted children and their families, posing for photos and giving fist-bumps. The pair passed out stickers to children after they got their shot.\n\nFlorida\n\nSebring: A man is accused of fatally shooting a black bear and one of her cubs, officials said. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said in a news release sent Tuesday that the 43-year-old man shot the bears in the Sun ‘n Lake community in Sebring on Oct. 26. He faces four charges, wildlife officials said. The state attorney’s office is prosecuting the case. “Our officers work tirelessly to protect Florida’s natural resources and this egregious violation serves as a reminder of why our work is so important,” said Col. Roger Young. “The deliberate shooting of these two bears is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.” Biologists with the agency were able to trap one uninjured bear cub in the community and release it in a more suitable habitat, officials said. They saw another cub in the area but were not able to capture it.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta:An Augusta company that uses ethylene oxide to sterilize medical instruments is being sued by residents. The Augusta Chronicle reported the lawsuit by 20 current and former Augusta residents claims a plant operated by Kendall Patient Recovery emitted the cancer-causing gas, putting them at risk. At least two other such lawsuits have been filed in metro Atlanta, one against Covington-based Becton Dickinson and one against Smyrna-based Sterigenics. One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, filed in July, blames the Augusta plant for her breast cancer diagnosis in 1999. She lived 51/ 2 miles from Kendall Patient Recovery. Attorneys for the company seek to dismiss the case, saying Kendall Patient Recovery never exceeded state-permitted emission limits. The company also argued the lawsuit doesn’t prove ethylene oxide is responsible for the illnesses of residents and former workers. Attorneys for both the plaintiffs and defendants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Health said tests of water samples from the Navy’s water system at Pearl Harbor have so far been inconclusive after it received more than 100 complaints about fuel-like odor coming from tap water in the area. Kathleen Ho, the department’s deputy director for environmental health, said samples sent to a Hawaii lab showed there were no contaminants in the water up to five parts per million. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t contaminants in the water, she said. The department expects to get results from samples sent to a California lab later this week. Ho told reporters at a news conference that a department inspector also noticed a fuel-like smell while at Red Hill Elementary School and at a child center in Aliamanu. Ho said all complaints about the fuel-like odor came from people using the Navy’s water system. The department has not received any complaints from customers of the Honolulu water utility, the Board of Water Supply. The department on Monday recommended that all Navy water customers avoid drinking their tap water. It also recommended that those who can smell fuel in their water avoid using it for bathing, washing dishes and laundry.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho is bracing for the likely appearance of the omicron variant, state officials said, noting the state is well-positioned to detect its arrival but a poor vaccination rate among residents could be problematic. Idaho Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen and other officials at a news conference said there isn’t enough known about the omicron variant yet to understand possible ramifications when it reaches the state. It’s not known, for example, how deadly it is or how easily it can spread. It’s also not known how effective vaccines that work against other variants will work against omicron. The state has expanded monoclonal antibody treatment, but it’s not known if that will be effective against the omicron variant. But Jeppesen and state epidemiologist Christine Hahn said getting vaccinated or getting a booster if eligible are the best possible protection, especially because vaccines are known to work against the delta variant, the major strain infecting and killing people in the state now. Mask wearing is also recommended.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Organizers of an effort to restore North Pond in Chicago’s largest park hope to reach their fundraising goal and begin work by early next year. The Chicago Tribune reported that North Pond in Lincoln Park is drying up because of eroding banks and algae bloom. Work to restore it is expected to cost $7.3 million, and a nonprofit organization raised money to dredge the pond. “North Pond has such an important connection for people,” said Doug Widener, executive director of the Lincoln Park Conservancy. The pond was built in the mid-1880s. The restoration plan would deepen the pond to about 8 feet from its current depth of 2 to 3 feet and add erosion controls. Widener said he hopes work can be complete by late summer or early fall next year.\n\nIndiana\n\nBurns Harbor: An explosion rocked a steel mill in northwest Indiana on Tuesday, rattling nearby residents and producing a plume of smoke visible miles away, though no one was injured, officials said. The blast at the Cleveland-Cliffs Burns Harbor steel mill could be felt as far away as Portage, and a plume of reddish-brown smoke was visible as far away as Chesterton, a few miles away. Residents and business owners said the explosion shook their homes and shops about 12 p.m. CST. Cleveland-Cliffs spokeswoman Patricia Persico said the blast took place in a slag pit at the mill along the Lake Michigan shoreline in Porter County. Steel slag is a molten liquid byproduct of the steelmaking process, and it is taken to pits where it solidifies as it cools. Portage Police Chief Michael Candiano said police and fire units were at the scene assisting other agencies. United Steelworkers Local 6787 President Pete Trinidad said no one was injured “and everything is under control.”\n\nIowa\n\nAltoona:The 100th and final Freedom Rock mural will be placed at Adventureland in Altoona, closing out a yearslong project. Iowa artist Ray “Bubba” Sorensen II set out in 2013 to honor service members by painting murals depicting military scenes on large boulders in each of Iowa’s 99 counties. He achieved his goal earlier this year with the installation of a rock in Linn County. The bonus mural at Adventureland will be the second in Polk County. The other is at an American Legion post in Bondurant. Sorensen, a Republican state representative from Greenfield, said in a Facebook posting that he hoped to place the rock right in front of Adventureland by July 4, with further details to come. Sorensen painted his first rock mural in 1999 and has painted rocks in other states, as well. Each rock is different and might reflect certain conflicts, honor the fallen or recognize a county’s history. The only image that doesn’t change is that of a Huey helicopter, made with paint mixed with the ashes of Vietnam veterans.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt has notified state education officials that some public universities are violating a state law passed last week that loosened requirements for obtaining medical and religious exemptions to COVID-19 vaccinations. Schmidt wrote a letter last week to Kansas Board of Regents President Blake Flanders, with copies sent to the University of Kansas Chancellor Doug Girod and Kansas State University President Richard Myers. Schmidt said “at least some” public universities are violating the new law but specifically mentioned the University of Kansas and Kansas State. He said the institutions must “immediately cease and desist” from their requirements. Schmidt’s spokesman said Tuesday that the letter has not been sent to any other institutions. University of Kansas spokeswoman Erinn Barcomb-Peterson said the university has updated its forms and processes to comply with state law and a federal executive order. Kansas State University did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Flanders said in a statement that state universities will follow all state laws in implementing vaccine requirements.\n\nKentucky\n\nBowling Green: Kentucky education officials plan to discuss a proposal that would add more limits on the use of corporal punishment in schools where it is still allowed. A proposed administrative regulation will be up for discussion Wednesday during a Kentucky Board of Education meeting, the Daily News reported. The current state statute permits the use of physical force by a teacher or other caregiver if they believe “that the force used is necessary to promote the welfare of a minor or mentally disabled person.” Most Kentucky schools no longer allow physical force to be used for discipline. More than 150 school districts prohibit corporal punishment, four permit it and and 11 have no clear policy, the newspaper reported. The proposal would make students with disabilities, those who are homeless or those who are experiencing the foster care system exempt from corporal punishment and limit its use on other students. It would require schools that allow physical force for discipline to have a clearly defined policy that limits it to a last resort, limits who can administer it and provides counseling to students afterward.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBossier City: An inmate who escaped from a facility in the Baton Rouge area has been captured in Bossier City, authorities said. Shwilliam Cheevis, 23, was apprehended Monday and taken into custody without incident, Bossier City police said. Law officers were acting on a tip and found Cheevis at an apartment complex with his girlfriend, KSLA-TV reported. Cheevis had escaped from the Dixon Correctional Institute on Thanksgiving Day, authorities said. He was serving time for sentences from Caddo Parish that included aggravated second-degree battery and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and U.S. Senate candidate said she is donating $3.5 million in leftover campaign money to a civil legal aid nonprofit group in the state. Sara Gideon, a Democrat, lost to Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins a year ago. Gideon said her donation to Maine Equal Justice will help the nonprofit create a new project that will create paths out of poverty for families. The new effort will be called the Build Hope Project. The effort will be designed to create new economic opportunities for parents and children and help working parents complete degree and credential programs, Gideon said. The gift “will provide immediate and significant support to working parents earning their degree, to their children – and ultimately to the entire state – by increasing the numbers of higher skilled workers badly needed by Maine’s employers and our economy,” Gideon said. Gideon’s race against Collins broke state fundraising records. Gideon ended the election cycle with more than $10 million in campaign cash.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A sewage overflow has prompted Maryland officials to close part of the Potomac River to shellfish harvesting for the second time in recent weeks. The Department of the Environment issued an emergency order Monday closing about 180 acres of the Potomac River offshore from the St. George Island area of St. Mary’s County, officials said in a news release. After the St. Mary’s County Metropolitan Commission reported the spill Monday, the department dispatched an inspector. The order was issued when it was determined that sewage likely entered the river, officials said. The commission reported that the overflow that began Nov. 24 was stopped Monday and entered ditches that drain to the river. The department estimated about 2,500 gallons entered the river and about 11,000 gallons were vacuumed from ditches. There are no aquaculture leases in the emergency closure area, officials said. Sewage spills in the St. George Island area prompted temporary closures in St. George Creek about two weeks ago and in January. The department will request a meeting with the commission on the repeated system failures and plans to address the sewage spills, officials said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Massachusetts Housing Court judge overturned Boston’s eviction moratorium, saying the city’s public health commission had overstepped its emergency powers. Judge Irene Bagdoian wrote in her decision Monday that evictions are a matter of state law, not local authority, The Boston Globe reported. “This court perceives great mischief in allowing a municipality or one of its agencies to exceed its power, even for compelling reasons,” she wrote, noting that a town could use a similar public health rationale to circumvent affordable housing laws. She added that this type of expansion of power “should be unthinkable in a democratic system of governance.” The moratorium that blocked enforcement of court-approved evictions was put in place on Aug. 31 by the administration of then-acting Mayor Kim Janey, who said it was to protect residents still struggling to pay rent because of the coronavirus pandemic. A city landlord and a constable, who serves judicial processes, challenged it in court. The U.S. Supreme Court in August struck down the Centers for Disease Control’s nationwide eviction moratorium.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration said it wants lawmakers to quickly allocate $300 million in federal pandemic rescue funding to support coronavirus testing at schools amid a fourth surge of infections in Michigan. The money was included in the relief law approved by Congress and President Joe Biden in March. It is set to expire next summer and is part of a $2.5 billion supplemental spending request that state budget director Christopher Harkins sent to the Republican chairmen of legislative appropriations committees on Nov. 19. The GOP-led Legislature returned to session Tuesday after a two-week break. The Senate plans to begin advancing a $3.3 billion proposal to spend federal infrastructure and pandemic dollars on water-quality upgrades, including $1 billion to replace lead pipes and $680 million for dam safety. The House intends to pass $250 million in public safety spending with a mix of federal and state aid. It is unknown if legislators and the Democratic governor will reach a deal in coming weeks.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRosemount: President Joe Biden on Tuesday went to Minnesota to pitch his completed infrastructure deal and a giant social spending bill that he’s still trying to get passed, but also found himself reassuring the nation he would fight the evolving COVID-19 threat without resorting to “shutdowns and lockdowns.” Biden met with students at Dakota County Technical College in Rosemount in a garage space with a bulldozer, backhoe and cargo truck before delivering a speech criticizing GOP lawmakers for opposing his social services and climate spending bill that would expand health care coverage, enhance job training for students at community colleges and offer child care benefits for middle- and low-income Americans. Biden has been eager to build momentum for his agenda but he finds himself again forced to divert attention to the coronavirus. He said that on Thursday, he would detail his plan for how “we’re going to fight COVID this winter, not with shutdowns and lockdowns” but “with more widespread vaccination, boosters, testing and much more.”\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A murder suspect who escaped police custody last week is back behind bars. Aceon Ja’shun Hopkins, 20, surrendered to a family friend in Neshoba County early Tuesday and was taken into custody, Jackson County Sheriff Mike Ezell said. Hopkins escaped authorities Friday while hospitalized with multiple gunshot wounds following a shooting in Moss Point two weeks ago. That case remains under investigation. No charges have been filed, Moss Point Police Chief Brandon Ashley has said. According to Ezell, Hopkins is suspected in two murders that happened in Meridian and has 13 additional warrants for various offenses, including drug charges in Gulfport, WLOX-TV reported. Two other people were also arrested and have been charged as accomplices in Hopkins’ escape, the sheriff said. Breanna Marie Cunningham is charged with aiding escape and Keesler Vonchay Holloway is charged with conspiracy to commit a crime. They were both arrested Monday. Holloway worked at Singing River Hospital in Pascagoula at the time of the escape, Ezell said. She provided information to Cunningham that helped her assist Hopkins in getting away, he said. The investigation into Hopkins’ escape is ongoing and more arrests could occur, Ezell said.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: A bipartisan majority of the St. Louis County Council has called for the ouster of acting Public Health Director Dr. Faisal Khan, but County Executive Sam Page said Khan isn’t going anywhere. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported the council on Tuesday voted 5-2 to adopt a nonbinding recommendation that Page, a Democrat, reject the formal appointment for Khan to lead the health department. The vote was the latest development in a political fight between Page and a council majority who have opposed public health orders issued by Khan to slow the spread of COVID-19. Last week, Khan sent an email thanking employees and telling them “to ignore the lunatic fringe” opposing those measures. And in July Khan was captured on surveillance cameras making an obscene gesture at protesters in the lobby of council chambers while leaving the building. Council members said Khan’s email showed a failure to act professionally under pressure.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:Residents are being asked to avoid the Gibson Flats area on the south side of Great Falls because of a fire that destroyed several structures and is threatening others Wednesday morning, according to the Cascade County Sheriff’s Office. The fire was first reported around 2:40 a.m. Wednesday. Anyone who has been displaced because of the fire and is in need of food or shelter should contact the Salvation Army at (406) 453-0391. Great Falls Fire Rescue is asking residents to stay away from the area of 26th St S and 33rd Ave S and the Highland area. Almost a dozen fire and law enforcement agencies have responded to the fire. There have not been any deaths or injuries reported “to the best of our knowledge,” the sheriff’s office said in a release early Wednesday. A wildfire has also started in the Browning area, according to the Glacier County Sheriff’s Office. The Tribune will provide updates as soon as they are made available. Great Falls and the region continue to experience high winds Wednesday, with gusts of 70 to 110 mph along the Rocky Mountain Front and 50 to 70 mph on the plains. The high winds are expected to continue through Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service in Great Falls.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials have shut down a COVID-19 vaccination clinic north of downtown Omaha, citing repeated vandalism at the site of the drive-thru clinic. The Douglas County Health Department announced in a news release that it’s closing the clinic off Abbott Driver, just north of the CHI Health Center event facility. The department declined to give details about the vandalism, citing an ongoing criminal investigation into the matter. Anyone who had an upcoming appointment at the site for a vaccine will be contacted by by staff to reschedule elsewhere, officials said. The department said it’s looking for a new clinic site and will release information when a new site is opened.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas:Nevada casinos equaled a record streak of eight straight months of $1 billion or more in house winnings in October, with travel, tourism and events returning to pre-pandemic levels in a state dependent on gambling revenue, according to several economic reports. McCarran International Airport said Tuesday that nearly 4.2 million passengers arrived and departed in October, making it the busiest month since the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority totaled nearly 3.4 million visitors in October and said nearly 82% of the region’s more than 150,000 hotel rooms were occupied. Casinos statewide won a little more than $1.2 billion last month, equaling a mark set before the Great Recession in 2007, the Nevada Gaming Control Board reported. The statewide monthly tally of casino winnings was up 19.5% compared with pre-pandemic October 2019.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Annual counts of loons are up slightly in New Hampshire and Vermont, wildlife authorities and advocates said Tuesday. In New Hampshire, the number of territorial loon pairs rose from 321 to 326 this year, according to the Moultonborough-based Loon Preservation Committee. Those are pairs that stay together for at least a month and have a potential to breed, said Harry Vogel, senior biologist with the committee. Vermont’s Fish and Wildlife Department said loons in that state are also thriving. A record of 109 nesting pairs were recorded in 2021 – the highest since loon monitoring began in 1978, the department said Tuesday. Maine is home to the largest population of loons in the eastern United States. Maine Audubon said Monday the count of adult loons increased this year, but the count of loon chicks fell. Loon counters in Maine found 3,446 adult loons this year, up from 2,974 last year, however the number of chicks was down to 224 from 414, Maine Audubon said. Wildlife advocates in the states attributed the increase in loon counts to management measures such as protection of nesting areas. Bans on the use of lead fishing tackle have also played a role, they said. Ingestion of lead can kill the birds.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold:An 85-year-old man who admitted using his SUV to purposely hit and kill a romantic rival three years ago has been sentenced to 10 years in state prison. Johnny Westbrook of Asbury Park pleaded guilty in July to aggravated manslaughter in the hit-and-run death of 63-year-old Daniel Rivera three years ago. Westbrook’s sentence was imposed Monday and made public Tuesday. The incident occurred in December 2018, when Westbrook followed Rivera – his neighbor in an adjacent apartment building – to a nearby store. Westbrook waited outside for several minutes and, when Rivera emerged from the business, Westbrook drove his SUV onto the sidewalk, ran over Rivera and dragged him several feet, according to Monmouth County prosecutors. He left the scene on foot and was later found at his apartment. A month earlier, authorities said the two men got into a physical fight in the apartment building hallway, swinging canes at each other before Westbrook punched the victim in the nose. Defense attorneys tried to have Westbrook declared incompetent for trial, saying he had memory loss. A psychiatrist, though, testified that she believed Westbrook was faking or exaggerating any memory loss.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Several dozen ancient alligator juniper trees have been illegally cut down at El Malpais National Monument in western New Mexico and authorities with the National Park Service are trying to find out who’s responsible. Known for their unique furrowed bark, alligator junipers grow slowly. A seed can take up to 18 months to mature after pollination and the growth rate for young trees is about 0.6 inches per decade, slowing as they get older. Officials said the trees that were cut down were likely hundreds of years old. Lisa Dittman, a spokeswoman for the national monument, said Tuesday that officials don’t know why the trees are being targeted or what they’re being used for. Rural New Mexico residents frequently cut wood in the fall to help with winter heating needs, but cutting trees at El Malpais is illegal. The cutting of alligator junipers affects biodiversity within the monument and officials said the area will take many decades to recover. The initial illegal tree cutting discovery was reported in 2020. But park law enforcement monitoring the area and over the past year have reported additional trees cut down, with the latest incident happening in October. Park employees are encouraging the public to submit any information that would help with the investigation to the National Park Service’s tip line.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city’s troubled jail system is facing more turmoil: the suspension of hundreds of corrections officers for failing to meet a Tuesday night deadline to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The city’s Department of Correction reported 77% of its uniformed staff had gotten at least one vaccine dose as of 5 p.m. Monday, the lowest of any city agency. Corrections Department Commissioner Vincent Schiraldi said Wednesday morning that about 700 jail workers who have applied for religious or medical exemptions can continue to work while their cases are reviewed. That leaves just under 1,100 uniformed staff who are unvaccinated and could be facing suspension, but Schiraldi said some of those workers are on long-term leave for other reasons and he did not know precisely how many workers were suspended for failing to comply with the mandate. The deadline for jail workers to be vaccinated was delayed a month because of existing staffing shortages. Workers who haven’t applied for an exemption and who failed to show proof of vaccination by 5 p.m. Tuesday were to be placed on unpaid leave and surrender any city-issued firearms and protective gear, officials said. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who already imposed similar mandates for other city workers, said he expects the vaccination rate to rise as workers begin missing paychecks or their requests for an exemption are denied.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTabor City: A fire marshal is crediting a 9-year-old girl with saving her family after their home was engulfed in flames sparked by a space heater. Columbus County Fire Marshal Shannon Blackman said the girl was sleeping in her home in Tabor City on Sunday night and awakened to discover a space heater on fire in her bedroom, news outlets reported. She then woke up her younger sister, and alerted the rest of the family to get out of the house. Three of the four adults inside the home suffered second- and third-degree burns, officials said. The girls’ father, David Vela, is a firefighter with the Lake Waccamaw Fire Department who was injured after reentering the burning home to rescue two dogs. Lake Waccamaw Fire Chief Brandy Nance said Vela is in intensive care with third-degree burns on his back in a hospital in Augusta, Georgia. Blackmon said the family lost everything in the fire.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: The trial continues for a Williston man accused of running over several neighbors with his truck, killing one of them. Steven Rademacher is charged with murder, attempted murder and terrorizing in a July 2019 confrontation with some neighbors. Prosecutors said Rademacher sped past the neighbors who urged him to slow down. According to court records, Rademacher turned his truck around and headed toward the neighbors, striking several, including Dyson Bastain who was killed. Rademacher drove away after the people were hit and was arrested a short time later, authorities said. KXNews reported law enforcement witnesses dominated Tuesday’s testimony. Jurors were shown video and pictures from the crime scene. Rademacher’s trial this week was set after a Northwest District judge declared a mistrial in the case in August when the identities of two alternate jurors were revealed.\n\nOhio\n\nBarberton: The remains of an Ohio sailor who died nearly 80 years ago during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor have been identified, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said. The agency said Buford Dyer, 19, of Barberton, was killed Dec. 7, 1941. He was among 429 who died on the battleship USS Oklahoma. Dyer’s remains were identified through DNA testing as part of a federal Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency effort to identify those who were recovered from the USS Oklahoma. He will be buried on April 11 in Seville.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board voted 4-1 to reject clemency for a man convicted and sentenced to die for his role in a quadruple slaying in Oklahoma City in 2005. The board’s denial of a clemency recommendation for 35-year-old Gilbert Postelle paves the way for him to receive a lethal injection on Feb. 17 unless a court intervenes. Postelle did not deny his involvement in the Memorial Day 2005 shooting deaths of James Alderson, Terry Smith, Donnie Swindle and Amy Wright at a home in southeast Oklahoma City. Prosecutors said Postelle, his brother David, father Brad and another man carried out the killings in a “blitz attack” motivated by their belief that Swindle was responsible for a motorcycle accident that left Brad Postelle seriously injured. Gilbert Postelle received two death sentences for the killings of Wright and Alderson after evidence showed he pursued the two as they were trying to flee and shot them from behind with a rifle. But Postelle’s attorney, Robert Nance, argued that Postelle, then 19, suffered from years of methamphetamine abuse that began around age 12 and that he was strongly influenced by his father, who suffered mental injuries in the motorcycle crash that ultimately prompted the slayings.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio, the longest-serving U.S. House member in Oregon’s history, said he is retiring and will not seek re-election next year. DeFazio, 74, is the chairman of the House Transportation Committee. He represents Oregon’s 4th District, which covers the southwestern portion of the state, including coastal communities and the liberal university towns of Eugene and Corvallis. It is seen as a safe seat for Democrats, “With humility and gratitude I am announcing that I will not seek re-election next year. It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as Congressman for the Fourth District of Oregon,” DeFazio said in a statement. DeFazio was first elected in 1986. The last time a Republican was elected to the seat was 1972.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A Pittsburgh man who threw concrete at a police vehicle and injured an officer amid last year’s protests over the murder of George Floyd was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison. George Allen, 31, will also have to serve three years of probation after he’s released. He had pleaded guilty to obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder. Allen threw “multiple pieces” of concrete at an occupied Pittsburgh police vehicle that was parked on a city street during the protests in downtown Pittsburgh on May 30, 2020, prosecutors said. One piece shattered the front passenger window and hit an officer, causing minor bruising to his arm. U.S. District Judge Arthur Schwab, who handed down the sentence, said Allen can remain free on bond until he reports to prison on Feb. 1 to start his sentence.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city has begun providing guaranteed monthly payments to some low-income residents, Mayor Jorge Elorza said. The city received more than 4,000 applications, and 110 residents were randomly selected to participate in the pilot program, said Elorza, a Democrat. They received the first of 12 monthly payments of $500 in November. Most of the participants are women, more than 60% have children and nearly half are Latino. The median reported monthly income for the 110 residents before the payments began was $913. Providence announced in July that it was joining a small but growing number of U.S. cities pledging to provide a guaranteed monthly income to a certain number of low-income residents. Under the Providence Guaranteed Income pilot program, city families living at or under 200% of the federal poverty level were eligible to apply for payments and corresponding benefits counseling. The counseling program is now available to all Rhode Island residents through Dorcas International and Amos House, city and state officials said. Participants will be screened for all the benefits they might be eligible for, and can get help with applying.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nPort Royal: A part owner of a private island in South Carolina accessible only by plane or boat has been given permission to build his own home on the island after Beaufort County last year denied a request to build an ecotourism resort. Bay Point, near Hilton Head Island, was subdivided into lots for houses decades ago, and Timothy Prichard said he intends to build his own house, The Post and Courier reported. Pitcher is one of several partners who own the island. Opponents of the earlier ecotourism plan worried that the building won’t end with just one house. Environmental officials have given permission for a septic tank on the lot, but opponents are asking the state Department of Health and Environmental Control to review that decision. The home also would still need a building permit before construction could start. “It’s clear that it is one of many planned villas,” said Rikki Parker of the Coastal Conservation League. “There’s development on the horizon if that zoning decision is allowed to stand.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:The Great Plains Zoo and the Butterfly House & Aquarium are considering a partnership, the organizations’ CEOs said. Audrey Otto, the CEO of the Butterfly House & Aquarium, said she was approached by Great Plains Zoo CEO Rebeka Dewitz about the potential partnership, and that a committee that includes both of them, as well as two board members from each organization, is exploring whether such a move makes sense. Dewitz said discussions were in the early stages, adding that a third-party consultant, Zoo Advisors, had been hired using a grant from the Sioux Falls Area Community Foundation, and was looking at aspects including economic impact for both organizations.\n\nTennessee\n\nOak Ridge: Federal regulators will review an application to build a low-power test nuclear reactor in Tennessee. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said environmental and safety reviews should be finished by September 2023 for the test reactor planned in Oak Ridge by Kairos Power. Regulators said the 35-megawatt reactor would use molten salt to cool the reactor core, providing insight to develop a bigger version meant for a commercial nuclear power plant. Kairos will need to apply for a separate operating license. In May, the Tennessee Valley Authority announced plans to collaborate with Kairos on the test reactor. The TVA said it generates more than 40% of its electricity from nuclear power and has received the first U.S. preliminary site permit for a so-called small modular reactor, also in Oak Ridge. The TVA said it’s evaluating potential environmental impacts of deploying more than one reactor and more than one design at the Clinch River Nuclear Site.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Regulators of Texas’ oil and gas industry that buckled during February’s deadly freeze moved toward making some producers more prepared for cold weather, but not in time for this winter as the nation’s power grid monitor warned the state is still at risk of blackouts. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is guaranteeing the lights will stay on this winter. But energy experts are less confident and said Texas’ response over the last nine months to a winter storm that killed hundreds of people – including some who froze to death after power was knocked out for days – has been insufficient. Some were concerned that gas operators that froze up in February – cutting off fuel to power plants – would be able to skirt new weatherization mandates by seeking exemptions. But gas supply deemed crucial by the state could not avoid doing so under new rules passed Tuesday, according to state regulators, which critics agreed amounted to an improvement.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:A Virginia man died in Zion National Park on Sunday after a canyoneering incident, officials said. Andrew Arvig, 31, of Chesapeake, Virginia, was on a permitted trip starting Saturday through Heaps Canyon with two others when “they had difficulty negotiating the last few rappels in the canyon which delayed their exit,” a statement said. “Arvig was the first to exit Heaps Canyon, rappelled past a small rock ledge where he needed to land and re-anchor his rope in order to then rappel the remaining distance to the ground,” officials said. “The other members of the group used their ‘pull line’ to rappel to the perch. Mr. Arvig was unable to ascend the 20 feet back to the perch.” After several failed emergency calls because of poor reception, rangers began a search-and-rescue operation Sunday morning with more than 30 rescuers, including a technical rescue team, a helicopter dispatched from Grand Canyon National Park and a Life Flight helicopter and crew from St. George, the statement said. Rescuers found Arvig suspended from a rope about 260 feet above the Upper Emerald Pools or 20 feet below the perch with the two other canyoneers stranded on the perch, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nNorwich: Police in Norwich and nearby sections of New Hampshire are searching for a dog believed to be named “Ruby” that is thought to have killed some chickens. The Norwich Police Department has requested the names of all dogs licensed under the name of Ruby in the nearby town of Hartford and in the New Hampshire communities of Hanover and Lebanon. But so far, police have been unable to locate the owner of the dog believed to have attacked the hen house owned by Norwich resident Eric Picconi on Nov. 15, leading to the death of four chickens. Norwich police said the search is ongoing. The Valley News reported the audio of the attack was recorded by a home security system on which hens can be heard wailing and a dog barking. Then a female voice is heard calling Ruby, which led Picconi to believe that is the dog’s name. Picconi’s property abuts the town’s Huntley Meadow, which has athletic fields, but is also a popular area for dog owners.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: One of two outstanding recounts requested by Democratic incumbents who trail their GOP challengers in Virginia House races is set to take place Thursday and Friday. Republicans won at least 50 seats in the 100-seat chamber in the Nov. 2 election and have said they expect their narrow leads to hold in the 85th and 91st Districts, where the recounts were requested. The secondary count of ballots in Virginia Beach’s 85th District race between Republican Karen Greenhalgh and Del. Alex Askew will kick off Thursday morning, Christine Lewis, the city’s deputy registrar, told the Associated Press. On Friday, any ballots being challenged will be presented to a three-judge panel, which will rule on how such ballots should be counted, Lewis said. Askew, who trails Greenhalgh by 127 votes out of 28,413 counted, announced two weeks ago that he would seek a recount, the same day Del. Martha Mugler said she also would request one in her race against Republican A.C. Cordoza. Cordoza leads by 94 votes out of 27,388 counted. The Associated Press hasn’t called either race. The 91st District recount was expected to take place next week, spokespersons for the House Republican and Democratic caucuses said.\n\nWashington\n\nBellingham: The Lummi Indian Business Council has passed a resolution declaring a disaster after more than 70,000 European green crab – an invasive species – were captured and removed from the Lummi Sea Pond in recent months. The Tribe cultivates shellfish and juvenile salmon in the 750-acre sea pond surrounded by the most productive natural shellfish beds on the reservation. The crabs threaten hatchery operations, Tribal shellfish harvests and might have larger impacts if the infestation spreads, the Bellingham Herald reported. “The appearance of the European green crab is a serious threat to our treaty fishing rights,” Lummi Nation Chairman William Jones Jr. said in a press release. The council passed the resolution after a multiagency effort led by the Lummi Natural Resources Department to remove the predator that consumes shellfish, destroys salmon habitat and is credited with the rapid decline of Maine’s soft-shell clam industry. The crab is highly adaptable and preys on juvenile clams before they reach harvestable age, out-competes native crab species, and wreaks havoc on marine and estuary ecosystems.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Striking workers at Cabell Huntington Hospital were scheduled to vote on a contract offer Wednesday. The hospital made a new contract offer to more than 900 maintenance and service workers, The Herald-Dispatch reported. The Service Employees International Union District 1199 said voting will take place throughout the day with ballots expected to be counted by 8:30 p.m. The hospital’s director of human resources, Molly Frick, said in a statement the hospital is “hopeful that our employees will ratify the contract and we look forward to them returning to work.” Union members went on strike in early November after their contract with the hospital expired.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOneida: The Oneida Nation will legally offer sports betting beginning this week, the first time such wagering has been allowed in Wisconsin. Sports betting is the result of a new gaming compact amendment with the state that allows “event wagering.” That can include betting on sports and events such as nationally televised award shows, professional sports league drafts and professional games, including football, basketball and baseball. Gamblers at the Oneida casino will be able to bet on the state’s three professional sports teams: the Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Bucks and Milwaukee Brewers. Wagering on Wisconsin college athletics or events involving children is not allowed. The Oneida Nation will hold a ceremony Tuesday at its main casino near Green Bay Austin Straubel International Airport to mark the occasion, Press-Gazette Media reported.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon said Friday’s release of the U.S. Department of the Interior’s report on federal oil and gas leasing and permitting was used as an excuse for the Biden Administration’s illegal moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal lands. Quoted on his website, Gordon said, “Instead of selling energy to our allies, as we used to, this administration wants to make us more dependent on our adversaries. And for what? We can do more to reduce CO2 emissions by innovating new technologies that improve our standard of living than regulating into oblivion.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/26/sandy-hook-memorial-rabid-bats-tour-de-turtles-news-around-states/117661940/", "title": "Sandy Hook memorial, rabid bats, Tour de Turtles: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDothan: Police searching the home of a man suspected of attacking a woman in her home found more than 400 pairs of women’s panties, authorities said. Investigators also found dozens of photos of John Thomas Uda’s co-workers taken without their permission from the neck down, leading to 50 counts of voyeurism, Dothan police told news outlets. Uda, 27, also is charged with attempted rape, three counts of burglary, aggravated criminal surveillance and two counts of illegal possession of a credit card. Police are trying to figure out how many of those 400 paris of women’s underwear, which had been worn, might have been stolen. Investigators said worn panties can also be bought on the internet. Uda was accused in 2019 of stealing women’s underwear from laundromats, authorities said. Jail records did not indicate if Uda had an attorney.\n\nAlaska\n\nNome: A miner who said he was harassed by a bear for seven straight nights in the tundra near Nome was rescued when a passing Coast Guard helicopter spotted an SOS, the internationally recognized sign for help, on top of his cabin. The man, who was not identified by the Coast Guard in a statement, was taken to waiting rescue personnel in Nome. The helicopter crew was flying from Kotzebue to Kodiak on July 16 when it saw the SOS on top of the building. The crew circled back over the mining camp and saw a man waving his arms, another recognized sign of distress, the Coast Guard statement said. The man requested medical assistance after the helicopter landed, saying he had been attacked by a bear a few days earlier. The man appeared to have a leg injury and bruising on his torso, the Coast Guard said. The man said the bear had returned to his camp and harassed him every night for the previous week, according to the statement. Friends the same day the man was found had reported him overdue when he hadn’t returned to Nome. The Coast Guard statement didn’t specify what type of bear was involved.\n\nArizona\n\nPage:Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir on the Colorado River, is about to hit the lowest water level since it was filled in 1963, the Bureau of Reclamation said. As of Friday afternoon, agency data showed the elevation at 3,555.35 feet above sea level. Despite the recent rain, officials anticipated the levels to decline to 3,555.1 feet by last weekend. The last time the reservoir dropped that low was in 2005, during the early days of a prolonged drought that continues to linger to this day. Once it falls below that level, it will mark a new low in the reservoir’s history. “The fact that we’ve reached this new record underscores the difficult situation that we’re in,” said Wayne Pullan, regional director for the Upper Colorado Basin at the Bureau of Reclamation, which manages Glen Canyon Dam, during a press call to discuss the milestone. Because of the low water levels, the bureau plans to release water from three upper basin reservoirs downstream into Lake Powell ahead of schedule. The emergency measure is intended to help ensure the water level remains high enough to keep the hydropower turbines spinning and generating electricity.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas’ coronavirus cases rose by nearly 2,000 on Friday as the state’s COVID-19 surge prompted the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to scale back its hospital visitor policy. The Department of Health said the state’s virus cases rose by 1,987 to 372,313 total since the pandemic began. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by 22 to 871, with 328 in intensive care and 159 on ventilators. UAMS announced that beginning Monday it will change its visitation policy to limit patients to one visitor per day. Previously, patients could have multiple visitors a day as long as only one visitor was in the patient’s room at a time. UAMS said it will continue to allow additional visitors for end-of-life situations. UAMS will continue to require visitors to pass a daily health screening and wear a photo ID badge and a face mask. Hospital visitors will also be required to stay in the patient’s room at all times.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: An unvaccinated snow leopard at the San Diego Zoo has contracted COVID-19. Caretakers noticed that Ramil, a 9-year-old male snow leopard, had a cough and runny nose on Thursday. Later, two separate tests of his stool confirmed the presence of the coronavirus, the zoo said in a statement Friday. Ramil is not showing additional symptoms, the zoo said, but because he shares an enclosure with a female snow leopard and two Amur leopards, the staff assumes they have been exposed. As a result, the animals were quarantined and their exhibit was closed. It’s unknown how Ramil got infected. In January, a troop of eight gorillas at the zoo’s sister facility, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, contracted COVID-19 from a keeper who had the virus but showed no symptoms. The gorilla troop, which has since recovered, became the first known example of the virus infecting apes. The case prompted the zoo to request an experimental COVID-19 vaccine for animals for emergency use. The vaccine from Zoetis, animal health company that was once part of Pfizer, was administered to species most at risk of contracting COVID-19, including several primates and big cats.\n\nColorado\n\nWindsor:The city closed Windsor Lake on Friday afternoon and shifted planned activities this week because of the detection of blue-green algae in the water. The lake, swim beach and dog park are closed to the public until further notice while the city works with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to monitor bacteria levels. Permitted boats are allowed on the lake “to assist in agitating the water,” but tubing, water skiing and other water activities are not allowed. The algae was detected in a precautionary water test July 19. On July 20, the town put out an algae advisory and put signs around the lake, but staff had not yet identified any toxins. Blue-green algae are known to spread rapidly and can be a result of hot weather, stagnant water and stormwater runoff. CDPHE said that the algae, while common in Colorado, can sometimes produce toxins that can harm people and be fatal to dogs and other animals.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNewtown: After nearly eight years of discussion and planning, a memorial to the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is nearing construction with the goal of offering a peaceful place for reflection. A groundbreaking ceremony is planned next month at the site down the street where the shooting occurred that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown on Dec. 14, 2012. Construction will be finished before the 10th anniversary next year, officials said. The State Bond Commission approved $2.5 million for the project on Friday, which the town will use to defray much of the $3.7 million local voters approved in April for the total cost of the memorial. The key area of the memorial will be a water feature with a sycamore tree in the middle and the victims’ names engraved on the top of the surrounding supporting wall. The water flow has been designed so floatable candles, flowers and other objects will move toward the tree and circle around it. Pathways will take visitors through a variety of plantings, including flower gardens.\n\nDelaware\n\nDagsboro: A historic chapel that predates the Revolutionary War has reopened to the public following a 16-month closure because of the pandemic. Prince George’s Chapel in Dagsboro welcomed the public for monthly tours Sunday, the Delaware State News reported. “It wasn’t worth even trying to open it up with all the restrictions and everything. So we’ve had it shut down,” Brian Baull, president of the nonprofit organization that serves as caretaker for the chapel, told the newspaper. Tours, which will take place the fourth Sunday of each month, are free. Construction on the chapel began in 1755 and was completed two years later. It was deeded to the state of Delaware in 1967, restored and reopened as a museum. In 1971, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Its most prominent feature is a vaulted ceiling made of heart-of-pine planks, the newspaper reported.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser has activated the District's Heat Emergency Plan for the first half of this week, WUSA-TV reported. The plan goes into effect when the forecast of the temperature or heat index in the District is 95 degrees or higher. That causes the city to open cooling centers for residents seeking relief from the heat. A list of District cooling centers can be found here. In addition, the city recommends that residents stay indoors, find places in the shade or with air conditioning to seek relief from the heat; check on neighbors – children, the elderly and those with access and functional needs are the most vulnerable in the community; dink plenty of water and wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing; do not leave children or pets in vehicles; pet owners should keep pets indoors, walk pets early in the morning and give pets plenty of water.\n\nFlorida\n\nMarathon: A juvenile green sea turtle rehabilitated at the Keys-based Turtle Hospital has been fitted with a satellite-tracking transmitter and released from a Keys beach to join the 14th Tour de Turtles, a marathon-like race that follows long-distance migration of sea turtles over three months. The educational outreach program organized by the Sea Turtle Conservancy raises awareness about sea turtles and threats to their survival. “The Tour de Turtles is an online educational program where, starting August 1, we’re tracking 19 turtles from Florida, Panama, Costa Rica and Nevis,” said Dan Evans, a senior research biologist with the Sea Turtle Conservancy. “It’s the idea that we’re tracking which turtle swims the furthest distance over three months.” Dubbed “Lucky Pulse” by her rescuers for a pulse-like marking on her head, the Keys turtle was released Friday to raise awareness about her own affliction. She was found off the Keys on March 17, entangled in fishing trap line and covered with fibropapilloma, debilitating tumors that develop from a herpes-like virus that affects sea turtles around the world. After the tumors’ removal, Lucky Pulse’s recovery included blood transfusions, breathing treatments, a broad spectrum of antibiotics, fluids, vitamins and a diet of seafood and greens.\n\nGeorgia\n\nColumbus: Residents at a mobile home park said they have had almost no water service for the past three weeks. So little water comes out of the pipes that it is almost impossible to flush toilets, wash dishes or take a bath at the Sea Breeze Mobile Home Park in Columbus, WRBL-TV reported. The water also isn’t safe to drink. “I had to spend three days in the hotel, me and my 8-year-old and my wife. That was money coming out of our pocket,” resident Jeffery Williams said. Water has been restored to some areas of the mobile home park and a citation has been issued to owner Fountain Bleau Capital LLC, said Columbus Inspection and Code Enforcement Director Ryan Pruett. The Massachusetts owner of the park said the maintenance staff was infected with COVID-19 and that delayed fixing the water problems.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A lawsuit challenging using police forces from other islands to respond to protests over a giant telescope planned for Hawaii’s tallest mountain is headed to the state Supreme Court. Police officers from Oahu and Maui flew to the Big Island in 2019 to help control protesters who blocked the mountain’s access road. Opponents of the Thirty Meter Telescope said it will desecrate land held sacred by Native Hawaiians. Big Island resident E. Kalani Flores’ lawsuit against police chiefs of the Hawaii County, Maui County and Honolulu forces argued his rights to observe Native Hawaiian cultural practices on Mauna Kea were violated by the police presence. The state Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case next month, Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported. The lawsuit said police violated a state statute that a police chief can operate on a neighboring island if doing so is required in the pursuit of an investigation that started in that chief’s jurisdiction. The lawsuit was initially dismissed because of a technicality and later went before the state Intermediate Court of Appeals, which ruled in favor of the police chiefs.\n\nIdaho\n\nKetchum: A multiyear project to improve forest health in and around one of the nation’s top ski destinations has begun in central Idaho. The 10-year Bald Mountain Stewardship Project is intended in part to reduce the chances of a wildfire at Sun Valley Resort’s Bald Mountain ski area that operates on U.S. Forest Service land. The Idaho Mountain Express reported that work has started on the Forest Service’s plan to reduce fuel, restore forest health and enhance recreation opportunities. The ski area is a huge economic driver. But pine beetles, dwarf mistletoe and white pine blister rust are killing trees on the ski-run-carved mountain that forms a scenic and much-photographed backdrop for the resort towns of Ketchum and Sun Valley. Experts said the aging forest long protected from wildfires is at risk, leading to the project that also will clear debris within the ski area. The 9-square-mile project includes Sun Valley Resort’s nearly 5-square-mile ski area, of which about 4 square miles is skiable terrain. Officials said wildfires in 2007 and 2013 surrounded 9,150-foot Bald Mountain with burned forest, creating an island of green trees and increasing bark beetle attacks.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockton:Officials have found elevated levels of harmful metals in groundwater monitoring wells at a Rockton Superfund toxic waste site. But the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency noted that the substances were not found in the municipal water system for the Village of Rockton. Its water was tested June 21. Testing of private wells near the site will begin soon. The metals discovered include antimony, cadmium, chromium and nickel. Some metals are essential nutrients, but others can cause health problems. The results came from wells that check groundwater on the site of the former Beloit Corp. toxic waste investigations at the former manufacturer of paper-making products have been underway since 1992. Elevated metal levels were found in 16 of 20 monitoring wells. All are contained on the Superfund site. The samples were collected following the June 14 explosion and devastating fire at Chemtool Inc., located on the Superfund site. Metals were not previously a concern on the Beloit Corp. property. State officials are investigating their source. Officials said that until testing is completed, those with private wells living in the Blackhawk neighborhood adjacent to Chemtool should use bottled water for drinking and cooking.\n\nIndiana\n\nBurns Harbor: Indiana’s Lake Michigan port has seen a big increase in shipments this year as the global economy rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic. In June, the port handled a 52% spike in cargo. So far this year, the Port of Indiana-Burns Harbor has had more than a 36% increase in maritime tonnage compared with the same period last year, said Vanta E. Coda II, chief executive of the Indianapolis-based Ports of Indiana port authority. “Steel is up more than 100% and limestone has climbed nearly 90%, too. We look forward to additional growth in the second half of the year,” Coda said. Through the end of June, international cargos shipped through the St. Lawrence Seaway to Great Lakes ports are up by 8.37% to 12.9 million tons, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported. Great Lakes shipping officials attributed the boost to increased domestic construction, manufacturing activity and global export demand. Shipments of cement are up 36%, gypsum 79% and general cargo 61%. Iron ore volumes are up 14%, partly because of exports to Asia and Europe. Coke, another steelmaking input, is up 125%, partly because of exports to France, the Netherlands and other European countries.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: Forty Iowans, including some from the Cedar Rapids area, had to undergo treatment for rabies after they were potentially in contact with a rabid bat at the zoo in Omaha, Nebraska. More than 180 individuals were advised to receive the rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, which contains the rabies vaccine, after a wild bat was found near a person attending one of the Henry Doorly Zoo’s multiple overnight campouts at the aquarium earlier this month. A total of 186 overnight campers, including youth and adult groups, were contacted by the Nebraska public health department, the Omaha World-Herald reported. Among those were dozens of Iowans, mostly adolescents and their parents, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Linn County Public Health said anyone locally who has been impacted has been contacted and the appropriate follow-up has been conducted. Public health officials in Nebraska recommended all campers who stayed at the zoo overnight June 29, June 30, July 2 and July 3 receive prophylaxis. The recommendation came after a camper staying in the aquarium the night of July 3 woke up to a wild bat near her head. A team found seven bats in the building, one of which tested positive for rabies, a news release from the zoo stated.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:Union members at the Frito-Lay plant in Topeka have approved a new contract and will return to work Monday, ending a nearly three-week strike at the plant, union officials said. Members of Local 218 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers union approved the contract Friday. It gives all union members a 4% pay raise over two years and guarantees workers at least one day off each week, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. More than 500 of the 850 employees represented by the union went on strike on July 5, complaining of a toxic work environment, forced overtime and a lack of pay raises. Workers said the shifts were caused by a severe staffing shortage at the plant. Carolyn Fisher, spokeswoman for PepsiCo., Frito-Lay’s parent company, said the contract allows the company to rebid its entire facility, or parts of it, once during the two-year contract. Labor-management committees will be formed to make recommendations on staffing and overtime and shape the rebid process.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Two members of Kentucky State University’s governing board resigned days before the abrupt departure of the campus president, adding to the upheaval in the highest ranks of the school as it faces an independent investigation into its finances. Soon after M. Christopher Brown II’s resignation as school president last week, Gov. Andy Beshear called for an independent accounting of KSU’s finances and signed an order empowering the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education to provide guidance and oversight during the review. The development came as Kentucky’s sole public historically Black university contended with concerns about its financial health and lawsuits alleging misconduct by campus officials. In the days before Brown’s departure, Candace McGraw submitted her resignation from the school’s Board of Regents. In her resignation letter, McGraw said she was “not fully aware of the time needed to engage fully in order to ensure the ongoing success of the university.” McGraw, a recent board appointee, is CEO of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Paul Harnice also resigned from the school’s board before Brown left, The State Journal reported. Harnice’s resignation letter did not provide an apparent reason for his resignation, The State Journal reported.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: With more than 1,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19 across Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards encouraged everyone, whether vaccinated or not, to wear masks indoors if they can’t stay distanced from others. But the Democratic governor stopped short of issuing a statewide face covering mandate or new restrictions on activities and businesses amid the state’s fourth spike of COVID-19, driven by the highly contagious delta variant. Louisiana – which has among the nation’s lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates – is seeing thousands of new confirmed cases of the coronavirus illness each day, and its hospitalizations have surged in recent weeks. Edwards said Louisiana has the highest rate of new COVID-19 cases per capita in the nation and has been labeled a “state of concern” by the White House. Edwards placed the blame squarely on people refusing to get immunized against the coronavirus in a state where only about 48% of those eligible for the vaccines have gotten at least one shot.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine is home to the last wild Atlantic salmon populations in the U.S., but a new push to protect the fish at the state level is unlikely to land them on the endangered list. Atlantic salmon once teemed in U.S. rivers, but now return from the sea to only a handful of rivers in eastern and central Maine. The fish are protected at the federal level under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, but a coalition of environmental groups and scientists said the fish could be afforded more protections if they were added to Maine’s own list of endangered and threatened species. State law allows Maine Department of Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher to make that recommendation, but his office told the Associated Press he does not intend to do it. The department has done extensive work to conserve and restore the fish, and Keliher “does not believe a listing at the state level would afford additional conservation benefits or protections,” said Jeff Nichols, a department spokesperson. The environmentalists who want to see the fish on the state list said they’re going to keep pushing for it and other protections. Adding the fish to the state endangered list would mean conservation of salmon would be treated as a bigger concern in state permitting processes, said John Burrows, executive director for U.S. operations for the Atlantic Salmon Federation.\n\nMaryland\n\nOakland: A state police helicopter hoisted an injured swimmer to safety in western Maryland. The helicopter was dispatched shortly after 5 p.m. Friday to rescue a swimmer who sustained a head injury after slipping on a rock at Swallow Falls along the Youghiogheny River in Garrett County, state police said in a news release Saturday. The helicopter was requested partly because of the steep terrain and nature of the victim’s injuries, police said. The helicopter hovered 275 feet above the river as a trooper with medical equipment was lowered to the scene to prepare the patient for an aerial extraction, the news release said. Once the patient was secured inside the AW-139 helicopter, the crew provided medical care during the trip to a hospital in Morgantown, West Virginia. The patient wasn’t identified, and the person’s condition wasn’t immediately known.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A rare first-place medal from the first modern Olympic Games has sold for more than $180,000. Boston-based RR Auction said Friday that the winning bidder for the silver medal from the 1896 games in Athens, Greece, was a collector based on the East Coast. The company estimated before the auction that the first place medal could fetch about $75,000. At the inaugural Olympiad, first-place winners were awarded silver medals and second-place finishers earned bronze, the auction house said. There was no award for placing third. Unlike today’s games where thousands of athletes compete, just 250 were featured at the first modern games, the company said. Other notable items sold include a gold medal bestowed on the Argentine men’s soccer team during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics that went for more than $97,000. A gold medal for the U.S. men’s basketball team during the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics also sold for more than $83,000 and a gold medal awarded to Swedish wrestler Ivar Johansson during the 1932 Los Angeles Summer Olympics sold for more than $45,000.\n\nMichigan\n\nCorunna: Elected officials in Shiawassee County who gave themselves bonuses of $65,000 with federal COVID-19 relief aid said they will return the money following days of criticism. County commissioners acted after the county prosecutor said the payments were illegal, The Argus-Press reported. The Michigan Constitution bars additional compensation for elected officials “after services had already been rendered,” prosecutor Scott Koerner said Friday. The commissioners, all Republicans, voted on July 15 to award themselves $65,000 as part of a plan to give $557,000 to 250 county employees as “hazard pay” for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. The smallest amounts for recipients were $1,000 to $2,000. But County Board Chairman Jeremy Root got $25,000. Two more commissioners received $10,000 each, and four others received $5,000 each. The commissioners awarded money to other elected officials, including the prosecutor, the sheriff and the county clerk, all Republicans. They, too, said they would give it back. Two Michigan congressmen, a Democrat and a Republican, said federal virus aid wasn’t intended to reward elected officials.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBlaine: A crane fell over at a construction site in the Minneapolis suburb of Lexington on Friday, causing a power outage for nearly 900 customers in the area as temperatures climbed into the mid-90s. There were no injuries reported. A dispatch supervisor with the Centennial Lakes Police Department said the call came in shortly before 12:30 p.m. The crane fell into power lines and onto the partially constructed building. Dispatch supervisor Donnelle Lawrence said the building was evacuated. The collapse also caused a small grass fire, which was quickly extinguished, Lawrence said. Xcel Energy reported reported nearly 900 customers in the areas of Blaine, Circle Pines and Lexington were without power after the collapse according to its online outage map. Temperatures were in the mid-90s on Friday afternoon and the area was under a heat advisory, as forecasters said the combination of heat and humidity made the temperature feel like it was 100 degrees.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Even as COVID-19 cases have increased rapidly in Mississippi in recent days, some school districts are saying masks will be optional for students, teachers and staff. Among the districts taking that approach is the state’s largest one, DeSoto County School District. “Right now, there are no state mandates or local mandates requiring masks,” Superintendent Cory Uselton told WMC-TV. “Last year, we were under a mask mandate because of the governor’s executive order. There’s no executive order in place right now, so that will be a parental decision.” As part of its guidance for K-12 school settings, the State Department of Health recommends masks for anyone not fully vaccinated. It also recommends people 12 and older get vaccinated. Instead of encouraging either of those things, the DeSoto District will give families information from the health department, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Academy of Pediatrics, Uselton said.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: St. Louis city and county officials said they will require masks in some public places starting Monday, citing a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases spurred by the delta variant. Masks will be mandatory in indoor public places and on public transportation for everyone age 5 or older, even for those who are vaccinated, officials said in a news release Friday. Masking outdoors “will be strongly encouraged,” especially in group settings. The decision comes as both of Missouri’s urban areas are seeing a big uptick in cases in hospitalizations that began in rural areas of the state, especially in southwestern Missouri. The Kansas City Star reported Friday that medical leaders in that region appear to be on the verge of calling for a new mask mandate there, as well.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Five firefighters were injured when a thunderstorm and swirling winds in central Montana blew a lightning-caused wildfire back on them, federal officials said. All five remained in medical facilities and were still being evaluated and treated Saturday, a day after they were injured, Bureau of Land Management spokesperson Mark Jacobsen said. He declined to release the extent of the firefighters’ injuries or specify where they were being treated. They had joined other crews working on the 1,300-acre fire burning in rough, steep terrain about 36 miles northwest of the town of Jordan. They were building a defensive fire line Thursday when the weather shifted, Jacobsen said. “Numerous wind shifts and rapid rates of spread resulted in erratic fire behavior as thunderstorms and associated cells were passing over the area when the incident occurred,” he said. Other firefighters in the area were able to call for help and the injured firefighters – three U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service crew members from North Dakota and two USDA Forest Service firefighters from New Mexico – were evacuated, Jacobsen said. Meanwhile, Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Friday that crews from Utah and California were coming to Montana on Saturday to help fight fires. Utah will send two task forces with a total of seven engines and 25 personnel, and California is sending a strike team with five engines and 20 personnel, Gianforte said. The teams will be in Montana for two weeks, and Montana will pay their costs, the governor said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nearly 50 Nebraska school boards have objected to proposed state health education standards that include lessons for young children on gender identity and gender expression. State Sen. Joni Albrecht said 47 school boards across the state have either adopted resolutions or sent letters opposing the first draft of the standards that the Nebraska Department of Education is considering. Albrecht was part of a group of 30 state senators who signed a statement urging school districts to object to the standards. The standards would be optional if they’re approved, according to the Omaha World-Herald. Under the proposed standards, kindergartners would learn about different kinds of family structures, including same-gender families. First-graders would be taught about gender identity and gender stereotypes. Sixth-graders would learn about a range of identities related to sexual orientation, including heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian, gay, queer, two-spirit, asexual and pansexual. They would be taught the differences between cisgender, transgender, gender nonbinary, gender expansive and gender identity. The proposal has faced strong opposition from Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts, who has no direct influence over the state board, and large crowds have attended state education board meetings. State Education Commissioner Matt Blomstedt told school districts in a letter earlier this month that there would be changes in the second draft of the standards. He said that next draft will remove many of the explicit examples and make clear that discussions of sensitive health-related topics should be “thoughtfully conducted with parental input at a local level.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Coronavirus numbers remained high in Nevada as the state reported more than 1,000 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, at least 20 deaths and hospitalizations climbing past the 1,000 plateau for the first time in more than five months, state health officials said. The 1,003 new cases reported by the state Department of Health and Human Services nearly matched the 1,004 new cases reported on Tuesday. It was the highest since 1,070 cases were recorded Jan. 30, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The updated figures pushed totals to 349,043 COVID-19 cases and 5,817 deaths statewide since the pandemic began in March 2020.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: New Hampshire residents can’t be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to access public facilities, benefits or services under a bill signed into law by Gov. Chris Sununu. Supporters said the bill signed this week establishes “medical freedom” by specifying that all residents have the “natural, essential and inherent right to bodily integrity, free from any threat or compulsion by government to accept an immunization.” It does not, however, supersede the state law regarding vaccinations as a prerequisite for admission to school. That law lists seven required vaccinations but does not include the COVID-19 vaccine. The new law also does not apply to county nursing homes, the state psychiatric hospital or other medical facilities operated by the state or other governmental bodies. And it allows mandatory immunizations in prisons and jails when there is a significant health threat.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: New Jersey on Friday took the first step to rid the lower Hackensack River of heavily contaminated sediment dating from the state’s industrial past. State Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette announced the commitment of Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration to seek placement of the 23-mile stretch of river on the federal government’s list of Superfund toxic sites. Approval would mean access to federal funding and would enable the Environmental Protection Agency to seek the parties responsible for polluting the waters to help fund the remediation, once identified. “Designating the lower Hackensack River as a federal Superfund site will provide the tools we need to remove decades of contamination that have polluted river sediments and restore the natural resources that have been impaired for far too long,” LaTourette said. A previous EPA study found elevated levels of cancer-causing dioxin, cadmium, lead, mercury and PCBs in sediment sampled from the river’s mouth at Newark Bay to the Oradell Reservoir. Achieving Superfund status could take years to complete. “I realize that this is one step in the process and that cleanup will take time,” said Hackensack Riverkeeper Bill Sheehan. He said he has been working to get the designation since 2015.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico schools plan to spend the bulk of the federal coronavirus relief money they have received on technology and building upgrades rather than student learning loss. A report this week before the New Mexico Legislature’s budget committee showed school districts and charters plan to spend 38% of the $490 million they received thus far on technology and HVAC systems. T he Santa Fe New Mexican reported that schools plan to spend 9% of the funds on learning loss programs and 8% on interventions for at-risk students. The budget committee’s program evaluation manager Micaela Fischer told lawmakers those numbers were surprising because students likely missed out on learning because of the shift to remote classrooms during the pandemic. Los Alamos Public Schools is an exception to the trend and plans to spend all of the money it received from a December coronavirus relief package to address learning loss with summer and after-school programs.\n\nNew York\n\nYonkers: Police and bystanders lifted a car to free a trapped baby after a suspected drunken driver struck the girl and her mother and then plowed through a storefront with the pair on the hood. The crash and rescue were recorded on video released by Yonkers Police. It showed a Hyundai Elantra striking a curb and parked car Friday before driving into a woman as she crossed the street with a child in her arms. With the woman and child on the hood of the car, it accelerates through the storefront of a barber shop. Police body camera footage from inside the building showed Yonkers Officers Rocco Fusco and Paul Samoyedny, who had been having breakfast nearby, frantically working with bystanders to lift the heavily damaged car and pull the crying 8-month-old girl from beneath it. “Luckily, two veteran officers of Yonkers’ finest just happened to be getting breakfast next door and quickly took action along with members of the community to rescue a child trapped under the vehicle and render aid to her mother,” Police Commissioner John Mueller said in a news release. “The actions taken are nothing short of heroic.” The baby sustained a skull fracture and burns to her back and foot. Her 36-year-old mother broke a leg, the news release said. The 43-year-old male driver and a female passenger were not injured. The driver, from Yonkers, was charged with driving while intoxicated, vehicular assault and aggravated unlicensed operation.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: Transportation officials said successful drone flights this week to Ocracoke have them hopeful that it might soon get easier to deliver vital supplies to the remote Outer Banks island amid bad weather. The Department of Transportation’s Division of Aviation and U.S.-based drone logistics company Volansi completed two successful trial flights of a delivery drone from a ferry dock in Hatteras to Ocracoke Island, the department said in a news release. “This is a tremendous first step in better connecting Ocracoke Island to potentially life-saving supplies and equipment,” Secretary of Transportation Eric Boyette said in a statement. “Today, Ocracoke Island is accessible only by plane or by boat. What we’re working on here is an entirely new, third method of serving the needs of Ocracoke’s people.” The tests involved an 8-mile round-trip flight averaging 18 minutes in flight time. The first delivered a small survival kit, space blankets and a chocolate muffin to Ocracoke, and the second delivered bottles of water, according to the news release. The next test, at a time to be determined, will involve a longer flight, the department said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The federal government has denied a request by North Dakota leaders to allow ranchers struggling with drought to hay idled grassland while it’s still of good quality. The Bismarck Tribune reported the state Agriculture Department is looking into the reasons why the request was denied. The federal government is allowing limited emergency grazing of Conservation Reserve Program land, which typically is idled under a government program that pays farmers to protect erodible land and create wildlife habitat. North Dakota ranchers all summer have been seeking federal government permission to also hay that land. The CRP typically doesn’t open until after nesting season ends, to protect wildlife populations. The season in North Dakota ends Aug. 1. Ranchers said that after that day, grass might not be of good enough quality to make it worthwhile to hay. State officials and members of North Dakota’s congressional delegation this summer have pushed the U.S. Department of Agriculture for earlier CRP haying. State Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring earlier this week made another plea. His department has received hundreds of calls from ranchers in recent weeks about the issue.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:The Cincinnati Black Music Walk of Fame is officially scheduled to open next summer. Plans for the interactive park and star-studded path were unveiled Saturday during an induction ceremony. The crowd was lively while the P. Ann Everson-Price & The All-Star Band played tributes to the walk's first inductees as well as other famous Black musicians and funk artists. The first four inductees to receive stars on the Walk of Fame will be Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Bootsy Collins, King Records icon Otis Williams, and Grammy Winners The Isley Brothers and the late Gospel great Dr. Charles Fold. The Cincinnati Black Music Walk of Fame is intended to stand toe-to-toe with The National Museum of African American Music in Nashville, Tennessee; Atlanta’s Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame; and Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee. Like the Hollywood Walk of Fame, each inductee will have their name placed on a star on the walkway. The funding for the park and walkway will come from the $159 million stimulus fund that was awarded to the county. The Hamilton County Commission unanimously voted in favor of the park while deciding on how to spend the county's stimulus money. The park was awarded $9 million. Procter and Gamble has also partnered with the project and will pay for the new inductee stars for the next several years.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:The owner of a dilapidated Oklahoma Panhandle wind farm has presented plans to clean up the most dangerous of the wind turbine towers. The plans are to address dangerously broken-down towers and turbines of the 60-tower KODE Novus I and II wind farm near Guymon, The Oklahoman reported. Owner Olympia Renewable Platform LLC has hired a contractor to remove broken blades from seven towers and topple a couple of others topped with burned-out generator nacelles. The company assured the repair work could begin next month and take 20 to 30 days to complete, depending on wind conditions. Dozens of wind turbines in the complex have been locked down and aren’t part of the cleanup plan. Oklahoma Corporation Commission officials have determined that the dilapidated wind towers are dangerous to the public, which had easy access to the scene until Olympia erected temporary fencing around it. The complex was developed and owned by a subsidiary of a South Korean company until it went bankrupt.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Low oxygen levels measured off the coast of Oregon and Washington are raising concerns of large “dead zones” that could decimate crabs and bottom-dwelling fish within them. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said this week that researchers have detected unseasonably low oxygen levels in a large area off the Pacific coast, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. Year after year of low oxygen levels beginning in the early 2000s led researchers to determine Oregon now has a “hypoxia season” – just as it has a fire season – and this year’s hypoxia season has arrived far earlier than usual. The start of the hypoxia season is marked by the upwelling of cold bottom water. Winds initiated that upwelling this year around March. Chan said that’s the earliest Oregon ocean-watchers have seen in 35 years. That could have major implications for coastal economies, particularly related to the Dungeness crab. Dead zones happen as winds pick up, driving cold water from the bottom of the ocean toward the surface, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That contributes to blooms of phytoplankton, which once they die, sink to the ocean floor. Bacteria consume oxygen while decomposing the plankton.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: President Joe Biden will head to the Allentown area Wednesday as he fights for passage in the Senate of a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure measure that a bipartisan group of senators brokered with him. The White House is billing Biden’s visit to Macungie as a stop to “emphasize the importance of American manufacturing, buying products made in America, and supporting good-paying jobs for American workers.” It gave no other details of the visit – Biden’s second to Pennsylvania so far this month after he went to Philadelphia last week to speak on voting rights. In the Senate, Republicans rejected an effort this week to begin debate on the infrastructure deal. Supporters said they need more time before another vote, possibly next week. Macungie is near the home of Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, who voted against opening debate. In a statement after the vote, Toomey echoed other Republicans in pointing out that crucial details about the deal are not completed. Should an agreement be reached on those, Toomey said he will consider the measure “based on its substance.” Pennsylvania’s other U.S. senator, Democrat Bob Casey, voted with other Democrats to start debate.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Environmental officials in Rhode Island have extended their ban on shellfish harvesting in certain areas of the state. The state Department of Environmental Management said a ban that was set to expire Sunday will be extended until further notice. The announcement covers what it refers to as the “Lower Providence River Conditional Area E” and “Upper Bay Conditional Area A.” The closures were enacted after recent heavy rainfall and are being extended because test samples showed continued high bacteria levels in the water. At least one other shellfish area in Greenwich Bay reopened to harvesting Sunday, and two others in Mt. Hope Bay and the Kickemuit River are open, the agency said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nNichols: A utility is building walls around an electric substation to prevent it from being overrun by floodwaters in the first-of-its-kind project in South Carolina. Duke Energy is spending $1.6 million on the Nichols project to protect a substation that has flooded twice in the past five years, utility spokesperson Ryan Mosier told the Morning News of Florence. The substation was flooded in 2016 in Hurricane Matthew and 2018 in Hurricane Florence. In 2018, the substation, which takes high voltage power from plants and converts it to lower voltage electricity for homes, was out for five weeks, Mosier said. The substation is surrounded by reinforced fiberglass walls. Crews put up aluminum gates when flooding is threatened, which keep water out but allow crews access inside. The walls are 6-to-8 feet tall with access gates. The gates are installed when the company forecasts potential flooding. Crews can also quickly access the substation for maintenance. Duke Energy has already installed the walls at facilities in Lumberton and Wallace in North Carolina and plans four more projects, Mosier said, Other nearby substations to Nichols are on higher ground and didn’t need the walls, said Davy Gregg, a Duke Energy supervisor for the Marion County area.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:A replica of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier came to Sioux Falls over the weekend as part of a honorary tour to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the monument. The half-scale replica was at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance and crowds came to view it and learn more about its history. The original Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is in Arlington Cemetery in Virginia, across the Delaware River from the nation’s capital.. The replica is part of a traveling exhibition called A Call to Honor: Tomb of The Unknown Soldier. The Americanism Committee of the Exchange Club in Rome, Georgia, is responsible for the exhibition and brings the replica to all parts of the United States.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:The bust of Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest that had been prominently displayed inside the state Capitol for decades – over objections from Black lawmakers and activists – was removed from its pedestal Friday. The image of Forrest has sparked protests since its installation in 1978 as defenders sought to tout his legacy while critics objected to honoring a historical figure who supported the South’s secession. Over the years, some suggested adding historical context next to the bust. Yet many others, including Republican Gov. Bill Lee, successfully argued for moving it to the Tennessee State Museum, just north of the Capitol. Forrest was a Confederate cavalry general who amassed a fortune before the Civil War as a Memphis slave trader and plantation owner. Later, he was a leader of the Klan as it terrorized Black people. The busts of Union Navy Adm. David Farragut and U.S. Navy Adm. Albert Gleaves also were moved to the museum on Friday, part of an agreement used to win over the votes needed on key panels that military leaders shouldn’t be displayed in the Capitol.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The Dallas area was the country’s top market for commercial property investments in the first half of 2021. Dallas retained the top real estate spot it gained last year during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new report by Real Capital Analytics. Through the first six months of this year, Dallas saw almost $13.4 billion in commercial property deals – 43% more than in the same period a year ago. Last year, more than $19.7 billion in commercial real estate deals were recorded in the local market. Sales of dozens of local apartment communities and warehouses, plus the $700 million purchase of Uptown Dallas’ Crescent complex, all contributed to the huge volume of property investments in the area this year. The Crescent was ranked as the second-largest commercial property deal in the country in the first six months of 2021.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City:People in Utah gathered to celebrate the state’s history and recognize early Mormon pioneers who trekked west in search of religious freedom. Pioneer Day is a beloved only-in-Utah holiday every July 24 that features parades, rodeos, fireworks and more. The festivities were canceled last year because of the pandemic. Hundreds of people on Friday camped and staked out spots along the parade route in downtown Salt Lake City. Pioneer Day marks the date in 1847 when Brigham Young and other Mormon pioneers, many pulling handcarts, ended their treacherous journey across the country from Illinois to the Salt Lake Valley. Many businesses and government offices close for the state holiday.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Signs will be posted near eight Vermont ponds where the use of baitfish is prohibited to protect native brook trout, the Fish and Wildlife Department said. 1/ 2 “Wild native brook trout thrive in ponds where there are simple fish communities with no or few other fish species,” department fisheries biologist Jud Kratzer said in a statement earlier this week. “Adding new fish species, even minnows, disrupts a long-established food chain. Trout populations suffer as a result.” Brook trout are native to the eastern United States but no longer exist in much of their original range, the department said. Signs will be posted at public access points near Beaver Pond in Holland; Blake Pond in Sutton; Cow Mountain Pond in Granby; Jobs Pond in Westmore; Lewis Pond in Lewis; North Pond in Chittenden; Unknown Pond in Avery’s Gore; and Noyes Pond in Groton.\n\nVirginia\n\nCulpeper: Virginia’s government watchdog said the commonwealth’s land conservation easement program that offers participants tax breaks needs improvement. Auditors with the Office of the State Inspector General found items such as trash, old tires, inoperable vehicles and a manure storage area containing dead cattle parts on properties with easements it inspected, the Culpeper Star-Exponent reported. “Virginia provides tax credits up to $75 million per year for conservation easements and land donations,” Inspector General Michael Westfall said in a statement. “In effect, Virginia is paying for natural resource preservation through these tax credits.” There’s a $1 million tax credit value threshold for a Department of Conservation and Recreation quality review of an easement. Among the watchdog’s recommendations was lowering that threshold. But Dan Holmes, director of state policy for the Piedmont Environmental Council, told the newspaper the tax credit was a valuable tool and questioned the audit’s conclusions and methodology.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan and other city officials plan to add a response unit for 911 calls that don’t require typical, armed police officers. Officials said they are still working out details, and it won’t launch until at least next year, The Seattle Times reported. Durkan said the idea is to provide 911 dispatchers with a new option for certain calls, such as wellness checks, that are associated with neither criminal nor medical emergencies. The mayor said it could be similar to the city’s Health One program, which sends firefighters and social workers to nonemergency medical calls. It will likely be staffed by civilian city employees, possibly partnered with certain officers, she said. The responders will know deescalation techniques and how to guide people to social services, she said, adding that it might be called “Triage One.” Durkan said she intends to include funding for the new option in her 2022 budget proposal, which is due in September. She hasn’t said what it might cost but said it would start as a pilot program, with limited capacity.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state treasurer’s office raised nearly $140,000 for law enforcement agencies through its unclaimed property firearms auction. This year’s event had record inventory – more than 500 firearms lots – because the pandemic prevented the treasurer’s office from holding an auction last year, Treasurer Riley Moore’s office said in a news release. The treasurer’s office raised $139,790 during the auction. Under state law, state and local law enforcement agencies can turn over unclaimed, seized or outdated firearms in their possession to the treasurer’s office for auction, and the proceeds can be returned to the law enforcement agency. This year’s auction attracted more than 60 federally licensed firearms dealers. Bidders must be a valid, licensed federal firearms dealer. The event isn’t open to the general public.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin System plans to offer nearly $500,000 in scholarships this fall to students who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus. System President Tommy Thompson said all vaccinated students at regional four- and two-year campuses that get at least 70% of their students vaccinated by Oct. 15 will be eligible for a drawing for a $7,000 scholarship. Seventy students will win, with more winners coming from campuses with larger enrollments. UW-Madison students won’t be eligible, Thompson said, because Chancellor Rebecca Blank is working on her own vaccination incentive programs. Asked for details on Blank’s plans, UW-Madison spokesman John Lucas said the flagship university is “on a path” to reach 80% vaccination among students and is “considering incentives” but had nothing to announce. Thompson has called for campuses to offer at least three-quarters of their courses in-person this fall. He said he set the vaccination threshold at 70% for the scholarship drawing because that’s generally considered the minimum for herd immunity.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Officials expect moderate to extreme drought to persist and spread throughout Wyoming. The multiyear drought is the state’s worst since 2013. Last year was Wyoming’s fifth-driest and 16th-warmest since 1895, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Even parts of the state with average or above-average precipitation got it earlier in the year than usual, leaving those areas just as susceptible to drought now, Wyoming Game and Fish Department terrestrial habitat supervisor Ian Tator told the state Game and Fish Commission last week. “On a statewide basis, there’s nowhere that’s doing fantastic,” Tator said. Fishing spots also face strain as water levels fall and temperatures rise, state fisheries management coordinator Dave Zafft told the commission.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/watchdog/2018/02/14/dupont-pompton-lakes-pollution/806921001/", "title": "DuPont downplayed pollution in a New Jersey town for years", "text": "For decades, an underground plume of toxic chemicals — about eight football fields wide and covering 140 acres — has lurked beneath 400 homes in the shadow of a now-shuttered munitions plant in suburban North Jersey.\n\nThe groundwater contaminated with cancer-causing solvents migrated from a century-old DuPont facility, nestled in the hills of Pompton Lakes, which produced ammunition that helped America win two world wars.\n\nThe solvents, used by DuPont to clean machinery, were dumped with wastewater for decades into four unlined lagoons near the edge of the company's property. The toxic stew seeped down into the soil and migrated with the groundwater off the company's site, eventually vaporizing up through the soil into the basements of nearby homes, posing a health risk to residents.\n\nThe solvents remain today — more than 30 years after they were discovered, and after countless public meetings, debate and study — beneath homes and backyards where DuPont workers and other residents raised families, played with children and planted vegetable gardens.\n\nBut now, a trove of government documents and emails obtained by The Record and NorthJersey.com reveal for the first time how extensively DuPont — the chemical giant that gave the world non-stick pans, stain-resistant carpets, nylon and other ubiquitous products — worked behind the scenes for more than three decades to keep secret and then downplay the extent of overall contamination from the site and the potential health risks they posed.\n\nThe company pushed back against regulators and chose not to tell residents that the cancer-causing chemicals could be vaporizing up from the groundwater into their homes, those documents reveal.\n\nThe plume of chemicals remains largely unaddressed, even as many residents blame DuPont for elevated levels of cancer and for other illnesses in their neighborhood.\n\n\"This was our home, and they did this, and we were lied to — lied to,\" said Helen Martens, who moved to the Pompton Lakes neighborhood in 1977. \"I lost all faith in the law, and in our town elected officials, and DuPont. I couldn't believe they had done this to people.\n\n\"I love my home,\" the 72-year-old said. \"I just fear it.\"\n\nThe Record reviewed hundreds of state and federal government emails and 100 boxes filled with government documents, obtained through open records requests, and conducted more than 70 interviews with residents, regulators, lawyers and environmental experts.\n\nThe investigation reveals that:\n\nDuPont told residents in 1997 that vapors from cancer-causing solvents weren't entering homes – even though the company was aware of the potential for the solvents to vaporize and had not conducted tests beneath or inside any houses.\n\nthat vapors from cancer-causing solvents weren't entering homes – even though the company was aware of the potential for the solvents to vaporize and had not conducted tests beneath or inside any houses. DuPont and regulators discussed the threat of vapor intrusion for seven years – from 2001 to 2008 – without informing the public, documents show. That prevented unsuspecting residents from acting on their own to protect themselves, while potentially breathing cancer-causing vapors in their homes.\n\nof vapor intrusion for seven years – from 2001 to 2008 – without informing the public, documents show. That prevented unsuspecting residents from acting on their own to protect themselves, while potentially breathing cancer-causing vapors in their homes. Even as residents were kept in the dark, regulators pushed DuPont to test for vapors. The company was \"adamantly opposed.\" Internal government documents show why: DuPont didn't want test results that could be used against the company by residents in an ongoing suit about other pollution from its Pompton Lakes facility.\n\nThen, as part of the settlement of that suit, DuPont required residents to sign a release that kept them from suing DuPont if additional pollution was discovered.\n\nOnly after those releases were signed did DuPont test for vapors. But when residents were finally told about the danger in their homes and tried to sue, a judge said those who signed the releases were out of luck.\n\nThe Record and NorthJersey.com's investigation also found:\n\nDocuments dating to 1979 show the company's behavior on the vapor intrusion issue was part of a larger, decades-long pattern in which DuPont obscured and then downplayed the extent of various toxic pollutants migrating off its property.\n\non the vapor intrusion issue was part of a larger, decades-long pattern in which DuPont obscured and then downplayed the extent of various toxic pollutants migrating off its property. Experts say it is hard to definitively link a particular polluted site to specific cases of cancer or other illness. Still, a door-to-door canvass by The Record of more than 50 households in the plume neighborhood identified many cases of various cancers that have been linked in studies to solvents that have been found in the plume, as well as other diseases, across multiple generations.\n\na particular polluted site to specific cases of cancer or other illness. Still, a door-to-door canvass by The Record of more than 50 households in the plume neighborhood identified many cases of various cancers that have been linked in studies to solvents that have been found in the plume, as well as other diseases, across multiple generations. A federal regulator told The Record she pushed to have the DuPont site added to the Superfund list so it could receive more federal money and contractor support, enjoy potentially quicker approvals for cleanup measures, and take into account public input. But state and local political leaders, including Bob Martin, the state's top environmental official under then-Gov. Chris Christie, blocked those efforts.\n\n\"It always seemed to me that the company was trying to slow-walk the problem,\" Judith Enck, former regional administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency during the Obama administration, said in a recent interview. \"They worked hard to pay as little money as possible and stretch it out over a long period of time, and sadly I think they are succeeding at that.\"\n\nThe delays at times generated expressions of frustration. At one point in 2007, for instance, Frank Faranca, a state regulator, emailed DuPont about vapor testing beneath homes: \"I find it increasingly hard to believe that it has taken this long to do the work. If you are truly trying to protect human health, it should not have taken this long.\"\n\nThe Pompton Lakes residents affected by the plume of vaporizing solvents are not alone.\n\nIn New Jersey and across the nation, vapor intrusion is a growing concern, and not only for newer contaminated sites that are just starting to be cleaned. Over the past decade, for instance, New York's environmental agency has revisited 147 legacy sites that had already been considered cleaned up to check for vapor intrusion.\n\nDuPont — which had a gross profit in 2016 of more than $10 billion — has spent money in Pompton Lakes over several decades to address some aspects of its legacy of pollution.\n\nA $50 million cleanup of Pompton Lake is underway to remove lead and mercury that washed into the lake sediment. DuPont also spent $70 million in the early 1990s to remove and replace soil tainted with lead and mercury from the backyards of homes that lined Acid Brook, a stream that runs through the DuPont property and through the adjacent neighborhood before it empties into Pompton Lake.\n\nDuPont spent nearly $40 million to settle lawsuits in connection with the mercury and lead contamination over the years, and offered a \"groundwater benefits program\" — payouts of $5,000 each to residents who promised not to sue the company.\n\nBut far less has been done to address the source of the vapor intrusion, which affects a much greater area.\n\nThe company built a $1.2 million pump-and-treat system to prevent more chemicals from leaving its property. And since 2008, DuPont has paid to install and cover the operating costs of venting systems intended to remove the harmful vapors from homes.\n\nStill, the underground plume of chemicals remains beneath 400 homes. One pilot study to test a method to treat the chemicals failed. A second controversial pilot study awaits state approval. There is no plan to buy out residents who have seen their property values plummet.\n\nDuPont declined to discuss its former operations in Pompton Lakes, referring all questions to Chemours, a spinoff it created in 2015. Chemours inherited about 170 contaminated DuPont sites nationwide, including the 600-acre Pompton Lakes site in Passaic County.\n\nChemours calls the Pompton Lakes cleanup challenging and said its goals ultimately mesh with those of residents.\n\n\"The remediation of a complex site like Pompton Lakes is a lengthy and complicated process,\" Chemours spokeswoman Robin Ollis Stemple said by email.\n\n\"While we all wish that this could be done more quickly, Chemours is committed to doing the work in a way that is thorough, science-based, protective of people and the environment and in accordance with all guidance\" provided by regulators.\n\n\"While this takes time, we believe this is the right approach for the Pompton Lakes community,\" she added. \"Ultimately, Chemours and the community have the same goal: to complete protective remediation and return the site to productive use.\"\n\nBut many wary residents — some of whom suffer from an array of illnesses — say they have been betrayed for decades by DuPont and let down by regulators and elected officials. They say they have no confidence the plume will be addressed. Some said they feel trapped, and want nothing more than to escape the neighborhood they once loved.\n\n\"I wind up with Stage 4 kidney failure,\" said longtime resident Ron Merlino. \"Guess what,\" he said. \"Buy our homes. Get us out of here. They should have got us out of here as soon as they knew we were getting poisoned in our own homes.\n\n\"It's time to go,\" Merlino added. \"I can't wait to get out.\"\n\nToday, more than three decades after regulators became aware toxic chemicals were migrating off the DuPont site, the plume of contamination remains unaddressed beneath more than 400 homes, making it one of the country's larger vapor intrusion sites.\n\nHere's how that happened.\n\nBecause it plays such an ominous role in their lives, some Pompton Lakes residents refer to the contaminated groundwater beneath their homes simply as \"The Plume.\"\n\nMany residents insist the plume of solvents has caused dozens of cases of brain, cervical, kidney and other cancers, as well as other illnesses.\n\nTheir argument was bolstered by a 2009 state health study that showed kidney cancer rates among women in the neighborhood were elevated and that non-Hodgkin lymphoma among men was elevated compared with the state average. New Jersey's rate of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in men is among the highest in the country.\n\nThe Health Department said in its 2009 study that while it could not definitively link the elevated cancer rates to solvents in the plume, \"the contaminants cannot be ruled out as a potential cause.\"\n\nWhen asked to comment on the array of illnesses among residents living above the plume, Chemours said in an email, \"It is an unfortunate fact that illnesses, including cancer, occur in all communities and neighborhoods in the state and the country.\"\n\nResidents say the plume has pushed down property values and prevented people from cashing in on life savings tied up in their homes.\n\nThe state first concluded solvents were migrating off the DuPont site and under homes as early as 1984, documents show. In 1988 the state and DuPont signed an agreement that required DuPont to drill monitoring wells to determine the extent of the plume — and to clean the contaminated groundwater.\n\nThe state Department of Environmental Protection called cleaning the plume a priority. Private wells in the neighborhood were the initial concern. Most were used to water lawns and fill swimming pools. But a few provided drinking water.\n\nRichard Marsh, a former DuPont employee and longtime resident, recalled a neighbor who had multiple dogs die from tumors.\n\n\"He fed them well water,\" Marsh said. \"My dogs never died of tumors. We used municipal water.\"\n\nThe solvents in the plume — TCE and PCE — belong to a group of chemicals called volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, which easily evaporate in the air. Private wells in the neighborhood, tested in 1985 and 1986, had volatile organic compounds as high as 5,592 parts per billion. One well had 408 parts per billion of PCE and 167 parts per billion of TCE.\n\nThe state drinking water limit for either of those solvents is 1 part per billion — the equivalent of one drop of solvent in an Olympic-size swimming pool — illustrating their potency.\n\nGiven the health concern, DuPont had the wells disconnected and the homes hooked up to municipal water.\n\nNot until 2001 — 17 years after the plume was identified — did regulators first mention in private exchanges with DuPont about the potential for the plume to be a health threat to residents through toxic vapors seeping into homes.\n\nVapor intrusion occurs when contaminants in the groundwater turn to vapor, move up through tiny spaces in the soil and enter basements through cracks in foundations or openings for utility lines.\n\nScientists have known about the threat for decades.\n\nTests for toxic vapors were conducted at the infamous Love Canal in upstate New York in the mid-1980s, and a few years later, vapor intrusion tests were conducted in residential areas of Rochester, New York, near a contaminated Kodak facility.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the federal Environmental Protection Agency issued some guidance on dealing with vapor intrusion at Superfund sites.\n\nNew Jersey was among the first states to focus on it. The state issued guidance in 1999 to test indoor air. The science was evolving rapidly, said John Boyer, a vapor intrusion expert with the state. Over the next few years the EPA and state Department of Environmental Protection put out new guidance on how to handle vapor intrusion, reflecting the evolving science.\n\nDuPont was aware of the potential for the solvents in the Pompton Lakes plume to vaporize into homes as early as 1997, documents show. But they told residents it wasn't happening, even though they had not tested the air in homes, or the soil underneath.\n\nHere is an excerpt from a letter DuPont sent residents in September 1997:\n\n\"… in addition to monitoring the groundwater plume, DuPont has also investigated the potential for vapor emissions to occur from the plume. (M)easurements … provide no indication of vapor migration.\"\n\nBut the measurements weren't taken under or inside people's homes. They were conducted in an old dry well on DuPont's former property.\n\n\"As far as the assumptions they were making, the science really wasn't there,\" said Boyer, the state vapor intrusion expert. \"There was no basis for us to disagree, I guess, at that point. But as time went on, the science got better, and as we moved forward we started recognizing this was more of a problem than we may have anticipated.\"\n\nChemours, in an email to The Record, said the best environmental investigation practice requires sampling \"where concentrations are likely to be highest,\" and the old well site was in the direct path of the groundwater flowing from the DuPont site \"where contamination would be expected to be highest.\"\n\nChemours also said \"the science of understanding vapor intrusion continued to evolve after 1997.\" It noted that DuPont conducted tests in the plume neighborhood from 2003 to 2005, though not under or inside homes.\n\n\"The data collected up to that point indicated that there was no vapor intrusion pathway,\" Chemours said.\n\nThough residents would be told nothing about vapor intrusion until 2008 — more than a decade after DuPont's 1997 letter — internal DEP and EPA emails and documents show that as early as March 2001 the regulators worried that vapors could be a health risk.\n\nIt took seven years for residents to be alerted.\n\nBecause the state at the time had little regulatory power on vapor intrusion, they relied on the federal EPA's push.\n\n\"We did not have the regulatory gun in a holster,\" said DEP spokesman Larry Hajna.\n\nAt a meeting in March 2001, regulators told DuPont that vapor intrusion \"must be addressed.\"\n\nAnd an EPA document a few months later noted that because the solvents were detected in elevated levels in monitoring wells in the neighborhood, \"indoor air may be of concern at off-site locations in the residential community.\"\n\nThe issue should be investigated, the report said.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nMore than a year later, in March 2003, DuPont and the regulators held a private meeting, documents show. The regulators underscored that \"there are potential impacts of the plume on people in the residential houses … through indoor air.\"\n\nBut that message was not conveyed to the residents.\n\n\"The public has a right to know about a problem,\" Enck, the former EPA regional administrator, said in a recent interview.\n\n\"I think it's crucial for government regulatory agencies but also for big companies to share information early,\" said Enck, who left the EPA in January 2017 after seven years. \"Unfortunately that didn't happen here.\"\n\nInstead, DuPont made it clear to the agencies that the company opposed sampling homes in the plume. In April 2003, an EPA official noted in an internal email: \"DuPont to fight if indoor air sampling required.\"\n\nDuPont sent a report a few months later saying there was no vapor intrusion — a report that relied on the same 1996 test of the dry well on DuPont's former property.\n\nThe state disagreed.\n\nAn agency memo noted that samples from monitoring wells in the plume neighborhood found elevated levels of PCE and TCE, which indicated the need to test for vapor intrusion. The 2003 memo also questioned DuPont's assumptions.\n\nIt noted that other wells had not been tested since 1995, so \"it is questionable whether one can conclude … that the concentration levels in the off-site plume are decreasing.\"\n\n\"If you know there's contamination and it's inexpensive and easy to mitigate, then do it,\" said Lenny Siegel, executive director of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight, which advocates for victims of environmental pollution.\n\n\"If you can install mitigation systems, just do it,\" he said. \"If installed properly they are effective.\"\n\nChemours defended DuPont's decision not to alert residents about the potential for vapor intrusion until 2008.\n\n\"In 1997, the science of vapor transport from groundwater … (was) still developing,\" Chemours wrote. \"We understand that DuPont followed relevant, applicable guidance as it was developed by regulatory agencies over time, and that DuPont communicated with residents appropriately.\"\n\nThat explanation does not sit well with some plume residents.\n\n\"The safest thing obviously is to move the people out,\" said longtime resident Cheryl Rubino. \"They should not be exposed to the contamination. But for those who don't want to go — make them whole. It's not fair what's happened to these people. Their homes, their investments, their life savings are in their house. They will always need to disclose the contamination.\n\n\"Personally, I don't feel it's going to get cleaned up,\" Rubino said. \"I really don't. It's too difficult and too expensive. And there's going to be a very difficult and long haul, and it will not happen before my mother dies, and it will not happen before I die.\"\n\nDuPont adamantly opposed testing for cancer-causing vapors beneath the Pompton Lakes neighborhood because it didn't want the test results to become a cudgel the public could use against the chemical giant in court, documents and emails reviewed by The Record and NorthJersey.com show.\n\nAnd as DuPont pushed back against regulators, Pompton Lakes residents, unaware of the vapors potentially seeping into their homes, continued to use their basements to do laundry, check their computer email, play video games — all while potentially breathing in the dangerous vapors.\n\nDuring that seven-year period when the public was kept in the dark about the potential danger lurking beneath their homes, not only did DuPont resist regulators who had pressed for vapor tests — at times the regulators' own bungling exacerbated the delays, according to dozens of internal emails and government documents obtained by The Record and NorthJersey.com.\n\nDocuments show that DuPont was unhappy with the regulators from the state and the federal EPA for pushing to have vapor tests conducted.\n\nIn an August 2003 email to officials at the EPA's Region 2, which covers New Jersey, DuPont complained that \"generally we feel that Region II wants more documentation and investigations tha(n) we have experienced with other Regions.\"\n\nA month later, DuPont and the regulators met to discuss ways to test for vapor intrusion in the plume. An internal EPA memo, uncovered by The Record and NorthJersey.com through a public records request, summarized the meeting.\n\nIt noted that if the geology of the site made it impossible to use generic testing methods, DuPont would need to conduct air sampling beneath and inside plume homes, \"which DuPont has adamantly opposed. They are involved in several citizen suits and they are concerned that such an assessment could be detrimental to the cases.\"\n\nIn other words, DuPont told environmental officials that if the tests showed elevated levels of solvent vapors, that could be used against them in ongoing lawsuits related to other contaminants that had left DuPont's property.\n\nOne of those suits had been filed on behalf of Pompton Lakes residents in 1998.\n\nThe case, Agnes v. DuPont, focused on health impacts and falling home values allegedly caused by mercury and lead that had washed off the DuPont site and into backyards, brought there by Acid Brook. The case also looked at solvents that contaminated private wells.\n\nBut it didn't focus on vapor intrusion, since the public had not yet been told it was a concern.\n\nWhen DuPont settled the Agnes case, the public remained uninformed about the danger of vapor intrusion.\n\nThe settlement provided most residents $950, a third of which went to their lawyers. In exchange, DuPont required residents to sign a release in which they relinquished their right to sue DuPont in the future over any illness other than cancer related to contamination from DuPont's Pompton Lakes site.\n\nWhen they signed those releases, residents were still in the dark about the ongoing talks between regulators and DuPont about vapor intrusion.\n\nAfter DuPont told the public in 2008 that tests indicated vapor intrusion was occurring, residents filed another suit, this time focused on vapor intrusion.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh ruled that 113 of the residents had no standing to sue DuPont because they had signed the 2004 releases — even though they knew nothing about vapor intrusion at the time.\n\n\"We were basically told after the fact — after giving them amnesty, if you will, that, oh, by the way — there is contaminated groundwater under your home, there are gases that are potentially seeping through the cracks in your basement, and they are carcinogenic,\" recalled longtime resident Jefferson LaSala.\n\nDuPont declined to comment on any aspects of its Pompton Lakes operations for this series. Chemours, a spinoff company that inherited responsibility for 170 of DuPont's contaminated sites across the country, including Pompton Lakes, told The Record in an email that \"there was no effort\" by DuPont \"to delay testing\" in the plume because of the lawsuits.\n\nDelays abounded, however, lasting years. Emails show that some delays were caused by DuPont, and some by regulators.\n\nMeanwhile, residents continued to use their basements, unaware they could be breathing cancer-causing vapors.\n\n\"I worked on vapor intrusion in upstate New York 20 years ago — it's not brand new,\" Enck, the former EPA regional administrator overseeing New Jersey during the Obama administration, told The Record. \"One of the most basic things is you do indoor air samples to decide if there is a problem and need a widespread solution.\"\n\nAt the same time, the state DEP had only a handful of vapor intrusion cases by 2005. \"So there was no precedent, no standard approach,\" recalled John Boyer, the DEP's vapor intrusion expert. \"We sort of broke ground when it came to the DuPont case in how to go about doing things.\n\n\"We were sort of feeling our way through this process,\" Boyer said.\n\nAnd DuPont didn't help.\n\nThe company submitted multiple reports over several years using screening levels and other factors the regulators had already rejected as lax or inappropriate, stalling the agencies in the process.\n\n\"History shows that in the absence of an active community and regulators, most polluters will drag their feet,\" said Lenny Siegel, executive director of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight, which advocates for victims of environmental pollution. \"They will try to do study after study showing the contamination isn't as bad as everyone thought. They are responsible to their shareholders.\"\n\nIn their 2010 book \"The Polluters,\" authors Benjamin Ross and Steven Amter, scientists who ran an environmental consulting firm, wrote that \"one of the industry's common tactics can be summed up as ‘spill, study, and stall.' When outside pressure to do something about pollution became strong, a study of the problem would be launched as an alternative to expensive action.\"\n\nEnck agreed.\n\nCompanies such as DuPont \"know how to tie regulatory agencies in knots,\" she said. \"They spend money on scientists who just question everything an agency wants to do.\"\n\nWhile the DEP and EPA kept prodding DuPont to test for vapor intrusion in Pompton Lakes, at times the regulators themselves dropped the ball, inadvertently exacerbating DuPont's delay, and causing residents to be victims of bureaucratic bungling.\n\nFor instance, early in 2004 DuPont sent an email to the DEP asking it to approve some sampling procedures. When the EPA asked three months later for the test samples, DuPont said it hadn't conducted the tests because it never heard back from the state.\n\n\"We prefer feedback before we proceed,\" DuPont wrote.\n\nA DEP official countered that he never received DuPont's correspondence, and besides, he was overwhelmed with work. \"I have to keep switching between my other 17 hazardous waste sites, which leaves me little time to devote to any specific project,\" he wrote. \"If any one project becomes a high priority, that gets 100% of my attention, and everything else gets dropped.\"\n\nLater that day, he acknowledged that he found DuPont's earlier email.\n\n\"Since my desk is buried beneath a Solid Waste landfill, I could not determine if I got the document,\" he wrote, somewhat sarcastically.\n\nThe new sampling was scheduled for Aug. 9.\n\nOn Sept. 14, the EPA followed up, asking for results.\n\nOn Dec. 22, the EPA asked again for the results.\n\nMore than a week later, DuPont replied: \"We had some problems with the last set of samples.\"\n\nWhen samples were taken at seven homes in early 2008, results showed elevated levels of PCE in all seven, and elevated TCE in six.\n\nA hydrogeologist hired as an expert for resident plaintiffs in a 2010 court case said that, since the solvents had likely been in the groundwater since the 1940s, \"vapor intrusion must have also occurred in the neighborhood for decades.\"\n\nAfter the 2008 test results, DuPont installed vapor intrusion systems on more than 330 homes to suck the vapors out from beneath the foundations and release them into the outside air to dissipate. In 2014, tests at Lakeside Middle School, adjacent to the plume, did not detect toxic vapors above state safety standards.\n\nHowever, the source of those vapors — the plume of contamination in the soil — is still there, unaddressed. Chemours has proposed a new pilot study to flush water into the ground to create a barrier between the vapors and the homes, but residents worry it will raise the water table and flood their basements with contamination.\n\n\"We're dealing with a very affluent company that knows science,\" said Enck, the former EPA regional administrator. \"They make billions of dollars every year, and someone inside the company has to take a very close look at the toxic legacy here and decide to do something differently.\n\n\"I think we need a new set of experts inside the company addressing this, because the old way is not working,\" Enck said.\n\nShe urged New Jersey's new governor, Phil Murphy, to make the site a priority. \"I think the community members are raising very legitimate concerns,\" Enck said.\n\nThe test results showing vapor intrusion in Pompton Lakes came nearly eight years after regulators first started raising concerns to DuPont about the potential for vapor intrusion in the neighborhood.\n\nThey arrived 11 years after DuPont told residents vapor intrusion was not occurring in the plume.\n\nAnd it was nearly 25 years after state environmental officials first suspected solvents were migrating off the DuPont site and under adjacent homes.\n\nWhen DuPont told Pompton Lakes residents in June 2008 that vapor intrusion could be occurring in their homes, the company said it would pay to install vapor mitigation units on each home in the plume.\n\nThe systems work by sucking the toxic vapors out from under a home and sending them up through a pipe, which releases them to the outside air, allowing them to dissipate.\n\nThe vapors came from the cancer-causing solvents PCE and TCE, which had contaminated a plume of groundwater beneath about 400 homes. The solvents had migrated off DuPont's former munitions facility nearby, and had moved their way up through the soil and into some basements.\n\nDuring tests to determine the extent of vapor intrusion in the neighborhood, two-thirds of samples taken beneath homes showed that PCE levels exceeded the state standard of 16 parts per billion. Levels were as high as 6,800.\n\nSimilarly, a third of samples tested high for TCE. The state standard was 11 parts per billion. Readings were as high as 1,200.\n\nAs for indoor air results, elevated levels of PCE were in 29 percent of the samples. The state standard was 1 part per billion, and readings were as high as 68.\n\nIn its 2010 report on the test results, DuPont said this about providing the vapor mitigation systems: \"DuPont believes that proactively offering systems to those residents located above the groundwater plume is an appropriate measure while efforts continue to assess potential remedial technologies for implementation in the offsite groundwater plume.\"\n\nThe company could have \"proactively\" provided those systems eight years earlier, when regulators first raised concerns about the potential for vapor intrusion.\n\n\"Companies are always free to proactively take steps to protect public health when they have contaminated communities,\" former EPA regional administrator Judith Enck said in a recent interview.\n\nIn December 2009, a state Health Department study found that women living in the plume had elevated rates of kidney cancer and men had elevated rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The Health Department said it could not definitively link the elevated cancer rates to the solvents in the plume — but \"the contaminants cannot be ruled out as a potential cause.\"\n\nBy that time, homeowners had grown so distrustful of DuPont that many refused to let the company's contractor into their homes to install the vapor mitigation systems. In some cases, their lack of faith was warranted.\n\nEarly in 2009, the Pompton Lakes building inspector failed 22 of the venting systems because the top of the outdoor pipe was installed too close to a window or chimney. Eventually, regulators allowed homeowners to choose their own state-approved contractors to install the systems. More than 330 homes in the plume neighborhood now have vapor mitigation systems.\n\nBut today, nearly 30 years after DuPont signed an agreement with New Jersey to clean up the groundwater plume — which is the source of those cancer-causing vapors — the land beneath the homes remains contaminated.\n\nBlasting caps and explosive powder have played a major role in the history of Pompton Lakes and neighboring Wanaque for more than a century.\n\nEven before DuPont arrived on the scene, several smaller companies made explosive powder in those towns as far back as the 1880s.\n\nThe first plant on the Wanaque portion of the future DuPont site was built in 1886 by H. Julius Smith, who had patented a spark-fired blasting cap filled with mercury fulminate.\n\nIn 1894, the American Smokeless Powder Co. took over production on the property. Its smokeless powder was a vast strategic improvement for soldiers over black powder, which had produced smoke that obscured enemy targets during battle and also gave away the location of the soldiers doing the shooting.\n\nThe Haskell Plant, as it was known, was purchased in 1898 by Laflin & Rand, which expanded the site. The factory was so important that American troops were stationed to guard it during the Spanish-American War.\n\nDuPont acquired control of Laflin & Rand in 1902, and set up its DuPont Electric Exploder Company, which included blasting cap and powder production facilities on the west side of Lake Inez along the Wanaque River. The facility would play a key production role in World War I.\n\nIn 1908, DuPont opened the DuPont Cap Works in the Acid Brook Valley.\n\nInitially the company made mercury fulminate as a powder to use in its blasting caps, then later switched to lead azide.\n\nTroops were stationed around the facility during World War I to guard against any potential sabotage by foreign agents.\n\nWith good reason.\n\nAn incident in January 1917 provided a stark reminder of the danger posed by the materials on the site. Some 400,000 pounds of smokeless powder ignited, causing explosions that could be felt as far away as Massachusetts. Houses shook in Brooklyn, windows shattered in Westchester County, and telephone and telegraph service throughout North Jersey was disrupted, according to a New York Times story at the time of the disaster: \"At the Pompton Lakes Hotel the floors were forced up and the guests ran to the street in terror, many not fully dressed.\"\n\nDuPont built a series of homes just south of its plant around World War I to house employees. The neighborhood became known as DuPont Village.\n\nIn 1926, DuPont shuttered its Wanaque facility and consolidated operations to the southeast, in Pompton Lakes.\n\nAs the nation ramped up for World War II, so did DuPont's hiring at its Pompton Lakes site. Employment peaked during the war at about 7,500, providing steady, well-paying jobs for many in the area.\n\nIn fact, DuPont provided more than jobs — it provided a way of life, a sense of community, even recreational opportunities such as athletic teams.\n\nIn 1943, amid World War II, operations and staff at the Pompton Lakes site had grown so large that DuPont introduced a monthly newsletter, aptly named \"The Exploder.\"\n\nThe first issue noted that it was created \"to unite the thousands of workers at the plant in a spirit of harmony, friendliness and above all, grim determination to keep at its peak the production for which we have taken solemn obligation.\"\n\nThe newsletter provided personal updates on workers in various parts of the sprawling facility, including the \"Twisting Line,\" \"Inspecting Line\" and \"Coiling Line.\"\n\nThat first issue also warned against absenteeism.\n\n\"They're beginning to use some pretty sharp words, including ‘deserter' for those who are absent without excuse from war plants,\" it read. \"The way to get to work every day is to bear constantly in mind that somewhere out in the Pacific or in Africa, some teenage son or somebody's husband may reach out desperately for ammunition to protect himself against the fiendish enemy and find that there isn't any…production was short that day you stayed out to get your hair set.\"\n\n\"The Exploder\" even had New Yorker-style cartoons, including one in which a female employee holds out a cup to a woman on another assembly line and says, \"Can you lend me a cup of Thermite — I just need a little to finish up a batch of incendiaries!\"\n\nAfter World War II, DuPont operations in Pompton Lakes slowly declined, until the plant closed in 1994.\n\nRemnants of structures — primarily concrete footings, stone and concrete foundations and masonry walls — remain on the 600-acre property, along with Cannonball Road, which had served as the facility's spine.\n\nFounded in 1802 as a gunpowder mill on the Brandywine River in Delaware by chemist and industrialist E. I. du Pont, who had fled the violence of the French Revolution with his family in 1799.\n\nHeadquartered in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nPlayed key role in making blasting caps and other ammunition at its Pompton Lakes facility for the U.S. military during both world wars.\n\nPlayed a major role in the Manhattan Project, which ultimately developed nuclear weapons for the United States during World War II.\n\nInvented Nylon, Lucite, Dacron, Mylar, Kevlar, Tyvek, Lycra, Teflon, Corian, Stainmaster carpets, and other now-ubiquitous products.\n\nIn 2015 spun off a separate company, Chemours, which inherited responsibility for cleanup of more than 170 of DuPont's contaminated sites, including Pompton Lakes.\n\nHad $10 billion in net profit in 2016.\n\nIn September 2017 completed a $130 billion merger with Dow, another chemical industry giant, to become DowDuPont. DowDuPont is expected to break into three independent, publicly traded companies focused on agriculture, materials science and specialty products.\n\nAbout the Project\n\nJames M.

He was surrounded by his family and full of love. Phil brought immense joy to everyone around him and leaves behind a legacy of music and love. We request that you respect the Lesh family’s privacy at this time.\"\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Jill, and their two musician sons, Grahame and Brian.\n\nLesh faced a number of health hurdles over the past decades. In 1998, he received a liver transplant after bleeding internally as a result of Hepatitis-C. In 2006, he had surgery to remove his cancerous prostate, and a decade later he successfully underwent treatment for bladder cancer.\n\nAs was the case for many musicians in the ‘60s and ‘70s, Lesh, along with his bandmate Jerry Garcia, battled addictions to various vices. Although Garcia died in 1995 while being treated for a heroin addiction, Lesh, with the fierce support of his wife, got clean and managed to live on for decades.\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2024\n\nLesh played in a number of post-Grateful Dead incarnations after Garcia’s passing, including The Other Ones, Further, Phil Lesh & Friends and The Dead.\n\nBut he also was an often-seen and often-heard staple of his Marin County home base, where for a decade he ran and performed at his San Rafael, California, club Terrapin Crossroads, named after a famous Dead tune.\n\nLesh went from tinkering with the violin to one of the most innovative rock bass players ever\n\nLesh took a notably eclectic path to rock 'n' roll stardom. Born in 1940 in Berkeley, California, he studied violin as a child and later played trumpet. Lesh also developed an early interest in avant-garde music and free jazz, both of which later influenced his unique bass playing in the Grateful Dead.\n\nWhile in college at the University of California-Berkeley, Lesh met Tom Constanten, who would briefly play keyboards for one of the earliest incarnations of the Dead. A bit later, while working as a recording engineer at a local radio station, he met bluegrass banjo player Jerry Garcia.\n\nLesh held down day jobs at the post office while pursuing his interest in music, but that faded away quickly when Garcia asked him to join his fledgling folk-rock band, then called The Warlocks. Lesh agreed, even though he had never played bass guitar. His broad interest in music and his unfamiliarity with the bass directly contributed to him becoming one of the most innovative players of his time.\n\nWhile many bass players were trained to hold down a band’s rhythm section in conjunction with the drummer, Lesh immediately felt his instrument should play more of a leading role. His bass lines through the Dead’s 1965-1995 heyday are rife with lead riffs and buoyant counterpoint play.\n\nIn pushing the instrument's boundaries he joined fellow travelers Jack Bruce of Cream and Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane and later Hot Tuna, two other musical explorers who redefined the formerly hidden-away instrument as a leading voice in their bands.\n\nWhen it came to such sonic experimentation, drugs certainly came into play. The Grateful Dead was the house band at author Ken Kesey’s famous “Acid Tests,” and sometimes the music could get taken over by the psychedelics. Which suited Lesh and his bandmates just fine.\n\nMore:The Grateful Dead named MusiCares Persons of the Year: How they'll be honored Grammys Week\n\nIn his 2005 autobiography, “Searching for the Sound: My Life with the Grateful Dead,” Lesh wrote of one such musical trip.\n\n“It was as if the music was being sung by gigantic dragons on the timescale of plate tectonics,” he wrote. “Each note seemed to take days to develop, ever overtone sang its own song, each drumbeat generated a new heaven and a new earth.”\n\nLesh's bass was a dominant sonic component of the Grateful Dead's famous Wall of Sound concert array\n\nAlthough not blessed with a particularly tuneful voice, Lesh was a fixture on a number of crowd-favorite songs he composed for the band, including “Box of Rain” and “Unbroken Chain.”\n\nLesh’s bass was an integral part of the one of the band’s biggest – and most costly – experiments: the Wall of Sound.\n\nFor a brief tour in 1974, the Dead hit the road with a thundering audio system with hundreds of speakers that could project sound accurately for it was said up to a quarter mile, the better reach the nearly 100,000 fans that were coming to see the group at large outdoor venues.\n\nOne of the Wall’s distinctive features was making sure that the sound from each of the four strings on Lesh’s bass guitar were projected out of four distinct corners of the speaker system. But the set-up was so cumbersome to put up and take down that it was ditched after only a few memorable months.\n\nAfter Garcia’s death, Lesh and the other members of the Grateful Dead soon found they were eager to continue without their musical and spiritual leader.\n\nThat led to a variety of still-ongoing incarnations of the group, which increasingly featured fewer members of the so-dubbed core (remaining) four. After what was supposed to be the band’s true good-bye to fans, the short 2015 Fare Thee Well tour, Lesh increasingly decreased his time on the road and on a bandstsand.\n\nHe opened Terrapin Crossroads to be able to play anything close to home, and often did so with his sons, performing Grateful Dead as well as other contemporary fare. The venue closed in 2021, and after that Lesh’s appearances were episodic at best as he slipped into his 80s.\n\nBut the memory of what Lesh and his band created, from its legions of Deadheads to its countless live show bootlegs, clearly powered the bass player through even his darkest days.\n\n“The Grateful Dead group mind was in essence an engine of transformation,” he wrote at the conclusion of “Searching for the Sound.”\n\n“As such, it had no morality of its own, it made no judgments, took no positions. It merely opened valves for music to pour through.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/25"}]}

And she agreed with Kelly's assessment that Trump is a \"fascist.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" she said. \"And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.\"\n\nHarris was responding to a question from Anderson Cooper, who asked her how she plans to convince millions of Americans that Trump made the comments.\n\nTrump's campaign has denied Kelly's account, and the former president assailed him on social media.\n\n\"I don't necessarily think that everyone has heard what you and I have heard repeatedly, which is, the people who know Donald Trump best . . . have all called him unfit and dangerous,\" Harris said.\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nColorado man pleads guilty for threatening election officials, judge\n\nA Colorado man pleaded guilty Wednesday to threatening Colorado and Arizona election officials as well as a Colorado state judge from 2021 to 2022.\n\nIt marks the latest in a string of convictions secured by the Justice Department's election threats task force against threats to election personnel that cross state lines. Teak Brockbank, who also admitted he illegally possessed multiple firearms, posted on social media in 2021 that a Colorado election official \"has to Hang by the neck till she is Dead Dead Dead.\"\n\nIn the same post, Brockbank pledged there would be accountability \"for these peoples actions,\" saying it would come from him or from others who \"understand that there life does not matter anymore with the future our country has laid out before it.\"\n\nThe election threats task force also brought charges against two other men on Monday, one for allegedly threatening an election official in Florida and the other for allegedly threatening a Pennsylvania political party representative who was recruiting poll watchers. An Alabama man was sentenced Monday to 30 months in prison for threatening Arizona election workers with violence in 2022, during and after that state's primary elections.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nRFK Jr. criticizes Kamala Harris, rejects John Kelly allegations\n\nDonald Trump has not acknowledged recent comments by his former chief of staff, John Kelly, who alleged to The New York Times that Trump has “fascist” traits and made positive remarks about Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.\n\nBut Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is talking about Kelly.\n\nThe former presidential candidate called Kelly a “liar” and said the former Marine Corps general “invented” stories about Trump, while on stage in Duluth, Georgia, ahead of Trump’s appearance there this evening.\n\nKennedy also criticized Harris for “repeating these irresponsible stories.” The vice president earlier today gave a brief address from Washington regarding Kelly’s statements.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nJason Aldean introduces Trump at Georgia rally\n\nCountry singer Jason Aldean took the stage to introduce Trump at a rally in Duluth, Ga., on Wednesday night.\n\nAldean, a Georgia native who was also spotted sitting next to Trump at the Republican National Convention in July, touted his friendship with the former president.\n\n“He’s a president who when knocked down, gets back up, raises his fist in the air and says ‘fight,’” Aldean said, referring to a now infamous photo of Trump surviving the first assassination attempt against him. “And to me that’s a warrior, that’s who we need running this country right now.”\n\nThe singer emphasized Georgia’s swing state status, telling the crowd that “every vote is necessary, so do not sit this one out.”\n\nAldean and his wife have long ties with Trump. He defended the former president on social media earlier this year after Trump was criminally convicted.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nMankind vs. The Undertaker: WWE wrestlers weigh in on 2024 'Electionmania'\n\nWWE wrestlers the Undertaker and Mankind duked it out in a famous steel cage match in 1998 that left the wrestlers bloodied, and even one of them with broken bones.\n\nBut this time the fight is outside the ring – and will take place at the ballot box. Former WWE wrestler Mick Foley, also known as Mankind, on Wednesday endorsed Kamala Harris after WWE legend The Undertaker endorsed Donald Trump over the weekend.\n\n“I think it's important for everyone to have a moment where enough is enough,” Foley said in a roughly 4-minute long video posted on YouTube. “For me, enough was enough eight years ago.”\n\nTrump appeared on The Undertaker’s podcast, “Six Feet Under,” where the two spoke about realities of professional wrestling. The Undertaker, whose real name is Mark Calloway then endorsed Trump in a TikTok video on Sunday, alongside other former WWE wrestler Glen Jacobs, who played “Kane,” The Undertaker’s on-screen brother.\n\nFormer professional wrestling stars have played a role in Trump’s reelection campaign. WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan endorsed Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention over the summer.\n\nTrump, who is a member of WWE’s Hall of Fame, has long been associated with the professional wrestling company – even making his way into the ring in 2007 to feud with Vince McMahon, the former CEO of the company.

She ramped up media appearances in recent weeks, including a \"60 Minutes\" interview that aired last Monday.\n\nThe interview with Fox, known for its conservative-leaning pundits and programming, comes as Harris is trying to court independent and Republicans voters who oppose Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Harris has also called for another televised debate with Trump, though the former president has said he won't face off against the vice president again.\n\n– Rachel Barber and Joey Garrison\n\nFox vs CNN town halls: Trump and Harris choose to take part in separate network events\n\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris have both agreed to attend town halls – but not the same one. The Republican presidential candidate will take part in a pre-taped televised town hall hosted by Fox News on Tuesday, and focus on “women’s issues” as he tries to win back female voters from his Democratic rival.\n\nThe hour-long event, which will not be broadcast live, will feature an all-women audience and cover various issues, including the economy, abortion, immigration, and health care. Fox’s Harris Faulkner will moderate, and the show will air Wednesday at 11 a.m. Eastern.\n\nA week after Trump takes part in the Fox News town hall, Harris will participate in one hosted by CNN.\n\nAfter Trump ruled out joining a CNN presidential debate, the network invited both candidates to participate in separate town hall events later this month. CNN extended the invitations on Thursday, and the Harris campaign quickly accepted. The vice president is set to appear with Anderson Cooper on CNN on Oct. 23, with voters in Pennsylvania. That event will be aired live.\n\n– Margie Cullen\n\nTruth Social parent company's stock prices pick up steam\n\nAs Election Day approaches, Trump Media & Technology Group's share prices have increased.

The former president delivered remarks at a Democratic campaign office in Columbus, Georgia, on Monday.\n\n“Uniting people and building, being repairers of the breach, as Isaiah says, those are the things that work,” Clinton said as he spoke to Peach State voters and organizers. “Blaming, dividing, demeaning — they get you a bunch of votes at election time, but they don’t work.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHarris unveils initiatives to support entrepreneurs, regulate crypto in outreach to Black men\n\nKamala Harris proposed legalizing marijuana nationally for recreational use and ensuring Black entrepreneurs have access to the cannabis industry as part of an economic agenda aimed at Black men, whose support for the Democratic presidential nominee has shown signs of slipping.\n\nOther proposals in Harris' \"Opportunity Agenda for Black men,\" released Monday, include offering 1 million \"fully forgivable\" loans to Black business owners and new federal regulations for cryptocurrency that look to protect investors in the digital currency.\n\nThe Harris campaign said, if elected, the vice president will \"break down unjust legal barriers that hold Black men and other Americans back by legalizing marijuana nationally, working with Congress to ensure that the safe cultivation, distribution, and possession of recreational marijuana is the law of the land.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n2024 election countdown\n\nCandidates across the country are in the final homestretch of the 2024 election.\n\nEarly voting is open in multiple states, voter registration deadlines have passed in several states and it appears that the top of the ticket candidates may have made their final appearance on the national stage together at the vice presidential debate earlier this month.\n\nOf course, all eyes are on former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, who have been campaigning in battleground states in what is looking like a very close election.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\n'I will stand my ground': Election officials are prepared for attempts to 'find' votes\n\nWhen Donald Trump lost Georgia by just under 12,000 votes in 2020, he went to the two people with the most power over the state’s elections — the governor and the secretary of state — and asked for help overturning the results.\n\nHe asked Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to help him “find 11,780 votes,” but Raffensperger refused. Then he asked Gov. Brian Kemp, another Republican, to order an audit and convene the state legislature so they could hand the state’s electoral votes to him. Kemp also resisted.\n\nHeading into a tight Nov. 5 election, Trump in September claimed without evidence that Democrats are \"cheating,\" laying the groundwork to challenge the results again if he loses. During a debate in June, Trump twice avoided directly answering if he would accept the result's of this year's election, eventually saying he would do so only \"If it’s a fair and legal and good election.\"\n\nBut Trump would be unlikely to find state officials willing to try to block their state's electoral votes from going to Vice President Kamala Harris. Democrats have gained power in major swing states, and the Republicans leading states that Harris could win have given no indication that they would overturn the election. In fact, several explicitly said they won't do so.\n\nRepresentatives of the Republican governors of New Hampshire, Vermont and Virginia − all states leaning toward Harris in polls − told USA TODAY they intend to certify the results regardless of the winner. And top election officials in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, and North Carolina also said they wouldn't be swayed.\n\n– Erin Mansfield and Sarah Wire\n\nTrump and Harris policies: Here's where the candidates stand on the issues\n\nAlthough Kamala Harris and Donald Trump's visions for solving Americans’ largest problems differ, both have pledged to address inflation, lower taxes and support Israel in its war against Hamas.

Even though a White House official said abortion rights are not a part of her official portfolio, the issue has given Harris some momentum after a first year in which the vice president found herself fighting off negative headlines, internal frustration and tough assignments that became political anchors.\n\nWith the midterm elections less than 100 days away, Indiana state Sen. Jean Breaux, a Democrat, told CNN Sunday she could see abortion rights as a chance for Harris to show off her leadership – both now and in the future.\n\n“I thought that there was something behind it for her, as well. That she was trying to position herself as a leader on this issue so that she could show America that she has the potential to lead and can articulate an issue that is resonating with voters all across the country,” she said after attending a roundtable event with the vice president last week.\n\nBreaux told CNN that still, she believed Harris is “sincerely concerned about abortion and the loss of abortion rights for women across this country” and White House officials and others downplay the idea Harris is making a political play by focusing on abortion. They argue she is only responding to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which established abortion as a constitutional right.\n\n“This is not about the next election. This is about an assault on women’s reproductive rights. This is about an extreme Republican Party that is willing to dismantle freedoms and erode rights. I don’t think anybody’s thinking of it in a political sense,” said Cedric Richmond, who left his position at the White House to be a senior advisor for the Democratic National Committee.\n\nWhile there is no action President Joe Biden can take to restore the nationwide right to an abortion, Democrats and advocates have been pressuring the White House to do more on abortion rights. The White House has dismissed several progressive ideas to protect abortion access, including allowing abortion providers to work from federal property in states where the procedure is banned.\n\nAbortion rights have long been a prominent issue for Harris in her campaigns. When she ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019, she vowed, if elected, to require states with a history of restricting abortion rights to obtain federal approval before any new abortion law could take effect. “We cannot tolerate a perspective that is about going backward and not understanding women have agency,” Harris said at the time.\n\nShe’s bringing that same intensity to her discussions with state lawmakers about how to respond to the Dobbs decision, in which the conservatives on the Supreme Court overturned Roe. Aides say the vice president plans to be more visible on any topic that is front and center for the Democratic Party as November grows near. In particular, Harris will continue to elevate abortion rights, ramping up her travel to speak to the “urgency of the moment,” three months ahead of the midterms, aides say.\n\n“As a former local official, the vice president is keenly aware of the critical role these leaders play, especially now when it comes to protecting access to reproductive care,” Kirsten Allen, Harris’ press secretary, told CNN. “The vice president will continue to travel the country and meet with leaders and people on the ground to highlight what’s at stake and build coalitions to protect a woman’s right to make her own reproductive decisions, free from government interference.”\n\nHarris finds her voice on the road\n\nThe vice president has been traveling from state-to-state this summer, sometimes making several trips per week since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade at the end of June. Harris has focused on deeply red and purple states like Florida, Indiana, Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania where state lawmakers have already put in place, or are discussing, newrestrictive measure to curtail or simply eliminate women’s access to an abortion.\n\nHarris will increase that already-ramped-up political travel over the next few months, with a significant number of trips focused on raising money for the DNC and Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, according to a DNC official.\n\n“She has been intentional about going to places and calling out mainly Republican governors in a way that we really haven’t done up until now,” one aide said.\n\nHarris allies, who had previously criticized the administration’s use of the vice president, now herald President Joe Biden for positioning her in an effective way on an issue where she has “deep credibility.”\n\n“This is just an area where she has a more defined profile,” the White House official said, who noted her focused intensified after Harris gave a forceful pro-abortion speech at Emily’s List hours after the draft opinion leaked. “It was a confluence of events, ability and opportunity all in one.”\n\nThe official said Harris then tasked her office with providing her data about wider implications of the Supreme Court’s decision, such as the effects if could have in vitro fertilization (IVF), access to birth control and same-sex marriage.\n\nStill, these latest appearances are giving hope to supporters who may have questioned what happened to the fierce former prosecutor who made headlines grilling Republicans during high-profile Senate hearings.\n\n“If you think about her as a rising star in the party, that’s what people saw,” one person allied with Harris told CNN. “They’re like, ‘Yes, she’s a fighter for us.’ And so, her voice out there on this issue is helping both to literally fight the fight, but then also to mobilize voters and remind voters what she is uniquely adept at.”\n\nLess than 100 days\n\nThe roundtables with state legislators have been a winning model for the vice president, allies say, as it props up Harris’ ability to convene and organize, while also shining a light on restrictive policy proposals across the country.\n\nThey’ve also provided Harris with an avenue to show the skills honed over years as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, providing a more emphatic voice on abortion rights than the President, who has a complicated history on the issue.\n\n“I think on issues like this, it’s clear why they are a good pair,” one source close to Harris told CNN.\n\n“In this moment in crisis her unique history, credibility, and expertise is just invaluable both to the administration as well as the country,” said Karen Finney, vice chair of NARAL and Democratic strategist\n\nThe vice president has tasked staff, aides say, with putting more of a focus on engaging younger voters as November grow closer. And a source with a Democratic-aligned super PAC told CNN that their focus groups show that Harris is still a popular figure with Black voters, despite the general dip in approval rating for the President.\n\n“So that’s going to be an important angle down the road,” the source said, suggesting Harris be deployed to help Democrats in tight House races, such as Georgia’s Sanford Bishop or Ohio’s Amelia Sykes, who is vying for an open seat.\n\nThe vice president will start campaigning with a relatively new team around her, after a series of staffers departed her office. A source familiar with office relations says that quicker decision-making has streamlined coordination with the West Wing and the vice president’s office during the administration’s second year. One White House official credited Anita Dunn, who returned to the White House amid staffing changes in the West Wing, as responsible for some of the positive change.\n\nThat’s led to Harris becoming more of a public face than she was during her first year, doing more media interviews in 2022 than in 2021 and taken far more trips to tout the Biden agenda.\n\nAbortion roundtables\n\nHarris has held more than two dozen roundtables on abortion rights since a draft opinion previewing the overturning of Roe v. Wade was published in Politico in May.\n\nFlorida Rep. Fentrice Driskell, who has attended two roundtables with Harris in both Washington and Orlando and rode on Air Force 2, said, “I really have the genuine sense that she is wanting to hear what we are experiencing on the ground.”\n\nIn some ways, Harris has been trying to create a national message for Democrats – repeating at nearly every roundtable how “one does not have to abandon your faith or your beliefs to agree that the government should not be making this decision” for women.\n\nBut advocates say Harris could be doing more, as they pressure the White House to be more aggressive on abortion rights legislation and meet the moment.\n\n“I’m really glad that the vice president is doing these things,” Renee Bracey Sherman, founder and executive director of We Testify, told CNN at in an interview. “But we were asking for very specific things, and we need to see those delivered.”\n\n“It would be amazing to see her have a more forceful voice, to be able to say the word abortion unapologetically,” Sherman said, “to have her remind everyone in this country that everyone loves someone who’s had an abortion, and also to see the actions from the White House that match her energy.”", "authors": ["Jasmine Wright"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/23/kamala-harris-press-conference-time-channel-livestream-details/75808511007/", "title": "What time is the CNN Town Hall tonight?

And with the costumes out, the picture for the Senate is clearer than ever.\n\nIt is pretty clear from the polling that control of the Senate will likely come down to four races: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe math is simple. Democrats need to win three of these four races to maintain control of the Senate. For Republicans, it’s a slightly easier climb as they need to win only two of these four races.\n\nBut despite the ease of the equation, solving it is anything but easy. All of these races are well within the margin of error. Moreover, the states aren’t all that similar in demographics, which means that it’s plausible that any late movement or polling error could affect the states in different ways. Each state has unique issues affecting them, too.\n\nArizona is the easiest race to understand. Democrats have won the last two Senate races in the state, after not having won one since 1988. They’re powered by increasingly strong performances in the Phoenix suburbs among White college-educated voters and a reliable Hispanic base. (They’re also helped by one of the largest Native American populations in the country.)\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly hasn’t trailed in any poll released publicly. His advantage has slimmed in some recent surveys, though many of those are from outfits that don’t meet CNN’s standards for publications.\n\nOn average, Kelly has been up by about 3 points over Republican Blake Masters. A New York Times/Siena College poll published Monday gave Kelly a 6-point lead over Masters.\n\nMasters’ problem is fairly simple: His net favorability (favorable - unfavorable) rating is underwater. Unpopular Republican candidates is an issue that has plagued Republicans across the board. Meanwhile, Kelly’s net favorability (and approval rating) has been positive.\n\nThis has allowed Kelly to overcome President Joe Biden’s own unpopularity in the state.\n\nKelly’s consistent lead may be why a number of analysts (though not this one) have viewed the Senate as coming down to the other three states.\n\nThe best one for Republicans and arguably the most straightforward one is Nevada. The Times poll there out Monday and the average has the race tied between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Adam Laxalt.\n\nNevada seemed to be a state trending toward Democrats 10 years ago, after Barack Obama won it with ease in two consecutive elections. Republicans have lost the last two presidential elections in the state by decreasing margins, including a 2.4-point loss in 2020.\n\nRepublicans have been helped by movement toward them among Hispanics, as well as a large base of White voters without a college degree. The state’s economic base of tourism was hurt during the Covid-19 pandemic, when national Democrats were far more likely to push for Covid precautions.\n\nCortez Masto, unlike Kelly, has not carved out a base of popularity, according to the polls.\n\nThe final two states to the Senate math are the hardest to figure out. Georgia and Pennsylvania couldn’t be more different in terms of their demographic math, even if they both voted for Biden by slim margins in 2020.\n\nPennsylvania is a Great Lake swing state in which Democrats must win a healthy share of White voters without a college degree. That’s a group that has been running away from Democrats, which is why Hillary Clinton in 2016 became the first Democratic presidential candidate to lose the state since Michael Dukakis in 1988.\n\nIf border issues play an outsized role in a state like Arizona and a recovering gaming industry are pivotal in Nevada, the big non-inflation story in Pennsylvania is crime. Philadelphia, the most populated city in the state, has seen a jump in its crime rate over the last few years.\n\nRepublican Mehmet Oz has used the crime issue to close what was once a large advantage for Democrat John Fetterman in the Senate race.\n\nFetterman, though, has seemed to persevere, despite a stroke that left him off the trail for a period of time. He continues to nurse a small lead in the area of 2 to 3 points. The Times had Fetterman up 6 points, though much of that polling was taken before a debate last week that many viewed as a weak one for him.\n\nAdditionally, Republicans have tended to outperform their final polling the last few cycles.\n\nOz, for his part, has had a negative net favorability rating throughout the campaign, as he’s had to fight off charges of being a carpetbagger.\n\nWhile Pennsylvania (and Arizona and Nevada) may take a while to project, we should know who wins them by the end of November. That may not be the case in Georgia.\n\nGeorgia is unique amongst the four in that the candidate with the most votes needs a majority to win. Otherwise, there will be a runoff in December.\n\nAt this point, a runoff seems quite plausible. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker are in a tight race. Neither one of them is anywhere close to 50% in the average of polls, with Libertarian Chase Oliver pulling around 3% of the vote.\n\nThe potential for a runoff isn’t the only thing that makes Georgia unique. The Peach State has, by far, the largest Black population of any of these pivotal races. Democrats have made a comeback in this deep Southern state because of a growing Black population, and the movement to Democrats among White college educated voters in the Atlanta area.\n\nGeorgia, though, is the most Republican of any of the aforementioned states. Biden won it by the smallest margin of any state he won in 2020. In January 2021 runoffs, Warnock along with Sen. Jon Ossoff became the first two Democrats to win Senate elections in Georgia in a generation.\n\nWarnock’s 2021 election was a special one to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, which is why he’s up for reelection so soon.\n\nUltimately, Georgia may come down to the same thing that is occurring in most swing states this year.

Playing a video of the interview at a Pennsylvania rally, Harris said, “Donald Trump is increasingly unstable and unhinged, and he is out for unchecked power.\"\n\nTrump cut a town hall short after it was interrupted by medical emergencies and instead ended it with nearly 40 minutes of music while he stood on stage and bobbed along.\n\nA new filing showed Elon Musk donated $75 million to a super PAC backing Trump over a three-month period ending in September.\n\nHarris sat for a combative interview with Fox News where they discussed immigration and she vowed that her presidency would not be a continuation of the Biden administration.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, David Jackson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/24/election-2024-live-updates-trump-harris/75815640007/", "title": "Election 2024 recap: Trump, Harris polls; Beyoncé to perform", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from the campaign trail for the 2024 election from Thursday, Oct. 24. For the latest news on the presidential election, read USA TODAY's live election updates for Friday, Oct. 25.\n\nArizona. Nevada. Georgia.\n\nThese three states could ultimately decide the 2024 race for the White House. They're also the states where former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will make their pitch to voters on Thursday.\n\nTrump held a rally in Tempe, Arizona, and addressed an event with the conservative group Turning Point Action in Las Vegas in the evening.\n\nHarris held a campaign stop on Thursday in Atlanta, and she was joined by former President Barack Obama and music icon Bruce Springsteen.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage.\n\nSpringsteen says Trump is 'running to be an American tyrant'\n\nMusic giant Bruce Springsteen told a crowd of 20,000 people that Donald Trump is “running to be an American tyrant.”\n\nSpringsteen, a longtime Democratic activist, played an acoustic set of three hits – “The Promised Land,\" \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" and \"Dancing in the Dark” – before Harris and former President Barack Obama took the stage at the James R. Hallford Stadium in Atlanta.\n\n“I’m Bruce Springsteen and I am here today to support Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for president and vice president of the United States and to oppose Donald Trump and JD Vance,” Springsteen said.\n\nSpringsteen said Harris “wants to protect and guide our great democracy, believes in the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power.” He said Harris will “fight for a woman’s right to choose” and “create a middle class economy that will serve for all our citizens.\n\n\"There is only one candidate in this election who holds those principles dear: Kamala Harris. She's running to be the 47th president of the United States. Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant. He does not understand this country, its history or what it means to be deeply American,\" Springsteen said.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump denounces Kelly, rejects Hitler comparison\n\nTrump remains on the defensive over John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff who described him as basically a fascist who sometimes said nice things about Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"I fired him (Kelly),\" Trump told Fox News Channel’s Bill Melugin in an interview broadcast Thursday evening. \"He made a statement that I'm like Hitler . . . Just couldn't be further from the truth. It's just the opposite, actually.\"\n\nTrump also called Kelly \"a bully. He was a bad guy and he ended up being a weak guy, because all bullies end up being weak. And he wasn't a smart guy. It's a bad combination.\"\n\nHarris and her allies, meanwhile, are trumpeting Kelly's remarks published earlier this week in The New York Times.\n\nOn his personal X account, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said: \"It’s one thing for some leftist group to call you a fascist. Quite another when it’s a fellow Republican. And absolutely astonishing when it’s your own chief of staff.\"\n\n- David Jackson\n\nObama mocks Trump COVID checks: 'Don't be bamboozled'\n\nMore than four years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, some Trump voters credit the former president sending Americans stimulus checks as one reason for their support.\n\nBut at a Harris campaign rally outside Atlanta, Obama sought to smack down that rationale.\n\n“The other thing I hear – some folks will be like, ‘Donald Trump sent me a check during the pandemic,’” Obama said in remarks introducing Harris to the stage. “I’ve heard this, and I know some of ya’ll have heard that.”\n\nThe $1,200 checks from the Treasury Department in the spring of 2020 included Trump’s signature. One year later, COVID-19 checks also went to Americans in the Biden administration.\n\n“Let me make sure y'all understand this,” Obama said, prompting laughter and cheers. “Joe Biden sent you a check during the pandemic, just like I gave people relief during the Great Recession. The thing is, we didn't put our name on it because it wasn't about feeding our egos. It wasn’t about advancing our politics. It was about helping people. That’s the difference.\n\n“He sent you a check,” Obama said with a strong hint of sarcasm. “Do not fall for that okey-doke. Don’t be bamboozled.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nJD Vance addresses comments about migrants\n\nDuring a NewsNation town hall on Thursday, Republican Vice-Presidential candidate JD Vance addressed the baseless claims he spread in September that Haitian immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio.\n\n“What I said then, and I'll say now, is, you're hearing a lot of things from your constituents. They're telling you things, and I think it's important for me to listen to the people that are coming to me with their problems,” Vance said during the Detroit town hall.\n\n“Do I wish that I had been better in that moment? Maybe,” Vance, who represents Ohio in the Senate, said. “But it's also people in my community, people that I represent are coming to me and saying, this thing is happening. What am I supposed to do?”\n\nVance in September pushed false claims that Haitian migrants in the small Midwestern town were abducting and eating their neighbors' pets. Donald Trump echoed the claims during his debate with Kamala Harris the same month. But the mayor of Springfield and local police have said the accounts are untrue.\n\nVance wore socks during Thursday’s town hall with pictures of his family dog who passed away earlier this year.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris urges voters to 'imagine oval office in three months'\n\nAt a raucous campaign rally outside Atlanta Thursday night, Harris framed her race against Trump by having voters visualize the scene in the Oval Office after Inauguration Day next year.\n\n“Just imagine the Oval Office in three months. Picture it in your mind,” Harris said. “It's either Donald Trump in there, stewing – stewing – over his enemies list, or me working for you, checking off my to-do list.\n\n“You have the power to make that decision. It is your power.”\n\nHarris debuted the “enemies list/to-do list” line during a CNN town hall Wednesday night. It's the centerpiece of her closing argument to voters.\n\nIn the homestretch of the 2024 campaign, Harris has aggressively attacked Trump as a threat to democracy, casting him as a vengeful dictator who wants to go after his political adversaries.\n\n“Georgia, I ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard?” Harris said, 12 days before the Nov. 5 election. “Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it?”\n\nThe crowd roared in applause.\n\n“And when we fight, we win!” Harris said, ending on one of her campaign’s go-to slogans.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTrump calls into JD Vance town hall\n\nJD Vance received a question from a special guest during his NewsNation town hall in Detroit on Thursday night: Donald Trump.\n\nAnchor Chris Cuomo joked with Vance that, “Not unlike Beetlejuice, if you invoke the former president's names too many times in a row, he's going to want to weigh in on what is being said.”\n\nTrump had called to ask Vance a pressing question – “How brilliant is Donald J Trump?”\n\nVance told his running mate that the town hall was supposed to be for undecided voters. “I would hope that I have your vote of all people,” he quipped.\n\nTrump also asked Vance “How brilliant is Kamala?” but the Ohio Senator deflected. “Oh, that’s a tough one, sir,” he told Trump.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nSamuel L. Jackson jokes that he and Kamala Harris have the same favorite curse word\n\nAt a Harris campaign rally Thursday night in Atlanta, actor Samuel L. Jackson joked that he and the Democratic nominee have something in the common – they have the same favorite curse word. Jackson, star of Pulp Fiction and other films, is known for his variations of “mother f---er.”\n\nIn a video that surfaced over the summer, Harris indicated it is also her go-to curse word.\n\n“She’s running on a proven track record of fighting for the people, standing up to bullies, protecting the most vulnerable and taking on the toughest fights,” Jackson said. “And we heard her favorite curse word is a favorite of mine, too! But I ain’t gonna say – uh- that word.\n\n“I don’t know about you, but that’s the kind of president I can stand behind. That’s the kind of president I can see leading our country forward.”\n\nJackson, film director Spike Lee and others were among the warm-up acts for a Harris campaign rally featuring musician Bruce Springsteen, former President Barack Obama and Harris.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTrump once again suggests he should have won Nobel Prize\n\nDonald Trump on Thursday suggested that he should have won a Nobel Peace Prize during his presidency for facilitating the Abraham Accords, an agreement establishing diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nTrump also argued that former President Barack Obama didn’t deserve his Nobel Prize.\n\n“I got elected in a much bigger, better, crazier election, but they gave him the Nobel Prize,” Trump said of Obama. “He didn't even know why the hell he got it right. He still doesn't.”\n\nObama was given the Nobel Prize less than a year into his first term for “extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.”\n\nTrump has previously suggested that he should have been awarded the Nobel Prize, including in 2020 when he alleged that he helped broker peace between broker peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea.\n\n- Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump uses dehumanizing language about migrants at Arizona rally\n\nTrump is talking more and more about immigration issues at his rallies as Election Day approaches.\n\nDuring his Thursday rally in Arizona, he told the crowd of supporters \"When we win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins.\"\n\nTrump, who once made inflation and the economy his top issues on the campaign trail, said earlier this week that immigration is now \"the number one thing to campaign on.\" In denouncing the U.S. immigration system, Trump said, \"we're like a garbage can for the world.\"\n\nOpponents have accused Trump of exaggerating the impact of illegal border crossings and criticized his plans for mass deportations.\n\nDonald Trump 'concerned' about RFK's environmental record\n\nDonald Trump on Thursday told voters at a rally in Las Vegas that he was “concerned” about Robert F. Kennedy’s past as an environmental lawyer who fought to protect waterways.\n\n“I don't know if I'm going to have him working too much on the environment. I'm a little concerned about that with Bobby. I don't know if I want to play it around with our with our liquid gold under our feet,” Trump said during his keynote speech at Turning Point PAC and Turning Point Action’s United for Change rally Thursday night.\n\nKennedy endorsed Trump after ending his independent presidential bid earlier this year. Trump has suggested he would give Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate, a federal post related to healthcare if he is elected president.\n\nWhen it comes to the environment, Trump is found of saying that he would “drill baby drill” and allow housing development on public lands preserved by the Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service.\n\nThe issue of public land is particularly salient in Nevada, where Trump was speaking. More than 80% of Nevada’s land mass is controlled by the federal government.\n\n- Karissa Waddick\n\nElection official in Reno, Nevada tells AP she was forced out before 2024 election\n\nThe top election official in a key swing county in Nevada told the Associated Press Wednesday that she was forced out of her job just weeks before the presidential election.\n\nHer comments are just the latest election-related dustup in the Reno-area county where right-wing activists who dispute election results have mounted a yearslong pressure campaign focused on the workers who run elections and officials who certify them.\n\nCari-Ann Burgess, who served as the interim voter registrar for Washoe County took a stress-releated leave of absence starting in September, a county spokesperson previously told the USA TODAY Network.\n\nBut she told the Associated Press she had a conflict with the county manager and offered to return to her previously held position as deputy registrar, but instead was forced to make a written request for a leave of absence.\n\n– Erin Mansfield and Trevor Hughes\n\nTrump and Harris neck-and-neck in swing state polls\n\nA new batch of polls released Thursday show the presidential race remains tight in many of the states likely to matter most.\n\nTrump is leading Harris by one percentage point in polls by Marist College and Emerson College in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona. The GOP nominee is leading the vice president by two percentage points in polls by the same institutions in North Carolina.\n\nThe two candidates are tied 49% to 49% in another poll by Marist College in Georgia.\n\nTrump's leads and the tie all fall within the polls' margins of error.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nObama calls Trump a 'wannabe king'\n\nFormer President Barack Obama called former President Donald Trump “a wannabe king” and a “wannabe dictator” Thursday night at a Harris campaign rally outside of Atlanta as he seized on recent comments from Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly.\n\n“In politics, a good rule of thumb is don’t say you want to do anything like Hitler,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people in Clarkston, Georgia.\n\nObama was referencing Kelly’s recent interview with the New York Times in which the former general and ex-Trump aide said Trump exhibited fascist tendencies in the White House and made admirable statements about Hitler.\n\n“I happen to know John Kelly and Mark Milley,” Obama said, also singling the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has also criticized Trump. “They are not quote, unquote, ‘woke liberals,’ They are people who have never in the past even talked about politics because they believe that the military should be above politics.”\n\nObama said Kelly and Milley have spoken out “because they have seen that in Donald Trump's mind, the military does not exist to serve the Constitution or the American people.” Obama said Trump thinks the military is to “serve his interests.”\n\n“And so my question to you, then, Georgia is: How is any of that going to help you? We do not need four years of a wannabe king, a wannabe dictator running around trying to punish his enemies. That is not what you need in your life America is ready to turn the page.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Democrats have early voting lead\n\nWith Election Day just two weeks away on Nov. 5, more than 11.5% of Pennsylvania’s more than 9 million registered voters have returned a mail ballot so far in the all-important 2024 battleground.\n\nApproximately 1 million of the 1.78 million voters who requested a mail-in or absentee ballots for the presidential election featuring Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump have returned them to their respective county’s board of election, according to data from the Pennsylvania Department of State last updated Tuesday morning.\n\nDemocratic voters lead in both mail ballot requests and ballots returned as of Friday, with that party’s voters making up almost 58% of applications and 62% of returned ballots, according to the state’s data.\n\nDemocrats have historically favored voting by mail in Pennsylvania with no-excuse mail ballots since 2020, the first election after Act 77 of 2019 allowing the ballot option was signed into law for the commonwealth.\n\n- Chris Ullery\n\nWhen will the election results be announced?\n\nIt is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.\n\nBut you can anticipate delays.\n\nSome key swing states that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward\n\nDid Beyoncé back Joe Biden? What about Hillary Clinton?\n\nBeyoncé is expected to appear with Kamala Harris on Friday in her home state of Texas. It's not the first time the \"Cowboy Carter\" singer has backed the vice president's White House bid – she also gave her blessing for Harris to use her song \"Freedom\" as an unofficial campaign anthem.\n\nBeyoncé has weighed in on politics before. She posted a clip of herself ahead of Election Day 2020 wearing a Biden-Harris face mask, and she headlined a concert alongside her husband, rapper Jay Z, for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBeyoncé set to perform at Kamala Harris rally in Houston\n\nBeyoncé is taking the stage with Kamala Harris.\n\nThe pop queen will appear with the Democratic presidential nominee at rally in Houston on Friday, according to Reuters.\n\nHarris, who is locked in a close race against Republican Donald Trump, is heading to Texas to support another Democrat, Colin Allred, who is trying to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nBeyoncé, who hails from Houston, is expected to perform, Reuters reported, and will come with her mother Tina Knowles.\n\n- Michael Collins and Caché McClay\n\nJoy no more: Harris takes sharper tone while campaigning against Trump\n\nGone is the joy. In it's place, rising alarm.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has taken an increasingly fatalist approach to campaigning that centers on the threat she says former President Donald Trump would present to democracy if he returns to office.\n\n\"He's going to sit there unstable, unhinged, plotting his revenge, plotting his retribution, creating an enemies list,\" she said Wednesday evening during a town hall on CNN.\n\nHarris referred to Trump as a \"fascist\" during the town hall, echoing comments made by his former chief of staff John Kelly in an interview this week, and hit him for reportedly praising aspects of Hitler's leadership, also according to Kelly.\n\nStanding outside the vice president’s mansion at the Naval Observatory in Washington earlier in the day, Harris warned that Trump “is increasingly unhinged and unstable” and said “people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrail against his propensities and his actions\" in a second term.\n\nOver the past week, Harris has hammered Trump at most campaign events for comments he's made in the final days of the race about wielding the power of the presidency to muzzle dissenters and punish his political opponents.\n\nIf her approach has taken a darker turn, Harris says, it's because Trump's conduct has made it necessary.\n\n\"He’s becoming increasingly unstable and unhinged, and it requires that response,\" she told reporters over the weekend. \"I think the American people are seeing it, witnessing it in real time.\"\n\n- Francesca Chambers and Michael Collins\n\nBy the numbers: Latest polling on the 2024 presidential election\n\nPolling numbers updated Thursday reaffirm what has been clear for weeks now: it is an incredibly close race between Trump and Harris.\n\nHere are some of the latest surveys:\n\nTrump leads Harris 47% to 45% in new national poll by the Wall Street Journal\n\nTrump leads 48% to 46% in a new national poll by CNBC\n\nTIPP Tracking Poll shows Harris ahead 50% to 47%.\n\nBloomberg polling of likely swing state voters show Harris and Trump statistically tied at 49%\n\nLearn more about the latest presidential election polling results 12 days ahead of the election.\n\n- Kinsey Crowley\n\nShootings and a bombing escalate threats against election, government workers\n\nThreats against election workers and other public officials have moved beyond calls and texts to shootings and a bombing in this incendiary political season.\n\nThreats that resulted in charges this week include a Philadelphia man vowing to \"skin\" and kill a state party official for recruiting poll watchers and an Alabama man threatening to execute election officials in Arizona.\n\nAn Arizona man was charged with shootings at a Democratic Party campaign office. And a California man was charged with bombing a courthouse.\n\n“As we approach Election Day, the Justice Department’s warning remains clear: anyone who illegally threatens an election worker, official, or volunteer will face the consequences,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in announcing action in four cases this week.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nBill Clinton calls Trump ‘Mr. Brand and Blame’\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton called Donald Trump “Mr. Brand and Blame” while addressing a group of Black leaders in Phoenix, Arizona, Wednesday.\n\nConsidered one of the “must-win” swing states in the 2024 election, polls show the presidential race is tight in Arizona. Clinton, who flipped the state blue when he ran for reelection in 1996, said Kamala Harris might be in better shape there than in other states that are typically “more Democratic.”\n\n“He's gotta take the election away from them by distraction and division,” Clinton said of the 2024 Republican nominee Wednesday. “She’s the clear choice.”\n\n- Stephanie Murray and Rachel Barber\n\nTrump makes it public: He would fire Special Counsel Jack Smith\n\nTrump made it official on Thursday: If he is re-elected, he would dismiss Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is prosecuting two cases against him.\n\n\"I would fire him within two seconds,” Trump told radio show host Hugh Hewitt.\n\nSmith is the top prosecutor in two cases against Trump, one involving efforts to overturn the 2020 election and the other dealing with the mishandling of classified documents.\n\nIt's always been understood that these federal cases would go away if Trump reclaims the White House.\n\nWhat's less understood is what might happen with Trump's conviction in the New York hush money case and another 2020 election case out of Georgia.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nTucker Carlson likens Trump to a dad giving U.S. a “vigorous spanking”\n\nFormer Fox News host Tucker Carlson riled up the crowd at a Georgia rally Wednesday with an unusual metaphor.\n\nHe compared former President Donald Trump to a “pissed” father coming home to punish his daughter, the country, in the case he is reelected on Nov. 5.\n\n“He’s not vengeful. He loves his children, disobedient as they may be,” Carlson said. “When dad comes home, you know what he says? ‘You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl and you’re getting a vigorous spanking right now.’”\n\nLater when Trump took the stage, members of the audience chanted “Daddy’s home.”\n\nCarlson’s comments quickly drew criticism online from Democrats\n\n- Rachel Barber\n\nFormer GOP representative Fred Upton endorses Harris\n\nRepublican former U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, a respected legislator who represented Michigan for 36 years and became chairman of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president, her campaign said Thursday morning.\n\n\"I have already cast my ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris to be our next president of the United States,\" Upton said in the statement.\n\nHe added that he’s never voted for a Democratic president, until now. Upton was one of the 10 Republicans who split with his party to vote to impeach Trump for his role in instigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol as Congress met to certify the 2020 election for Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\n- Todd Spangler and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat time do polls open and close on Election Day?\n\nAcross the country, polling hours on Nov. 5 will vary by location.\n\nMost states will allow voters to cast their ballots between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. However, in some areas of Vermont, polls will open as early as 5 a.m. and in New York, polls will close as late as 9 p.m. Check with your state or local election office or its website to find the correct window when you can vote in your area.\n\nUSA TODAY’s Voter Guide details everything you need to know about making sure your voice is heard in this year’s general election.\n\n- Rachel Barber\n\nTrump locked in tight battle against Harris, new WSJ poll finds\n\nA new Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday found that Trump is leading Harris by two percentage points, 47% to 45%, among 1,500 registered voters when asked who they would choose if the general election were held today.\n\nThree percent of voters said they were undecided and 2% of voters chose Robert F.

Former President Barack Obama will be at both events and Harris plans to attend today, according to her campaign.\n\nThe vice president is the latest in a series of Democrats for whom Springsteen has turned up on the campaign trail. The Boss backed Hillary Clinton in 2016, Obama in 2008 and 2012, and John Kerry in 2004. He also performed at a star-studded Inauguration Day rally for Biden on Jan. 20, 2021.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar and Joey Garrison\n\nDid Eminem endorse Kamala Harris?\n\nYes. At Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign rally in Detroit Tuesday, Eminem told the crowd that he thinks Harris “supports a future for this country where these freedoms and many others will be protected and upheld.”\n\n“I also think that people shouldn’t be afraid to express their opinions, and I don’t think anyone wants an America where people are worried about retribution, of what people will do if you make your opinion known,” Eminem said at the rally.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen will Trump be on Joe Rogan’s podcast?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is set to appear on podcasting giant “The Joe Rogan Experience” on Friday. Rogan is set to interview Trump in his studio based in Austin, Texas, as reported by Politico.\n\nThis would mark Trump’s first appearance on Rogan’s wildly popular podcast.

He also praised the millions of Georgia voters who have already cast their vote.\n\nHe also talked about his economic plan and vision for bolstering cities like Detroit; criticized the Biden administration and his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, over immigration; and repeated claims of political persecution.\n\nHe said nothing on stage about recent allegations by his longest-serving chief of staff.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris says Trump is a fascist at CNN town hall\n\nHarris said Wednesday that she believes former President Donald Trump is a fascist and his ex-chief of staff is \"putting out a 9-1-1 call\" to the American people to consider the implications of his potential return to the White House.\n\nAppearing at a CNN town hall in Delaware County in Pennsylvania, Harris invoked former White House chief of staff John Kelly's claim that Trump made positive comments about Hitler and agreed with his assessment that Trump is a \"fascist.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" she said. \"And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.\"\n\n--Francesca Chambers\n\nWhy a majority of voters think Donald Trump should face charges even if he's elected\n\nA majority of Americans think it would be “wrong” for Donald Trump to have the Justice Department drop federal charges against him if he wins back the White House, according to a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll.\n\nLegal observers say there's no chance a Trump Justice Department would continue the two federal cases he has asked judges to dismiss as a \"witch hunt\" led by a prosecutor he calls \"deranged.\" But nearly 58% of likely voters who responded to the poll said it would be \"wrong\" for Trump to direct the department to drop the charges, compared to 30% saying it would be the \"right\" thing to do. Nearly one in 10 were undecided.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nWhat time do polls open on Election Day?\n\nIn some states, like Arizona and Connecticut, polling locations can open as early as 6 a.m. on Election Day, which is Nov. 5.

A poll manager is then supposed to confirm those tallies match the figures produced by machines and correct any inconsistency ahead of the state's Nov. 12 county certification deadline.\n\n\"Why wouldn't we just pause, especially on the hand-count rule, given what looks like a fairly robust record of chaos that it is sowing?\" Judge Robert C.

I. McBurney was ruling on the claim of Julie Adams, a Republican member of Atlanta's Fulton County election board, that she has discretion over whether to certify election results. She argued that, given she has taken an oath to prevent fraud or abuse, she should have the right to withhold certification if she believes the results aren't reliable.\n\nHowever, McBurney wrote that if officials like herself were \"free to play investigator, prosecutor, jury, and judge,\" then \"Georgia voters would be silenced.\" McBurney added that Adams could report any concerns about fraud or error to a prosecutor.\n\nThe ruling comes amid rising fears that local officials may sow chaos or confusion this November election by refusing to certify results by the state's Nov. 12 deadline – one week after the election.\n\nLawyers for Adams didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDOJ sues Virginia over removing noncitizen voters from rolls within 90 days of election\n\nAnother dispute over how to prevent noncitizens from voting Nov. 5 has erupted in Virginia, where the U.S. Justice Department says the state is cancelling registrations too close to the election and GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin argues this has been state policy for 18 years.\n\nThe department sued the state on Friday for removing voters from the registration rolls within 90 days of the election, which is nicknamed a “quiet period,” in violation of a 1993 federal voting law.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, head of the civil rights division, said in a statement the policy “places qualified voters in jeopardy of being removed from the rolls and creates the risk of confusion for the electorate.”\n\nYoungkin said a state law approved in 2006 calls for removal of any voter who stated they were a noncitizen while filling out motor vehicle records and then either accidentally or intentionally became registered to vote.\n\n“This is unprecedented, and I stand by my duty to ensure fair, safe, and accurate elections in Virginia – no exceptions,” Youngkin said in a statement on X.\n\nStudies by the Brennan Center for Justice and the libertarian Cato Institute have found no widespread fraud from noncitizens voting.

Cases in the first reported outbreak have risen to 196 in 28 states and Washington, D.C. – up from 162 people in 25 states. The CDC said that 68 of those sickened with the strain Salmonella Africana have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nThose cases were reported between March 30 and May 23, the CDC says. Nearly three-fourths of the 85 patients interviewed (74%) said they ate cucumbers.\n\nCases of people infected with the strain Salmonella Braenderup in the second outbreak have risen to 185 cases in 24 states, up from 158 in 23 states, the FDA says.\n\nFather's Day deals:Get food and restaurant discounts from Applebee's, KFC, Arby's, Denny's, more\n\nStates where people have gotten sick from salmonella linked to cucumbers\n\nBack on May 31, Fresh Start Produce Sales Inc. of Delray, Florida, recalled cucumbers grown in Florida and shipped to 14 states between May 17 and 21. That recall came after some cucumbers tested positive for salmonella, the FDA said on June 1.\n\nThe salmonella strain those cucumbers tested were found to have a third strain, Salmonella Bareilly, which doesn't match any of the currently reported outbreaks, the FDA said.\n\nWhile epidemiologic data show that cucumbers may be contaminated with Salmonella Africana and may be making people sick, the FDA and CDC have not confirmed that cucumbers are the source of illness in any ongoing outbreaks. The agencies are continuing to investigate both outbreaks to determine the specific sources and products involved.\n\nHowever, with so many people who developed salmonella infections having reported eating cucumbers, those cucumbers are likely involved, Bill Marler, a food safety lawyer, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe epidemiological investigation after the Fresh Start cucumbers were recalled led \"to cucumbers in that company,\" he said.\n\n\"Just because the leftover cucumbers (those tested), which are clearly the ones people didn't eat, have a different strain, doesn't mean the CDC and FDA are wrong\" about having Fresh Start issue the recall, he said. \"Most of the time there's never food to test because people eat the evidence,\" Marler said.\n\nWhere Salmonella Africana infections have been reported:\n\n◾ Alabama\n\n◾ Arkansas\n\n◾ Connecticut\n\n◾ District of Columbia\n\n◾ Delaware\n\n◾ Florida\n\n◾ Georgia\n\n◾ Illinois\n\n◾ Iowa\n\n◾ Indiana\n\n◾ Kentucky\n\n◾ Maine\n\n◾ Maryland\n\n◾ Massachusetts\n\n◾ Michigan\n\n◾ Minnesota\n\n◾ Missouri\n\n◾ North Carolina\n\n◾ New Jersey\n\n◾ New York\n\n◾ Ohio\n\n◾ Pennsylvania\n\n◾ Rhode Island\n\n◾ South Carolina\n\n◾ Tennessee\n\n◾ Texas\n\n◾ Vermont\n\n◾ Virginia\n\n◾ Washington\n\nSymptoms of salmonella infection\n\nThe bacteria Salmonella can enter the food production chain when the process isn't sanitary and when workers handling food do not wash their hands, according to the FDA. Salmonella is usually spread via contaminated water such as that used to irrigate crops, the CDC says, and undercooked and raw foods, like cucumbers.\n\nSalmonella infection symptoms usually occur between six hours and six days after exposure and may include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps, the CDC says. Severe infections may include aches, headaches, elevated fever, lethargy, rashes, and blood in the urine or stool. Some salmonella infections may become fatal.\n\nSalmonella causes about 1.35 million illnesses, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the U.S. annually, according to the CDC. Other recent salmonella outbreaks have been linked to pet bearded dragons, backyard poultry and basil, the agency says.\n\nSalmonella and cucumbers: What consumers should know\n\nConsumers should be concerned about food safety during this situation because we don't know the specific sources of salmonella contamination in the outbreaks, said Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health in Washington, D.C.\n\nEven though the initial shipments of cucumbers potentially linked to the Salmonella Africana outbreak were recalled – and likely wouldn't be edible by now – eating cucumbers could still be risky, she said.\n\n\"I hate to tell someone not to eat fresh produce, but if I were someone over the age of 65, with a compromised immune system, maybe I was dealing with cancer … I probably wouldn't eat cucumbers now.\"\n\nThose more likely to develop a serious illness from salmonella infection, according to The CDC, include people with immune systems weakened from a medical condition – such as diabetes, liver or kidney disease, and cancer or cancer treatment – as well as children younger than 5, and older adults.\n\n\"If you were to eat cucumbers, I would wash it thoroughly and I would be very careful about cross-contamination,\" Kowalcyk said. \"And I probably wouldn't eat (cucumbers) every meal, every day.\"\n\nWhile the number of salmonella cases is at more than 380 now, those infected likely number 30 times more, she said. So it's good to be cautious, she said, until \"there's a little more clarity.\"\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

A flyout ends the inning 2-2.\n\n2:56 p.m.: Texas' offense leaves the field after eight pitches, with a strikeout and two flyouts ending the inning in a flash.\n\n3rd inning\n\n3:05 p.m.: Cooper Hastings enters the game for Kaleb Christ and gets an out on of a stellar play by third baseman Dylan Burke. Hastings walks a batter and allows another hit, but two flyouts strands the Paseo Verde runners.\n\n3:15 p.m.: Gary Steubing gets a hit for Boerne on a pop up that falls in the shallow outfield. A bunt advances Steubing to second after a throw by the Nevada catcher is just off. Another hit falls into the right field and an errant throw allows Steubing to score, making the game 3-2 Texas. Collins gets his second hit of the day, driving home Burke and putting runners on second and third. Hastings hits another sacrifice fly to make the game 5-2. A flyout ends the inning with Texas in the drivers seat.\n\n4th inning\n\n3:20 p.m.: A much smoother inning on defense for the Southwest Region champions. A hit by pitch gave Nevada a base runner, but Hastings was able to handle the other three batters for an uneventful frame.\n\n3:30 p.m.: Noah Letalu takes over on the mound for the Mountain Region champions in the bottom of the 4th. Mogford gets another hit with a slow roller toward third base that isn't corralled in time. Guffey makes it to first on fielder's choice retires Mogford.

Two days before the World Series opener, they sent a group text inviting Scott Bradley, their Princeton coach, to Games 1 and 2.\n\n“When you look at both Mike and Chris as they’ve evolved into these roles, I think their ability to deal with people, to have difficult and honest conversations, to see the value in character I think is probably their greatest strengths,” said Bradley, a former major league catcher and a brother of former U.S. soccer coach Bob Bradley.\n\nTheir ties go back to Old Nassau. Hazen was a senior outfielder on Bradley’s first Princeton team in 1998, six years after Bradley’s ninth and final major league season. Young was among Bradley's first recruits, played baseball there in 1999 and 2000 while also spending two years with the Tigers basketball team.\n\n“I met Mike on my recruiting visit to Princeton,” Young recalled. “Played with a lot of his teammates who were the year below him and then got to know him better in the professional ranks.”\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\nWhile Hazen never advanced above Class A, Young is among seven of Bradley’s players who have reached the major leagues, joined by Danny Barnes, Matt Bowman, Mike Ford, David Hale, Ross Ohlendorf and Will Venable — the Rangers’ current associate manager. Another, Mike Chernoff, is the Cleveland Guardians’ GM\n\n“It was such a highly competitive environment. I think it helped a ton,” Hazen said. “It really pushed you, obviously, to be competent academically there, which you can put that loosely — I was competently academic. You were around such motivated, driven people that I felt like that kind of probably would help me more than anything else.”\n\nHazen, class of ‘98, hit .333 with 10 homers and a team-record 49 stolen bases over four seasons. Young, class of ’02, went 5-0 with a 1.82 ERA as a sophomore in 2000 as Princeton won the Ivy title while averaging 13.4 points per game in two basketball seasons.\n\nBoth were politics majors — Hazen’s senior thesis was on the 1981 and ’94 baseball labor strikes, Young’s on Jackie Robinson, integration and racial stereotypes.\n\nBradley inherited Hazen as a senior and team captain.\n\n“You could see the leadership qualities at that point,” Bradley said. “There were times where I would be waiting to go to talk to somebody and Michael would literally put his arm in front of me and stop me from walking any further and look at me, 'I got to coach.' And he made sure that the players understood that’s not how we do things, that’s not our way.”\n\nHazen, 47, was a 31st-round draft pick by San Diego in 1998, and his minor league career was slowed by a shoulder injury. He was released after the 1999 season and called Bradley.\n\n“He said, ‘Hey, coach, I got released. I’m not sure what to do. I’d love to try to stay in shape to see if anybody calls,’” Bradley said. “I said, ‘Why don’t you come to my house?’ So he stayed at our house for a couple of weeks.”\n\nBradley called baseball writer Peter Gammons, who offered to pay Hazen, a Massachusetts native, to scout in the Cape Cod League. Bradley and Gammons were so impressed by Hazen’s reports that they recommended him to Cleveland Indians assistant general manager Mark Shapiro, who hired Hazen as an intern.\n\n“A lot of the same attributes that have led to his successful career were evident in his track record prior to hiring him and in talking with him,” said Shapiro, now the Toronto Blue Jays president. “He showed determination, initiative and drive throughout his amateur and pro playing career and in his pursuit of a job in MLB. He was an easy guy to believe in and the endorsements from Scott and Peter made it easy to push him into our hiring process. ”\n\nHazen rose in the Cleveland organization and left to become Boston’s director of player development ahead of the 2006 season. He was promoted to GM in September 2015 under president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski, and 13 months later was hired as Arizona’s GM.\n\n“We knew he was the next up-and-comer from all we had spoken,” Diamondbacks President Derrick Hall said. “After we met with him, there was no doubt he was the ideal candidate to lead our baseball direction: Smart, experienced, passionate and overdue.”\n\nBradley was coaching his first Princeton team and recruiting for the first time when he got a call from Ryan Cotton, who had been admitted to Princeton and wanted to be a student assistant. Cotton worked with the Dallas Mustangs youth baseball team and recommended Young, who also played basketball.\n\n“I was following him in the papers in basketball, and I was seeing the numbers that he was putting up and I walked up to John Thompson (III), who was an assistant coach at the time, and said, ‘What are you guys looking for this year?'\" Bradley recalled. “He says, ‘We’re looking for size. We need height.’ I said, ‘6-foot-10 big enough?'\"\n\nYoung, 44, was drafted by Pittsburgh in the third round in 2000. Known universally by the initials “CY,” he was 79-67 with a 3.95 ERA in 13 seasons for Texas, San Diego, the New York Mets, Seattle and Kansas City. He earned his only All-Star selection in 2007 and won the 2015 World Series opener with six scoreless innings, helping the Royals beat the Mets for the title.\n\nWeeks after he was released from a minor league deal by the Padres in March 2018, he joined the commissioner’s office as vice president of on-field operations, initiatives and strategy. He was promoted to senior vice president in February 2020, then left that December to become GM of his hometown Rangers.\n\nBoth Hazen and Young have taken teams to the World Series two years after last-place finishes and 100-loss seasons.\n\n“When I was a player, I could have a singular focus. I could come to the park every day with: What do I need to do to prepare myself to help this team win?” Young said. “Every day I come to work now, I have to think about how I can help everybody else organization-wide to help us be prepared to win. And it’s much more immense and an outward focus as compared to when I was a player. But it’s also in a lot of ways more gratifying.”\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/university-of-tennessee/other-sports/2024/06/19/tennessee-baseball-texas-am-college-world-series-final-schedule-game-times/74153096007/", "title": "Tennessee baseball to face Texas A&M in College World Series final", "text": "OMAH, Neb. − Tennessee baseball will face Texas A&M for the College World Series title.\n\nThe No. 1 Vols (58-12) and No. 3 Aggies (52-13) play in the best-of-three CWS final series starting Saturday (7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN).

In last year's title run, they were the third seed after running through the Lone Star Conference and South Central Regional Tournaments.\n\nThis year, the Rams were knocked out of the LSC Tournament in the second round, dropping back-to-back games against UAFS and UT Permian Basin, and were held scoreless in both games.\n\nDespite the disappointing losses, the Rams still qualified for the South Central Regional tournament as the sixth-seed, facing off against the third-seed, West Texas A&M, in Grand Junction, Colo.\n\nHS SPORTS:Q&A: Mark Smith talks about first months as Central Athletic Coordinator, football coach\n\nAngelo State ran off three straight wins against West Texas A&M and second-seeded Colorado Mesa University, earning a trip to the South Central Super Regional against top-seeded Lubbock Christian University in Lubbock.\n\n\"It was really good for us to get out of Texas,\" coach Kevin Brooks said. \" To get away from pretty much everyone and just be with ourselves, I thought, was a good thing. And then to play two really quality teams and have success bred a lot of confidence that we carried into the next week.\"\n\nIn the first game of the best-of-three Super Regional, the Rams returned from a 4-0 deficit to tie the game in the fifth and went into the extra inning tied at 6-6. Both teams remained scoreless until the top of the 10th inning when Conagher Sands scored a run to go up 7-6. The defense came up big for Angelo State in the bottom of the 10th as it stole Game 1 in Lubbock.\n\nThe second game was nip and tuck until the Chaps pulled away in the fourth and fifth innings to take a 15-1 lead. The Rams responded with eight runs in the sixth, but it was too little, too late as Lubbock Christian took the second game 25-12.\n\nThe Rams showed their experience by taking an 11-0 lead into the eighth inning of the third and final game and winning in a blowout 17-4.\n\n\"This (World Series) has been the most gratifying and special to get to,\" Brooks said. \"Just because we've gone through so many injuries and with playing bad. And credit to the guys who have just kept working and working.\"\n\nFirst round matchup\n\nAs the eighth seed, Angelo State faces its toughest test right out of the gate matching up against No. 1 Central Missouri. The last time they faced off against the Mules was in 2009, ending in a 6-3 Rams win.\n\nCentral Missouri is riding a five-game winning streak to sweep to the Central Regional title.\n\nThe Mules boast an impressive display of offensive production and sit among the best in multiple D-II offensive categories, including leading the nation in batting average, hits, home runs, runs scored, slugging percentage and stolen bases.\n\nCMU has three NCBWA All-Americans starting with outfielder Brennen van Breusegen earning first-team honors with a .385 batting average, 21 home runs and 69 RBIs. Carter Young was voted to the second team with a .373 batting average and 16 home runs.

We've been there, we've done that and we've done well.

On one hand, it isn’t exactly a national event with only two conferences represented.\n\nBut despite the SEC and ACC monopolizing all the reservations to Nebraska, it’s likely that a first-time champion will be crowned. The Omaha octet can claim a total of just two past championships, one each for Florida (2017) and Virginia (2015). The other six are trying to hoist the trophy for the first time. That includes perennial bridesmaid Florida State, yet to win the whole thing despite making its 24th CWS appearance, second only to Texas.\n\nThere’s no disputing that the SEC comes in with recent history on its side, having claimed each of the last four CWS titles. But none of the four programs responsible for those are in this field. Schools representing the ACC, on the other hand, have left Omaha as champions just twice, with UVa adding to Wake Forest’s lone title way back in 1955 – just the third year of the league’s existence.*\n\n*Miami (Fla.) won four CWS titles, but all occurred before the Hurricanes joined the ACC.\n\nSo can one of the ACC squads break through, or will the SEC’s dominance continue? Let’s take a look at the matchups.\n\nFirst, here’s a quick reminder of the College World Series format. And here’s what to know about the participants:\n\nNo. 4 North Carolina (47-14) vs. No. 12 Virginia (46-15)\n\nTIME/TV: Friday, 2 p.m. ET, ESPN\n\nThe festivities begin with this renewal of ACC acquaintances. The Cavaliers took two out of three from the Tar Heels in Charlottesville back in April, a series that featured a total of 53 runs scored. This one might also be a high-scoring affair given the potency of both lineups, though the confines here at Charles Schwab Field tend to be more friendly to pitchers. Experience might also be on the side of the Cavaliers, who still have a number of key contributors from last year’s squad that reached Omaha. The Tar Heels, however, have demonstrated the clutch gene during the postseason, winning three games in their final at-bats. Overall pitching depth as well as outfielder Vance Honeycutt, arguably the best all-around player in the tournament, could also work to UNC’s advantage.\n\nNo. 1 Tennessee (55-12) vs. No. 8 Florida State (47-15)\n\nTIME/TV: Friday, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN\n\nThe Seminoles’ years of Omaha heartbreak are well-documented. But the Volunteers are up against a different sort of history as they look to become the first overall top seed to win the championship since Miami in 1999. Tennessee is one of only two teams that needed a third game to prevail in its super regional, although the seven homers the Vols pounded out in their decisive contest against Evansville removed any suspense. As mentioned, the ball doesn’t generally fly out of this stadium as readily, and likely Florida State starter Jamie Arnold (11-3, 2.77 ERA) is quite capable of silencing Tennessee’s bats. The Vols have enough arms to win in this setting but might not have a true staff ace, so they’ll have to be opportunistic to avoid having to come through the losers’ bracket.\n\nNo. 2 Kentucky (45-14) vs. No. 10 North Carolina State (38-21)\n\nTIME/TV: Saturday, 2 p.m. ET, ESPN\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, the Wildcats have never been here. The Wolfpack have, and they’ll be eager to erase the memory of how their last trip to Omaha ended when COVID-19 positives sent them home one win from the championship series. N.C. State fans are enjoying quite a ride this spring after both the men’s and women’s basketball teams reached the Final Four. The top end of the Wolfpack batting order, featuring Alec Makarewicz and Garrett Pennington, is as formidable as any. But Kentucky does a lot of things well, and its winning formula relying on speed and defense could serve well at this venue. The Wildcats lead the CWS field with 118 stolen bases, led by Emilien Pitre (25) and Ryan Waldschmidt (24).\n\nNo. 3 Texas A&M (49-13) vs. Florida (34-28)\n\nTIME/TV: Saturday, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN\n\nThe Gators, the lone unseeded squad to make it this far, exemplify that old adage about getting hot at the right time. Florida did take two of three from the Aggies in SEC play, but that series was in Gainesville and was played in early March before the Gators’ mid-season swoon that nearly kept them out of the NCAA tournament altogether. Florida has undeniable talent, and it goes way deeper than two-way standout Jac Caglione, but their lack of pitching consistency will make them underdogs in Omaha. A&M, however, arrives in town shorthanded from its super regional sweep of Oregon. Slugging outfielder Braden Montgomery sustained a season-ending ankle fracture in a home-plate collision, and game two starting pitcher Shane Sdao will also not be available. The Aggies are still capable of scoring a lot of runs and might have to this week to get through its loaded half of the bracket.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/baseball/2024/06/19/kentucky-florida-live-updates-results-highlights-college-world-series/74141365007/", "title": "2024 College World Series highlights: Florida's Caglianone sets ...", "text": "The 2024 College World Series continued early Wednesday with a delayed matchup in Bracket 2. The Florida Gators and Kentucky Wildcats were moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning in Omaha. The winner earned a second game of the day against Texas A&M.\n\nIt was a close game for roughly 35 pitches.\n\nFlorida tallied seven runs in the first inning to power its second-highest scoring effort of the NCAA baseball tournament. Star first baseman Jac Caglianone moved to the top of the order for the first time this season and the Gators reaped the benefits.\n\nBrody Donay's grand slam made it 7-1 after the first frame. Another two runs in the third and five in the fifth stopped any comeback hopes for the Wildcats. Caglianone put an exclamation point on the effort with a solo home run in the sixth inning to become the Gators' all-time home runs leader with 75.\n\nAs prolific as Donay, Caglianone, and Luke Heyman were at the plate for Florida, sophomore pitcher Pierce Coppola was equally productive at the mound. He earned his first win of his career with a season-high nine strikeouts over five innings and kept Florida's run going.\n\nHow does the College World Series work?Explaining college baseball's CWS format\n\nKentucky vs. Florida highlights\n\nKentucky got on the board first with a single to right center by Nick Lopez to plate leadoff hitter Ryan Waldschmidt.\n\nThat proved to be the only lead Kentucky held all day.\n\nColby Shelton's double deep to right field brought Caglianone home to tie the game 1-1. Minutes later, Heyman's single and an error by Kentucky brought both Cade Kurland and Shelton home for a 3-1 lead.\n\nDonay turned up the scoring with his grand slam to give Florida an insurmountable lead.\n\nThe Wildcats' Emilien Pitre went yard as well for a two-run homer in the fifth. It proved to be the final runs of the year for Kentucky facing a 9-4 deficit.\n\nFlorida responded with five runs in the bottom of the fifth to end any comeback hopes. One frame later, Caglianone earned himself a spot in Florida Gators baseball history.\n\nWhen does Florida play again?\n\nThe Gators get just a little rest after their dominant win in Omaha. They take on Texas A&M at 7 p.m. ET facing elimination once again.\n\nThese two teams faced off in the College World Series already in the first game of Bracket 2. The Aggies won that one 3-2. Florida won the teams' regular season series 2-1 in Gainesville.\n\nGators clinch 15-4 win\n\nAfter two strikeouts by Philpott to open the ninth, a fly out to center field officially ends the Wildcats' season as Florida earns another win. The Gators will face Texas A&M tonight in Omaha.\n\nPhilpott comes in to finish things off for Florida\n\nRight hander Alex Philpott entered the game for the final out of the eighth inning and continues in the ninth for the Gators holding a 15-4 lead.\n\nGators shut out in the eighth\n\nFor the first time all game, Kentucky's held Florida scoreless for consecutive innings. Cleaver earned two strikeouts but the deficit still remains 15-4 heading into the ninth.\n\nAnother pitching change for Kentucky\n\nThe Wildcats continue to go through the bullpen by bringing in freshman lefty Ben Cleaver for the eighth inning.\n\nKentucky holds Florida scoreless in the seventh\n\nThe lineup changes paid off in the short term as Smith struck out his first two batters. Ashton Wilson's fly to centerfield earned the third and final out of the frame. Florida leads 15-4 entering the eighth inning.\n\nWildcats make lineup changes\n\nEntering the seventh inning, Kentucky brought in Travis Smith to the mound, the Wildcats' seventh pitcher of the game. The Wildcats also moved Mitchell Daly to from third base to shortstop, Patrick Herrera to third base, and Eli Small to right field.\n\nFlorida holds Kentucky scoreless in the seventh\n\nClemente struck out Emilien Pitre to retire the Wildcats with a runner on. Florida leads 15-4 in the bottom of the seventh.\n\nCaglianone sets Florida home run record\n\nOn his seventh pitch from Hummel, Caglianone fired a ball deep to right field for a solo home run. That shot makes him the Gators' all-time home runs leader as Florida takes a 15-4 lead.\n\nHummel enters the game for Kentucky\n\nThe Wildcats brought in their sixth pitcher of the game in right hander Johnny Hummel.\n\nFlorida makes first pitching change\n\nPierce Coppola set a season high with nine strikeouts through five innings. He's done for the game as righty Jake Clemente enters the game in the top of the sixth for Florida and strikes out his first batter.\n\nFlorida scores another two to close the fifth inning\n\nAshton Wilson singled to right field to score Heyman and Colby Shelton to extend the Gators' lead. Dale Thomas struck out to end the inning as Florida leads 14-4.\n\nKentucky makes a second pitching change of the inning, Florida immediately scores\n\nAfter 21 pitches from Jackson Nove, the Wildcats brought in righty Ryan Hagenow. Florida's Luke Heyman knocked his third pitch to left field to score Tyler Shelnut.\n\nCaglianone gets home on bunt single\n\nThe Gators' top hitter stole third after reaching second on a wild pitch. Tyler Shelnut's bunt single brought him home to make it 11-4 Gators.\n\nAnother pitching change for Kentucky\n\nFollowing Donay's home run, right hander Jackson Nove took to the mound for the Wildcats. He's 4-0 over the last two years in Lexington with a 5.60 career ERA for Kentucky.\n\nGators respond with another HR\n\nIt took Brody Donay just three pitches to hit his second home run of the game, a solo shot to left field. Gators lead 10-4.\n\nCoppola ends inning with strikeout No. 9\n\nAfter Pitre's home run, Coppola struck out Kentucky's Ryan Nicholson for his ninth in the game, a season-high. Florida leads 9-4 heading into the bottom of the fifth.\n\nEmilien Pitre goes yard for Kentucky\n\nThe Wildcats' second baseman hit a ball deep to center field for a home run to plate Ryan Waldschmidt and close the deficit to 9-4 with two outs in the fifth.\n\nCoppola continues his hot hand in the fifth\n\nFlorida's starter has notched four strikeouts in a row over the fourth and fifth innings to tie his season-high with eight strikeouts in a game.\n\nKentucky keeps Florida off the board to close the fourth\n\nHogan earned two more strikeouts against Wilson and Heyman before the Wildcats retired the Gators' offense. Florida's lead remains 9-2.\n\nCoppola earns strikeout No. 6\n\nFlorida's starting pitcher has held strong through four innings. Coppola struck out Kentucky's Devin Burkes and Nolan McCarthy (his sixth on the day) to retire the Wildcats' offense and bring out the Gators with a 9-2 lead.\n\nIs there a College World Series run rule?\n\nThere is no mercy or run rule in the College World Series. The Women's College World Series does - a team up by eight or more runs after five innings can win by mercy rule - but that's not the case for college baseball.\n\nKentucky gets on the board again\n\nLopez singled to center field for his second hit of the day. Emilien Pitre scored from second to close the deficit slightly to 9-2.\n\nKentucky closes out third inning\n\nO'Brien struck out Tyler Shelnut to bring the third to an end with two on for the Gators.

Kentucky challenged the ruling of a double play but it was upheld. Florida leads 7-1 with the Gators offense set to hit the plate.\n\nKentucky holds Florida scoreless in the second\n\nO'Brien rebounded from a rough first inning to strike out Florida's first two batters. Emilien Pitre caught a fly to centerfield to end the second frame. Florida still leads 7-1.\n\nFlorida's Coppola dealing in the second inning\n\nAfter Florida's scoring barrage in the first inning, Pierce Coppola struck out Kentucky's first two batters in 10 pitches. A ground out by Nolan McCarthy made it three outs as Kentucky failed to make any impact on the 7-1 deficit.\n\nNightmare first inning ends for Kentucky\n\nThe Wildcats finally get a third out in the first to stop Florida's scoring spree. Gators lead 7-1.\n\nFlorida's Brody Donay piles it on with a Grand Slam\n\nGators' third baseman Dale Thomas singled to right field to reach first and load the bases. One pitch later, Brody Donay homered to right field and score Heyman, Wilson, and Thomas to make it a 7-1 lead for Florida.\n\nKentucky making a pitching change\n\nAfter Niman hit Ashton Wilson on a 3-2 count to put the rightfielder at first, the Wildcats are bringing in righty Cameron O'Brien to the mound in the first.

It won't be easy: Florida is 7-1 in elimination games the past two seasons. But this year's batch of Wildcats have found ways to win in nearly every fashion imaginable. They'll outlast Caglianone and the Gators in a slugfest to set up a rematch with the Aggies.\"\n\nThe Gainesville Sun: Florida 5, Kentucky 3\n\nKevin Brockway writes: \"Florida has played loose and relaxed when facing elimination and expect that trend to continue [Wednesday morning].

They powered through the Regional and Super Regional rounds with a 5-0 record, outscoring teams 34-11. The Wildcats rely on an aggressive offense that steals more bases than almost any other team in the country. Top pitcher Trey Pooser is one of the better pitchers in the College World Series.\n\nIn the first game of the College World Series against NC State, a clutch home run by Ryan Nicholson tied the game 4-4 in the bottom of the ninth inning. One frame later, Mitchell Daly homered to seal the Wildcats' win and Johnny Hummel earned the win from the mound with a scoreless 10th inning.\n\nTwo days later, the Wildcats squared off against SEC foe Texas A&M and suffered their first loss of the tournament. Pitcher Mason Moore gave up four runs in the sixth inning before getting pulled. A Nicholson homer in the ninth prevented a shutout as the Wildcats fell 5-1.\n\nHow did Florida get here?\n\nThe defending College World Series runners-up, the Gators entered the College World Series with the longest odds to win the title. They were a No. 3 seed in the Stillwater Regional after one of the toughest regular season schedules. They've battled back from a loss in each round of the tournament. In the Regional, Florida lost to Oklahoma State 7-1 before beating Nebraska and then Oklahoma State twice. In the Super Regional, the Gators beat Clemson in Clemson twice in a row to secure their spot in the College World Series. They have the best player left in the tournament in likely top-15 pick Jac Caglianone.\n\nIn their first game in Omaha, Florida took on Texas A&M and couldn't stop an early barrage of Aggie runs. By the end of the third inning, the Gators were down 3-0. Two runs in the seventh made it 3-2 by the end of the game.\n\nThe second game was another one-run outcome the other way. The Gators took on NC State and used a four-run second inning - highlighted by a three-run homer by Caglianone - to build an early 4-1 lead. Florida held NC State scoreless over the final four frames to seal a 5-4 win.\n\nKentucky Wildcats Lineup\n\nFlorida Gators lineup\n\nKentucky players to watch\n\n1B Ryan Nicholson: The Wildcats' transfer from Cincinnati is thriving in Lexington. He posted career-highs in batting average (0.308), on-base percentage (0.410), slugging (0.692), and OPS (1.102) with at least 20 plate appearances. In the College World Series, he's 5-for-8 from the plate with two home runs and two RBI.\n\nRHP Johnny Hummel: Kentucky's expected to start fifth-year senior Dominic Niman, who gave up six runs on seven hits in four innings against the Gators in a 10-1 loss to Florida on May 11. Niman may struggle and Kentucky could rely on its bullpen in a must-win game. Hummel came through in the clutch against NC State, throwing 18 strikes on 30 pitches and holding the Wolfpack scoreless.\n\nFlorida players to watch\n\n1B/LHP Jac Caglianone: It's hard to run out of superlatives for the Gators' top hitter. He broke the program record for single-season home runs (34) with his homer against NC State. He was top-three in the SEC in most statistics from the plate and has a 4.76 ERA from the mound through 73.2 innings this season.\n\nCF Michael Robertson: Behind Caglianone, Robertson's been the most consistent hitter for the Gators in the College World Series. He's 4-for-8 from the plate with one RBI and one run scored. If he can get it going from the plate early for the Gators, Florida could quickly build a lead.\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Here's when you can see another (but it won't be as good)\n\n'Eclipse warriors' stay until the end\n\nWhile many people made a quick exodus after totality, Sara and Jennifer Glueckert decided to stay till the eclipse ended. The mother and daughter are “eclipse warriors,” said Sara, 69, who came from South Bend to join Jennifer, who lives in Indianapolis.\n\nThough they watched the 2017 eclipse, this experience was their first time witnessing totality. Jennifer described the atmosphere at 3:06 p.m. almost as a peaceful evening.\n\n“It was really cool how there was cheering and silence together,” Jennifer, 36, said.\n\nThey found the ring around the moon especially spectacular.\n\n“It’s just something that I’ll remember forever,” Sara said.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nIMS spectators take in 'indescribable' moments of totality\n\nUnlike other folks who traveled to Indianapolis for Monday's total solar eclipse, the Anderson family made the decision to drive from North Carolina to Indianapolis to see the spectacle on Saturday night. They left on Sunday.\n\nRobert Anderson, 52, said his friends had seen the last total solar eclipse in 2017. He didn’t want to miss this one.\n\nRob and his wife, Lori Anderson, and their son, Josh, all agreed that what they saw Monday could never be compared to a partial solar eclipse. Lori Anderson said the over three-minute experience was “indescribable.”\n\n“Totality is just completely different,” she said.\n\nJoe Wojtulewicz, 53, traveled from his home in Chicago to Carbondale, Illinois, for the last solar eclipse in 2017. He knew then he wasn’t going to miss this one, especially when it was passing by even closer.\n\n“It was incredible, so I’d been planning this for years,” he said.\n\nBut this year’s eclipse in Indianapolis was even better, Wojtulewicz exclaimed. He said the ring around the sun was even brighter this time, and the visible solar prominence was unlike anything he’d seen before.\n\n“I was getting emotional,” Wojtulewicz said, “this sort of thing just doesn’t happen every day.”\n\n— Jade Thomas and Sarah Bowman\n\n'An eerie twilight' fell over Indianapolis Motor Speedway\n\nAndrew Nencka, 42, absolutely loved science growing up — “astronomy in particular as a kid was my thing.” He remembers building a big telescope with his dad when he was younger that was nearly a foot wide and 6 feet long.\n\nThat’s actually what inspired him to go into physics as an adult, and for he and his wife to travel four hours from Franklin, Wisconsin, to take in the eclipse from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. This is their first time seeing a total eclipse.\n\nHe brought a different telescope this time, this one a little smaller but just as powerful. They enjoyed having others come look through the telescope, equipped with a special filter, especially children.\n\nNencka and his wife Jennifer wished their two children, ages 14 and 12, were with them. But unfortunately they had state testing this week and couldn’t make the trip.\n\nWhen the eclipse neared totality, the couple looked at each other with anticipation.\n\n“It’s an eerie twilight light,” Jennifer Nencka said. “Like the calm before the storm.”\n\nAs the Speedway fell into darkness, she said she could see why ancient civilizations were terrified of the eclipse. But today, she was just in awe.\n\n— Sarah Bowman\n\nHow Indy Zoo's elephants, sea lions and gibbons — and the humans around them — reacted to the eclipse\n\nJust as the moon began to eclipse the sun, Aria was helping her dad Steve Crutchfield put together a special telescope made specially for viewing the eclipse. The mini telescope was small enough to carry around with them at the zoo.\n\nSteve bought the telescope in 2017 with his wife and drove down to Nashville for the previous eclipse.\n\nSteve, Aria and Mary Crutchfield flew in from Chicago to witness the eclipse but weren’t originally going to watch it at the zoo. Their original plan was to watch it at the history museum, but there wasn’t enough parking so they headed to the zoo.\n\nAs the Cruthfields scoped out the eclipse, zookeepers began feeding sea lions near the zoo’s entrance. They usually eat a little later and would normally be asleep during the eclipse, but the keepers wanted to see how they might react when the moon covers the sun, so the sea lions got an early dinner so they stay awake.\n\nMinutes before totality, lines at the zoo’s attractions and vendors cleared as visitors found an open spot on the ground to lay back and watch the eclipse. As the visitors settled in, some of the zoo’s animals wound up.\n\nGibbons started singing again, and the sea lions began vocalizing. During totality, however, the animals settled down into the darkness. Flamingoes huddled together and chimpanzees stopped travelling along the newly built paths.\n\nVisitors said the elephants, playful just before totality, stood in utter stillness during the entirety of the darkness.\n\nShawn Smith drove up from Kentucky with Ashley Monarch and her two children to see the eclipse at the Indy Zoo. They showed up at 8 a.m. and braved the crowds, finding a seat near the sea lions.\n\nSmith had an old cell phone set up to take a time-lapse video of the eclipse.\n\nAs the moon passed the sun and daylight shone again, the lines for Dip n’ Dots and exhibits across the zoo started filling up again.\n\n— Karl Schneider\n\nAs totality passes over Indianapolis, 'It just makes me think about what God is capable of'\n\nPamela Vaden, 74, stayed and watched the eclipse pass long after many other spectators left Crispus Attucks High School.\n\nAlumni and community members gathered at the school’s museum on Monday to witness the eclipse but also participate in a spiritual ceremony with references to historic African celebration traditions.Vaden graduated from Crispus Attucks in 1967 and said she felt like she was in the presence of God when the eclipse reached totality.“It’s amazing,” Vaden told IndyStar. “It just makes me think about what God is capable of and makes me so excited.”\n\nJanet Tate Anderson graduated from Crispus Attucks High School in 1970 and still loves to volunteer at the school and remains deeply connected to the community.At Monday’s eclipse celebration at the Crispus Attucks museum, Anderson and fellow alumni celebrated the spiritual passing of former loved ones by performing traditional African drum celebrations and a “pouring of libations.\"Anderson said Robert Chester, the curator of the Crispus Attucks museum, does great work at celebrating and educating people on Indianapolis’ African American community and history. “(Chester) always makes it so it’s relatable to our history,” Anderson told IndyStar.\n\n— Caroline Beck\n\nTourists, Hoosiers and Buddhist monks experience totality together in Bloomington\n\nMinutes before the eclipse, Aaron Schexneider, 28, and Sarah Clark, 28, sit in the shade. Tucked under a cornflower blue blanket in Clark’s lap is Dominic, just 15 days old.\n\nAside from the occasional gurgle or a tiny finger poking from underneath the blanket, Dominic’s presence goes unnoticed. Clark and Schexneider expected Dominic would be born shortly before the eclipse, but that didn’t stop the Louisville couple from planning the trip. Just keep the baby’s eyes protected and we’re good, they said.\n\nWhen darkness settles on the young family shortly after 3, Schexneider takes Dominic from Clark’s lap so he can witness the false night before it vanishes. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, the kind you don’t soon forget — unless you’re Dominic, of course.\n\nAs mid-afternoon becomes night, distant fireworks echo over Bloomington. Across the lawn of the Tibetan Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center, jaw-dropped spectators try to make sense of what they’re watching.\n\n“Dude, are you serious?”\n\n“That’s actually insane.”\n\n“People are setting off fireworks?”\n\nA jumbled mix of delight and awe grips the audience. Buddhist monks smile gleefully and hold eclipse glasses to their eyes, children gasp audibly and dogs whip their heads around in confusion.\n\nIn the nearby woods a robin sings, 14 hours ahead of schedule. “If it had gone on longer, we might have heard some owls,” Indiana Forest Alliance executive director Jeff Stant said.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the night relinquishes its grasp and sunlight sweeps back in like a little wave of sea foam upon the sand. Families gather up chairs and towels, discussing what they just saw.\n\nHalf an hour later the trees still ring with bird calls. Evidently, the humans aren’t the only ones wanting to debrief.\n\n— Bradley Hohulin\n\nPurdue basketball fans in Arizona watch eclipse ahead of national title game\n\nAs we said earlier, big day for Purdue. Ahead of tonight's men's basketball national championship game against UConn, Purdue fans gathered outside State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, to watch the eclipse.\n\nTotality in Indianapolis\n\nAs the eclipse crept closer toward totality, a few of us at IndyStar stood at Meridian and Georgia streets in anticipation.\n\nThe temperature cooled. The white lights crisscrossing Meridian Street flickered on. What few cars were on the street parked and idled. And in the first moments of totality, awe-struck gasps and cheers filled the otherwise quiet streets.\n\nWe could hear them from the groups sparsely populating Georgia Street and the crowd gathered blocks away at Monument Circle. For a few minutes, everyone's eyes turned upward, faces unobscured by eclipse glasses, to marvel at the rare event. Totality hasn't passed over Indianapolis since 1205, and it won't pass over the contiguous U.S. for another two decades.\n\nAfter about four minutes of near-silence, spectators once again donned their eclipse glasses and Indianapolis was blanketed in the sun's clear, bright light.\n\n— Holly Hays\n\nIt's almost time!\n\nWe are minutes away from totality in Indianapolis, and the world outside our downtown newsroom is growing darker by the minute. We expect totality will last from about 3:06 to 3:09 p.m.\n\nA reminder: You can view the eclipse directly without proper eye protection only when the moon completely obscures the sun's rays. As soon as you see even a little bit of the sun, immediately put your eclipse glasses back on.\n\nMore:Are your solar eclipse glasses safe? Here are three easy ways to check\n\nThe eclipse is well underway over Central Indiana now\n\nA tip a seasoned eclipse-viewer gave IndyStar's Sarah Bowman: Use an extra pair of eclipse glasses to put over the lens of your phone's camera to take a picture of the sun.\n\nVisitors 'enlightened' by Buddhist puja ceremony in Bloomington as eclipse begins\n\nHands clasped and heads bowed, four monks begin to pray.\n\nShaved heads glisten with sweat under the afternoon sun. The chanting, a blend of Chinese and South Asian languages, drifts between arrhythmically monotone and vaguely musical.\n\n“I go for refuge until I am enlightened,” they recite.\n\nThis puja, or act of worship, calls to the Medicine Buddha for inner strength and planetary healing. A smattering of the visitors gathered around the dome-shaped shrine known as a stupa do their best to follow the monks, tripping over the transliterated payer in low groans. But more and more, the people sitting on the prickly lawn abandon the booklets, reaching instead for cheap cardboard glasses.\n\nThe moon has just begun its eclipse, now barely a blemish on the bright orange egg yolk of the sun. When darkness falls on the monks, they will pause their prayer.\n\nUntil then, as visitors from around America crane their necks in mounting curiosity, their heads remain bowed.\n\n— Bradley Hohulin\n\nWatch the solar eclipse live\n\nThe eclipse has officially started here in Central Indiana. Watch it on IndyStar's livestream, embedded in this article or on our YouTube page.\n\nTotality is expected to happen in Indianapolis from 3:06 to 3:09 p.m., and the eclipse is expected to end by 4:23 p.m.\n\nMore:Watch the total solar eclipse live here as it passes over the US\n\nVisitors say 'we had to go' to IMS to watch the eclipse\n\nJustin He, 25, and Maxwell Yeo, 29, said they were thinking about coming to the eclipse when they learned the next one on mainland U.S. wouldn’t be for another 20 years.\n\n“So then we realized we had to go,” He said.\n\nThe two are videographers, and they were inspired by an eclipse picture they saw on Instagram to make the trip to Indianapolis to see if they could get some epic shots themselves.\n\nThey traveled down from Chicago with friend Michael Um, 27, who also is a photographer. They got help from YouTube for tips and tricks on how to best capture the eclipse. That included buying a filter for their camera lenses.\n\n“We need sunglasses for our cameras, too, basically,” Um said.\n\n— Sarah Bowman\n\nHonestly, just a big day for Purdue\n\nIndiana interstate traffic moving smoothly, officials say, but rest stops are filling up\n\nThe state Department of Transportation announced one rest stop, along I-74 near Veedersburg, northwest of Indianapolis, is closed.\n\nLook for this cool detail as the partial eclipse starts\n\nThe telescopes outside Butler University have earned diva status today: Each has its own name, courtesy of the students.\n\nAmong them are Tiny Tim; Spud; Bill Nye the telescope guy; and Laika, named after the stray dog who was launched into space on a Soviet ship in 1957.\n\nAbout eight of the small telescopes were placed around the Holcomb Observatory & Planetarium on Monday. Each has a 6- to 8-inch diameter mirror and is outfitted with a solar filter that blocks 99.999% of the sun’s light, making it safe to view, said Aarran Shaw, associate director of the observatory.\n\nOne exciting thing to watch for will be darker patches, called sun spots. “What that actually is, is a much cooler region of the sun,\" Shaw said.\n\nThe spots are 6,500 degrees Fahrenheit to the sun’s 10,000 degrees, Shaw said.\n\n“As the moon starts to move across the surface of the sun, you might actually see some of those sun spots disappear as the moon covers them,” he said.\n\n— Domenica Bongiovanni\n\nIndianapolis Zoo eclipse watchers excited to see how animals react to eclipse\n\nBy lunchtime, the zoo was humming with crowds from all over the U.S.\n\nThe Indy Zoo’s gates have been busy, with more than 3,300 visitors passing through by just before 1 p.m.\n\nKathy, Autumn and Alyssa Rettke, along with Stephen Plekan, have been on a bit of a journey. They traveled from Green Bay to visit the Indiana Dunes, they then headed into Ohio’s Cuyahoga Valley National Park and made a stop in Columbus before ending up at the Indy Zoo for the eclipse.\n\n“We were looking for places we could be outside, and we like zoos,” Kathy said.\n\nAlex Kopytko is visiting Indy from San Diego, but first flew in to Chicago to meet up with his parents Therese and Ed.\n\nThe Kopytkos were walking through the kangaroo exhibit, where the marsupials roam free.\n\n“We wanted to see how the animals react to the eclipse,” Therese said, but the group was still not sure where they’d end up during totality.\n\n— Karl Schneider\n\nIndianapolis weather: Clouds may arrive from southwest just in time for eclipse\n\nThe eclipse begins in just over an hour (totality isn't for another few hours, don't worry), and meteorologists at the National Weather Service in Indianapolis are keeping an eye on some clouds that are moving over Missouri that could move our way by the afternoon.\n\nThe incoming clouds are cirrus clouds, which are typically higher and appear as the more thin, wispy-looking clouds in the sky. The clouds are estimated to arrive in Central Indiana between 1 and 2 p.m.\n\nRead more:Clouds have been spotted moving toward Indy before the eclipse. Will they block the view?\n\n— Katie Wiseman\n\nExtending spring break for an event 'they can't read about in textbooks'\n\nTory Patrick, 41, is hoping to give her four children a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity.\n\nPatrick and her family are from Granger, Indiana, near South Bend, where they are expected to have 97% totality, but it’s not the same as total coverage, she said.\n\n“So they will be getting the full experience that they can’t read about in textbooks,” Patrick said. Patrick and her sister Cally Gannon, 39 from Cincinnati, met in Indianapolis to view the eclipse from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. They camped outside IMS over the weekend ahead of the event. Sunday afternoon they saw a double rainbow over the speedway Pagoda.\n\nRyan Harper, 30, knows today is special.\n\nHe’s been planning for today’s solar eclipse since 2015. He bought glasses for his girlfriend, Madison Williams, and younger brother and father, Zachary and Jeff Harper, last year. He bought tickets for the IMS event with NASA and Purdue months ago.\n\n“We’re right in totality,” he said. “This sometimes doesn’t happen in people’s lifetimes.”\n\nThe total solar eclipse is nothing new for Ben Smith, and his mother, Annette Smith, but it’s just as magical. They’re originally from Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and drove to Louisville in 2017, which was in the path of totality.\n\nBen Smith said his special interest is space and that today is a reminder that humans are “just a sentient speck in the middle of the universe.”\n\nFor him, it’s 100% totality, or bust. “That 1% we're going to get here today toward 100% makes a world of difference,” Annette Smith said. “It is the purest, clearest, whitest light.”\n\n— Sarah Bowman and Jade Thomas\n\nWhat to do with used eclipse glasses\n\nYou went through all the trouble of hunting them down, now you have to figure out what to do with them after the big day. Good news: you've got a few options.\n\nRead more:The 2024 total solar eclipse is here. Donate, recycle, or keep your viewing glasses after.\n\nFamilies flock to the Indianapolis Zoo to watch the eclipse\n\nParking lots were filling up at the Indianapolis Zoo at 10 a.m. as visitors flocked the entrance. Chimps travelled along their new highway – a series of walkways about 20 feet above the ground and snaking about a quarter mile between different buildings.\n\nCrowds are trending above normal, a zoo staffer said, and about 1,000 passed through the gates by 10.\n\nThe macaws close to the parking lot were raucous and talkative and the gibbons further in the park were loudly singing.\n\nJulia Romashko drove in from Fox Lake, near Chicago, last night with her children Sawyer and Wren. The family visited the Children’s Museum yesterday but decided to spend the day at the zoo to witness the eclipse.\n\nSawyer loves red pandas, and Romashko said he’s excited to see the one at the Indy Zoo.\n\nThe family plans of staying at the zoo through the eclipse and then will head back toward Chicago this evening.\n\nZookeepers are excited to see how the animals react during the eclipse. Will the primates vocalize and try to take a peek at the eclipse? Will the birds sing?\n\n— Karl Schneider\n\nExperiencing the total solar eclipse in the woods of Southern Indiana\n\nThe woods surrounding the Tibetan Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center in Bloomington are quiet this morning, or at least much quieter than they will be in the summer. Hopefully the next eclipse visible from Indiana will come in May, Indiana Forest Alliance executive director Jeff Stant said.\n\nStant, now in his 12th year as director, wonders whether the sudden disruption of the light-dark cycle will make the forest animals behave as if it were nighttime. Listen for the wagon-wheel squeak of the warblers or the distant croak of the spring peepers, he said. The warblers have flown north from Central America, putting them squarely among the most ambitious eclipse travelers.\n\nWhile humans tend to try to shape nature, Stant pointed out that we are merely a dash in a massive melting pot of biodiversity. He hopes the visitors at the Cultural Center can appreciate the eclipse as a rare phenomenon over which they have no control. “It reminds us we’re part of something much bigger than us,” he said.\n\n— Bradley Hohulin\n\nA Buddhist puja ceremony and more:Explore Yellowwood State Forest during the solar eclipse\n\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway's Doug Boles is everywhere\n\nIMS President Doug Boles, who is rarely, if ever, seen in public wearing anything other than a suit and tie (I've always thought that was a CHOICE on blisteringly hot race days, but he is committed), is apparently handing out stickers featuring his signature look, complete with lapel pins of the state of Indiana and the iconic wing and wheel logo. An objectively hilarious bit.\n\nI didn't have Doug Boles merch on my eclipse day bingo card, but the man is an Indy icon, so why not?\n\nAnd just look at how excited he is to celebrate with this couple, who got engaged at IMS today:\n\n— Holly Hays\n\nToday's New York Times crossword clues\n\nIf you haven't made your playlist for the eclipse yet, today's New York Times crossword can help you.

{"question_id": "20241025_24", "search_time": "2024/10/26/02:52", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/perspectives/oxfam-federal-minimum-wage/index.html", "title": "The federal minimum wage hasn't risen in almost 13 years and US ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Gina Cummings is vice president of Advocacy, Alliances and Policy for Oxfam America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\n\nWith inflation hitting a 40-year high in the United States, working families are swimming ever faster in the effort to stay afloat. But the water just keeps rising, as mostly stagnant wages are also rapidly losing value.\n\nThe federal minimum wage has lost at least 21% of its value since Congress last raised it in 2009. This has become an emergency for the millions of workers who earn less than $15 an hour and are finding it impossible to trim other costs enough to still be able to put food on the table and fill the tank.\n\nAccording to new research released by Oxfam, roughly 32% of workers in the US earn less than $15 an hour. Nearly 52 million people are trying to make it on less than $31,200 a year, or $2,600 a month before taxes.\n\nThis is not right, nor is it viable — not for working families, for the economy or for communities. We can’t keep an economy going if people can’t pay the rent and drive to work. That’s why Congress must pass the Raise the Wage Act of 2021, which would gradually increase the wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 by 2025 and would tie increases to median wage growth over time.\n\nIn truth, this a civil rights crisis, as the people most impacted by low wages are historically marginalized populations: women and people of color. Not only did these workers get hit harder, longer and deeper by the pandemic, they’ve been watching their wages buy less each day, as they account for a vastly disproportionate share of the low-wage workforce — 40% of women versus 25% of men. Half of all women of color earn under $15 per hour versus a quarter of all men. And while 26% of White workers earn less than $15 an hour, 46% of Hispanic/Latinx workers and 47% of Black workers earn less than $15 per hour. These are the people suffering the worst sticker shock at the grocery store and the gas pump, choosing between rent and utilities.\n\nWhat’s more, federal law still allows US employers to pay subminimum wages to nearly a million workers. The Raise the Wage Act would fix that, prohibiting anyone from being paid less than the federal minimum wage.\n\nThis is a solution that is long overdue, as it has been almost 13 years since the wage was increased. It’s also common sense: The pandemic filled the coffers of corporations, which made record profits, and created many more millionaires and billionaires. Why are we refusing to mandate that the people who do the work, who are responsible for productivity and profitability, get a slightly fairer share of the rewards?\n\nPeople are hurting not because prices are rising, but because we have built a system that enables employers to exploit workers so a few can cash in.

Bobby Scott said, D-Va., chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee.\n\nAt the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden remains “firmly committed” to raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\n“He believes any American who is working a full-time job trying to make ends meet should not be at the poverty level, and it's important to him that the minimum wage is raised,” Psaki said.\n\nSome bipartisan concern over raising the minimum wage\n\nBiden advocated for raising the minimum wage during last year’s presidential campaign and has proposed boosting the hourly rate to $15 as part of his COVID-19-relief package.\n\nCongressional Republicans and others, however, have raised concerns about raising the minimum wage. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a crucial swing vote in the Senate, also has said he opposes a $15 minimum wage, raising doubts about whether it can be increased through Biden's COVID-19-relief plan.\n\nBiden conceded late last week that the minimum wage proposal is unlikely to survive as part of his COVID-19 package.\n\n“Apparently, that’s not going to occur,” he said in an interview with \"CBS Evening News With Norah O’Donnell.\"\n\nBut Biden also told O’Donnell he is prepared to negotiate a separate proposal to boost the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nSounding the alarm:Joe Biden calls women out of work, kids out of school a 'national emergency'\n\nIn its study, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that as many as 27 million Americans would see their pay increase if the minimum wage is raised to $15 an hour. Cumulative pay for those workers would jump by as much as $509 billion over the next 10 years, the report said.\n\nBut the pay increase also would mean increased labor costs for companies, the report said. Employers would pass some of those increased costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices, which could mean a decline in sales and services, the study said.\n\nIn the end, many companies will reduce their workforce or hire less, resulting in 1.4 million fewer jobs, the report said. Young, less educated people would account for a disproportionate share of the job reductions, the report concluded.\n\nRaising the minimum wage to $15 per hour also would balloon the federal deficit to $54 billion over the next decade, the report said.\n\nThe CBO’s projection of a 1.4 million decline in employment is based on an average estimate of the studies it reviewed. But Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, says the CBO gave equal weight to all the studies it assessed and should have placed more value on higher-quality studies.\n\n“The weight of the evidence finds a small to no employment effect,” she told reporters on a conference call.\n\nMichael Reich, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley, told reporters a minimum wage increase would have a small effect only on restaurant prices and it would not cause profits to fall.\n\nHow a raise could affect some government services\n\nCBO also found the minimum wage measure would increase federal revenue because low-paid workers would earn more and pay more taxes but that would be more than offset by higher government costs. For example, federal spending on Medicaid would rise because workers providing health care services would earn more and people who lose their jobs because of the minimum wage hike would become eligible for Medicaid.\n\nSocial Security outlays would increase because a higher-paid workforce would receive more benefits on average. And people who lose their jobs would file for Social Security earlier than otherwise.\n\nOther programs would become less costly, CBO says. Spending on food stamps and child nutrition programs would decline as a higher minimum wage reduces the number of low-income households receiving benefits and the average amount they receive.\n\nReich, however, says the CBO analysis doesn’t account for certain increased government revenue. Enticed by higher pay, many older Americans would work longer, saving $12.2 billion in Social Security fund costs.\n\nEmployer advocates, however, say the CBO study underscores their concerns.\n\n“The nonpartisan CBO confirms what we already know from economic research and real-world experience,” says Michael Saltsman, managing director of the Employment Policies Institute, the restaurant industry-financed group. “A $15 minimum wage is a terrible idea that will put economic recovery further out of reach for thousands of employers and employees.”\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who supports a higher minimum wage, challenged the report’s findings.\n\n“I find it hard to understand how the CBO concluded that raising the minimum wage would increase the deficit by $54 billion,” Sanders. “Two years ago, CBO concluded that a $15 minimum wage would increase the deficit by less than $1 million over 10 years.”\n\nFrances Holmes of Fight for $15, an advocacy group that supports raising the minimum wage, said the report underscores the need to boost workers’ pay.\n\n“Essential workers across the country are facing a crisis,” Holmes said. “We risk our lives at work every day during a pandemic because we can’t afford to miss a paycheck. … We don’t need excuses from our nation’s leaders. We need relief.”\n\nContributing: Nicholas Wu\n\nBarreling ahead:Days after talks with GOP senators, Biden signals he'll move ahead without them on COVID-19 relief bill", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/02/what-is-wisconsins-minimum-wage-and-why-hasnt-it-changed/72388847007/", "title": "What is Wisconsin's minimum wage, and why hasn't it changed?", "text": "About half of all states in the U.S. increased their minimum wage at the start of the year, or will do so later in 2024.\n\nWisconsin isn't one of them — it remains one of 20 states that'll keep its minimum wage at $7.25, the federal minimum.\n\nDespite lawmakers' attempts to find solutions to workforce shortages, and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers declaring 2024 the \"Year of the Worker,\" historically there hasn't been much momentum in the state to increase the minimum wage.\n\nBut why is that? How does Wisconsin's minimum wage compare to other states? How has the amount been affected by inflation?\n\nHere's a guide to some of those most-asked questions:\n\nWhat is Wisconsin's minimum wage?\n\nWisconsin's minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. Young workers under age 20 can be paid a $5.90 \"opportunity wage\" during the first 90 days of employment.\n\nThere's also a minimum wage of $2.33 for workers who receive tips in Wisconsin. If tips, combined with that hourly rate, don't total $7.25, the employer must cover the difference.\n\nThere are also special rates for golf caddies and camp counselors, according to the state Department of Workforce Development.\n\nWhat is the 'living wage' in Wisconsin?\n\nAccording to a calculator developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the living wage for an adult with no children in Wisconsin is $16.06 an hour. In a household with two working adults and two children, it's $25.20.\n\nThe living wage varies by location. In the Milwaukee area, the living wage for an adult with no children is $16.10. In Madison, it's $17.49. In Eau Claire, it's $15.19, and in Wausau, $14.47.\n\nThat amount takes into account basic needs like food, housing and transportation, but not extras like going out to eat, taking vacations or saving for retirement.\n\nMore:What's a good paying job in Milwaukee? These are the industries with the highest-paid workers\n\nHow does Wisconsin's minimum wage compare to neighboring states?\n\nIllinois increased its minimum wage by a dollar to $14 in January and will boost it to $15 in 2025. Tipped workers are paid $8.40 hourly, and minors working less than 650 hours a year are paid $12.\n\nMichigan raised its minimum wage from $10.10 to $10.33. Minors now get $8.78 an hour, and tipped employees get $3.93.\n\nMinnesota also raised its amounts to account for inflation. Large employers, with annual revenue over $500,000, must pay $10.85 an hour. For smaller employers, it's $8.85. Minors must also be paid $8.85.\n\nMinneapolis and St. Paul are also raising the minimum wage — $15.57 hourly for employees working in the Twin Cities, except for some small businesses.\n\nIowa is similar to Wisconsin — the minimum wage there is $7.25. The tipped wage is $4.35 an hour if the employee makes $30 or more per month in tips.\n\nMore:Minnesota's higher minimum wage has minimal effect on nearby Wisconsin businesses\n\nCan cities in Wisconsin raise the minimum wage on their own?\n\nUnlike the Twin Cities, local governments in Wisconsin were barred from going beyond the state's minimum wage as part of a compromise signed in 2005 by then-Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle to boost the state's amount.\n\nAnd before a 2017 law prohibited it, local governments like Milwaukee County had approved \"living wage\" ordinances for government workers and contractors' employees.\n\nWhat's the history of minimum wage laws in Wisconsin?\n\nLegislation to set a minimum wage in Wisconsin was introduced in 1911. In 1913, the first wage law in Wisconsin said that women and minors must be paid a \"living wage,\" though it took a few years to determine that amount.\n\nThe first minimum wage for women and minors in Wisconsin was $0.22 in 1919. Future wage amounts took into account age, the population of a city or village, and the length of employment.\n\nWhen was the last time Wisconsin's minimum wage increased?\n\nWisconsin's minimum wage hasn't increased since 2009, when the federal minimum wage was also set at $7.25.\n\nIn 2006, the minimum wage for non-agricultural employment was $6.50 for adults and $5.90 for minors. A year prior, it was $5.70 for adults and $5.30 for minors.\n\nHow has inflation in Wisconsin affected the minimum wage?\n\nIf the $7.25 minimum wage set in 2009 was indexed for inflation to have the same purchasing power, it would be $10.33 now.\n\nLow-wage workers have found it especially hard to afford higher housing costs, even before a spike in prices in 2022, explained Laura Dresser, associate director of the High Road Strategy Center (formerly COWS, a left-leaning think tank) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nMore:A snapshot of Wisconsin's economy: remarkably strong job growth, warning signs ahead\n\nWho would be affected the most by a raise in Wisconsin's minimum wage?\n\nDresser's research has found that increasing the minimum wage to $15 over the next five years would increase wages for one in seven workers in Wisconsin. That includes one of every four Black and Hispanic workers.\n\nHalf the workers who'd get raises are in the retail or restaurant industry, Dresser said.\n\n\"These are the places where wages are lower,\" she said. \"You're looking at labor markets and looking where wages are consistently the lowest, closest to the wage floor, (are) restaurants and retailers.\"\n\nMore:The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention to a trend that began in the mid-1970s: The economy has produced too many low wage jobs\n\nWhy isn't Wisconsin's minimum wage increasing?\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have proposed changes to the wage rules, including eliminating the tipped wage and allowing local governments to set wage ordinances.\n\nIn February, Democrats released a bill that would raise the state's minimum wage to $10.85 at first, bring it to $15 within a year and adjust the amount for inflation after that. It would also end the tipped wage and allow local governments to again set wage ordinances.\n\nBut Republicans who control legislative committees typically don't hold public hearings for bills authored only by Democrats, limiting their chances to get votes and reach the governor, who would likely approve changes to the minimum wage.\n\n\"Regardless of a public hearing or not, we know the public has a lot going on, especially working families,\" said Rep. Francesca Hong, a Democrat from Madison who has led the bills. \"Part of our job is to remind them that we're still fighting for these policies, fighting for them first.\"\n\nHas Evers tried to increase the minimum wage?\n\nEvers has also proposed increasing the minimum wage in his state budget proposals. In 2023, he wanted to increase the amount to $8.25, then to $9.25 by 2025 and $10.25 by 2026, followed by adjustments for inflation. He also pitched a task force to study options for creating a $15 minimum wage in Wisconsin.\n\nRepublicans typically scrap hundreds of items Evers wants and write their own state budget plan. This past budget season, the budget they sent to Evers didn't include minimum wage increases.\n\nWhat's the opposition to raising the minimum wage in Wisconsin?\n\nThe Republican chairs of three committees that could schedule hearings on the bills above didn't respond to requests for interviews. Republican legislative leaders don't often comment on the issue, though some have previously argued it would hurt small businesses.\n\nWisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state's largest business lobby, which typically supports Republican candidates and causes, opposes raising the minimum wage, according to its 2023-24 legislative agenda.\n\n\"I think a lot of employers are very concerned about young people in particular being left out of the workforce,\" Rachel Ver Velde, WMC's director of workforce, education and employment policy, said in an interview.\n\n\"If the minimum wage increases, it'll have a disproportionate effect on those young people who are just trying to get into the workforce and trying to gain some experience, which ultimately hurts employers long-term, because their future employees may not have any work experience before walking in their doors,\" she said.\n\nDresser counters by saying evidence from other states shows stability or growth in sectors after raising the minimum wage, countering the \"dominant theme\" that people could get thrown out of work.\n\nWhy are some Wisconsin businesses offering more than the minimum wage?\n\nWhile Wisconsin's required wage hasn't increased, many employers have offered higher hourly rates, in the $15 to $30 range, plus sign-on bonuses and other benefits, as they struggle to recruit workers.\n\nWMC's Ver Velde said the \"vast majority\" of employers are paying above minimum wage, and most entry-level jobs aren't starting below $13.\n\n\"We heard from 73% of our membership that they're planning on increasing wages more than 3%,\" she said. \"It's significant wage increases to bring people in the door, and they're having to provide competitive benefits, across all sizes of companies, in order to fulfill that labor shortage.\"\n\nWhile workers have more leverage now, Dresser said, that doesn't mean the labor market will stay that way forever.\n\n\"We always think we're living in the new, recession-free world, but we never are,\" she said.\n\nThe minimum wage floor is \"about extending that clarity, that regulation, and making a standard across the board ... and then being able to hold that for different conditions of the labor market.\"\n\nMore:Wisconsin companies are hiring. Here are a few offering higher wages and sign-on bonuses\n\nHong said there should be efforts to level the playing field between large and small companies, as not all businesses are able to offer the same types of benefits to employees.\n\n\"Just like we have different tax brackets for different incomes, we should absolutely allow for some of the wages for higher-earning companies to go up as well,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2023/09/16/minimum-wage-california-fast-food-health-care-workers/70856929007/", "title": "California minimum wage now among highest in US: See where ...", "text": "Unions representing health care workers, fast food workers and other industries are increasingly flexing their power, as employees take to the picket lines this summer.\n\nAcross industries, workers are seeking improved benefits, better working conditions and most commonly, increased wages.\n\nIn California, nearly 1 million fast food and health care workers are set to get a major raise after a deal was announced earlier this week between labor unions and industries.\n\nUnder the new bill, most of California's 500,000 fast-food workers will be paid at least $20 per hour next year. And a separate bill will increase health care workers' salaries to at least $25 per hour over the next 10 years.\n\nHow does minimum wage for health care and fast-food employees compare in other states?\n\nMinimum wage varies across the US\n\nFifteen states have laws in place that make minimum wages equivalent to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, according to the Department of Labor.

Washington state has the highest minimum wage of any state in the country at $15.74 per hour, followed by California at $15.50.

In Georgia and Wyoming, the state minimum wage is lower than the federal minimum wage at $5.15 an hour. But, many employers are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act and must pay the Federal minimum wage.\n\nDo minimum wage laws vary within a state?\n\nNevada has two tiers of minimum wage: Employers that provide health benefits must pay workers at least $9.50 an hour, while employers that do not provide health benefits must pay at least $10.50 an hour.\n\nHow many workers make federal minimum wage or less?\n\nAccording to the Department of Labor, 78.7 million workers 16 and older were paid at hourly rates, making up 55.6% of all wage and salary workers. Of those hourly workers, about 1 million were paid wages at or below the federal minimum wage, making up 1.3% of all hourly paid workers.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/politics/american-workers-15-dollars-hour-minimum-wage/index.html", "title": "Nearly one-third of American workers make less than $15 an hour ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNearly 52 million workers – or almost one-third of the nation’s labor force – earn less than $15 an hour, according to a study released Tuesday by Oxfam America, an anti-poverty advocacy group.\n\nThese workers, whose annual income is less than $31,200, are disproportionately women and people of color, the study found.\n\nSome 47% of Black workers and 46% of Hispanic workers make less than $15 an hour, compared with 26% of White workers. Some 40% of female workers earn less than that threshold, compared with 25% of male workers.\n\nHalf of the women of color in the workforce make less than $15 an hour, as do nearly 58% of single parents.\n\n“It’s shameful that at a time when many US companies are boasting record profits, some of the hardest working people in this country – especially people who keep our economy and society functioning – are struggling to get by and falling behind,” said Kaitlyn Henderson, the study’s author and senior research adviser at Oxfam America.\n\nThe report is one of the latest efforts to push for raising the federal minimum wage above the current $7.25 an hour, where it has been since 2009. Many worker advocates would like to see the threshold increased to $15 an hour, which they say is a first step to creating a more livable wage.\n\nSoaring inflation, which has pushed up the prices of food, housing, gasoline and other necessities, has made it even more difficult for lower-income families to survive on their wages, Oxfam America said.\n\nTake Vikki Tully, 65, who lives in Alkol, West Virginia. She makes $12.70 an hour after working as a Head Start teacher for 26 years.\n\nThe skyrocketing cost of gas means she and her husband will take fewer trips this summer to visit their grandchildren in Virginia Beach, while the increased cost of wood and building materials means they will have to put off repairs and updates to their home.\n\nLower pay also makes it harder for her Head Start program to fill its vacancies. A teacher’s aide, for instance, starts at $10.10 an hour, while bus drivers and cooks start at $9.87 an hour, she said.\n\n“We’re short-staffed at one of the centers because no one wants to work because of the pay,” Tully said. “They have tried and tried to hire people. We’re losing people to other jobs too.”\n\nA growing number of companies have been raising their pay to lure and retain workers – a trend that started even before the pandemic. Last year, Under Armour raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour, while Amazon, Costco, Walmart, McDonald’s, Starbucks and others said they would increase the pay of some or all of their employees. Target announced last month that it would raise its starting wage for some positions to $24 an hour.\n\nBiden administration efforts\n\nThe Biden administration hiked the minimum wage for federal civilian workers stationed in the US and for federal contractors to $15 an hour earlier this year. Several Republican attorneys general have challenged President Joe Biden’s authority to lift the threshold for federal contractors.\n\nThe President also sought to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, which he signed into law in March 2021. However, the Senate parliamentarian ruled against including it in the Covid-19 relief bill, saying it did not meet a strict set of guidelines needed to move forward in the Senate’s reconciliation process.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have repeatedly introduced the Raise the Wage Act bill, which would boost the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and phase out the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, youth employees and workers with disabilities. But it has never made it through the Senate.\n\nThere are various analyses of how many people earn less than $15 an hour. The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute last year that 22 million people would see a boost in pay if the federal minimum wage was raised to $15 an hour in 2025 under the Raise the Wage Act.\n\nOxfam America’s figure is higher because it includes the number of people who currently make less than $15 an hour and looks at a broader set of workers that includes tipped wage workers, sub-minimum wage workers, gig workers, farmworkers and care workers, Henderson said. It also includes Puerto Rico, which adds nearly 1 million people.\n\nBoth analyses are based on US Census Bureau data.\n\nWhere lower-paid workers live\n\nOxfam America, which backs the Raise the Wage Act legislation, also looked at which states have larger shares of their labor forces making $15 an hour.\n\nThe South has a disproportionate percentage of workers making less than that threshold, as do some states in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain region, the study found.\n\nIn Texas, for instance, more than 60% of women of color earn less than $15 an hour. In Mississippi, 45% of the state’s workforce makes less than that amount.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Washington, DC, has a minimum wage of $15.20 an hour, while California’s minimum wage this year rose to $15 an hour for larger companies. Some localities, including Seattle, Denver and Los Angeles, have even higher minimum wages.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/06/joe-biden-minimum-wage-hike-unlikely-covid-19-relief-package/4419484001/", "title": "Joe Biden says minimum wage hike unlikely to stay in COVID-19 relief", "text": "President Joe Biden says his proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour is unlikely to make it into the final $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package after negotiations with Congress.\n\nBiden, who advocated for a minimum wage increase before the pandemic began, has pitched the idea as an effective way to help working-class Americans cope with the economic consequences of the crisis.\n\n\"No one should work 40 hours a week and live below the poverty wage.

But Manchin, a moderate Democrat, said he supports a smaller increase.\n\n\"I’m supportive of an increase that’s responsible and reasonable,\" Manchin said, \"and in my state that’s $11.\" Manchin added that the increased rate should account for inflation.\n\nRepublican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa said she was concerned about raising the minimum wage during the pandemic.\n\n\"A $15 federal minimum wage would be devastating for our hardest-hit small businesses at a time when they can least afford it,\" Ernst said.\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., echoed Ernst, tweeting Saturday that \"Raising the minimum wage amid a pandemic is a tone-deaf idea authored by Washington elites.\"\n\nScott co-sponsored Ernst's amendment Thursday night to prevent a federal minimum wage increase to $15 an hour amid the pandemic.\n\nDespite the roadblocks Biden’s push to raise the wage has faced, he does have the support of progressive Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who indicated he had not given up on the possibility of including the wage increase in the relief package.\n\nPolitics live updates:$15 minimum wage unlikely to be in COVID relief bill, Biden says\n\n\"The budget resolution the Senate passed today puts us on a path to finally raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour,\" Sanders tweeted Friday. \"It is a moral imperative in the richest country in the world that no one is forced to live on a starvation wage, and the American Rescue Plan will get it done.\"\n\nSanders has backed a phased minimum wage increase. Democrats proposed to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, raising it in five steps in the coming years.\n\nAlthough Senate Democrats have promised future legislation to increase the federal minimum wage, the Senate faced criticism for not including it in the latest package.\n\n\"Your reminder that 67% of Americans support raising minimum wage to $15 hour but it can be filibustered by 41 Republican senators,\" Robert Riech, former secretary of labor under the Clinton administration, tweeted Saturday. \"The Senate is broken.\"\n\nBiden told O’Donnell that if his \"guess\" that the minimum wage increase won't be included in the relief package, he is prepared to negotiate a separate bill to make it happen. And he plans to continue to push the issue, which was part of his platform on the campaign trail and which he discussed at his first major campaign rally in Pittsburgh in April 2019.\n\nThe last time Congress passed legislation to increase the federal minimum wage was in 2007, when it was raised to $7.25 an hour. Since then, at least 29 states and Washington, D.C., have raised their minimum wages on their own.\n\nMore:Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Tlaib and Rep.

In addition, approximately 1,000 troops currently based in Germany were moving to Romania.\n\nKirby said the moves, which would happen in the coming days, were not permanent and emphasized, “These forces are not going to fight in Ukraine.”\n\nThe move is the most significant sign to date that the US is preparing for the prospect of Russian President Vladimir Putin launching an invasion of Ukraine, as Russia has shown no signs of de-escalating after several rounds of diplomatic talks with the US and NATO.\n\nBiden signed off on the additional troops following a meeting on Tuesday morning at the White House with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, an official said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN’s Matthew Chance in an exclusive statement later Wednesday that the “US de facto is continuing to pump up tension in Europe.” Peskov said the deployments are “the best proof that we, as Russia, have an obvious reason to be worried.”\n\nBiden told CNN’s Kaitlan CollinsWednesday that the decision was “totally consistent” with what the US has told Russia throughout discussions.\n\n“It’s totally consistent with what I told Putin in the beginning,” Biden said in a brief exchange in the White House East Room. “As long as he’s acting aggressively, we’re going to make sure we reassure our NATO allies and Eastern Europe we’re there and Article V is a sacred obligation.”\n\nAt the same time the US was preparing to send troops to Europe, the White House said Wednesday it was no longer describing a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine as “imminent,” suggesting the word sent an unintended message.\n\n“I used that once. I think others have used that once. And then we stopped using it because I think it sent a message that we weren’t intending to send, which was that we knew President Putin had made a decision,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.\n\nLast week, Psaki said an invasion by Russian troops of Ukraine continued to be “imminent,” a description that drew anger in Kyiv. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, disagreed, arguing the descriptions could cause panic and economic turmoil.\n\nA Ukrainian official told CNN that Kyiv welcomed the reinforcement of NATO’s eastern flank, but “hopes it will be accompanied with continued supplies of defensive weapons to Ukraine, including sophisticated air defenses.”\n\nMore US troops could be deployed\n\nKirby stressed these additional troop movements don’t mean the US believes Putin has decided to invade Ukraine or any other country, but “if he does invade Ukraine, obviously there’s going to be consequences for that.”\n\n“We want to make sure that he knows any move on NATO is going to be resisted, and it’s going to trigger Article Five, and we’re going to be committed to the defense of our allies,” Kirby said.\n\nLast week, the US placed 8,500 troops in the US on heightened alert in case a NATO Response Force is called up and US forces are needed quickly. But the US and NATO have tens of thousands of other troops already in Europe to draw on for any additional deployments to Eastern European allies.\n\nKirby said that the troops being deployed were separate from the 8,500 US troops on heightened alert. The Pentagon is “not ruling out the possibility that there will be more” US troop movements in the coming days, Kirby said.\n\nThe US deployment to Poland consists of about 1,700 troops from an 82nd Airborne Division infantry brigade combat team based at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. There are about 300 service members from the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg deploying to Germany. And the US is moving a stryker squadron of about 1,000 troops from Germany to Romania, Kirby said.\n\nThe troops will operate on a bilateral basis with their host countries, since NATO has not yet activated the multinational response force.\n\nCNN reported last week that the US and a handful of allies had been in discussions to deploy thousands more troops to Eastern European NATO countries before any potential Russian invasion of Ukraine as a show of support in the face of Moscow’s ongoing aggression.\n\nA Latvian diplomat told CNN Wednesday that Latvia, which borders Russia and Belarus, “is ready and willing to host more troops from the US – it’s been a long standing topic of discussion with the Pentagon and those discussions are still ongoing.”\n\nAllies welcome announcement\n\nThe announcement of US troop deployments to Poland was welcome news to Polish officials, according to a senior Polish diplomat. Polish officials had been discussing the possibility of sending more US troops to the country with their American counterparts in recent days, the diplomat said.\n\nPolish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau visits Washington beginning Thursday, and he will meet with White House officials and lawmakers, the Polish diplomat said. On Friday, Rau will meet Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the State Department.\n\nBiden said last Friday that he would be moving the forces “in the near term,” as Russia has continued to build up forces near Ukraine, sparking fears of a renewed invasion even as diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions have continued.\n\nNew satellite images showed a further expansion of Russia’s military presence at multiple locations in Belarus, Crimea and western Russia.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Spanish newspaper El Pais published confidential written responses that the United States and NATO sent last week to Russia, which rejected Moscow’s demand to never admit Ukraine into NATO. El Pais published five pages of what it said was a US government document and four pages of what it said was a NATO document, and said both were sent to Russia on January 26.\n\nKirby confirmed Wednesday the US written response to Russia was authentic, saying that its publication “confirms to the entire world what we have always been saying.”\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the US decision to deploy additional forces to Europe.\n\n“This is a powerful signal of U.S. commitment, and comes on top of other recent U.S. contributions to our shared security – including 8,500 troops at high readiness for the NATO Response Force, and the USS Harry S.

The Defense Department has no plans to return to Afghanistan to “retrieve or destroy” the equipment, reads the report, which has been provided to Congress.\n\nThe US gave a total of $18.6 billion of equipment to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) from 2005 to August 2021, according to the report. Of that total, equipment worth $7.12 billion remained in Afghanistan after the US withdrawal was completed on August 30, 2021. It included aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications equipment and other materials, according to the DoD report.\n\nThe huge value of the hardware left behind will serve to refocus attention on the chaotic and hasty Afghanistan withdrawal that has been heavily criticized by lawmakers from both parties.\n\n“Much of the remaining equipment” left in Afghanistan requires “specialized maintenance that DoD contractors previously provided” to Afghan forces “in the form of technical knowledge and support,” the report states.\n\nThe Department of Defense was required to submit a report to Congress “regarding the disposition of United States property, equipment and supplies provided to” Afghan forces that “were destroyed, taken out of” or “remain in Afghanistan,” states the report, which is dated March 2022.\n\n“The $7.12 billion figure cited in the Department’s recent report to Congress corresponds to ANDSF equipment and not U.S. military equipment used by our forces,” Army Major Rob Lodewick, a Defense Department spokesperson, said in a statement. “Nearly all equipment used by U.S. military forces in Afghanistan was either retrograded or destroyed prior to our withdrawal and is not part of the ‘$7.12 billion’ figure cited in the report.”\n\nFrom Afghanistan to Ukraine\n\nThe report also says that five Mi-17 helicopters that had been in Afghanistan were officially transferred to Ukraine in 2022, though they were already in Ukraine for maintenance before the US left Afghanistan. The Department of Defense notified Congress of its intent to transfer the helicopters in January 2022, before Russia’s invasion of the country had begun, and Ukraine signed a letter of acceptance on March 11, 2022.\n\n“These five helicopters were in Ukraine undergoing overhaul maintenance when the Afghan government collapsed, and have remained there since,” the report states.\n\nOf other materials the US had previously procured for Afghanistan but not sent to the country, the US has given some “non-standard munitions” to Ukraine, including about 37,000 122mm howitzer rounds, the report states.\n\nThe US has also transferred over 15 million rounds of Ball rifle ammunition, over 99,000 40mm high-explosive/fragmentation grenade cartridges, and about 119,000 82mm high-explosive mortar rounds to Ukraine from material that was previously procured for Afghanistan, the report states.\n\nThese munitions have been transferred to Ukraine under presidential drawdown authority, the report states.\n\nUS military equipment and weapons left behind\n\nAircraft worth $923.3 million remained in Afghanistan. The US left 78 aircraft procured for the government of Afghanistan at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul before the end of the withdrawal. These aircraft were demilitarized and rendered inoperable before the US military left, the report states. The US military conducted its non-combatant evacuation from Afghanistan in August, primarily through that airport.\n\nA total of 9,524 air-to-ground munitions, valued at $6.54 million, remained in Afghanistan at the conclusion of the US military withdrawal. The “significant majority” of the “remaining aircraft munitions stock are non-precision munitions,” the report states.\n\nOver 40,000 of the total 96,000 military vehicles the US gave to Afghan forces remained in Afghanistan at the time of the US withdrawal, including 12,000 military Humvees, the report states. “The operational condition of the remaining vehicles” in Afghanistan is “unknown,” the report states.\n\nMore than 300,000 of the total 427,300 weapons the US gave to Afghan forces remained in Afghanistan at the time of the US military withdrawal, according to the report. Less than 1,537,000 of the “specialty munitions” and “common small arms ammunition,” valued at a total of $48 million, are still in the country, the report states.\n\n“Nearly all” of the communications equipment that the US gave to Afghan forces, including base-station, mobile, man-portable and hand-held commercial and military radio systems, and associated transmitters and encryption devices also remained in Afghanistan at the time of the withdrawal, the report states.\n\n“Nearly all” night vision, surveillance, “biometric and positioning equipment” totaling nearly 42,000 pieces of specialized equipment remained in the country, the report adds.\n\nAnd “nearly all,” of the explosive ordinance disposal and demining equipment, including 17,500 “pieces of explosive detection, electronic countermeasure, disposal and personal protective equipment” also remained in Afghanistan, according to the report.", "authors": ["Ellie Kaufman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/politics/president-authority-deploy-us-troops-explainer/index.html", "title": "Here's why presidents send US troops abroad | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved the deployment of 3,000 US troops to Poland, Germany and Romania to bolster NATO countries in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe deployments, US officials have told CNN, are a show of support to NATO allies feeling threatened by Russia’s buildup of troops near Ukraine’s border.\n\nTo be clear, there is no plan for US troops to engage Russian troops, and the White House and the Pentagon have stressed that American service members will not be entering Ukraine.\n\n“They are moves designed to respond to the current security environment,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Wednesday, adding that these forces “are not going to fight in Ukraine.”\n\nWhile the shuffling of troops marks the most significant sign yet that the US is preparing for the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, US troop movement is not unusual at all. And there are a number of options under which a president can deploy troops.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nExercises and basing\n\nThe US can, and does, frequently send troops to Europe to participate in exercises with partner nations.\n\nUS troops are stationed at bases across the continent, and these exercises and stations are built upon agreements with each nation individually or with a treaty alliance such as NATO.\n\nBilateral agreements or requests\n\nThese deployments are made in consultation with ally nations and with the agreement of both countries. This is the dynamic playing out now, with the US’ NATO allies having asked for US troops to bolster their own defenses and to send a stronger message of deterrence to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut while NATO allies are receiving US troops, the deployment is a US deployment done in consultation with these allies – not a NATO deployment.\n\nNATO\n\nAs part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the US also has commitments to come to the assistance of ally countries and to provide for the overall defense of NATO.\n\nPart of that defense entails the NATO Response Force, a multinational, 40,000-strong force. In 2014, partially in response to the Russian invasion of Crimea, NATO created the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, which is part of the Readiness Action Plan for quick responses to a changing security environment.\n\nNATO has not activated the NATO Response Force – which has also been used in disaster relief – in regard to Russia’s actions on Ukraine’s border, but the Pentagon has said that it has 8,500 troops on heightened readiness in case it does. And the US and NATO have tens of thousands of other troops already in Europe to draw on for any additional deployments to Eastern European allies.\n\nKirby said Wednesday that the troops being deployed were separate from the 8,500 US troops on heightened alert. The Pentagon is “not ruling out the possibility that there will be more” US troop movements in the coming days, Kirby said.\n\nIn 2005, aircraft from the NATO Response Force delivered NATO relief supplies to the US in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and last August, the NATO Response Force was activated to support the evacuation of Afghans who had previously worked alongside NATO.\n\nAuthorized use of military force\n\nThis is the most controversial option on the list, but one that has been used repeatedly to send troops to war since the September 11 attacks. As of now, there has been no move to seek congressional authorization to use force in regard to the Russia-Ukraine tensions.\n\nThe 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force comprises only one long sentence. But its 60 broadly written words have helped pave the way for years of military activity. According to official documents, Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump all invoked it during their tenures.\n\nWhile Republicans and Democrats alike have expressed a desire to update the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which authorized the global war on terror, and the 2002 authorization for the Iraq War, the consensus has been bogged down amid disputes over how a new authorization would deal with the scope of the mission, time constraints and the use of US ground troops.\n\nThe Constitution, meanwhile, states explicitly that only Congress has the authority to declare war, a power that has been invoked five times in US history: The War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War, and World Wars I and II.", "authors": ["Oren Liebermann Paul Leblanc", "Oren Liebermann", "Paul Leblanc", "Authorized Use Of Military Force"], "publish_date": "2022/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/02/22/russia-invasion-ukraine-effects/6770843001/", "title": "Russia invades Ukraine.

Reed and his family have denied the charges against him.\n\nIn her tweet, Paula Reed also advocated for the release of Paul Whelan, a US citizen and former Marine who was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 and arrested on espionage charges, which he has consistently and vehemently denied.\n\nReed’s release will not impact the US approach to the war in Ukraine, senior administration officials said.\n\nHis release came after months of effort by the US government, officials said, and was particularly urgent given concerns about Reed’s health. It was ultimately secured through a prisoner swap for Russian citizen Konstantin Yaroshenko.\n\nThe exchange took place in Turkey on Wednesday, Trevor’s parents, Paula and Joey Reed, previously told CNN.\n\nThe couple, who spoke to their son by phone shortly after the prisoner exchange, said he had been subdued. “The first phone call we got, he did not sound like himself,” Paula Reed said Wednesday evening at a news conference outside their home in Granbury, Texas.\n\nShe said his spirits seemed better by the time they received a second call from him later in the day: “He still looks terrible, but he sounded better. He sounded more like himself.”\n\nTrevor Reed, who was detained in Russia for nearly three years, saw Yaroshenko on the tarmac during the prisoner swap but did not say anything to him, according to his father.\n\n“Trevor quickly told us that they – the American plane pulled up next to the Russian plane, and they walked both prisoners across at the same time like you see in the movies,” Joey Reed said earlier on CNN’s “New Day.”\n\nThe Reeds said they had also spoken to President Joe Biden on Wednesday and expressed their gratitude.\n\n“I heard in the voices of Trevor’s parents how much they’ve worried about his health and missed his presence,” Biden said in a statement. “And I was delighted to be able to share with them the good news about Trevor’s freedom.”\n\nAsked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday whether he had been surprised by Reed’s release given Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Biden said: “I did it.” The President, pressed on how, continued, “I raised it,” adding, “Three months ago.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told Collins earlier Wednesday that the President waited to notify the Reed family of their son’s freedom due to “not wanting to put anyone in a position of putting that at risk – even people who are excited and joyful and looking forward to the news.”\n\nPressed on whether Russia was able to extract any other conditions from the US aside from a one-to-one prisoner swap, Psaki told CNN, “There were no other conditions that I’m aware of,” later adding, “This was about one issue and topic and I don’t think we should read into it further.”\n\n‘Months and months’ of negotiations\n\nReed’s release was the result of “months and months of hard careful work across the US government” on the matter, a senior administration official said, noting that “the conversations on this particular issue have accelerated recently to get us to this point.”\n\nOne driving factor was concern for Reed’s health. His family has expressed worry about his likely exposure to tuberculosis as well as lingering effects from having Covid-19.\n\nThe official, speaking to reporters on a background call Wednesday, said that “ultimately, those negotiations led the President to have to make a very hard decision with a decision to commute the sentence of Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian smuggler convicted of conspiring to import cocaine.”\n\nYaroshenko is a Russian pilot who had been detained in Liberia by undercover US Drug Enforcement Agency agents on May 28, 2010, and brought to the US, according to Russian state news agency TASS. He was convicted of drug smuggling in 2011 and sentenced to 20 years in prison, which he had been serving at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut. He has denied the charges against him.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry had previously raised the possibility that Yaroshenko could be returned “in exchange for any American national” held in Russia.\n\nThe official did not provide details about how or why Yaroshenko was chosen for the swap, but noted that he had served the majority of his US sentence and is now in Russian custody.\n\n“This is a tough call for a President. President Biden made it to bring home an American whose health was a source of an intense concern, and to deliver on his commitment to resolve these hard cases and reunite Americans with their loved ones,” the official said.\n\nPaula Reed spoke Wednesday with CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day.”\n\n“I’m going to try not to cry, because he doesn’t want me to cry,” Reed’s mother, Paula, told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day” Wednesday. “Obviously, I’m going to cry a little bit, give him a big hug, and just, you know, give him hugs, and it will be the four of us together again (for the first time) in a few years, so it’s going to be great.”\n\nReed’s father previously told CNN he believed it was likely Reed was suffering from tuberculosis, that he was coughing up blood and also had a broken rib. He said Reed went to a prison hospital but did not receive treatment and was then sent back to solitary confinement.\n\nAs Reed started a second hunger strike in protest of his treatment by Russian authorities, Reed’s parents went to protest outside of the White House in the hopes of securing a meeting with the President.\n\nThe Reeds ultimately did meet with the President at the White House for about a half hour last month.\n\n2 other Americans still detained in Russia\n\nWednesday’s release also brought renewed attention to the case of Whelan. He was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison in a trial US officials denounced as unfair.\n\nLast June, he told CNN of the grim conditions of the remote labor camp where he works in a clothing factory he called a “sweatshop” and said obtaining medical care is “very difficult.”\n\nIn his statement welcoming Reed’s release, Biden said his administration “won’t stop” until Whelan is home.\n\nThe Whelan family expressed happiness at Reed’s release but said it was a day of “varied emotions” and questions for them.\n\n“Unfortunately, time is not on Paul’s side. Our parents are literally not getting any younger. Our hope remains that Paul will be home so they may see him once more. But each day that hope dims,” his brother David Whelan said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, US basketball star Brittney Griner remains detained in Russia after she was arrested in February on allegations of drug smuggling. A Moscow court recently extended her detention until May 19, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nWhile her legal team has had access to her and was able to see her several times a week throughout her detention, a US official from the US embassy in Moscow was finally granted consular access to Griner in late March, and said they found her to be in “good condition.”\n\nNed Price, a State Department spokesman, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Wednesday that the cases remain top priorities for the US.\n\nPsaki echoed Price’s sentiment, saying Wednesday that the White House will “continue to do everything they can” to secure the release of Whelan, Griner and other Americans still detained in Russia.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional background information and reaction.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hansler Kylie Atwood Radina Gigova Anna Chernova", "Jennifer Hansler", "Kylie Atwood", "Radina Gigova", "Anna Chernova"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columns/2024/05/09/drones-have-heavy-impact-in-russia-ukraine-war-gary-cosby-jr/73584726007/", "title": "Drones have heavy impact in Russia-Ukraine war | GARY COSBY JR.", "text": "The Russian-Ukraine war is redefining how future wars will be fought with the lessons learned being written in the blood of soldiers on both sides as well as that of Ukrainian civilians.\n\nThe heavy tank losses by Russia — reliable sources indicate they have lost at least 3,000 tanks — have already shown how traditional armored forces are susceptible to anti-tank missiles.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/09"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/defence/957912/does-ukraines-surprise-offensive-mean-end-is-in-sight", "title": "Does Ukraine's surprise offensive mean the end is in sight? | The ...", "text": "Ukraine’s surprise counter-offensive that has seen it retake huge swathes of land occupied by Russian forces has sparked hope it could mark a crucial turning point in a war that was grinding to a stalemate.\n\nHaving prepared for and promised a retaliatory attack in the south of the country, Ukrainian forces are now making what The Guardian described as “unexpected, rapid advances” in the northeast, around the country’s second largest city, Kharkiv.\n\nUkraine claims its forces have liberated 3,000 square kilometres since this latest operation began last week, retaking more than a third of the occupied Kharkiv region, which if confirmed would represent a “remarkable advance”, said the BBC.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

So there’s a long way to go,” he said.\n\n“The last month has seen the end of one phase of the war and the beginning of another,” said Byline Times. While the strategic impact of the counter-offensive remains as yet unclear, “what it has inarguably done is give Ukraine a massive morale boost – to its own troops and to its western partners – while severely denting Russian confidence”, said the FT.\n\nPutin under pressure\n\nWith Russia forced into a humiliating withdrawal from areas it has held since the beginning of the war, Vladimir Putin has come under increasing pressure at home.\n\nAl Jazeera reported that “the Russian army’s leadership appeared to be caught off-guard by Ukraine’s fightback against its invasion in the northeast” and there were reports that the increasingly embattled President Putin had cancelled a meeting with defence chiefs on Sunday and fired the head of the Western Military District, Lieutenant General Roman Berdnikov, just 16 days after appointing him.\n\nThe Telegraph’s Russia correspondent Nataliya Vasilyeva said that politicians in St Petersburg have signed a petition calling on the president to resign, “marking a rare and daring protest against the war”.\n\nIt is not just his political opponents who have spoken out against the course of the war. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a staunch ally of Putin, has criticised the Russian army’s performance after recent losses. In an 11-minute-long message posted on the Telegram messaging app he conceded the campaign was not going to plan and that if the army’s strategy did not change he would speak to the “leadership of the country”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Richard Windsor", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}]}

We are confident this unprecedented enforcement will make it clear to the entire airline industry that passengers with mobility disabilities deserve to travel with the same level of safety and dignity as everyone else,\" PVA CEO Carl Blake said in a statement.\n\nAmerican Airlines acknowledged the fine and said it is committed to improving. In fact, it noted that it has ramped up accessibility investments since well before the DOT issued its fine.\n\n\"This year, American invested over $175 million in service, infrastructure and training to improve the travel experience for customers traveling with wheelchairs or other mobility devices,\" Julie Rath, American's Senior Vice President of Airport Operations, Reservations and Service Recovery, said in a statement. \"Today's agreement reaffirms American's commitment to taking care of all of our customers.\"\n\nThe airline emphasized that it had a 22% improvement in the number of wheelchair mishandling incidents from September 2022 to September 2024. Its investments include the ability for customers to get a wheelchair tag generated automatically rather than relying on handwritten documentation for checked mobility devices. The airline is also investing in better mobility device handling equipment at many of its airports and improved training for its team members who handle mobility devices and interact with passengers with disabilities. Many advocates have said that improved and increased training is an important step for airlines to take.\n\n\"When you get right down to it we want our customers to feel 100% cared for on their travel journey,\" Rath told USA TODAY in an interview. \"We are focused on getting better and better. We’re not going to stop until we down to zero wheelchair incidents.”\n\nThe DOT said it has ongoing investigations into similar issues at other airlines, but officials did not indicate when those would be concluded or what penalties may result.\n\nHow common is wheelchair damage on planes?\n\nU.S. airlines typically damage 10,000-15,000 wheelchairs per year, and while that equates to less than 1.5% of the total number of mobility devices they transport, it's a huge issue for the affected travelers.\n\n“If you need a particular type of wheelchair equipment and the airline damages or destroys your wheelchair, that doesn’t just ruin your trip, that can affect you at home after your trip has ended, in some cases for weeks or worse,\" Buttigieg said during a press call announcing the fine.\n\nOver the course of 2023, USA TODAY spoke to more than 30 travelers whose mobility devices were damaged or destroyed by U.S. airlines, and many said the process of waiting for repairs or replacements took months, often leaving them homebound in the meantime.\n\nOne traveler who was affected said the wheelchair damage resulted in having to stay home from work for two weeks. “Two weeks of work is food out of my children’s mouth,\" they said.\n\nMany affected travelers also expressed that having their wheelchairs damaged was like having their legs broken by an airline while they were traveling, and said it would be obviously unacceptable if travelers who did not rely on wheelchairs had a 1.5% chance of losing their mobility after a flight.\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

And mostly, they win. Could it be the $50 million the industry has lavished on federal campaigns since 1990?\n\nNow Congress has another chance after United Airlines’ recent fiasco — dragging passenger David Dao off a flight in full view of the world via smartphones. At a House hearing Tuesday, lawmakers grilled airline executives from United, Alaska, American and Southwest about \"customer service,\" certainly a misnomer, and threatened to take action if the airlines fail to do so on their own. On Thursday, senators will have their turn to roast United's president.\n\nLet's hope that this time, unlike the past, the promise of change isn't an empty one. Airlines don't need regulation to prevent a repeat of the Dao incident. Horrendous publicity took care of that. The best thing Congress could do is to pass laws that provide fliers with information about their rights, which are buried in federal regulations or airline “contracts of carriage,” long, complex documents written by lawyers for lawyers. United's runs more than 37,000 words.\n\nThink what might have been avoided if passengers on United Express Flight 3411 knew they were entitled to up to $1,350 for being bumped from a flight. Before United had Dao dragged off, other passengers might have clamored to get off the plane and take the cash.\n\nAirlines are taking action: Opposing view\n\nBut only the savviest of travelers know this rule. And they can't count on airlines to inform them.\n\nLast year, after an undercover operation in which Transportation Department investigators posed as travelers, four major airlines — Alaska, American, Southwest and United — were caught providing inaccurate information about compensation for lost bags and bumping. All four were fined.\n\nAirports in the European Union manage the feat by prominently displaying on posters in simple language the most important consumer rights. In Madrid, for instance, posters are placed above the luggage carousels. In the United States, it would be easy to post these rules. There are only a handful, including a requirement that airlines pay up to $3,500 for lost or damaged luggage and compensate passengers for bumping. The rules could also appear on the computer-generated itineraries or boarding passes that consumers get. Several Democratic senators have proposed a measure that would do just that.\n\nBut airlines prefer less informed customers, and they are willing to go to the Supreme Court to keep them in the dark. In 2012, rules proposed by the Obama Transportation Department required airlines and travel websites to list your total fare — including government taxes and fees — upfront. It helped fliers shop and compare costs with ease — at least until they ran into the add-ons for checked bags, legroom and other \"amenities.\" The rule survived challenges all the way up to the nation's highest court.\n\nMore recently, the industry has been battling a 2014 Obama administration proposal to expand price transparency again by putting bag- and seat-upgrade fees upfront in the posted fares on travel websites. The growing profusion of add-ons makes figuring out the actual total cost of tickets, particularly for a family, a job for a math whiz. But airlines are having none of this idea, either.\n\nUnder Obama, the proposal languished. It is unclear whether the Trump administration plans to move forward.\n\nWhat fliers need most is accessible information, whether it’s about myriad fees or their rights. Customers are smart. Armed with knowledge, they can protect themselves and hold airlines to higher standards.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

But we need to ensure it works for ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Elise Gould is a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Heidi Shierholz is president at the Economic Policy Institute and former chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic shut down businesses across the US in spring 2020, the labor market lost 22 million jobs in just two months — more than twice as many jobs lost during the entire Great Recession and financial crisis of 2008-2009. Given that a full labor market recovery from the Great Recession took a decade, there were sincere worries that Covid-19’s economic wound could take even longer to heal. But because we undertook a radically different — and better — policy response to the latest crisis, the labor market is far healthier today than anybody expected it would be in those grim early days of the pandemic.\n\nOver the last 12 months, the economy has added 6.6 million jobs, an astonishing pace. And while there is still a significant gap in the labor market, we are on track to return to pre-pandemic labor market conditions before the end of 2022 — a recovery that is roughly eight years faster than the recovery from the Great Recession, according to our own calculations. And that’s because, unlike in the aftermath of the Great Recession, Congress did what was needed to spur a strong recovery this time around. We would have millions fewer jobs today if Congress had not enacted the Covid relief and recovery measures it did. And these policies have not only made the recovery faster overall, but particularly so for historically disadvantaged groups.\n\nIn 2020, Congress acted quickly and decisively to help workers and their families, businesses and state and local governments on the front lines of the public health crisis. The first law passed in early March provided emergency funding for the public health response and vaccine research. Shortly thereafter, Congress passed well over $2 trillion in legislation that expanded unemployment insurance, delivered direct payments to households, and provided support to businesses, governments and health care providers.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Congress passed legislation that provided an additional $900 billion in Covid relief. This bill alone — which is sometimes forgotten among other pandemic legislation — was larger than the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, the clear centerpiece of the fiscal response to the Great Recession. And following the significant relief packages of 2020, the American Rescue Plan in March 2021 provided an additional $1.9 trillion in federal relief in the form of additional direct payments and aid to state and local governments, among other fiscal support. And, as investments stemming from the more recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act hit the economy in coming years, the recovery and the economy will be made even stronger.\n\nWe’re seeing the extraordinary effects in the jobs numbers. We have gained back almost nine out of every 10 jobs lost during the pandemic, and essentially all groups are seeing dramatically faster recoveries than they did following recent recessions. For example, the Black women’s unemployment rate jumped from 5.8% pre-Covid to 16.2% (using a three-month average) in spring 2020, but it is now down to about 6.2% in a fraction of the time it took to recover from the Great Recession. However, even with these significant gains in Black unemployment, the rate remains about twice as high as White unemployment. Clearly, there is more work that needs to be done to address the disparities plaguing the US economy even before Covid-19 struck. That’s where strong government action can continue to make a difference.\n\nThe income numbers are also telling. Families in the bottom 60% of the income distribution benefited enormously from pandemic fiscal relief efforts, which boosted incomes directly and helped spur spending and the labor market recovery. In turn, the fast labor market recovery has boosted wages most strongly for the bottom third of workers, a welcome change from the patterns of recent decades. This relief has also supported historically disadvantaged groups, who are more concentrated in the bottom of the wage distribution because of the impact of structural racism on the labor market.\n\nIt is true that some of the wage gains from a much-improved labor market have been neutralized by the inflation spike this past year. But this inflation was largely from global supply chain problems, and without the strong jobs recovery we have today, this burst of mostly inevitable inflation would’ve been much more damaging to working families.\n\nThat said, virtually none of the obstacles in the way of having a better and fairer economy that existed before Covid have yet to be addressed. Policies are needed to restore workers’ rights to unions and collective bargaining, the federal minimum wage should be a strong labor market floor rather than essentially the poverty-level wage it’s become, and unemployment insurance should be a real safety net rather than the patchy and stingy system it’s returned to after temporary but incredibly valuable pandemic enhancements were allowed to wither.\n\nStill, it is radically underappreciated how much better off US families are as a result of policies that were put in place during the pandemic. And while enormous disparities still exist, the benefits have been particularly large for low-income households and groups historically disadvantaged by racism — both in current forms and its legacies. It’s essential that lawmakers remember the rapid pace of this recovery — and the policy measures that led to it — when we’re faced with the next economic crisis. And in the meantime, Congress needs to put policies in place that address the massive imbalances that existed pre-Covid and help create an economy that works for everyone.", "authors": ["Elise Gould Heidi Shierholz For Cnn Business Perspectives", "Elise Gould", "Heidi Shierholz For Cnn Business Perspectives"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/us/unruly-passenger-flight-london-lax-utah/index.html", "title": "Unruly passenger forces flight from London to Los Angeles to divert ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA disruptive passenger aboard a Virgin Atlantic flight from London’s Heathrow airport to Los Angeles on Tuesday caused the aircraft to be diverted to Salt Lake City, according to an airline statement.\n\nWilliam Stephen Hayes, 39, of the United Kingdom, was then arrested at the Salt Lake City airport on suspicion of being violent and unruly on an international flight, Salt Lake City police said in a news release.\n\nHayes was arrested on charges of interference with a flight crew and assault by striking, beating and wounding in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States.\n\nCNN has been unable to determine whether Hayes has secured an attorney.

He serves on the House Natural Resources Committee, the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis and the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nOver the years, members of Congress have come under fire for trading stocks in companies involved in the industries they’re supposed to regulate. Some members on both sides of the aisle traded stocks in early 2020 right before the severity of the pandemic became widely known to the general public.\n\nThere’s nothing that forbids lawmakers from trading shares of companies that could be affected by laws they pass (the Stock Act, which Congress passed in 2012, does ban them from using any nonpublic information for financial benefit). But even more casual stock trading that may not seem particularly sinister can create conflicts of interest — or the appearance of conflicts. That is precisely what I wanted to avoid when I first started running for Congress in 2017.\n\nAt that time, my wife and I divested from all of the individual stocks we held and moved everything into diversified mutual funds that are managed by a third party. While that step isn’t required by law, I felt it was my responsibility to go above and beyond to earn the trust of my constituents.\n\nNow I believe we need to require all of my colleagues in Congress to take similar steps. It’s time to pass the bipartisan Ban Conflicted Trading Act, which I am proud to cosponsor. That bill would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks or similar investments and prohibit them from serving on corporate boards while in office.\n\nPassing the Ban Conflicted Trading Act would be a critical step to restoring the public’s trust in Congress. Many Americans have little faith in their elected representatives to do the right thing. They see a culture of corruption in Washington and are cynical about the direction of our democracy. Passing this act could help change that. The American people would have more faith in their elected officials by knowing that they’re focused on serving the public’s best interests and not lining their own pockets.\n\nSome of my colleagues argue such a ban is unfair to members who should have a right to trade individual stocks just like anyone else. However, I think it’s fair to say that when you take the oath of office, you are accepting an enormous responsibility that requires a higher standard of conduct than private citizens. We have been entrusted to put the public’s interest above our own, and maintaining that trust requires sacrifices.\n\nI have also heard from colleagues who raise legitimate concerns about who should bear the cost of divesting from individual stocks and transferring investments to mutual funds or blind trusts, which typically requires the assistance of finance professionals. I do not believe taxpayers should be asked to cover that expense, but I have also heard arguments that members themselves should not be forced to pay for that cost either.\n\nI believe these obstacles are no excuse for abandoning the effort entirely. We need to have a discussion about our disagreements, and then press forward. Passing this bill is one of many steps we must take now to show our constituents we are working for them, not our own financial self-interest.\n\nIf the debate around this bill in recent months is any indication, my stance will surely ruffle some feathers. Even some colleagues in my own party disagree with the push to ban trading. That being said, I know this is the right thing to do.\n\nOur country is more divided than ever. But I believe that we can still come together to do the right thing and restore some faith in our political process.

As more immigrants came to the United States and fusion dishes and ethnic cuisines entered the cultural mainstream, Spam has reached new, younger foodies, say Hormel, food analysts and researchers.\n\nEdgy and clever advertising campaigns also have helped Spam attract a broader customer range than the Baby Boomers who grew up eating it, sometimes reluctantly.\n\n“Spam has undergone a reputation makeover,” said Robert Ku, an associate professor of Asian and Asian American studies at Binghamton University and the author of “Dubious Gastronomy: Eating Asian in the USA.” “A lot of celebrity chefs have been Asian and Asian American, and reintroduced Spam to a new audience.”\n\n‘Miracle meat’\n\nMore than 100,000 visitors stream into the Spam museum every year in Austin, Minnesota, with stories to tell about Spam and recipes to share, said Savile Lord, the manager of the museum in the brand’s hometown.

Josh Noel/Minneapolis Star Tribune/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nSpam first hit shelves in 1937 as a 12-ounce, 25-cent, convenient and long-lasting protein in a tin can during the lean years of the Great Depression. Spam contained nothing but pork shoulder, chopped ham, water, sugar and sodium.\n\nIt was a concoction of George Hormel and his son, Jay, meatpackers in Austin. The Hormels had been working on the “problem of canning a nonperishable pork product for a good many years and at last we solved it,” Jay told The New Yorker in 1945.\n\nThey offered a $100 prize for the best name for the food. It needed to be short for display purposes and to fit on one-column newspaper advertisements. It also had to pronounceable in any language.\n\nThe brother of a corporate executive threw out “Spam,” a combination of “spice” and “ham,” at a party, and Hormel “knew then and there that the name was perfect.”\n\nFrom the beginning, Spam was marketed as a time-saver and a food for any meal: Spam and eggs. Spam and pancakes. Spam and beans, spaghetti, macaroni and crackers. Spamwiches.\n\nA pie made with Spam-brand canned meat, potatoes, scallions, and cream of mushroom soup during the 1950s or 1960s. Tom Kelley/Getty Images\n\n“Never have you imagined a meat could turn into so many interesting uses. Morning, noon or night – cold or hot – Spam hits the spot!” read one early advertisement. Spam was a “miracle meat,” the company told consumers in newspaper spots and radio ads.\n\nAnd then came the United States’ entrance into World War II in 1941, the decisive moment in Spam’s growth.\n\nAt many Pacific outposts, which had little refrigeration or local sources of meat, American and Allied troops relied on the canned meat that could be stored away for months and eaten on the go.\n\nHormel says more than 100 million pounds of Spam were shipped overseas to help feed the troops during the war. Uncle Sam became known as Uncle Spam, much to the dismay of troops forced to eat it every single day.\n\n“During World War II, of course, I ate my share of Spam along with millions of other soldiers,” Dwight D. Eisenhower later wrote to Hormel’s president. “I’ll even confess to a few unkind remarks about it – uttered during the strain of battle.”\n\nFor the citizens of conflict-wracked countries in the Pacific struggling with hunger and famine during the war and rebuilding years, however, Spam was a symbol of access to American goods and services. Sometimes, it was the only protein source available. After US troops left, Spam remained, becoming an ingredient in local dishes.\n\n“Spam became part of Asian culture,” said Ayalla Ruvio, a consumer behavior researcher at Michigan State University who studies identity and consumption habits. “It represented a piece of America. It’s like Coca-Cola or McDonald’s.”\n\nAmerican troops also introduced Spam in Korea during the Korean War in the early 1950s, and Budae Jjigae (Army Stew) became a popular Korean dish. Spam also remains a common ingredient in dishes almost anywhere US soldiers were stationed, such as Guam, the Philippines and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nIn Hawaii, where the US military has long been a major presence, more Spam is consumed per person than any other state. It’s stacked on a block of rice and wrapped in seaweed to make Spam musubi and sold at fast-food chains like McDonald’s in Hawaii. There’s even an annual Waikiki Spam Jam festival.\n\nSpam musubi and tacos\n\nMany US soldiers returning from World War II vowed never to eat Spam again, and the brand became linked to rationing and economic hardship. But Spam has appealed to new consumers in the United States in recent years.\n\nSpam musubi, a common Japanese lunch dish that was created in Hawaii.

As more people have been introduced to these dishes, they go home and try to make their own versions, Lillis said.\n\nSpam highlights its versatility in dishes on social media and TV advertisements. There are ads for Spam and eggs, as well as Spam fried rice, Spam musubi, yakitori, and poke.\n\nSpam has made a comeback in the United States because Asian and Asian American chefs such as Chris Oh have tried to reinvent it in their own ways, said Ku, the Binghamton University professor. “They brought some of the culinary influences of Asia and the Pacific and upscaled it.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/business/ftx-bankruptcy-one-million-customers/index.html", "title": "Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX may have over 1 million creditors as ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nBankrupt crypto exchange FTX could have more than 1 million creditors and has been in contact with “dozens” of regulators around the world, according to court documents, underlining the far-reaching impact from the stunning collapse of one of the industry’s biggest players.\n\nThe new bankruptcy court filings also offer new details into the liquidity crisis that caused FTX to implode and called out the role of Sam Bankman-Fried, the exchange’s 30-year-old founder and one of the faces of the crypto industry.\n\nIn filings dated Monday, FTX’s lawyers say there is “substantial interest in these events” from regulatory authorities around the world.\n\nIn just the past 72 hours, FTX says its representatives have been in touch with “dozens” of federal, state and international regulatory agencies, including with the US Attorney’s Office, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nA person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN on Monday that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating the FTX collapse.\n\nFTX filed for bankruptcy last week and at the time estimated it had more than 100,000 creditors.

Drivers could grab a drink or snack while waiting for their vehicle to charge. But despite available federal funding to build EV chargers, many stores aren’t biting. The reason? High electric utility fees on charging stations make them unappealing – and unprofitable – for convenience store owners.\n\nThe bipartisan infrastructure bill is providing $7.5 billion to help pay for electric vehicle chargers that could help gradually replace gas pumps. But sky-high fees combined with competition from utilities and spotty electric vehicle uptake have dampened interest from convenience stores in building out this essential infrastructure.\n\nCharging four vehicles at once at a station could cost the operator $250,000 a year in supplemental fees, called demand charges, according to Jigar Shah, Head of Energy Services at Electrify America, which operates the largest public charger network in the US.\n\nElectric utilities, whose operations and fees vary from state to state, charge demand charges, which apply when businesses draw a lot of power at once, even if only for a short time period. Residential customers generally don’t pay them.\n\nDemand charges can make up 90% of a charging station’s electric costs, research has found. These fees can vary widely and are triggered by drawing a lot of energy at once, which is required to quickly charge even a single electric vehicle.\n\nRetailers with a high volume of sales can pass these costs on to customers without them feeling a marked increase in charging costs.\n\nWhen chargers make sense\n\nJacob Maass, commercial fuels manager at Iowa-based Kum and Go, said the convenience store has become more careful and strategic about where it places electric vehicle chargers since installing its first charger in 2008. In 2017 it installed its first fast charger, which charges vehicles more quickly but can bring those huge fees because of how fast it gulps power. Kum and Go has chargers at 35 of its 400 locations. Even a single charger operating at the speeds required by the Biden charging grants could lead to large fees.\n\nMaass said Kum and Go is interested in how to get people out of their cars during electric vehicle charging and into its convenience stores. Businesses like Kum and Go depend on their fuel pumps to attract customers who make purchases in their stores. Convenience stores with fuel pumps account for 80% of fuel purchased in the US, according to the industry trade group.\n\nBut despite all that revenue, the real money lies when customers step inside a convenience store for an additional purchase. Most profits come not from fuel, but convenience store sales.\n\nA Kum & Go LC gas station is shown in Colorado, Springs, Colorado. Chet Strange/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nSome electrification experts say convenience stores could seize a huge opportunity. Customers charging electric vehicles must stick around longer, so they may be more likely to buy food and other goods.\n\nBut the risk of chargers being unprofitable may slow the buildout of fast chargers and adoption of electric vehicles.\n\nRamzey Smith, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, told CNN Business that demand charges can be mitigated through solutions like on-site battery storage, solar generation, energy management strategies and regulatory approaches.\n\nSome states and utilities have already taken steps to lessen fees so charger installation isn’t hampered. New York’s utility regulator proposed last month that the state’s utilities should offer lower rates to public EV chargers that are used sparingly. These fees would gradually increase the more chargers are used.\n\nTo date, 36 states have addressed or begun to address demand charges, according to Chargepoint, which helps businesses set-up chargers.\n\nFor now, convenience stores like Kum and Go risk thousands of dollars in demand charges in many states, depending on how customers utilize their chargers.\n\nFor EV charger operators with a high volume of customers, these fees can be less significant. They can be spread out evenly among a large pool of customers. But for businesses in areas with light adoption of electric vehicles, the fees are too onerous to pass on to a customer who will be unwilling to pay extra to charge their vehicle.\n\n“While EV adoption is low, utilization will also be low, and costs for electricity will be high,” Minnesota, one of many states to identify demand charges as a challenge, cautioned in its electric vehicle charging plan.\n\nMaass says that Kum and Go now works with utility companies to make sure they’ll be able to afford the rates. Some offer special rates for electric vehicle charging.\n\n“They knock them down to where we’re not losing everything that we have, or everything we’re making just to have an EV charger on site,” Maass told CNN Business.\n\nConvenience stores could try to work around demand charges by installing battery back-ups at their chargers. The battery back-ups would enable convenience stores to slowly draw power throughout the day, especially at times of lower demand, accumulating the energy in the batteries, and then discharging it quickly when an EV needs to charge up. That way the convenience stores aren’t pulling a huge amount of power from the grid at once.\n\nA driver stops at a Tesla charging station at a Sheetz. Nate Smallwood/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe infrastructure bill sends federal money to states, who can award it through grants to entities that want to install electric chargers. But these grant applicants, who could be businesses, municipal governments or non-profits, will have to provide 20% of funds for chargers.\n\nFederal funds can be used to cover batteries, according to the Department of Energy’s Smith. Some charger operators have already turned to batteries. Electrify America has installed battery storage at more than 140 of its fast-charging stations.\n\nBut battery-backup can make a charging station cost several times as much as otherwise, according to John DeBoer, who leads electric mobility efforts at Siemens, which installs chargers for companies like Amazon.\n\nFresh competition\n\nSome convenience stores are also concerned about direct competition from utilities.\n\nTrevor Walter, a Sheetz executive testifying for the National Association of Convenience Stores on Capitol Hill earlier this year, warned of the “threat of regulated utilities making use of their status as monopolies to gain a competitive edge over private businesses.”\n\nMany utilities effectively have monopolies on their markets, as the costs to enter their markets are exorbitantly high. This lack of competition in their core business gives them an advantage over most private companies they may compete with on electric chargers.\n\nUtilities also may not have any incentive to adjust their demand charges if they’re building their own electric vehicle chargers. Most utilities are not building out electric vehicle chargers, but some have started to.\n\nXcel, a utility operating in Minnesota, has said it plans to build hundreds of chargers in the state. Xcel declined to comment for this story.\n\nGeorgia Power is investing in electric vehicle charging too. It has characterized its investment as supplemental to other businesses. It has claimed the chargers are primarily in places that are unlikely to see private investment.\n\n“No private business is going to risk thousands of dollars of buying and installing and maintaining and operating EV charging stations if there’s the risk or reality of Georgia Power or Xcel or Dominion [Power] doing the exact same thing down the street for half the price,” said Ryan McKinnon, a spokesman for the Charge Ahead Partnership, which represents businesses.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/business/wordle-internet-game-explainer/index.html", "title": "Meet Wordle, the internet's latest obsession | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nWonder what those green and yellow tiles all over your social media feeds are? It’s Wordle, a new no-frills word game that has charmed the internet.\n\nThink of it as Mastermind, but with words instead of colored pegs. Or a mini crossword without clues. You start by choosing any five-letter word and typing it out into the grid. Any incorrect letter pops up in grey. Correct letters turn yellow, and if the letter is also in the right spot it turns green. Users have six tries to guess the word — that’s it — the fewer tries, the better. Kinda like golf.\n\nWordle internet word game Brook Joyner/CNN\n\nIn the midst of a chaotic, polarized news cycle, a simple word game may be just what the internet needs.\n\nEven the story behind the game is intriguing. The New York Times reported it was created by software engineer Josh Wardle for his partner, who loves word games. Wardle – yes, even the game’s name is a play on words – eventually took his side project to the public in October after its popularity on a family groupchat. It’s since grown from 90 players to 300,000 as of last Sunday.\n\n“It’s something that encourages you to spend three minutes a day,” he said in an interview with the Times. “It doesn’t want any more of your time than that.”\n\nDeepak Venkatasubramanian of Charlotte, N.C., checks Wordle like the morning paper. It is refreshing to have a sense of routine during a pandemic and in a society with an oversaturation of information, he said. He played a similar word game on family road trips growing up, and now he plays Wordle in a group chat with his friends to keep in touch. His group of recent college graduates even made an Excel sheet to keep tally of scores.\n\n“We have a culture of being able to access everything at once,” Venkatasubramanian said. “It’s like waiting for an episode of your favorite television show to drop.”\n\nThe game, a simple enough combination of logic and sheer luck, is blowing up on social media and group chats alike, after Wardle created an easy way to share results by allowing users to copy and paste their colored squares without giving away the word. Thousands of people post their scores every day on Twitter, revealing how many, or how few, tries it took them to solve the puzzle and in what order.\n\nFor many, it’s become part of their daily routine. Wardle posts a new game every 24 hours on a website he created. There are no frills. Also, no pop-up ads, no pesky login information, no cash grabs.\n\n“I don’t understand why something can’t just be fun. I don’t have to charge people money for this and ideally would like to keep it that way,” Wardle said in an interview Wednesday with BBC Radio 4.", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/politics/americans-with-disabilities-act-transgender-gender-dysphoria/index.html", "title": "Federal appeals court says Americans with Disabilities Act ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nA federal appeals court said Tuesday that the Americans with Disabilities Act covers individuals with “gender dysphoria,” handing a win to trans people in a case concerning a former inmate who alleged discrimination at a Virginia prison.\n\nIn a majority opinion issued by a three-judge panel with the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the court wrote, “In light of the ‘basic promise of equality … that animates the ADA,’ we see no legitimate reason why Congress would intend to exclude from the ADA’s protections transgender people who suffer from gender dysphoria.”\n\nGender dysphoria describes an uncomfortable conflict between a person’s assigned gender and the gender with which the person identifies, according to the American Psychiatric Association.\n\n“We have little trouble concluding that a law excluding from ADA protection both ‘gender identity disorders’ and gender dysphoria would discriminate against transgender people as a class, implicating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,” the ruling read, referring to a constitutional clause that has been used in court to protect minority groups from discrimination.\n\nThe treatment of trans inmates has long been a focus of advocates for trans rights, with stories of abuse fueling calls for reforms and more targeted anti-discrimination laws. Activists hailed Tuesday’s ruling, saying it will be a helpful precedent for future litigation.\n\nThe case at hand concerned Kesha Williams, a trans woman with gender dysphoria who was held for six months at a Virginia prison.\n\n“Though prison deputies initially assigned her to women’s housing, they quickly moved her to men’s housing when they learned that she was transgender,” according to the ruling, which said that while held in the men’s facility, Williams “experienced delays in medical treatment for her gender dysphoria, harassment by other inmates, and persistent and intentional misgendering and harassment by prison deputies.”\n\nWilliams sued several individuals connected to the prison, claiming that the way she was treated was a violation of the ADA and other laws.\n\nA district court initially dismissed Williams’ case on the basis of the ADA’s explicit exclusion of “gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments” from protection under the law. Williams appealed, arguing that because the language of the exclusion is dated and undefined, it was up to the court to determine whether gender dysphoria is protected under the ADA.\n\nThe appeals court, citing an updated medical understanding, reversed the lower court’s dismissal.\n\n“In sum, we hold that Williams has plausibly alleged that gender dysphoria does not fall within the ADA’s exclusion for ‘gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments,’” the ruling said.\n\nCNN reached out to attorneys for several of the defendants named in the case for comment.\n\nThough the matter still needs to go back to a lower court to settle additional questions central to the case, Joshua Erlich, an attorney for Williams, told CNN that Tuesday’s ruling “is a really meaningful win for trans people more broadly because this opinion applies not just (to) people who are incarcerated, but for workplace accommodations, for public accommodations.”\n\n“The ruling in this case is consistent with the ruling in Bostock several years ago … that extended employment protections under Title VII to trans employees,” he said, referring to a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that said federal civil rights law protects LGBTQ workers.\n\nHe continued: “I think that this ruling in a lot of ways was mandated by the language in Bostock. To the extent that Bostock has created a positive trajectory for trans rights, this is a continuation of that.”\n\nA number of advocacy groups signed onto a friend-of-the-court brief for the case co-authored by the LGBTQ legal rights group GLAD and the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR). In a statement following the ruling, NCLR’s legal director Shannon Minter said that the “decision sets a powerful precedent that will be important for other courts considering this critical issue.”\n\nAnd Jennifer Levi, the director of GLAD’s Transgender Rights Project, said in the same statement that it “would turn disability law upside down to exclude someone from its protection because of having a stigmatized medical condition.”\n\n“This opinion goes a long way toward removing social and cultural barriers that keep people with treatable, but misunderstood, medical conditions from being able to thrive,” Levi said.", "authors": ["Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}]}

The decision also comes as Boeing faces intense scrutiny from regulators and customers amid a series of crises, including when a door panel blew off a 737 Max Alaska Air jetliner in mid-air in January.\n\nTens of thousands of machinists voted Thursday to reject a proposed deal between the company and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM,) whose members produce Boeing's 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas. The rejection was despite the significantly boosted pay and benefits the deal would have offered, according to multiple reports.\n\nOf the roughly 30,000 union members, 96% voted in favor of the strike, according to reports. Just two-thirds were needed to approve a work stoppage, Reuters reported.\n\nThe strike could be seen as a blow to new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over in August with the mandate to restore the company's image as the premier American aerospace manufacturer.

The deal also included better retirement benefits and gave the union more input into the safety and quality of the production system.\n\nAlthough union leadership called it \"the best contract we've negotiated in our history,\" many workers were angry about the loss of an annual bonus, larger raises and other original demands.\n\n\"This is about respect, this is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, who headed the negotiations for Boeing's largest union, before announcing the vote result on Thursday evening, per Reuters.\n\nStrike begins; Boeing wants to get back to bargaining table\n\nEven before Thursday's vote, workers had been protesting this week at Boeing factories in the Seattle area that assemble Boeing's Max 777 and 767 jets.\n\nNow that the strike is in effect, workers assembled shortly after midnight outside factory entrances, waving placards reading \"On Strike Against Boeing.\" Some motorists passing by honked their horns in support, according to Reuters.\n\nSome workers indicated they're willing to maintain the picket line for the long haul.\n\n“I’m willing to strike for two months or even longer,\" said James Mann, a 26-year-old who works in a wings division at Boeing. \"Let’s go as long as it takes to get what we deserve.\"\n\nBut for Boeing leaders, they're hoping to get union officials back to the bargaining table as quickly as possible.\n\n\"We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement,\" the planemaker said in a statement on Thursday to Reuters.\n\nHolden told reporters that \"we're going to get back to the table as quickly as we can,\" Reuters reported.

Those wrecks were ultimately attributed to poorly designed, undisclosed flight control software, and Boeing agreed to plead guilty to one count of criminal fraud in connection with the case.\n\nThen in January, an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 lost a door panel that blew off a section of its fuselage shortly after takeoff. No serious injuries were reported, but more than 100 planes were again grounded, and regulatory scrutiny of Boeing ramped up.\n\nBoeing also experienced major setbacks with its Starliner spacecraft, which it designed and built to one day make crewed missions to the International Space Station for NASA. The Starliner's first crewed test flight encountered a slew of technical issues that forced NASA to return it to Earth last week without its crew, who remain at the space station.\n\nThe task of returning the Starliner astronauts to Earth will instead fall to Boeing's spaceflight competitor, SpaceX.\n\nContributing: Zach Wichter, USA TODAY; Reuters\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

However, it is not clear when the planemaker would announce its next jet.\n\nBoeing and rival Airbus are in the early stages of drawing up strategies for replacements of their best-selling single-aisle models expected to enter service in the late 2030s.\n\nBoeing’s decision to commit early to its main Northwest planemaking hub for new models contrasts with previous efforts to compete in different locations, which have irked the IAM.\n\n\"This would go along with our other flagship models, meaning job security for generations to come,\" said Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope in a message to employees.\n\nOrtberg, who is under pressure to change Boeing's culture to improve quality, also needs to address labor relations and the company's future, said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. Ortberg is a former Rockwell Collins executive who moved to Seattle to head the company.\n\n\"Changing the culture starts with a different attitude towards labor and towards the future with new product development,\" Aboulafia said on Sunday.\n\nBoeing simultaneously faces significant financial pressures as it continues to lose money. In July it posted a second-quarter net loss of $1.44 billion.\n\nLast week, Wells Fargo said Boeing's annual free cash flow target of $10 billion may be delayed by about two years to 2027-28 and the company may have to raise $30 billion before developing a new aircraft. Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Akers said Boeing carries about $45 billion net debt.\n\nAn accepted deal would secure labor peace for Boeing at a time when the planemaker is burning cash and trying to raise production of its strongest-selling 737 MAX to a target rate of 38 aircraft per month by the year's end.\n\nThe union fell short of its early goal of achieving a 40% raise but still hailed the agreement.\n\n\"Although there was no way to achieve success on every single item, we can honestly say that this proposal is the best contract we've negotiated in our history,\" the IAM union local representing the Boeing workers said in a statement.\n\nThe deal comes as workers are capitalizing on tight labor markets to make gains. The United Auto Workers union won a similar 25% general wage pay hike over four-and-a-half years with the Detroit Three last autumn.\n\nThe talks had been watched by members of the Biden administration, with Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su last week urging the sides in an interview with Reuters to get a \"fair contract.\"\n\nSu had spoken with both Ortberg, a source familiar with the matter said, and union local head Jon Holden.\n\nThe Boeing workers, who produce Boeing's widebody 777 and 767 in addition to the MAX, had voted in favor of a strike mandate in July.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2024/10/03/boeing-workers-union-strike-new-ceo/75493627007/", "title": "Boeing workers union calls on new CEO 'to truly engage' to end strike", "text": "Allison Lampert and David Shepardson\n\nReuters\n\nBoeing's largest union urged new CEO Kelly Ortberg on Tuesday to get more involved in contract negotiations to end a strike by around 33,000 U.S. West Coast workers, after the U.S. planemaker cut off their healthcare benefits.\n\nIn August, the former Rockwell Collins boss took over the reins of Boeing, which has been rocked by multiple crises this year, including the strike that has hit production of Boeing's strongest-selling 737 MAX jets.\n\n\"It’s time for the new CEO to truly engage at the proposal-based level and to take the reins from his subordinates who are fumbling critical decisions like this one,\" said Brian Bryant, president of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) and Aerospace Workers, which represents the striking workers.\n\n\"There is no reason the health benefits question could not have been punted on to allow more time for negotiations at the table,\" Bryant added in a statement.\n\nThe Sept. 30 limit for striking workers to access their Boeing health insurance plans was long known, with the union urging workers on Monday to find alternatives.\n\nTalks between Boeing and the IAM's District 751, which is negotiating the deal, broke off last week and it is not clear when discussions will resume.\n\n\"We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our represented employees and negotiating in good faith, and want to reach an agreement as soon as possible,\" Boeing said in a statement.\n\nBoeing workers in the Seattle area and Portland, Oregon, walked off the job on Sept. 13 in the union's first strike since 2008, halting production of three commercial airplane models and adding financial strain to the planemaker.\n\nThe union is seeking a 40% pay rise and the restoration of a defined-benefit pension that was taken away in the contract a decade ago.\n\nBoeing made an improved offer last week to the striking workers that it described as its \"best and final\", which would give workers a 30% raise over four years and restore a performance bonus, but the union said a survey of its members found that was not enough.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2024/10/08/boeing-continues-strike-talks-with-workers-union/75568058007/", "title": "Boeing resumes strike talks with workers union", "text": "Shivani Tanna\n\nReuters\n\nBoeing and its largest union said they would continue contract talks on Tuesday, as both sides seek an agreement to end a strike by around 33,000 U.S. West Coast factory workers.\n\nThe company and the union, whose members have been on strike for 25 days, had resumed contract talks on Monday in the presence of federal mediators.\n\n\"Although we met with Boeing and federal mediators all day, there was no meaningful movement to report.

What to know about ...", "text": "Update: US port workers and operators reach a deal to end East Coast strike immediately on Oct. 3. Read more.\n\nAlmost 25,000 dockworkers at various ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are striking to ask for higher pay and protections from having their jobs automated out of existence.\n\nMarking the first such strike in almost 50 years, members of the International Longshoremen’s Association walked off the job on Tuesday. In a social media post, the union's president Harold Daggett said the union was fighting for “the kind of wages we deserve.”\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the union blamed the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents docks and ocean carriers, for continuing to block an agreement that would end the strike.\n\n“The Ocean Carriers represented by USMX want to enjoy rich billion-dollar profits that they are making in 2024, while they offer ILA Longshore Workers an unacceptable wage package that we reject,\" the statement said.\n\nWhile 14 ports in the East and Gulf Coast are seeing striking workers, West Coast ports have not been affected as a different union represents its workers. Back in 2023, the West Coast union negotiated wage increases for its workers.\n\nYour money questions, answered. Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\nWhat do dockworkers make? What wages are they proposing?\n\nThe wages negotiated by the West Coast dockworkers union is one of the reasons for the current strike. ILA workers make significantly less than their counterparts.\n\nThe ILA contract that expired on Monday shows that the starting pay for dockworkers was $20 per hour. Pay rises to $24.75 after two years, $31.90 after three and tops out at $39 for workers with at least six years on the job.\n\nMeanwhile, the ILA is demanding a 77% increase over the duration of the contract, with a $5 increase each year of the contract. Workers would make $44 the first year, $49 the second and up to $69 in the final year.\n\nIn recent days, the U.S. Maritime Alliance proposed a smaller increase, nearly 50%, which the ILA rejected.\n\n\"They might claim a significant increase, but they conveniently omit that many of our members are operating multi-million-dollar container-handling equipment for a mere $20 an hour. In some states, the minimum wage is already $15,\" the ILA said.\n\nThe current top wage amounts to about $81,000 per year, but according to a Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor report about a third of local longshoremen made $200,000 or more a year.\n\nHowever, that pay may come with extreme hours. The ILA president, Harold Daggett, told the Associated Press that many of the workers earning high wages work up to 100 hours a week.\n\n“Our members don’t work typical 9-to-5 jobs; they work extraordinary hours, sacrificing time with their families. Our position is firm: we believe in the value our incredible rank-and-file members bring to this industry and to our great nation,” the ILA said in a statement.\n\nThe average U.S. salary was about $59,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor.\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

But school and business closures helped constrain that figure.\n\n“There are a lot of buildings out there that don’t need power this morning, which contributed to the drop,” Public Utility Commission Chairman Peter Lake said at a storm-related public briefing Friday with Gov. Greg Abbott. The PUC oversees ERCOT, which operates the grid.\n\nBut Friday’s peak still reflects huge demand for electricity statewide amid the freezing temperatures and precipitation. On Wednesday, ahead of the ice storm, power demand came in at about 43,000 megawatts around 8 a.m.\n\nDemand was even higher in February 2021, however, when freezing temperatures lasted much longer without a thaw and precipitation was heavier and more widespread. In that storm, peak demand was estimated at about 77,000 megawatts, although much of it went unfilled because of the blackouts triggered by the failure of the grid.\n\nOne megawatt of electricity can power about 200 homes.\n\nNearly 3,000 people without power in Williamson County\n\nThe Pedernales Electric Cooperative outage map, reported six total outages in its coverage area, but the largest outage has left 2,813 people near Cedar Park without power Friday afternoon.\n\nIt could be a few hours before the issue is repaired.\n\nThe company manages more than 366,000 meters throughout Hays and Williamson counties and in the Hill Country. More than 99% of customers still had power.\n\nIn Austin, 25 people in Southeast Austin were without power on Friday. Around a dozen in Hays County were also without power.\n\n50 people without power in Austin\n\nOnly two outages have been reported in Austin as of 11:05 a.m., affecting around 50 customers — the largest being in Southeast Austin near Texas 71 and U.S. 183. Residents, who saw power outages in West and Northeast Austin have seen power return.\n\nFriday's report is a significant improvement from Thursday, when hundreds of residents across the city were without power throughout the day.\n\nAustin Energy spokesperson Kim Doyal said that the largest outage on Thursday — as measured by the number of people impacted and how long it took power to be restored — was in a neighborhood north of West Lake Hills of Westlake Pass.\n\nThe outage was caused by a large tree that fell and took down some power lines, which knocked out power for 149 customers. Overall, Austin Energy maintained power to around 99.5% of customers or more throughout the day Thursday, she said.\n\nDoyal said the western part of the city, and nearby smaller cities up in the hills, often experience unique challenges during storms because of the foliage and terrain.\n\n“They have more of those hills, trees, canyons, and really large old growth trees out there,” she said. “Our crews maintain those every year, we're constantly trimming trees. But even if they're trimmed way back, an entire tree that's located 30 feet from the wires could fall during this freeze — maybe it was dead or it wasn't super healthy — it freezes, it falls over it can take down an entire neighborhood.”\n\nDoyal said that during storms, not all outages can be prevented. However, one step people can take year round is to report trees that look unhealthy or trees that are growing near power lines. Maintenance requests can be sent in on Austin Energy’s website or by calling 311.\n\nMore than 100 without power in West Austin, some outages in Hill Country\n\nAn outage has been reported in West Austin near the Common Fords neighborhood just off of Bee Cave Road and Cuernavaca Drive that is affecting 136 homes in the area. At least one home in Northwest Austin near Anderson Mill also did not have power Friday morning, according to the Austin Energy outage map.\n\nCrews have been assigned to the outage and are expected to restore power quickly.\n\nMore than 99% of Austin Energy customers were still with power Friday morning.\n\nAt least 30 customers in the Hill County — mainly in Burnet County — were also without power on Friday, according to the Pedernales Electric Cooperative outage map.\n\nSo far so good for the Texas power grid\n\nWith anticipated peak consumer demand for electricity approaching Friday morning, conditions on the grid continued to be normal — meaning power supplies were sufficient to cover it — according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the grid.\n\nERCOT also lowered its forecast for peak demand.\n\nOn Thursday, the agency’s estimate called for Friday’s peak to come at about 8 a.m. and total nearly 74,000 megawatts. But the latest forecast pegged the 8 a.m. peak at about 67,500 megawatts.\n\nThe projection still reflects huge power demand statewide amid the freezing temperatures and wintry conditions. On Wednesday, prior to the storm, power demand came in at about 43,000 megawatts at 8 a.m.\n\nPrices on the ERCOT wholesale electricity market climbed Friday as a result of the big demand. That’s because the state's deregulated electricity market relies mainly on financial incentives to prompt generators to deliver more power to the grid in times of high usage.\n\nThe real-time spot price of wholesale electricity on the grid was averaging about $57 per megawatt hour, compared to about $25 typically under normal conditions.\n\nIn December, state regulators cut the maximum allowable price by about 45%, dropping it from $9,000 per megawatt hour to $5,000.\n\nThe previous $9,000 price ceiling was behind much of the direct financial havoc caused by the near collapse of the power grid in February 2021. At the time, multiple days of subfreezing temperatures and prolonged precipitation caused a cascade of failures across the energy sector — triggering extensive blackouts on the grid that contributed to hundreds of deaths and billions of dollars in property damage.\n\nOne megawatt of electricity can power about 200 homes.\n\nOutages affecting only dozens\n\nDozens of Austin residents are waking up without electricity Friday — a significant improvement over the few thousands that lost power Thursday — after more than 24 hours of subfreezing temperatures.\n\nThe weather forecast for Austin calls for dry skies for at least the next several days, so the threat of icy accumulation weighing down tree limbs or power lines has diminished.\n\nAustin Energy at 6 a.m. Friday reported that 31 people in Central Austin lost power at around 4:39 a.m., with an estimated restoration time of 7:02 a.m. Friday.\n\nMore:ERCOT expects higher power use amid cold snap, but says Texas grid can handle demand\n\nThe power outages on Friday morning were a dim comparison to the loss of electricity Thursday morning.\n\nAt one point, as many as 3,200 customers were without power just before noon Thursday. But only about 200 people in Rollingwood and West Lake Hills, west of Austin, were without power by Thursday afternoon.\n\nMore:Austin suspends trash pick-up, COVID-19 testing sites, other non-essential operations amid freeze\n\nOncor Electric, which serves Williamson County, reported 171 outages in areas between Temple and Austin early Friday.\n\nNearly 100 of those outages were in, or located east of, Pflugerville. Power to those areas likely will not be restored until around 10:30 a.m. Friday.\n\nBastrop County had 42 of its residents without power Friday morning, according to Bluebonnet Electric. Of those, 10 of the customers affected live west of Luling and 32 live west of Giddings.\n\nHays County had no power outages as of 6 a.m. Friday morning.\n\nPower grid holding up\n\nGrid conditions were normal — meaning power supplies were sufficient for current demand — according to ERCOT's website early Friday.\n\nDemand totaled about 65,700 by 6 a.m. Friday, compared with about 45,000 megawatts before freezing temperatures began Wednesday.\n\nERCOT listed its operating reserves at about 6,874 megawatts, and it said previously that the grid has a total generating capacity of about 86,000 megawatts if needed.\n\nDemand is expected to peak at just under 75,000 megawatts at about 8 a.m. Friday.\n\nPrices on the ERCOT wholesale electricity market were climbing Thursday as a result of the big demand. That’s because the state's deregulated electricity market relies mainly on financial incentives to prompt generators to deliver more power to the grid in times of high usage.\n\nThe spot price of wholesale electricity on the grid was averaging about $36 per megawatt hour Thursday morning, although some prices in the day-ahead wholesale market topped $133.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/03/hurricane-helene-aftermath-live-updates/75493504007/", "title": "Helene death toll tops 200 amid daunting water and power issues ...", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Hurricane Helene's aftermath for Thursday, Oct. 3.

Those winds quickly diminished, but the drenching rains overwhelmed a 500-mile long swath of the already-saturated region.\n\nFlash flooding from creeks and rivers conspired with Appalachian mudslides to sweep away scores of people, destroy homes and businesses, collapse roads and devastate entire communities.\n\nMiracles in the mud:Heroes, helping hands emerge from Hurricane Helene aftermath\n\nIn rural North Carolina, families divided over the way forward\n\nMEAT CAMP, N.C. — Carolyn and Clifford Coffee’s home is less than 10 miles from Boone, a North Carolina college town popular with tourists set between a creek and steep hillsides. The two-lane road to reach it along Meat Camp Creek is now dotted with washed-out pavement and bridges, downed powerlines and damaged homes.\n\nCarolyn, 77, and Clifford, 80, have lived here for 40 years. Clifford built their home himself by connecting two trailers. But Hurricane Helene’s torrential rains, which caused deadly landslides and floods, left Carolyn terrified.\n\n“We just prayed to God,” she said, adding that while her husband wants to rebuild, \"I want to move.\" Read more here.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\n'So many hollers':Appalachia's remote terrain slows recovery from Helene\n\nBiden tells hard-hit states US 'has your back'\n\nBiden visited Greenville, South Carolina, on Wednesday and later got an aerial view of the extensive damage in Asheville.

Bill Lee and First Lady Maria Lee walked through paths of rubble late Sunday as they surveyed the tornado damage along Nesbitt Lane in Madison, where three people were killed.\n\nThe governor talked with some residents as the First Lady gave hugs and words of encouragement.\n\n\"I’m happy to see you, governor. Thank you for coming,\" said resident Keith Speer, whose home was damaged.\n\nLee and his wife stopped in a mobile home park where a mother and her two-year-old child were killed in the storm.\n\nThey met with resident James Gibson and his 16-year-old son Dylan, who were both inside their mobile home when it was demolished.\n\nThey miraculously survived, though they lost everything.\n\n“I didn’t expect the governor to be here,” Dylan Gibson said.\n\nLee previously visited Gallatin, Hendersonville and Clarksville, where another three people were killed.\n\nWhile the damage is “sad and heartbreaking,” Lee said he was touched by the Volunteer State’s fortitude.\n\n“Everywhere we went, we saw volunteers… Tennesseans that were coming into neighborhoods they didn’t live in and coming alongside people to make sure they were doing all they could to help,” he said.\n\nLee added the emergency relief has begun and the community is banding together.\n\n“I encourage Tennesseans to pray for their neighbors,” he said. “There are a lot of people hurting right now.”\n\nFamily says dog's warnings 'saved our lives'\n\nChristina Johnson was in the garage with her husband when they noticed their dog George’s behavior change dramatically.\n\nThe beagle instantly transformed from calm to panicked, scratching and whining – like he does during 4th of July fireworks, Johnson said.\n\n“That’s not something he does,” she said. “So I came back in to see if I could get him to calm down.”\n\nThat’s when she said she saw a tree and shed fly past her window. Her ears popped.\n\nShe ran to her husband, yelling: “Tornado,\" and they all crowded into the bathroom.\n\nThere were no sounds of a train like people often say, just strong winds, she remembered.\n\n“The only thing on my mind was I hope we’re still here,” Johnson said. “I mean it took a tree and our shed. It could be our roof next.”\n\nWhen it was over, there was a broken window and a few roof injuries, she said. Some of the others on her street were hit much harder.\n\n“We’re thankful to be here still and have our home,” Johnson said. “Especially when we see what it did around us.\n\n“George saved our lives. If it weren’t for him we would’ve been outside until it was too late.”\n\nTwo tornadoes confirmed, ranked\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed storm survey findings Sunday evening, with the Clarksville tornado rating as an EF-3, with winds of 150 mph. The Madison/Hendersonville/Gallatin tornado received a preliminary rating of EF-2, with winds of 125 mph.\n\nFamily withstands 'UFO'-like tornado in hallway\n\nMany associate a tornado with the sound of a freight train, but Clarksville’s Dustin Arnold experienced a visual of a flying trampoline as he headed for shelter.\n\n\"It went straight in the air like a UFO summoned it,\" Arnold, 35, said. \"It didn’t turn or anything.\"\n\nArnold, an active U.S. Army soldier, suffered heavy damage to his home on Cabana Drive. Along with the trampoline visual, he said glass shattering was probably the most memorable noise.\n\nHe and his wife were working in the garage with their nine-year-old daughter reading upstairs when the wind picked up and notifications for the oncoming storm began. They sheltered in the downstairs center hallway.\n\nNo one was injured, including the family's black Labrador mix, despite portions of the roof and a back wall being taken off. A speed-limit sign landed in the living room and a neighbor's shed settled in their yard — near where Arnold's shed stood before the storm.\n\n\"The whole thing happened in about 45 seconds,\" Arnold said. \"It was very aggressive. (Initially) you don’t know your house is gone. I’m definitely blessed. Not even a couple blocks over are people without a home. Ours isn’t habitable, but it’s not as bad off.\"\n\nThe family was able to salvage some possessions. They are able to retreat to a hotel through the military.\n\nTEMA preliminary inspections report 13 tornadoes hit at least 11 counties\n\nEleven Middle Tennessee counties experienced various levels of damage from the severe storms and tornadoes that battered the state on Saturday night.\n\nNine of those counties were likely hit by one or more of 13 tornadoes that moved through the region, according to preliminary data from Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.\n\nWhen all the damage is inspected, the National Weather Service said counties affected by severe weather damage will be \"likely double\" that.\n\nBy Sunday afternoon, only two tornadoes were confirmed by radar in Clarksville and in the area of North Nashville and Gallatin.\n\nAt least four counties have reported damage from straight-line winds.\n\nStorms rolled in Saturday afternoon a little after 12:30 p.m., crossing the Tennessee River into Stewart County, where the first tornado warning was issued at 1:22 p.m. Hardest-hit areas were Clarksville, Madison, Hendersonville, Gallatin and Springfield.\n\nIn total, 34 storm warnings were called across the Middle Tennessee region, with 20 of those being tornado warnings.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a \"tornado emergency\" alert for parts of the region for the first time in more than a decade as the storms swept through, according to meteorologist Sam Shamburger.\n\nRain amounts for the area vary, but according to National Weather Service, an estimated .5 to one inch of rain fell, with volunteers in Williamson, Rutherford, Wilson and Humphreys Counties reporting more than one inch.\n\nHundreds of buildings damaged in Clarksville\n\nThe Montgomery County Emergency Management Agency reported Sunday that Clarksville has 65 structures with minor damage, 339 with moderate damage and 271 with major damage, making them uninhabitable. There are 91 structures that are totally destroyed, based on the latest assessment from EMA.The vast majority of these structures are residential homes. Numbers are expected to rise as assessments continue.\n\nClarksville-Montgomery County school facilities suffered mostly minor damage, with West Creek Elementary School being the hardest-hit.\n\nFort Campbell families displaced\n\nCol.

I heard some loud explosions. It lasted for 30 seconds.”\n\nIn a moment, the roof was blown off, the windows blown out and 2X4 planks thrust through walls.\n\nBut through it all, no one was injured.\n\n“That is why we are grateful,” he said.\n\nThe storm also damaged his business truck that does heavy hauling. The family decided to stay with a relative as they work through the insurance process.\n\nBusinesses took the brunt of the damage in Hendersonville\n\nAlong Hendersonville’s Highway 31, many businesses showed scars of Saturday’s severe storms.\n\nAn Ace Hardware store owned by Greg Yandell was open Sunday without power as employees used flashlights to show customers products they needed to begin repairs. They ran the cash registers off a generator.\n\nThe storm damaged the roof and the 8,000-square-foot garden center.\n\n“Most of what was hit in Hendersonville was commercial property, which means business owners are significantly impacted,” Yandell said.\n\nNearby, nearly 400 people were inside family-entertainment center Big Play when the storm hit. It leveled much of the building, which opened in a shopping center in October.\n\nGame Technician Tanner Watkins, 35, said many inside were there for kids’ birthday parties. They crammed into bathrooms and around a café as the storm approached. Watkins was aware of two injuries that required medical care.\n\n“Someone was watching over everyone in that building last night,” Watkins said as he went through the rubble Sunday morning. “I wasn’t expecting a building this size to be swept away like a tin can.”\n\nHow to help now\n\nThere are many ways to help the recovery efforts from Saturday’s devastating series of tornadoes.\n\nThe community response has already been so strong that rescue workers in Springfield have asked the public to be patient and wait for direction to help with cleanup efforts.\n\n\"A full safety and damage analysis must be completed\" before volunteers can begin cleanup, Springfield city leaders said in a social media post Sunday. \"Once completed, if volunteers are needed, a message will be released to the community. Thank you to everyone eager to volunteer, but at the moment, staying clear of the affected areas will lighten the load on first responders and city workers during the assessment phase.\"\n\nIn the meantime, here are some ways to get involved:\n\nClarksville officials are taking calls from those who want to volunteer at 931-245-2988.\n\nBlood Assurance opened its Clarksville donation center Sunday at 1767 Wilma Rudolph Blvd. Suite E, and is accepting blood donations from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nYAIPak Outreach community organization is accepting donations at 1255 Paradise Hill Road from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. in Clarksville.

Bill Lee declares state of emergency\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee has issued a \"Level 3\" state of emergency declaration for the state of Tennessee, in light of widespread tornado and severe storm damage on Saturday.\n\nA Level 3 declaration is considered a \"serious emergency or minor disaster,\" according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThe designation gives the governor direct control to coordinate disaster response and activates the state's Emergency Operations Center.\n\nSchools closures announced in Montgomery County\n\nClarksville-Montgomery County School System will be closed Monday and Tuesday.\n\nShock hits survivor on Nesbitt Lane in Madison: 'So hard to comprehend'\n\nPhotographer Tonya Osborne heeded severe-storm warnings and left her Madison home early for her gig at Geodis’ Christmas party on Saturday afternoon.\n\nAs she unloaded her gear to start work at the event, her neighbor called crying hysterically.\n\n“She said: ‘Your bedroom. The whole top of your house is gone,’” Osborne said. “I just stood there for a minute, dumbfounded.”\n\nOsborne rushed home despite the rainstorm and fast winds. Her dog and all the belongings she’s accumulated while living at the Nesbitt Lane townhome for 23 years were there.\n\nMost importantly: Her diamond engagement ring, which she always left at home while working.\n\nShe arrived to find her roof and walls gone, leaving her belongings in heaps of rubble.\n\nThe stairwell was exposed to the sky and her sunroom was flattened. The new windows and roof she recently had installed were demolished.\n\nBut, seemingly against all odds, her bedroom nightstand was still standing with her engagement ring.\n\n“It was still sitting on the nightstand next to my bed,” Osborne said. “It’s just floor, bed and dresser. There’s no walls, no roof.”\n\nHer dog survived by hiding under the kitchen table.\n\nOsborne was overjoyed to be reunited with both. She gathered the valuables she could find — a dry coat, shoes, medicine from her refrigerator.\n\nNow, she’s working with her insurance company to get a hotel room.\n\nA few doors down from her Nesbitt Lane home, three people were killed in the tornado.\n\n\"This is so crazy,\" Osborne said, struggling to come to grips with the tragedy. \"It's so hard to comprehend we're not going to see them anymore.\"\n\nFrank Bassett, another Nesbitt Lane resident, said the tornado hit so fast that he barely had time to take cover with a loved one under a pile of pillows in corner of the living room.\n\n\"All of a sudden the wind picked up a hit us,\" Bassett said. \"It was like a millisecond.\"\n\nTheir home, like many on the street, suffered major structural damage.\n\nClear path of destruction in Springfield\n\nAs morning dawned in Springfield on Sunday, the extent of the damage from Saturday's tornadoes became apparent in the area of Memorial Boulevard and Blackpatch Drive on the south side of town.\n\nA clear path of destruction extended through a residential neighborhood, damaging homes and downing trees.\n\nHolman Jewelers, a dental practice and other nearby businesses also suffered heavy damage before the storm moved across Memorial Boulevard to a strip mall, where Jet's Pizza was completely flattened.\n\nThe pizzeria was the worst hit, though all the retail strip businesses, which include an urgent care and cell phone shop, suffered some kind of damage from the passing storm. Kroger's gas pumps and a nearby Valvoline were also extensively damaged as were dozens of cars in the Kroger parking lot.\n\nOn Sunday morning, police and emergency workers maintained a heavy presence in the area. One officer told The Tennessean that three cars from the parking lot had been tossed down an embankment and into a retaining pond.\n\nBricks from the front of the Kroger store had been ripped from the building, but Christmas wreaths still hung neatly near the front doors. A power chair and cart, to assist disabled shoppers, sat in the parking lot, the vinyl ripped from its seat, but it was otherwise unscathed.\n\nUtility crews had worked through the night, but most of the city remained without power Sunday morning.\n\nGallatin residents clean up, feeling 'blessed'\n\nTwo walls of O’Reilly Auto Parts were torn down on South Water Avenue in Gallatin. Behind the building, Amber Gannon’s modular home was spared from the worst with just shingle and siding damage. A large tree in the front yard had been brought down.\n\nGannon said she felt lucky to be walking her dog Sunday morning.\n\n“When I saw that,” Gannon said about the auto-parts store, “I just felt very fortunate. It was windy, you could feel the whole house shaking. There was debris flying everywhere.”\n\nA number of homes along Airport Road in Gallatin suffered extensive damage. Residents and friends started the massive cleanup effort Sunday morning.\n\n\"I feel blessed, it could have been a lot worse,\" said Ronald Durard, 68, as he and wife Ruthie picked up the remains of two porches, two sheds and various parts of other damaged homes with friends and helpers joining the cleanup at their home in The Crossings neighborhood.\n\n\"We lost a lot, but we’re still here,\" Durard said.\n\nRobert Robinson, 64, lives across the street and was in his truck after picking up dinner when the tornado hit. His wife Lisa Robinson was inside.\n\n\"I was backing up and noticed the leaves — I’ve never seen leaves move that fast,\" Robert Robinson said. \"(Lisa) was calling me and said: ‘It’s here.’ Something hit my truck, I think it was that trampoline. I feel lucky.\"\n\nInglewood blocks hit hard by tornado that 'just hit so fast'\n\nNathan Koehn took shelter in his second story apartment off Dickerson Pike when the tornado ripped through his East Nashville neighborhood.\n\nAfter things calmed down, he emerged to see the nearby Community Baptist Church at 3838 Dickerson Pike had been demolished. Emergency workers carried members of the congregation out from the rubble.\n\n“They were pulling people out and carrying them in white tarps,” Koehn said. “The building was totally flattened. It was a sight to see.”\n\nOfficials said 13 survivors were taken to nearby hospitals.\n\nOn Sunday morning, workers cleared power lines from the rubble of the former church building. Nearby, neighbors Jauckque Buford and his son Tehlor sifted through the remains of their home after a massive maple tree crushed a bedroom.\n\nThe Bufords rushed to safety in a back room when they heard the emergency siren.\n\n“It was quiet and then it just hit so fast, it was like 13 seconds,” Tehlor Buford said.\n\nJauckque Buford said this is the family’s second encounter with a tornado. In 1998, their Russell Street home was destroyed.\n\n“We’ll just move forward like we always do,” he said.\n\nDorothy Prayther, one of the congregants at Community Baptist Church, was heading out the door on Saturday evening to attend a banquet in honor of church Pastor Vincent Johnson when she heard the alarm siren and decided to stay home.\n\nThe church had been planning for months for the big celebration and had speakers coming in from Kentucky, she said.\n\nShe later heard that many of her follow congregants had been in the banquet hall when the tornado demolished the building. Prayther went to the scene on Sunday morning trying to get more information on her pastor and fellow church members.\n\n\"I don’t know anything yet,\" she said. \"I hope they’re ok.\"\n\nEmergency shelters open\n\nResidents in need of a place to stay or to get urgent resources can go to the following emergency shelters:\n\nThe Isaac Litton Alumni Center at 4500 Gallatin Pike is open to the public as a Red Cross shelter.\n\nHendersonville residents can go to Beech High School at 3126 Long Hollow Pike and to Cornerstone Church at 1410 Stop 30 Road, which is a Red Cross shelter.\n\nIn Clarksville, a Red Cross shelter is open at Northeast High School, 3701 Trenton Road.\n\nAlso in Clarksville, emergency shelters include: Mosaic Church at 1020 Garrettsburg Road and Church of Christ at 2650 Trenton Road.\n\nMadison Community Center 550 North Dupont Avenue is a Red Cross shelter.\n\nYMCA and YWCA facilities also offer electricity and shelter in many communities.\n\nPower outages roll into Sunday\n\nNashville Electric Service said about 27,000 woke up Sunday without electricity − down from 39,000 on Saturday.\n\n\"While this is significant progress, there continue to be about 27,000 customers without power,\" NES officials said. \"NES crews will continue to work around the clock until all power is restored, however damage is severe in some areas, and it will take our crews time to assess and restore power in these areas.\"\n\nOut-of-state crews are expected to arrive to assist the Nashville Electric Service later today. NES does not have a timeline for the restoration of power for the 26,000 homes still without power this morning. The outages in the Hendersonville area may last days, rather than hours.\n\nHardest-hit areas of Hendersonville, Clarksville, Madison, Gallatin and Springfield are expected to take the longest to recover.\n\n\"Right now, our major focus is on the transmission infrastructure and substations that supply power to the Hendersonville area,\" NES wrote on X. \"The damage is severe and it will take our crews time as the assessments continue into the morning.\"\n\nThere were 13,174 customers without power in Clarksville on Sunday morning, according to CDE Lightband. Meanwhile, emergency responders continued to assess massive damages across the community.\n\nCrews continue to work around downed trees and wires to restore power to the region amid what Dickson County Electric called a \"historic and catastrophic\" severe weather event Saturday evening.\n\nDickson Electric System officials said they reduced outages from 1,700 to 1,117 by 6 a.m. Sunday and deployed all available workers to clear many downed trees and wires. But they acknowledge there is so much debris that the work could take more than a day.\n\nIn Robertson County, Springfield took the brunt of the damage and 5,800 homes remained without power early Sunday.\n\n\"Our Wartrace substation took a direct hit from the storm and sustained substantial damage. Crews are continuing to work to repair the substation,\" the City of Springfield Facebook page reported late Saturday. \"We anticipate that power will not be restored to the areas of Old Greenbrier Pike, Oakland Farms, Legacy and Timberlake tonight.\"\n\nNashville police identify child, two adults killed\n\nPolice identified the three people, including a 2-year-old boy, who were killed in storms in Nashville on Saturday.\n\nJoseph Dalton, 37, was inside his mobile home on Nesbitt Lane in Madison when the storm rolled it on top of the residence of Floridema Gabriel Perez, 31. Both died. Perez's son Anthony Elmer Mendez, 2, was also killed.\n\nTwo other children survived. Perez’s 7-year-old son and Dalton’s 10-year-old son were inside their homes at the time of the storm. They were taken to Vanderbilt Pediatrics with non-life threatening injuries.\n\nNashville mayor declares state of emergency\n\nNashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell declared a state of emergency in Davidson County in a video statement around 10:15 p.m. Saturday\n\n\"Today a storm turned the world upside down for many in our community,\" he said, adding that he is \"heartbroken\" that at least three people were killed in the storm.\n\nFirst responders continued to work to get to hard-to-reach areas. Metro partially activated its Emergency Operations Center and O'Connell has contacted state and federal partners, he said.\n\nNashville Fire Department personnel were searching damaged buildings for anyone who could be trapped inside.\n\nThe Nashville Office of Emergency Management reported a building collapse at Community Church on Dickerson Pike. Thirteen people were transported to nearby hospitals and were last listed in stable condition.\n\n\"While many of you will want to help immediately, for now it is crucial that you stay out of the affected areas and heed guidance from first responders and officials on the ground,\" O'Connell said.\n\nMore information on supporting those impacted will be released in the coming days.\n\nFamily survives Clarksville tornado\n\nMackenzie Underwood huddled with her four children in their basement bathroom while her fiance watched the storm from the porch of their Peggy Drive home.\n\nHer security system had alerted her to the tornado warning. Within five minutes, she said, \"you could hear it coming.\"\n\nHer fiance caught a glimpse of the funnel and ran downstairs to join his family. Behind a mattress in the bathroom, they heard a series of loud booms.\n\n\"It was just trees falling on top of my house,\" she said.\n\nThe tornado blew out the basement windows and broke the hinges on the bathroom door. When they emerged — physically unscathed — they could see the sky where the roof should be. Outside, their detatched garage was \"completely gone\" with its contents strewn across their property, but the carport curiously remained.\n\nUnderwood tried calling 911, but the phone continued to ring for about five minutes. Some lines were down, she said, and she's sure they received a high volume of calls.

And many of the nation’s grid operators are also not taking climate change into account in their planning, even as extreme weather becomes more frequent and more severe.\n\nAll of this suggests that more power outages are on the way, not only this summer but in the coming years as well.\n\nPower operators in the Central US, in their summer readiness report, have already predicted “insufficient firm resources to cover summer peak forecasts.” That assessment accounted for historical weather and the latest NOAA outlook that projects for more extreme weather this summer.\n\nBut energy experts tell CNN that some power grid operators are not considering how the climate crisis is changing our weather — including more frequent extreme events — and that is a problem if the intent is to build a reliable power grid.\n\n“The reality is the electricity system is old and a lot of the infrastructure was built before we started thinking about climate change,” said Romany Webb, a researcher at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “It’s not designed to withstand the impacts of climate change.”\n\nWebb says many power grid operators use historical weather to make investment decisions, rather than the more dire climate projections, simply because they want to avoid the possibility of financial loss for investing in what might happen versus what has already happened. She said it’s the wrong approach and it makes the grid vulnerable.\n\n“We have seen a reluctance on the part of many utilities to factor climate change into their planning processes because they say the science around climate change is too uncertain,” Webb said. “The reality is we know climate change is happening, we know the impact it has in terms of more severe heatwaves, hurricanes, drought, and we know that all of those things affect the electricity system so ignoring those impacts just makes the problems worse.”\n\nMatjaz Krivic\n\nAn early heatwave knocked six power plants offline in Texas earlier this month. Residents were asked to limit electricity use, keeping thermostats at 78 degrees or higher and avoid using large appliances at peak times. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, in its seasonal reliability report, said the state’s power grid is prepared for the summer and has “sufficient” power for “normal” summer conditions, based on average weather from 2006 to 2020.\n\nBut NOAA’s recently released summer outlook forecasts above average temperatures for every county in the nation.\n\n“We are continuing to design and site facilities based on historical weather patterns that we know in the age of climate change are not a good proxy for future conditions,” Webb told CNN.\n\nWhen asked if the agency is creating a blind spot for itself by not accounting for extreme weather predictions, an ERCOT spokesperson told CNN the report “uses a scenario approach to illustrate a range of resource adequacy outcomes based on extreme system conditions, including some extreme weather scenarios.”\n\nThe North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC — a regulating authority that oversees the health of the nation’s electrical infrastructure — has a less optimistic projection.\n\nIn a recent seasonal reliability report, NERC placed Texas at “elevated risk” for blackouts this summer. It also reported that while much of the nation will have adequate electricity this summer, several markets are at risk of energy emergencies.\n\nCalifornia grid operators in its summer reliability report also based its readiness analysis on “the most recent 20 years of historical weather data.” The report also notes the assessment “does not fully reflect more extreme climate induced load and supply uncertainties.”\n\nCompounding the US power grid’s supply and demand problem is drought: NERC tells CNN there’s been a 2% loss of reliable hydropower from the nation’s power-producing dams. Add to that the rapid retirement of many coal power plants — all while nearly everything from toothbrushes to cars are now electrified. Energy experts say adding more renewables into the mix will have the dual impact of cutting climate change inducing greenhouse gas emissions but also increasing the nation’s power supply.\n\nPlan B\n\nOne Chicago neighborhood is already making plans for how to keep the lights, air conditioning and heat on when the larger grid fails.\n\nIn the Bronzeville neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, solar panels dot the rooftop of a public housing complex. A short drive away, a a giant battery stores energy from the solar panels as well as natural gas generators, creating a micro grid. Ilinois-based energy company, Commonwealth Edison, is working with community members to make the neighborhood energy independent.\n\n“Without power we are talking about potential life-threatening situations, so this micro grid provides that backup to be able to deliver power even when the [main] grid isn’t there,” said Paul Pabst, an engineer for Commonwealth Edison.\n\nThe project is pending approval but once it’s operating, the micro grid can connect and share power with the main grid. In the event of a blackout, it can disconnect and operate independently, tapping its stored battery energy to power the homes, police station and hospital in the area for four hours.\n\nYami Newell is a Bronzeville resident and energy advocate. She has seen the cascading effects of an unreliable power grid in Chicago, a place that’s no stranger to weather-related outages from both extreme cold and extreme heat. Losing power in a heatwave can create a dangerous health situation, and for families on a fixed income, losing all of the food in their refrigerator can be financially devastating.\n\n“An energy crisis can become a public health crisis,” Newell told CNN. “It can become a food crisis.”\n\nAs communities look for innovative ways to build a more resilient grid, Bronzeville is one possible blueprint. Until states build a more resilient power grid, climate change will force energy companies to continue to take emergency actions, like asking people to limit electricity use or forced rolling blackouts to manage the grid when supply can’t meet demand.", "authors": ["René Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/hurricane/2024/09/26/hurricane-helene-impacts-tracker-live-updates-from-tallahassee/75386305007/", "title": "Hurricane Helene impacts tracker: Landfall updates from Tallahassee", "text": "A Category 4 Hurricane Helene crashed into the Big Bend as a storm whose fury has never been seen in this area.\n\nAs Helene closed in on Thursday, residents in the path prepared, hoped and prayed.\n\nHere's the latest from the path of the storm:\n\nLeon County Administrator Vince Long: Damage assessments to begin at first light\n\nLeon County Administrator Vince Long, who rode the storm out at the Emergency Operations Center, told the Democrat around 2:40 a.m. Friday that there were a couple of reports of trees on structures but no widespread damage to buildings. He said emergency calls were lower than expected.\n\n“It sort of had us in the crosshairs for quite a while as it moved into the Gulf and closer to us,\" Long said. “And minor degrees of variation in that track can have a major effect on what the impact is here to us.

These evacuation orders let people know the severity of the incident and lets everybody know we won’t be able to respond to you in the storm.

Turnbull Conference Center on campus.\n\nExtreme wind warning issued for several towns\n\nThe National Weather Service of Tallahassee issued an extreme wind warning for Perry, Madison and Monticello until midnight.\n\nThe wind warning does not currently include Tallahassee, but extends just east of Leon County from Capitola to Horseshoe Beach.\n\n\"Treat these imminent extreme winds as if a tornado was approaching and move immediately to an interior room or shelter NOW!\" NWS Tallahassee said in a post on X.\n\nPresident Joe Biden says to take Helene seriously and 'be safe'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he is \"closely tracking Hurricane Helene\" in an 8:50 p.m. post on X.\n\nThe president's team is communicating with state and local officials \"ready to support.\"\n\n\"I urge everyone in and near the path of Helene to listen to local officials and follow evacuation warnings,\" Biden said. \"Take this seriously, and be safe.\"\n\nPower outages start to mount as Helene approaches\n\nCoastal counties are starting to lose power as Hurricane Helene makes her way toward the Big Bend.\n\nAs of 9 p.m. a USA TODAY power outage tracker shows there are:\n\n2,792 power outages reported in Franklin County out of a total 11,403 customers\n\n1,069 power outages reported in Dixie County, out of a total 10,584 customers\n\n884 power outages reported in Wakulla County, out of a total 18,483 customers\n\n554 power outages reported in Leon County, out of a total 132,016 customers\n\n191 power outages reported in Taylor County, out of a total 13,988 customers\n\nAcross the state, there are 543,265 outages reported, of more than 11 million customers, according to the outage map.\n\nCORRECTION:An earlier version of this entry had the incorrect number of customers without power.\n\nAlligator Point loses power, resident says\n\nThe electricity went out at Alligator Point, according to a resident who has been monitoring the storm from his Ring camera.\n\nStace Stroud said his Ring camera and Internet went out around 8:30 p.m. Thursday evening.\n\nHelene expected to make landfall in Taylor County around 10 or 11 p.m.\n\nWinds are steadily picking up as Hurricane Helene closes in on Taylor County.\n\nThe Category 4 storm is expected to make landfall around 10 or 11 p.m., said Andy Haner, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service Tallahassee.\n\nAs of 8:30 p.m. the center was about 75 miles south-southwest of the Taylor County coastline, with the leading edge of Helene’s inner eyewall only about 35 miles offshore Horseshoe Beach in Dixie County.\n\nAn offshore buoy, located 90 miles southeast of Apalachicola, clocked wind gusts at 102 miles per hour, indicating no escape from Helene, Haner said.\n\n“For folks out in places like Perry, Madison, Monticello, out there you could very well come under the eye for maybe 30 or 45 minutes,” he said.\n\nThe strongest winds will rip through Taylor County before the eye arrives, then the calmer eye will hover. But once the eye moves, on winds are going to come from the opposite direction and be just as strong as when they came in, he said.\n\nTallahassee to see worst weather between 9 p.m. and midnight\n\nWinds are picking up in Tallahassee, and now is the time to take shelter, the National Weather Service Tallahassee says.\n\nAs of 8 p.m., the storm was located 130 miles south of Tallahassee with an expected landfall in Taylor County around 10 or 11 p.m., said Andy Haner, a meteorologist at NWS Tallahassee.\n\n“We are at the stage in Tallahassee where people need to be hunkering down,” Haner said.\n\nThe worst weather is expected to hit Tallahassee between 9 p.m. and midnight, he said, simmering down around 1 or 2 a.m.\n\nTallahassee is slated to be in or immediately west of the left side of the eyewall, which is usually where the worst winds of a hurricane are located, he said.\n\nSome of the Big Bend counties will eventually come under an “extreme wind warning” that should prompt residents to take the same precautions as if a tornado was coming.\n\nBy sunrise, winds are projected to be around 15 to 20 miles per hour, “which is less than what we’re seeing outside at this moment,” Haner said.\n\nTallahassee predicted to get 3-6 inches of rain\n\nThe NWS Tallahassee is forecasting 3 to 6 inches of rain along and west of the eyewall including Tallahassee. An area southwest of the city has seen 6 to 10 inches over the past 24 hours but will likely be west of the band of intense rainfall mentioned above.\n\nWhat to do if you hear trees snapping in a hurricane\n\nFlorida Department of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie advised Big Bend residents that if they start to hear trees snapping while sheltering from the hurricane, treat it like a tornado:\n\nTake shelter in an interior portion of their home, such as a windowless bathroom.\n\nGet as low as possible and cover yourself with a heavy blanket, a comforter or even a thin mattress.\n\nThe sound of pine trees snapping is \"an awful lot like fireworks or potentially gunshots, so please make sure if you hear that, act immediately,” Guthrie said.\n\nIf the sound suddenly stops and it becomes calm and quiet, Guthrie warned that does not mean the storm is over. It means you’re in the eyewall of the storm. He urged residents to stay inside, and especially not to start surveying any damage to one's property.\n\n“This eye is projected to be anywhere from 50 miles wide to 20 miles wide. But again, if it's moving at 21 miles an hour, and it's a 20-mile wide eyewall, you may have only 30 minutes, 45 minutes before that eyewall collapses right back on you and trees start snapping again,” Guthrie said.\n\nWeatherTiger: NHC intermediate advisory shows Helene's outer core pushing ashore\n\nHere's an excerpt from the 8:05 p.m. live blog update from Dr. Ryan Truchelut of Tallahassee-based WeatherTiger:\n\n\"The NHC’s 8 p.m. advisory is out, and there is little change from the previous information we had. Estimated minimum central pressure is down to 942 millibars, and motion remains to the north-northeast (25 degrees) at 23 mph.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Checking on radar, Category 4 Helene’s outer core is now pushing on shore into Florida’s Big Bend. While on-the-ground weather observations are sparse in this part of Florida, Cedar Key recently reported sustained winds of 52 mph and a gust to 65 mph, so tropical storm conditions with embedded hurricane-force gusts are likely to overspread the Apalachee Bay coastline in the next hour.\"\n\nLocal officials appear on NewsNation to talk Helene response\n\nLeon County Sheriff Walt McNeil and Tallahassee Mayor John Dailey both appeared on NewsNation this evening to talk about response and recovery plans for Hurricane Helene.\n\nDailey said the city was ready and waiting to see what Mother Nature brings. He also touted the city’s partnership with the state, the Governor’s Office and the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n“We have a saying here in Tallahassee that we’re ‘Tallahassee strong,’ ” Dailey said.\n\nHurricane Helene is now a Category 4\n\nA NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft currently investigating Helene recently found that the maximum sustained winds have increased to 130 mph, according to a post by the National Hurricane Center on X.\n\n\"Helene now an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane,\" the post says.\n\nLeon County say Category 3 force winds are expected inland\n\nHurricane Helene started picking up speed, meaning the storm will get here and be done quicker, Leon County Emergency Management Director Kevin Peters said. But the faster the storm, the stronger the winds inland towns — like Tallahassee — will see.\n\nLeon County’s 5 p.m. forecast showed sustained winds were clocking in at 125 miles per hour, Peters said. Category 3 force winds are still expected to make landfall tonight, alongside six to 12 inches of rainfall.\n\n“Trees will come down, roads will be blocked, power lines will be down, and it’s going to take time to repair and restore and clear all of that,” he said.\n\nPeters said crews are ready to begin restoration efforts as soon as winds die down, but “it’s going to be a process” with a core of the storm this close to Tallahassee.\n\n“We’ve not had that happen in the past,” he said. “We’ve seen storms like Hurricane Michael or Hurricane Idalia, but the cores were a little further away.”\n\nResidents should expect heavy debris and roadblocks and proceed with caution. It’s best to treat every down line as a power line and let the professionals clear them, Peters said.\n\nLatest NHC cone no longer includes western Leon County, but NWS Tallahassee says any eastern shift only 'incremental'\n\nThe National Hurricane Center’s 5 p.m. advisory for Hurricane Helene indicated another small shift to the east, with the cone of uncertainty stretching from eastern Leon County into Taylor County.\n\nThe hurricane’s center line, which ran between Tallahassee and Quincy in earlier forecasts, is now east of there, between Tallahassee and Perry.\n\nHowever, Felicia Bowser, meteorologist in charge with the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, said residents shouldn’t pay attention to the center line.\n\n“If it changed at all, it was very, very incremental,” Bowser said. “The southeast Florida Big Bend is still the same area of where it’s going to be making landfall. So not really that much change in regards to that.”\n\nAnd while some forecasters have predicted later landfalls, Bowser said she still expects the hurricane to make landfall before 10 p.m.\n\n“Just how strong it can get is a little bit questionable at this time,” Bowser said. “But it’s a strong Category 3 hurricane, sustained winds of 125 mph and not too far from Category 4.”\n\nDuring a news conference shortly before 6 p.m., Gov. Ron DeSantis said landfall was expected around 11 p.m. and that the track had shifted toward Taylor County. But the change may not mean much for the capital city.\n\n\"Tallahassee remains in the path of the storm, and the impacts are expected to be significant,\" Mayor John Dailey said in a post on X at about 6 p.m. \"Widespread and prolonged power outages, damage to critical infrastructure, catastrophic damage to the trees and powerlines, widespread inaccessibility due to blocked roads, and damage to well-built structures will all be likely.\"\n\nMost Leon shelters at capacity; evacuees directed to Rickards High shelter\n\nMore than 1,000 people are hunkering down at eight local public schools turned shelters as Hurricane Helene approaches the Big Bend coast.\n\nA district representative said Rickards High School opened this morning to accommodate more evacuees. Aside for Rickards, all other school shelters have reached capacity. Those still seeking shelter must go to Rickards at 3013 Jim Lee Road.\n\nTallahassee City Manager Reese Goad: 2K workers across all utilities will respond to Helene\n\nSome 2,000 workers across all the city utilities and including mutual-aid electric repair crews and contract workers, will be working to restore power and other services once Hurricane Helene has passed, City Manager Reese Goad said in an interview with the Democrat.\n\nGoad said he expects the damage to eclipse Hurricane Michael, which knocked out power to 90% of city customers in 2018. Repairs will take days, but estimates are unlikely until Saturday, after assessments are done. He added that the city put generators at critical intersections to keep signals operating while power is down and will deploy more as needed.\n\n\"I would expect hundreds of roads to be blocked by trees, based on our past experience, and so you'll have a lot of roads that are impacted just by downed trees and wires,\" Goad said. \"And so that'll take some time to dig out from that. Obviously, we would hope that people kind of stay still on Friday, allow the first responders to get out and do their work. Then I would be hopeful by the weekend that, people can start to move about a little bit, things start to resume a little bit of normalcy. But you know how long ... the pace will be for restoration, it's too early to say at this point.\"\n\nFSU athletics hunkers down for Helene\n\nFlorida State Athletics is preparing for the arrival of Hurricane Helene as the potential major hurricane is expected to make landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region.\n\nFor instance, the FSU football team is flying out of Jacksonville International Airport a day ahead of its game against Southern Methodist University in Dallas.\n\nThe Seminoles baseball complex was significantly damaged in the May 10 tornados that tore through Tallahassee. The right field wall of Dick Howser Stadium toppled over after the storms, with significant damage to the trees and surrounding area.\n\nThe wall was replaced in the days after the tornados, but the university is prepared for the potential arrival of Helene.

That’s slightly lower than Wednesday projections of a low-end Category 4.\n\nFelicia Bowser, meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, said Helene is expected to make landfall this evening.\n\n“It’s still moving at a pretty decent speed,” she said.\n\nAs for Helene’s slight jog to the east, Bowser said it happened as of the NHC’s 11 p.m. Wednesday forecast and that any move in that direction since was “extremely incremental.”\n\n“That slight eastward shift did occur, and the fact that it wobbles a little bit east, west, east, west, that’s pretty typical,” she said. “Will we not see any more wobbles? That’s just a little bit hard to say. Will it keep going east? That’s a little bit hard to say, too.”\n\nShe said NHC Hurricane Hunter aircraft will continue to collect data that will show whether there are more wobbles or the track is as refined as it will get.\n\n“We’re definitely getting to that time where the refinements are probably going to be minimized, because it looks like it’s on target,” Bowser said. “And eventually that will happen.”\n\nAt 11 a.m., Helene was 290 miles south of Apalachicola and moving north-northeast at 14 mph.

The watch, which means conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form, is in effect until 10 p.m.\n\nFlorida counties under the watch are: Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Calhoun, Clay, Columbia, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Franklin, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hamilton, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Liberty, Madison, Nassau, Putnam, St. Johns, Suwannee, Taylor, Union and Wakulla.\n\nAn earlier tornado warning for central Franklin County will expire at 11:30 a.m.\n\nNWS in Tallahassee said, \"The storm which prompted the warning has weakened below severe limits, and no longer appears capable of producing a tornado. Therefore, the warning will be allowed to expire.\"\n\nWeatherTiger's offers 'slightly positive trends' for Tallahassee in latest Helene update\n\nDr. Ryan Truchelut of WeatherTiger offered up the one thing Tallahasseeans have been praying for — a glimmer of hope — in his latest forecast for Hurricane Helene.\n\nTruchelut said Helene did not intensify as much as expected overnight. And while it’s still expected to become a Category 3 or 4 hurricane, the delay in intensification “is helpful in shaving a bit of the high-end potential off the hurricane’s core of destructive winds tonight,” he wrote.\n\nIn his newsletter to his subscribers on substack, Truchelut added that Helene nudged a few miles east, but no further, from the National Hurricane Center’s 5 a.m. forecast centerline.\n\n“I’ll be watching carefully to see if that persists, as every tick east counts towards increasing the potential for Tallahassee staying on the weaker, western half of the storm,” Truchelut wrote. “Make no mistake: in Tallahassee, your rooting interest is that the center of Helene passes to our east.”\n\nHelene was about 350 miles south of Apalachicola and moving north-northeast at about 12 mph, according to the NHC’s 8 a.m. forecast. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph.\n\nDespite what he called the \"slightly positive trends,\" Truchelut said Helene remains a \"catastrophic threat.\" The hurricane is expected to make landfall in Apalachee Bay tonight or early Friday morning.\n\nLeon County opens eighth shelter at Rickards High School\n\nLeon County opened its eighth shelter for people seeking refuge from Helene this morning at Rickards High School.\n\nThe shelters are run in cooperation with Leon County Schools.

Ron DeSantis appeared on Fox & Friends Thursday morning to talk about Florida's preparations for Hurricane Helene.\n\nThe governor warned that time is running out for those living in evacuation zones to leave.\n\n\"People just need to make decisions, keep themselves safe,\" DeSantis said. \"Soon as the storm passes, you're going to see the response very quickly.\"\n\nHe also emphasized the potential damages for Tallahassee, which has historically missed the brunt of major hurricanes.\n\n\"If it does hit Tallahassee, they have not had a major hurricane in Tallahassee in recent memory,\" DeSantis said. \"We've got a lot of beautiful trees here — the neighborhoods have them. But when you start having 125 mph winds, that could cause a lot of damage, a lot of debris as well.\"\n\nHe gave another warning for those who live beneath trees: \"You got a big oak fall on your roof, that is not going to be something that you're going to want to be there for,\" he said.\n\nJim Cantore, a harbinger for hurricane damage, in Tallahassee\n\nThe Weather Channel's Jim Cantore was in Tallahassee Thursday morning.\n\nThat's something making city residents uneasy, as he's known to visit areas before and as they get significantly damaged by hurricanes.\n\n\"It cannot be understated the threat (Hurricane Helene) poses across the southeastern United States just based on current intensity projections,\" Cantore said in a social media post Wednesday.\n\nThe Tallahassee Democrat spotted Cantore doing live coverage outside the Old Florida Capitol on Wednesday evening. See the images below.\n\nHurricane Helene grows to Category 2 storm\n\nHurricane Helene is now a Category 2 with 100-mph winds, according to the National Hurricane Center's 8 a.m. bulletin.\n\n\"ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING EXPECTED BEFORE LANDFALL IN FLORIDA... ...PREPARATIONS TO PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY SHOULD BE RUSHED TO COMPLETION...\"\n\n\"Weakening is expected after landfall,\" NHC forecasters say, \"but Helene's fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.\"\n\nThat scenario harkens back to Hurricane Michael, which punched into Georgia with Category 3 winds.\n\nDreams washed away: Horseshoe Beach residents pray for a miracle ahead of Helene\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH — This beloved Gulf Coast fishing destination was a ghost town in the hours leading up to Hurricane Helene's anticipated landfall.\n\nOnly a few residents remained Wednesday afternoon as they made final preparations for the storm before evacuating to more inland towns.\n\nThe town lost more than 50% of its homes to Hurricane Idalia, a Category 3 hurricane that hit Aug. 30, 2023, causing major damage to the eastern Big Bend and Nature Coast. Now it faces the prospect of a 10- to 15-foot storm surge that could be even worse.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking to come back and see your dreams you've always had get washed away in two hours,\" resident John Hamelink said.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWeatherTiger's video forecast outlines a harrowing night ahead\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK meteorologist Ryan Truchelut of WeatherTiger broke down the impacts ahead of Hurricane Helene in a late Wednesday night video forecast.\n\nHe warned that Tallahassee could be blasted by 115 mph winds. He also noted that a record storm surge of 15 to 20 feet will occur during high tide, which will ratchet up the life-threatening risk potential for those coastal dwellers under hurricane and surge warnings.\n\n\"This is not a survivable situation,\" he said. \"You just have to get out.\"\n\nWhen the night is over, Truchelut said, \"(Helene) will stand toe to toe with one of the biggest hurricane hits in Florida hurricane history, unfortunately.\"\n\nFlorida becomes the evacuation state as residents wake-up to final decision\n\nResidents are awaking Thursday morning and facing a final decision on whether to stay or go.

The National Weather Service in their local hurricane statement expand in a detailed and sobering snapshot of the cataclysm to come.\n\n\"Damage to critical infrastructure, catastrophic damage to the trees and powerlines, widespread inaccessibility due to blocked roads, and damage to well-built structures will all be likely, particularly close to and east of the track. Power outages will likely last days, if not weeks.\"\n\n\"Potential wind impacts in this area include: Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof and wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage greatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations may be uninhabitable for weeks or months. Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and roadway signs blown over. Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban or heavily wooded places. Many bridges, causeways, and access routes impassable. Widespread power and communications outages.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/american-south/2021/08/30/new-orleans-residents-relieved-hurricane-ida-not-another-katrina/5650680001/", "title": "New Orleans residents relieved Hurricane Ida was 'not another ...", "text": "Buildings collapsed. Windows and roofs were yanked to the ground. Power remained out for all New Orleans residents Monday afternoon and one neighborhood awoke to a foot of water stagnant in the street.\n\nBut the day after Hurricane Ida hit New Orleans, one phrase was consistently repeated by residents across the city: It could have been worse.\n\nIda, the strongest hurricane to hit Louisiana since modern record keeping began, ripped through south Louisiana Sunday devastating parts of coastal areas. Many New Orleanians were expecting similar devastation. The storm’s arrival on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina only added to some locals’ fears of what was to come.\n\nJames Ackerson, a Lower Ninth Ward resident, saw his house washed two blocks down the street after Katrina caused the levees to fail.\n\nWhen it came to Ida, Ackerson said he was “concerned about nothing else but the water.” But while Ackerson had spent the days after Katrina living in his fishing boat and floating through a sunken community, he stood in his driveway Monday washing his car.\n\nThe water had come up to his sidewalk due to the heavy rainfall, but quickly subsided. The $15 billion improvements made to the levees after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 seemed to have done the job, sparing the city from widespread catastrophic damage, experts and engineers said to USA Today Network.\n\nAckerson's fishing boat sat parked and unneeded across the street. “This wasn’t nothing compared to Katrina,” he said. “I’ve got more confidence in the levees now than I have in the police. Now I know I can stay here.”\n\nThough Ida's storm surge overtopped levees in low-lying areas such as Lafitte, 30 miles south of New Orleans, the majority of the hurricane protection system withstood the storm.\n\nAt a press conference Monday, the city's mayor LaToya Cantrell echoed the concerns of residents like Ackerson.\n\n\"It did not happen. We did not have another Katrina. And that's something again we should all be grateful for,\" Cantrell said.\n\nShe went on to say the city has still been significantly impacted, in particular, the widespread power outage that is ongoing with little end in sight. And urged evacuees not to return to the city until further notice.\n\nFew places had standing water Monday\n\nOn Monday, New Orleans’ Lakeview neighborhood was one of the few places to still have standing water.\n\nDerek Cummiskey walked through his street, the water up to his calves. He said he was thankful that the water didn’t seem to reach anyone’s house, but said he was “frustrated” by the water in the street and lack of electricity, the latter of which was exacerbated when an Entergy transmission tower fell sending power lines into the Mississippi river.\n\n“Honestly our house was almost a fishing camp at one point,” Cummiskey said. “We just got a pool a few weeks ago and you couldn’t even see it.”\n\nHurricane Ida updates:Second Hurricane Ida death confirmed in New Orleans\n\nIda hits New Orleans:See the damage in New Orleans caused by Hurricane Ida\n\nDown the street, 44-year-old Ted Nass was clearing debris from gutters with a rake and attempting to coax the water to recede.\n\nNass also cited the power outages as his primary concern, but as a resident of a neighborhood separated from Lake Ponchartrain by levees, he was thankful that the flooding didn’t cause more issues.\n\n“The power outage is crazy and will cause problems later on,” Nass said. “Everything else worked. This is rain water, not levees breaching, so I’m happy.”\n\nNeighbors begin picking up the pieces\n\nMuch of the biggest structural damage seen in New Orleans occurred in separate, distinct events.\n\nThe Karnofsky Tailor Shop where a young Louis Armstrong was once employed, was reduced to a pile of bricks on Rampart Street.\n\nIn the city’s Freret neighborhood, D’Artanian Stovall’s house stood in similar shambles. Stovall had moved into his former childhood home years ago in hopes of fixing it up. The fireplace had been next on his list of repairs.\n\nBut on Sunday evening as Ida edged closer to the city, a gust of wind ripped the chimney from the side of the house, causing the fireplace to collapse. The rest of the house followed suit and crumbled around Stovall, who scrambled to the back of the house and hid in a hallway until firefighters arrived.\n\nStovall escaped with a scratch on his arm and a sore ankle. He said he would spend the week pulling valuables from the debris and start rebuilding the house from scratch.\n\n“Someone once asked me, ‘What are you going to do when you’re done?’ And I said ‘I don’t know, maybe tear it down and do it again,’” Stovall said with a rueful laugh. “That’s just life. New Orleans got lucky. I was unlucky. But you live to fight another day.”\n\nAcross town, neighborhoods hummed with chainsaws and generators as residents began the communal cleanup that follows each hurricane. Some set up portable charging stations on their porch.\n\nIn the Garden District, gas station owner Abbas al Sharees only meant to drop by his store for 5 minutes to make sure it was safe. He found a line of people looking for water and gas. Since his generators had already been running overnight, al Sharees spent the next several hours selling gas and cold beverages to the neighborhood.\n\n“They’ve supported me, now is my time to pay them back,” al Sharees said. “It’s inconvenient with no electricity, but thank God because it could have been worse.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2021/02/18/texas-power-outages-greg-abbott-dan-crenshaw-fact-check/6791469002/", "title": "Is wind to blame for the Texas power outages? Fact-checking ...", "text": "Greg Abbott: \"Our wind and our solar got shut down ... and that thrust Texas into this situation where it was lacking power at a statewide basis.\"\n\nTexas Public Policy Foundation: Blackouts “never would have been an issue had our grid not been so deeply penetrated by renewable energy sources.\"\n\nDan Crenshaw: \"The little energy that power regulators planned on being supplied from wind was now gone.”\n\nTexas’ wind energy has become a popular culprit as politicians and interest groups pointed fingers at who was to blame for widespread blackouts that left millions of Texans without power and heat amid single-digit temperatures.\n\nWind energy has been Texas’ fastest-growing energy source over the past decade. Last year, wind supplied 23% of Texas energy demand and overtook coal as the state’s second-largest resource after natural gas, which supplied 46% last year.\n\nOver Valentine’s Day weekend, before grid operators mandated statewide blackouts, reports began filtering in that several wind turbines had frozen to a halt due to unusual levels of moisture in West Texas typically dry air. This was first revealed Friday, Feb. 12 during a Texas Public Utility Commission meeting. By Sunday afternoon, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the state-wide grid, was reporting that about half of Texas’ 24,000 megawatts of installed wind capacity was frozen.\n\nMore:What percentage of Texas energy is renewable? Breaking down the state's power sources from gas to wind.\n\nBlackouts swept the state early Monday as the historic chill skyrocketed demand and tanked supply. By Tuesday, as the number of households without power climbed to 4 million, many state Republicans placed the blame squarely on renewables.\n\nThe blackouts \"never would have been an issue had our grid not been so deeply penetrated by renewable energy sources that contribute the least when you need them the most, yet are propped up by billions in taxpayer-funded subsidies every year,\" the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a right-wing think tank, said in a Tuesday morning statement.\n\nBy Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, tweeted a thread that claimed to reveal \"the truth about what happened,\" and his criticisms were along similar lines — wind energy is too feeble to withstand extreme weather yet has been over-subsidized by the federal government.\n\n\"A mix of over-subsidized wind energy and under-investment in gas power means we didn’t have enough base load energy for a massive spike in demand,\" Crenshaw tweeted.\n\n\"Can we ever rely on renewables to power the grid during extreme weather? No, you need gas or nuclear,\" he said. \"And subsidizing investment in wind has pushed gas and nuclear out.\"\n\nGov. Greg Abbott jumped on the bandwagon during a Tuesday evening Fox News appearance, where he said the failure of wind energy demonstrates how the Green New Deal would be \"a deadly deal for America.\"\n\n\"Our wind and our solar got shut down ... and that thrust Texas into this situation where it was lacking power at a statewide basis,\" he said on Hannity. \"As a result, it just shows that fossil fuels are necessary for the state of Texas as well as other states to make sure that we're able to heat our homes in the wintertime and cool our homes in the summertime.\"\n\nBut placing blame on one single energy resource directly contradicts information the Electric Reliability Council of Texas has been reporting throughout this energy crisis — that blackouts were caused as electric plants of all energy sources \"began tripping offline in rapid succession.\"\n\nExclusive:ERCOT said grid was prepared for winter weeks before Texas power crisis\n\nOn Tuesday, as blackouts dragged on for a second day, Electric Reliability Council of Texas CEO Bill Magness said that the energy deficit was mostly due to impacted gas plants.\n\n\"It appears that a lot of the generation that has gone offline today has been primarily due to issues on the natural gas system at large,\" Magness said. \"From getting the gas from the wellheads, through the pipes to generators and to consumers for heating natural gas. That really seems to be a lot of the issues from the plant that we're seeing become unavailable during the day today.\"\n\nWith the blame game heating up, PolitiFact fact-checked several claims made by Crenshaw, Abbott and the Texas Public Policy Foundation.\n\nBlackouts ‘never would have been an issue' if it hadn’t been for renewables\n\nOn Tuesday, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas reported that 45,000 megawatts were offline due to a variety of reasons. Of that amount, around 29,000 of those lost megawatts were attributable to thermal generators, or non-renewable energy sources. The remaining 16,000 megawatts were due to installed wind resources in West Texas.\n\nWind resources are quantified in two ways: the total installed capacity (meaning the maximum amount of energy that wind farms would produce under ideal conditions) and generation capacity (meaning the amount of electricity that wind inventory is expected to produce at any given point in the year given seasonal fluctuations).\n\nTexas has about 24,000 megawatts of installed wind capacity connected to the grid. As of Tuesday about 16,000 megawatts of that capacity was offline due to icing.\n\nDuring wintertime, which is known to be a low wind season, generation capacity is only projected to be around 6,000 megawatts. Even though the unfrozen coastal turbines overperformed due to the windy weather the storm created, the grid was in need of any juice the frozen turbines could have otherwise supplied.\n\n\"It’d be fair to say that wind has underperformed, but it’s not alone in having done that,\" said Josh Rhodes, a University of Texas research associate at the Energy Institute. \"A third of our thermal plants were offline.\"\n\nIndeed, the largest energy deficit came from the state’s gas plants. While freezing temperatures impact wind energy by freezing up turbine blades, natural gas plants are impacted in a multitude of ways. Gas wells can freeze up. Uninsulated pipelines can cause certain gasses with heavy carbon chains to liquify. A gas, coal or nuclear plant’s water intake or outtake pipes can freeze.\n\n\"All of those things can impact operations of any type of plant,\" said Bernadette Johnson, an energy economist at Enverus.\n\nAll these factors combined to shut down enough thermal energy plants to remove 29,000 megawatts from the grid.\n\nMore:Mandatory blackouts across Texas power grid have ended for now, ERCOT says\n\nThe amount of wind energy that could have been produced from the frozen turbines was sorely needed, but it’s misleading to say that blackouts \"never would have been an issue had our grid not been so deeply penetrated by renewable energy sources,\" as the Texas Public Policy Foundation claimed. Abbott's comment on Hannity's show placing blame for the outages on wind and solar energy production runs along the same lines and is equally misleading.\n\nThe Texas Public Policy Foundation's \"statement does not appear to be supported by the evidence,\" said University of Houston Energy Fellow Ed Hirs. \"There’s no way wind generation could contribute to the collapse of 40% of the generation capacity of ERCOT.\"\n\n‘We couldn’t even depend’ on renewables working\n\nCrenshaw claimed in a tweet that \"the little energy that power regulators planned on being supplied from wind was now gone.\"\n\nWhile freezing weather cut wind supplies from the West Texas region, many other unfrozen turbines in the Gulf Coast region continued to spin. As previously mentioned, those sources generated at higher rates than previously projected thanks to the blustery weather.\n\nOverall, it’s safe to say Texas' installed wind capacity in West Texas underperformed these past few days, but it’s inaccurate to say that wind power \"was now gone,\" as Crenshaw claims.\n\n‘We have almost 31GW of wind installed on the grid’\n\nIn the same tweet, Crenshaw said that the Electric Reliability Council of Texas has \"almost 31 (gigawatts) of wind installed on the grid, but on Monday we couldn’t even depend on 6 (gigawatts) working.\"\n\nTexas has around 24 gigawatts of installed wind capacity connected to its grid, with another 1,800 megawatts expected to be added in 2021.\n\nThere is another 7 gigawatts of wind energy installed in Texas, but it is connected to a separate grid — the Eastern Interconnection, which spans the eastern seaboard to Oklahoma.\n\n‘Every natural gas plant stayed online’\n\nIn another tweet, Crenshaw claimed that \"every natural gas plant stayed online. The ‘downed’ plants were due to scheduled maintenance.\"\n\nIt’s true that gas plants require annual maintenance. In Texas, maintenance is typically performed during the winter months when demand is lowest.\n\nBefore the Valentine's Day weekend storm, thermal plants producing around 14,000 megawatts of energy were offline, presumably due to maintenance and curtailments. After the storm struck, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas reported 29,000 megawatts of thermal energy plants were down.\n\n\"We’re seeing the loss across various generation types, and those losses came pretty much the same time as we saw this storm sweep through and have its impact on lots of different kinds of generation,\" said grid CEO Bill Magness.\n\nA final word\n\nThe overall consensus from energy experts is that it’s far too soon to draw conclusions on what the exact cause or causes of the blackouts were. All agree that the single-digit temperatures that shattered the grid’s previous record for wintertime demand quickly outstripped the grid’s design parameters.\n\n\"It’s too early to play the blame game,\" Johnson said. \"Everybody naturally wants to play the blame game depending on where they sit politically. I think the real answer lies in the middle somewhere.\"\n\nNonetheless, attempts to place the blame squarely on one energy source is misleading.\n\n\"If you’re pointing to a few thousand megawatts of wind being short and ignoring the fact that tens of thousands of thermals is short — I don’t see how you can paint that kind of picture,\" Rhodes said.\n\nSources\n\nTweet thread, U.S. Rep Dan Crenshaw, Feb. 16, 2021\n\nTexas Public Policy Foundation, Life:Powered project, Feb. 16, 2021\n\nElectric Reliability Council of Texas, press conference, Feb. 14-16, 2021\n\nThe Daily Beast, Texas Gov.

He said the number of younger, more liberal people prepping indicates a loss of trust in government.\n\n\"That's the impetus for all the preppers I've ever dealt with: They saw something and felt the government could not or would not help,” said Chad Huddleston of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, a professor and anthropologist who has studied the prepping community extensively.\n\nHuddleston said it’s important to distinguish between the large numbers of people who consider being prepared for emergencies their civic and family responsibility and those who are, sometimes eagerly, awaiting societal collapse. But he said the number of people deliberately preparing for a crisis tied to a Trump-Biden election is growing.\n\n“On one side, people think Trump may bring a New World Order and ‘they’ will come and get us, so we need to be ready,\" he said. \"And then on the other hand you have the communities who think things will get just get worse so we have to help ourselves.\"\n\nCount Wagoner among those people. She sees climate change as a worsening existential threat the government isn't prepared for, especially if a Republican is in charge.\n\n\"The intensification of our natural storm seasons is the No. 1 thing that's going to happen to you,\" she said. \"An electromagnetic pulse that takes out the electrical grid could happen. A nuclear war might happen. A civil war might happen. But a storm will happen.\"\n\nPrepping is becoming increasingly diverse\n\nThough the movement has long been associated with libertarian-fueled apocalyptic scenarios like a zombie infestation or the collapse of modern society, as highlighted by the 2020 television show \"Doomsday Preppers,\" Wagoner is among younger, more liberal people who say the Trump administration flubbed its responses during the 2017 hurricane season, particularly in Puerto Rico, and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOverall, prepping appears to reflect the deep uncertainty many Americans feel: A recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll found that 67% of Americans think the country is facing either bigger problems than usual or is in the most troubled state they've ever seen. The poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken Oct. 17-20 by landline and cellphone, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nExperts say younger preppers like Wagoner reflect broad concerns for the nation's future as we choose our next president. Some are stockpiling weapons and medical supplies in armored bunkers. Others are urging their neighbors to set aside enough food to survive for weeks or months without outside help.\n\n\"If you can be prepared, you won't be a drain on the resources needed to help the people who didn’t prepare,” said Wagoner, who has a 90-day supply of food set aside for her six-person family. Wagoner, who works for a nonprofit, runs a YouTube channel where she offers prepping advice to young people, urban residents and people who have small homes.\n\n\"In the face of an apocalypse, I want to come out and calmly help people,” she said. “I want to be able to create a society that instead of wanting to shoot every stranger, understands our interdependence and creates a better society.”\n\nMany disaster response experts say the ideas espoused by Wagoner is the most reasonable and responsible approach for Americans to take, building off the assumption that neighbors, churches and nonprofits like the Red Cross or Salvation Army will always play a front-line role in helping recover from a disaster, filling in the gaps until the federal government gets organized.\n\nGuns and bunkers: Some preppers are focused on their own survival\n\nIf Wagoner represents one end of the spectrum ‒ focused on community, interdependence and cooperation ‒ retired U.S. Air Force Col. Drew Miller represents the other. He's prepared for a full societal collapse caused by war, a nuclear explosion or rampaging mobs angry at election results.\n\nMiller's \"Fortitude Ranch\" has built seven compounds around the country, including Nevada, Wisconsin and outside Washington, D.C., where members can retreat for up to a year, armed and isolated from whatever may come. In addition to stockpiles of food, propane and whiskey, the compounds are outfitted with solar panels, wells and two-way radios. And lots and lots of guns.\n\nTheir plan during a collapse: Members will immediately flee to the closest compound, poach wildlife for meat, surround their compound with log walls and shoot any \"marauders\" who approach too close. USA TODAY toured one of the compounds in southern Colorado, where Spartan accommodations await members who pay a minimum of $1,200 a year for what Miller calls a different kind of life insurance.\n\n“We’ll have decent chow here come a collapse,” he said. “We guarantee a year of food, but not of toilet paper.”\n\nFortitude Ranch in Colorado has about 100 members, Miller said. He acknowledges the cost of joining would be a financial burden for many Americans, but he pulled out a $300 pistol to argue that being prepared doesn't have to cost a fortune. He said the ultra-rich have their own compounds but will depend on paid staff to protect them, while he believes individual families in cities will become targets for armed gangs, especially if people get hungry and desperate.\n\nHis advice for city dwellers stockpiling supplies in their homes: \"The first rule of prepping is to not tell people you're a prepper.\"\n\nInside Fortitude Ranch's Colorado compound, which includes an armored guard post, sniper positions and underground bunkers, members aim to remain isolated for as long as needed. Members have added their own beds, furniture and ammunition stockpiles to the group supplies cached around the property.\n\nAmong the weapons: a .50-caliber rifle to disable oncoming vehicles, hunting rifles to kill deer, and plenty of pistols. Members also have cupboards filled with first-aid kits and have recruited doctors and people with military medical training to help keep their fellow preppers healthy.\n\nThe group's plan is to ride out any collapse and then be positioned to take advantage of business opportunities opened up by widespread urban deaths. That's what happened when the Black Death killed tens of millions of Europeans and Asians in the 1300s: It concentrated wealth and resources among survivors.\n\nMiller said the compounds are primarily set up to be defensive, and while they'd be open to bartering with their neighbors during a collapse, they wouldn't help non-members who came begging for food or assistance. Otherwise, he said, no one would pay to join Fortitude Ranch until times got tough.\n\nMiller worries about a wide variety of problems, from a pandemic that kills a large majority of Americans to a nuclear detonation that wipes out the nation's electrical grid and our modern electronic devices. He said many of his clients started thinking seriously about survival during the protests and riots that came after George Floyd's murder in Minneapolis in 2020. The overwhelming majority of protests were peaceful, although some caused significant property damage in multiple cities and drew threats from Trump that he would send the military to stop them.\n\n\"There could easily be a civil war during a Biden-Trump election,\" he said, referencing the violent 2020 clashes in Portland between armed federal agents dispatched by Trump against Black Lives Matter protesters, some of whom shot fireworks at officers.\n\nMiller's group deliberately avoids getting into the political debate, although he acknowledges many members have military training. And scattered around the compound are multiple copies of his 2011 novel \"Rohan Nation,\" a libertarian-focused tale of survivalists written as a call to break \"nation's addiction to socialist entitlements and return to Constitutional, strictly limited government, focused on security.\"\n\nMiller said your politics don't matter in a cataclysm ‒ only your willingness to work with the small number of survivors in the compound to get through the first worst months of a crisis so you can launch a business to take advantage of vacant real estate and free-market needs.\n\n“I want middle-class Americans to survive, and we make it affordable to do that,\" Miller said. “I think eventually things will recover ‒ and I want to be alive for that.”\n\n'Unfortunate arms race' for conservative, liberal preppers ahead of election\n\nGarrett, the author and academic, spent three years visiting eight counties and interviewing hundreds of preppers for his 2020 book \"Bunker,\" which explores the philosophies driving the prepper movement. He said Miller's Fortitude Ranch reflects a typical libertarian-focused prepper mindset in which the government is inherently incompetent and that everyone is more or less on their own.\n\nBut he said some liberals, especially younger ones, were shocked into action by the pandemic and the federal government's response to the George Floyd protests ‒ they had never personally experienced such government failure or hostility before and suddenly feel vulnerable. He said the upcoming presidential election is only sharpening those concerns on both sides of the nation's divide.\n\n\"We do have this authoritarian streak running through the right, and prepping plays into that. They are prepared for violence, no question,\" he said. \"But you're also seeing an increase in militancy on the left. I'm seeing a lot of liberal preppers buying guns, saying that they waited too long. It's an unfortunate arms race that I do think we're going to see escalating as we head into the election, particularly if it's Trump versus Biden.\"\n\nGarrett said many of the younger preppers, while worried about a fascist federal government under a second Trump administration, are also concerned about the growing impact of climate change. He said there's a shift back toward being prepared for disasters in a way people routinely were 100 years ago, especially in rural areas.\n\n\"You're seeing a lot of people who are not worried about the apocalypse but if the power goes out for three days,\" he said. \"You're seeing more prepping but less extreme prepping.\"\n\nPrepping can help others\n\nBack in North Carolina, Wagoner would consider herself among those who take responsible, reasonable steps to prepare. She and her husband got rid of some of their books and camping gear to make room for their food stockpile. And they eschew having guns, even though they'd be prepared to use them in self-defense, she said. For Wagoner, being prepared comes with an explicit addendum: so she can help others.\n\nOn her YouTube channel, Wagoner said she tries to help people understand that being prepared doesn't need to be expensive, and that gradually building up a stockpile of nonperishable foods like pasta and rice is an easy way to be self-sufficient in a crisis.\n\nShe explicitly rejects the philosophy of what Garrett calls \"dread merchants\" ‒ people capitalizing on fear to sell packs of freeze-dried meals, \"bugout bags,\" battery banks or guns ‒ and encourages her audience to think about how prepping will help their community.\n\n\"When I talk about preparedness, I start with 'What's most likely'?\" she said. \"You have to ask, what are you prepping for? Are you prepping to survive for a Max Mad world? Because if that's what prepare for, that's what you'll ultimately create. And I'm prepping for community survival. My perspective is that we are better together.\"\n\nShe added: \"Jesus would slap the s--- out of anyone who had food and refused to help their neighbors who were hungry.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/08/debby-tropical-storm-updates/74716296007/", "title": "Debby storm updates: Carolinas hit with 'life threatening' flooding", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Tropical Storm Debby's remnants for Thursday, Aug. 8. For the latest news on the storm, view our story for Friday, Aug. 9.\n\nThough no longer a tropical storm, now-Tropical Depression Debby was still dropping copious amounts of rain on eastern states Thursday evening as the Northeast braces for the system's arrival.\n\nDebby, still a tropical storm at the time, made its second U.S. landfall around 2 a.m. near Bulls Bay, South Carolina, just northeast of Charleston, according to the National Hurricane Center. In a matter of hours, over half a foot of rain had fallen in parts of central North Carolina, causing \"life-threatening flash flooding\" as waterways crested, turning roads into rivers.\n\nDebby is expected to dump 4 to 8 inches of rain − some areas could get up to 15 inches − across parts of the Carolinas and Virginia on Thursday and Friday, bringing \"considerable to locally catastrophic flash flooding impacts,\" the weather service's Storm Prediction Center said. All told, rain totals in some parts of South Carolina could exceed 2 feet.\n\nCaught in Hurricane Debby's winds: A migrating bird named Suwannee 22 ended up where she started\n\nDebby's sustained winds were down to 30 mph by 11 p.m. ET. In the days ahead, the storm is forecast to weaken as it picks up speed and moves north, bringing up to 6 inches of rain from Maryland to Vermont. Flood watches throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions were set to activate Thursday evening and last through Friday night.\n\nAcross Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, Debby drenched communities in over a foot of rain, breaking several decades-old records. Flash flooding triggered water rescues, overtook roads, and breached several dams as winds knocked over trees and tangled power lines. Officials have said at least seven people have died as a result of the storm.\n\nDebby tracker map:Where is Tropical Storm Debby? Maps track path, flooding, rain, where it already hit\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Millions of people from southeast Georgia up through the Carolinas and western New York were under flood advisories, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of North Carolina and Virginia were under tornado watches.\n\n∎ Virginia's Department of Emergency Management warned residents to stay aware of possible tornadoes Thursday and Friday. \"Tropical Storm Debby has the potential to create tornadoes, with the threat potentially lasting through the overnight hours,\" the post said.\n\n∎ Cleanup crews have cleared over 245 miles of road and eight acres of debris across Florida, according to the state's Division of Emergency Management. Emergency responders in high-water vehicles and on foot rescued at least 120 people trapped by floodwaters.\n\nDeath toll rises to at least 7 after tornado kills man in North Carolina\n\nA man in Wilson County, North Carolina, was found dead in his home after a tornado touched down in the area, bringing Debby's death toll to at least seven.\n\nStephen Mann, director of communication for Wilson County, told USA TODAY on Thursday that a twister tore through the outskirts of Lucama, a town 35 miles southeast of Raleigh, sometime before 3 a.m. A middle school, a church and four homes sustained structural damage. Inside one of the homes, a search and rescue team discovered the body of an adult male, Mann said.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper met with local officials at Springfield Middle School to assess the damage and posted photos to social media Thursday. They showed piles of debris outside a heavily damaged building, with about half of the roof missing as insulation foam spilled out, and a collapsed wall that exposed what appeared to be the remnants of a classroom.\n\nOfficials have tied Debby to at least six other deaths, five in Florida and one in Georgia. In the southern Georgia city of Moultrie, a tree fell onto a home, killing a 19-year-old, Gov. Brian Kemp said Tuesday. In Florida, two adults and a child were killed in fatal vehicle accidents; also, a 13-year-old boy died after a fallen tree landed on a mobile home; and officials on Tuesday found the body of a boater who had been missing near the city of Gulfport.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, officials confirmed a tornado touched down in North Carolina's Sampson County, damaging two homes, according to weather service reports. A suspected tornado was also reported in Pender County. Across South Carolina and Florida, Debby spawned eight tornadoes earlier this week.\n\nAt historic North Carolina inn, 'it's literally raining inside'\n\nThursday quickly became a tough day at work for hotel manager Elise Tyler, when the ceiling of the Colonial Inn in Hillsborough, North Carolina, began to leak rainwater and drain systems couldn’t keep up with the heavy downpour.\n\n“We are on the verge of flooded,” said Tyler, 37. “Several areas of the inn are dripping and it’s literally raining inside.”\n\nThe 200-year-old building had not lost power, but the lights were flickering, Tyler said. Nearby roads were closed because of flooding and some staff who lost power at their homes took advantage of empty hotel rooms to shower and charge their phones, she said.\n\nThe Colonial is located in a historic block of Hillsborough, close to the site of a Revolutionary War battle, and the building was pillaged by Union troops, according to the hotel's website.\n\nKnown for its restaurant’s weekend brunch, the inn got a lot of customers Wednesday, Tyler said, likely because people were anticipating hunkering down Thursday – when only “one brave soul” came in for lunch.\n\nForecasters eye another system in the Atlantic\n\nJust as Debby continues to pound the East Coast, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are also keeping an eye on a developing system near the Caribbean islands.\n\n\"An area of low pressure could form in the central or western tropical Atlantic Ocean early next week,\" the center said in an online forecast released Thursday morning. \"Some development of this system is possible while it approaches the Lesser Antilles during the early to middle part of next week and moves generally west-northwestward toward the Greater Antilles thereafter.\"\n\nThe system has a 30% chance of becoming a tropical depression or named storm within the next week. The next name on the 2024 storm list is Ernesto. It's far too soon to determine whether the system will impact any land areas, including the U.S.\n\n– Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nDebby's latest rainfall totals\n\nRainfall reports show more than a dozen locations in the Southeast where Debby has dropped at least a foot of rain since Saturday, causing widespread flooding from Florida to North Carolina. Below are some preliminary selected rain totals from the National Weather Service.\n\nFlorida:\n\nLake City: 19.67 inches\n\nParrish: 18.86 inches\n\nLakewood Ranch: 18.34 inches\n\nSarasota: 17.78 inches\n\nEllenton: 14.60 inches\n\nSouth Carolina:\n\nSummerville: 18.25 inches\n\nMount Pleasant: 17.70 inches\n\nGreen Pond: 17.43 inches\n\nLoris: 15.89 inches\n\nCharleston Airport: 10.35 inches\n\nGeorgia:\n\nOliver: 14.82 inches\n\nRincon: 13.87 inches\n\nBelville: 13.59 inches\n\nRocky Ford: 11.63 inches\n\nSavannah Airport: 10.10 inches\n\nNorth Carolina:\n\nKings Grant: 15.25 inches\n\nShallotte: 13.05 inches\n\nElizabethtown: 10.71 inches\n\nHolden Beach: 10.28 inches\n\nWilmington Airport: 8.57 inches\n\nPower outages in NC down to 60,000\n\nMore than 25,000 homes and businesses in North Carolina were without power Thursday night, a major improvement from 60,000 customers just a few hours earlier as crews repaired some of the damage caused by Debby. Duke Energy, the state's largest power provider, said Wednesday it had 7,500 linemen and other employees staged across the Carolinas to respond to outages.\n\nBlackouts also diminished in Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia, which were all under 2,500 outages by 10 p.m. E.T.\n\nBut as the storm headed north, other states such as Virginia − with 20,000 outages − were feeling its effects. In addition, more than 232,000 homes and businesses were out of power in Ohio, the result of Tuesday's storms impacted by Debby.\n\nWhere is Debby?\n\nDebby gained speed but lost intensity as it moved farther inland Thursday, hours after making its second U.S. landfall, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAccording to an 11 p.m. update, the storm was moving north-northeast at 26 mph. Debby was located 80 miles north-northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina, and 90 miles west-northwest of Raleigh, North Carolina, with sustained winds of 30 mph, according to the center.\n\nNorth Carolina resident prepared campground for Debby\n\nIn Raeford, North Carolina, Michelle Morville said her property got a few inches of rain overnight but hasn’t flooded or lost power. “It poured and is still raining here with more to come,” Morville said Thursday morning.\n\nHer campground, Idlewild Farm Stays, is terraced to allow for erosion control so there’s no standing water, Morville said. Rain flows properly down a main driveway during storms, and after the current downpour passes, Morville said she will use a land plane on the road to clear any remaining moisture.\n\nMany people who come to the farm are visiting family members serving in the military on nearby Fort Liberty, formerly Fort Bragg, Morville said. This week, she is offering discounted rates to anyone needing to move their camper or RV out of a flood zone.\n\n“Most flooding issues I believe come from a lack of regard for Mother Nature and not planning accordingly to work with her,” Morville said.\n\nReopening begins after flooding cuts off North Carolina town\n\nAuthorities in Bladenboro, North Carolina, began reopening several main roads after the town was completely cut off by floodwaters overnight.\n\n\"Water has receded in some areas. Crews will begin reopening up roads here shortly,\" said a statement on the county's Facebook page. Much of the downtown was still closed as standing water remained several inches deep in some areas.\n\nJust before midnight, as Debby approached the South Carolina coast, a statement on Bladenboro's Facebook page announced, \"Downtown is underwater. We have several street closures out. Please stay off the roads!\" Within an hour, the local fire department said, \"Due to flooded roadways all roads into Bladenboro are closed.\"\n\nAs the heavy rains and tornado threat shifted away from the area toward more northern parts of North Carolina and Virginia, the town has begun to assess the damage and reopen main roads. \"Many secondary roads have not been checked, use caution,\" the fire department warned early Thursday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/09/30/biltmore-estate-in-asheville-closed-flooding-damage/75455240007/", "title": "Biltmore Estate update: Asheville attraction closed as damage ...", "text": "(This story has been updated with information from the newest statement by the Biltmore Estate.)\n\nThe Biltmore Estate will remain closed through Tuesday, Oct. 15 following Hurricane Helene's devastating pass through Asheville.\n\nIn a statement on their website Tuesday evening, the estate announced the latest timeline for opening, offering no detail on the extent of the damages to the Biltmore home or surrounding estate, though \"internal network and communication systems\" are still being repaired. The previous timeline set by the estate was closure through Oct. 3.\n\nThe Biltmore Estate did not respond to request for comment.\n\n\"This is a heartbreaking situation for our community and region,\" an earlier statement read. \"The safety of our guests and employees is our top priority, and we appreciate your patience as we assess the damage of last weekend's storm and work to repair communication channels.\"\n\nThe estate originally cited \"significant flooding, impassable roads, and widespread power outages\" as the initial reason for closing directly after Helene came through.\n\nThe Biltmore home sits about 2,000 feet east of the French Broad River, which flooded to a record of over 24 feet in some areas. The river sits at roughly 1,985 feet about sea level, while the home was built at about 2,200 feet.\n\n35 people were confirmed dead in Asheville and 41 across the western part of the state Monday after Helene ripped through, causing catastrophic damage to homes, businesses and roadways all over the area. Access to food and water, as well as the internet remains difficult for many residents.\n\nWhat is the condition of Biltmore Village?\n\nLike much of Asheville, Biltmore Village was also devastated by floodwaters. The Swannanoa River just north of the village crested at 26.1 feet, nearly 6 feet above the record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe area remains both heavily damaged and mostly inaccessible. For long distance travelers, Drivenc.gov states that I-40 is impassable in multiple locations, and I-26 is closed at the Tennessee state line. Non-emergency travel remains prohibited.\n\nArea hotels such as the Grand Bohemian Asheville and Biltmore Inn are also closed as damage is assessed.\n\nWhat Biltmore guests need to know\n\nGuests who had tickets to visit the Biltmore Estate can use their tickets another day, though they do not need to call to change their visit date at this time.\n\nWhen ready, future guests can call 800-411-3812 to reserve a date or time in advance. If accessible, guests can exchange their ticket in-person at the estate's Reception and Ticketing Sales Center. They can also request a refund online.\n\nIt remains difficult to drive anywhere around Asheville due to floodwaters washing away streets and bridges.

Reasons we don't: pollen, hay fever and allergies.\n\nSeasonal allergies are a headache for a significant portion of American adults. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 31.8% of Americans 18 or older suffer from some sort of allergy. Seasonal allergies account for the largest number of these allergy sufferers at 25.7%.\n\nThe primary culprit? Pollen.\n\nPollen is a common airborne allergen known to cause uncomfortable symptoms in many people, says the CDC. Pollen grains are dispersed by plants, trees, grass and weeds and are generally present in higher concentrations during warmer seasons. The type and amount of pollen in the air is based on plants in the area, location and the environment in which you live.\n\nCommon reactions to pollen\n\nThe most common pollen reaction is allergic rhinitis, also known as \"hay fever.\" Hay fever occurs when your immune system responds to pollen entering your body, releasing defensive chemicals that cause symptoms like runny nose and stuffiness. You may also experience allergic conjunctivitis, which is the inflammation of the lining of the eyes, causing the rednesses, wateriness and itchiness we associate with allergy season.\n\nPeople who already suffer from asthma also have an increased risk of symptoms worsening due to pollen exposure, causing asthma attacks in tandem with the other common reactions.\n\nThe bad news is we can't really prevent the plants around us from producing pollen or tell our immune systems that exposure to pollen isn't worth reacting to. However, there are things people sensitive to seasonal changes can do to make the upcoming spring and summer less miserable.\n\nAllergy season already:How early spring is bringing more pollen (and sneezing)\n\nTips for pollen and allergy season\n\nJoy Hsu, Senior Medical Officer of the Asthma and Air Quality Branch at the CDC, spoke with USA TODAY about seasonal allergies and pollen sensitivity.\n\n\"If you are allergic to pollen and/or you have asthma, you can take steps to protect yourself,\" she advised. A few tips allergy sufferers may want to consider:\n\nCheck pollen forecasts : Similar to weather forecasts, pollen forecasts are available for review before venturing outside. Checking them can help plan your day in a way that lessens the likelihood of agitating your allergies. \"You can check pollen forecasts and plan to spend less time outdoors when pollen levels will be high so you can limit pollen exposure,\" said Hsu.\n\n: Similar to weather forecasts, pollen forecasts are available for review before venturing outside.

Keep yourself clean : You may pick up pollen particles when you step outside, causing irritation.

Shutting your windows can help prevent pollen from drifting into your home, advised Hsu.\n\n: Keeping windows closed during allergy season can also help keep irritants out of your home. Shutting your windows can help prevent pollen from drifting into your home, advised Hsu. Consider using filters: Keeping the inside of your home comfortable may also be helped by using high-efficiency filters, said Hsu. You can put the filters in your house's ventilation and air conditioning system or HVAC system to help keep pesky particles at bay. However, \"be sure to make sure that your HVAC system can use high-efficiency filters that don't violate your system's warranty,\" she advised.\n\nAllergy treatment myths to watch out for\n\nWhen people experience pain or discomfort, they naturally want to find a way to remedy it − and fast. At times, this leads to the discovery of some useful techniques but often, it results in trying faulty at-home remedies that don't really work but are spread around as useful tips.\n\nHere are a few common myths and unhelpful allergy \"cures\" to be aware of.\n\nEating honey: Honey may help a sore throat, but it won't help cure you of allergies. Some believe that eating local honey regularly will expose you to the remnants of pollen bees collect to make honey, building up your immunity. However, the pollen bees collect isn't generally the same pollen that causes allergies, meaning increased exposure is useless.\n\nHoney may help a sore throat, but it won't help cure you of allergies.

Avoiding flowers: Believe it or not, flowers shouldn't be your main concern if you're sensitive to pollen. While many do still produce it, flowers tend to make pollen that sticks to them, attracting pollinating insects. Instead, it's usually the lighter, easier-traveling pollen from grass and trees that cause you grief.\n\nBelieve it or not, flowers shouldn't be your main concern if you're sensitive to pollen.

Since 1970, allergy season has grown longer due to a warming climate. Longer and earlier spring means plants have more time to grow and release allergy-inducing pollen earlier in spring and later into fall, according to the researchers.\n\nThese cities had their allergy season lengthen the most since 1970:\n\nReno, Nevada: 95 days longer Las Cruces, New Mexico: 65 days longer Medford, Oregon: 61 days longer Boise, Idaho: 51 days longer Tupelo, Mississippi: 50 days longer Missoula, Montana: 48 days longer Myrtle Beach, South Carolina: 48 days longer El Paso, Texas: 47 days longer Toledo, Ohio: 45 days longer Eugene, Oregon: 40 days longer\n\nHigher levels of CO2 can boost pollen production in plants, such as grasses and ragweed, according to Climate Central.

Climate changes, warmer overall temps and increased carbon dioxide concentrations can cause ragweed — the No. 1 culprit of autumn allergies — to grow faster, produce more pollen and bloom longer, meaning more days of sniffling, sneezing and itchy eyes. Mold could get your allergies going, too; so might dust mites. Here's a closer look at these common fall triggers, plus tips to help ease symptoms.\n\nTrigger: Ragweed\n\nThe plant usually starts releasing pollen in mid-August and continues until the first frost, which in some Northern states is occurring up to three weeks later than it used to. Some estimates indicate about one-quarter of all Americans are sensitive to ragweed. It's impossible to completely avoid the allergen. Each plant can make up to 1 billion pollen grains per season — but to minimize exposure, pay attention to pollen levels and limit time outdoors when counts are high. Also, wash your hands often, shower before bed and keep windows closed when possible. Using a neti pot helps with symptoms, as do antihistamines or allergy shots. Researchers also recently reported that a new, once-a-day tablet may offer relief for ragweed sufferers; the pill is under review now.\n\nTrigger: Mold\n\nIt doesn't just grow in your humid bathroom or basement; mold can be found on rotting logs and fallen leaves and in compost piles, plants and soil. Outdoor mold spores reach their peak in July in warmer states and October in colder states. In the South and on the West Coast, they can be found year-round. Wear a dust mask when you're mowing the lawn, digging around plants or picking up leaves. Keep away from uncut fields if possible, and stay inside when mold air levels are high.\n\nTrigger: Dust Mites\n\nThey're tiny little bugs that commonly live in house dust, and their populations tend to peak in August. Allergen levels stay high through December. Even the cleanest homes have dust, but encasing your mattress and pillows in allergen-blocking covers helps reduce symptoms — they're made of tightly women fabric to prevent the mites from colonizing and escaping. Other ideas: wash bedding weekly in hot water, keep humidity levels low in your home, vacuum regularly and if possible, install a high efficiency media filter with a MERV rating of 11 or 12 in the furnace and air-conditioning unit to keep the air cleaner year-round.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2023/03/24/where-do-sesame-seeds-come-from/11429147002/", "title": "Where do sesame seeds come from? How they grow and who ...", "text": "Sesame seeds joined the major food allergens list under U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines as of January 1, 2023. This means that packaged food must list sesame as an allergen just as they do peanuts, wheat, milk, eggs, soybeans and other common culprits.\n\nAbout 1.1 million people in the U.S. have a sesame allergy, and 17% of children with other food allergies are also allergic to sesame.\n\nSesame makes its mark in many global food products, from sesame oil to bagel toppings to crackers. Long before they reach our pantry, here’s how sesame seeds grow.\n\nWhere do sesame seeds come from?\n\nSesame seeds are grown in pods in sesame plants, one of the oldest cultivated plants in the world. Sesame is known as a “survivor” crop because it is drought tolerant and can grow in hot and dry conditions, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Marketing Resource Center reports.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, these countries were the top 10 producers of sesame seed from 1994-2021:\n\nSudan India China Myanmar Sudan Tanzania Nigeria South Sudan Ethiopia Uganda\n\nAre sesame seeds grown in the U.S.?\n\nOnly about 4.3% of sesame seed production happens in North and South America. In fact, sesame production dates to 1600 BC in the Tigris and Euphrates valleys but was only introduced to the U.S. some 200 years ago by slave traders. At the time, it was called “benne,” the African word for sesame.\n\nToday, sesame production in the U.S. mainly occurs in southern states because of the warmer climate – Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Florida.\n\nWhat do sesame seeds grow into?\n\nWould you believe us if we said sesame seeds grow into more sesame seeds?\n\nIt’s true – planting sesame seeds yields a two-foot-tall, leafy sesame plant with light-colored flowers. Seeds develop in inch-long pods that open when they’re mature, or within 125-135 days of planting. Sesame seeds are ready for harvesting when they drop their leaves and begin to dry, usually around October.\n\nWhere do almonds come from?:History of the ancient food source\n\nJust Curious for more?

And if you're in Knoxville, allergy season can be even worse than elsewhere.\n\n“It's been pretty bad,” allergist Dr. Nicholas Kolinsky, a Knoxville allergy expert, told Knox News. “Pollen counts are ridiculously high.”\n\nSpringtime weather arrived three weeks earlier than usual, causing peak allergy season to start earlier and likely last longer, USA TODAY reported. That's already bad news for allergy sufferers because warmer temperatures bring higher pollen counts, a trend that’s been occurring for decades.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2018, the overall amount of pollen increased by up to 21% according to a study by the University of Wisconsin cited in a recent USA TODAY report.\n\nWhy allergy season is so bad in Knoxville\n\nThe pollen count in Knoxville is forecast to be medium-high or high at least until April 9, according to pollen.com. It’s been consistently high for the past 30 days – except for one very low day three weeks ago.\n\nKolinsky, a physician at the Allergy Asthma and Sinus Center in Knoxville, has seen an influx of patients with classic allergy symptoms since late February.\n\nTree, grass and weed pollen all are high throughout the year in East Tennessee, and wind can carry pollen hundreds of miles.\n\n“A lot of the pollen – because of the geography in the area – kind of settles down here in between the mountains,” he explained. “I think that makes East Tennessee unique because there's a lot of pollen that comes through here.”\n\nTree pollen is the biggest culprit during the spring, and it usually peaks in March. Grass pollen dominates in the summer.\n\nWho’s at risk for spring allergies?\n\nAs many as 60 million people in the United States experience hay fever every year due to pollen, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Certain people – like those with respiratory illnesses such as asthma – are more sensitive to pollen. Genetic factors also influence allergies.\n\nAnd then there’s something called the atopic (or allergic) march. It refers to the “natural history of allergic diseases as they develop over the course of infancy and childhood,” according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“Someone might have eczema as a young child and then as they get older eczema is a risk factor for food allergy, and so they might have eczema and food allergy,” Kolinsky explained.\n\n“It's also that type of individual that might have allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, or allergy nasal and eye symptoms and then also asthma.\"\n\nHow to beat the pollen\n\nKolinsky grew up in Knoxville and struggled with seasonal allergies throughout childhood and adolescence. It wasn’t until he was training to be an immunologist that he decided to get tested and learned more about his triggers.\n\nA skin test by a certified allergist can help you identify what you’re specifically allergic to, whether its grass pollen, tree pollen, a specific food or something else. Once the triggers are detected, the physician and patient can develop a treatment plan to control or alleviate flare ups.\n\nImmunotherapy allergy shots are one option. Kolinsky said it’s one of the best treatments because it desensitizes patients to their specific allergic triggers over time. Itchy, watery eyes, sneezing and other symptoms will decrease when you’re exposed to the allergen.\n\n“I'm on them myself. I think they’ve made a world of difference,” he added.\n\nThe allergy shots can be given to patients as young as 2 years old and even to those in their 80s, the allergist noted. If you're not ready for the shot, a range of over-the-counter medications are available to provide some relief.\n\nDevarrick Turner is a trending news reporter. Emaildevarrick.turner@knoxnews.com.

With Alabama ahead of only Mississippi in vaccinations and just 30% of the state’s population fully inoculated against the illness caused by the coronavirus, the Alabama Department of Senior Services said a new marketing campaign was aimed at overcoming vaccine hesitancy. The agency will work with local agencies for the aging and disability organizations to encourage more people to get shots. A telephone hotline will allow people to reach local services and make vaccination appointments, which has been difficult for some disabled people. Vaccination rates have dropped statewide to the lowest point since early this year, when doses were scarce, and only certain people were eligible to receive shots. While less than a third of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, precautions like face masks and social distancing are increasingly rare in the state. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are rising in a trend that is troubling to health experts. State statistics showed 252 people were being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals Thursday compared to a low of 166 late last month.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge is scheduled to hear arguments Monday in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a voter-approved initiative that would end party primaries in Alaska and institute ranked-choice voting in general elections. Scott Kohlhaas, who unsuccessfully ran for a state House seat last year as a Libertarian; Bob Bird, chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party; Bird’s party; and Anchorage attorney Kenneth P. Jacobus sued in December, shortly after the initiative was approved. In court documents, they say people “exercise their right of free political association by forming political parties for the purpose of electing candidates” and advancing issues and principles. They call the new voter-approved system a “political experiment” and say it was designed in a way to harm political parties. They cite concerns that candidates for minor parties, like the Alaskan Independence Party, could get “lost in the shuffle” in a primary where all candidates are listed on one ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election. Attorneys for the state Department of Law in court documents say the plaintiffs’ opposition includes a mix of policy arguments and speculation. They say the claims raised by the plaintiffs “rest on a misunderstanding” of what the initiative does, according to court filings.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Friday signed legislation banning state or local governments from requiring training in “critical race theory” and a bill creating a new small-business income tax category that will allow small-business owners to avoid paying any of the 3.5% income tax surcharge voters approved in November. The new small-business tax is expected to cut $292 million from the original $836 million schools would have received under Proposition 208, according to the Legislature’s budget analysts. Backers of the initiative have vowed to block the new law by referring it to the ballot. Ducey also signed a measure that tightens the state’s sex education law and requires parents to give permission for instruction that includes sexual issues in non-sex ed classes. The broad requirement would block discussions of historic events that have a sexual component, like the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York, considered the genesis of the modern gay rights movement, or even the U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage, without parental preapproval. “Parents should have the right to know what their children are learning in school,” Ducey said in a statement. “This is a no-brainer piece of legislation that protects our children from learning materials that aren’t suited for them.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas State Police on Friday handed over to prosecutors the results of the agency’s investigation into a deputy’s fatal shooting of a white teenager that has drawn the attention of civil rights activists nationwide. Lonoke County Prosecutor Chuck Graham said his office received the case file on the shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain by Lonoke County sheriff’s deputy Sgt. Michael Davis during a June 23 traffic stop. Graham said the file has been taken to the state prosecutor coordinator since he’s requested a special prosecutor to handle the case. Authorities have released few details about the shooting, and State Police earlier Friday referred questions about the case file to Graham’s office. Brittain’s family has said the teenager was unarmed and holding a jug of antifreeze at the time of the shooting. Prosecutor Coordinator Bob McMahan said a special prosecutor should be named early this week. Davis was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred. Staley said there’s no footage from the shooting, only the aftermath. The Rev. Al Sharpton and two attorneys who represented George Floyd said the teen’s death highlighted the need for interracial support for efforts to reform police practices.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBurbank: Batman’s secret cave, Harry Potter’s cupboard under the stairs and the apartment from “Friends” are major centerpieces to the huge Warner Bros. studio lot expansion. Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood recently reopened more than a year after doors were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, attendees will have a chance to explore the studio’s nearly 100 years of television and filmmaking history, highlighting the DC Universe and “Harry Potter.” A firsthand look took place a couple of days before the tour opened in late June at the Southern California studio, which now welcomes families with children ages 5 and older. Warner Bros. officials said the expansion – which includes a new building – took five years to develop in Burbank. Officials say the studio tour will follow all city, state and federal COVID-19 safety protocols. “One of the most incredible things about Warner Brothers is the incredible history of epic films that are legendary,” said “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, who helped reopen the tour.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: A 10-year-old died of plague in La Plata County, San Juan Basin Public Health said Friday. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and health officials said they are investigating the case and will provide more information as it becomes available, 9News reports. No other information on the child was immediately released. “We are so sad for the loss of this young Coloradan, and our deepest condolences go to the family,” said Dr. Jennifer House of the health department. “Public Health is doing an epidemiological investigation and wants Coloradans to know that while this disease is very rare, it does occur sometimes and to seek medical care if you have symptoms.” Officials say plague is caused by bacteria that can be transmitted to humans by the bites of infected fleas or by direct contact with infected animals. The risk of contracting certain animal-borne diseases, while present year-round, increases during the summer when humans and animals are frequently in close contact. Most human plague cases are acquired directly from fleas. Officials say it’s important to wear repellent when outdoors and keep up to date on pet vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says symptoms of the plague include fever, headache, chills, weakness, and one or more swollen, tender and painful lymph nodes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State employee union leaders are suing to stop Gov. Ned Lamont’s order to have workers return to the office now that much of the state has emerged from the pandemic, accusing him of violating prior telework agreements reached with the unions and ignoring the benefits of having people work from home. The State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which filed the request for an injunction in Hartford Superior Court on Tuesday, said in a statement that state workers proved throughout the COVID-19 crisis that a flexible teleworking agreement could be beneficial to the state of Connecticut. “From increased productivity and quality performance to the positive environmental impacts like reduced emissions, improved air quality and public health, the benefits of telework are clear and something that the Administration should be taking a proud step in leading,” SEBAC said in a statement posted on its website. In May, Lamont sent an email to state employees announcing that they would be returning to their offices as of July 1 and that any telework would be limited to no more than 50% of their time, with manager approval.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: More than 111 years after it sank off the Delmarva coast and 43 years after divers found and looted it, researchers can finally – and officially – say where the USS Nina is located and why the U.S. Navy steamer built in the 1860s likely sank. The University of Delaware is a big reason why. A two-day mission out of Lewes led by UD oceanographer Dr. Arthur Trembanis in mid-June used the school’s new autonomous underwater vehicle to help identify the sunken ship. The university has been partnering with the Navy for nearly a decade, and Trembanis’ group has been mapping the seafloor for years. The drone used during the mission has a shape similar to a small torpedo. Trembanis needed to test the new equipment and said the “stars aligned” nicely for this mission since Dr. Jim Delgado, senior vice president of SEARCH Inc., a cultural resource management firm, had been talking about a mission to officially identify the Nina. Using UD’s technology, the mission did in hours what divers and researchers may have needed days or weeks to do. “We’re really privileged at UD to have one of the most largest and advanced fleets of autonomous systems in the country,” Trembanis said. A violent February storm appears the likely culprit for the ship’s loss.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With more homicides so far in 2021 than by this same time in 2020 and carjacking incidents skyrocketing, the police department is trying to get a handle on the crimes by getting back to the basics of community policing. D.C. police officers in the 4th District have been hitting the streets, knocking on doors and starting conversations with people in the community, WUSA-TV reports. “This is an opportunity for folks to really give us some feedback – let us know what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong,” Inspector James Madison Boteler said. The work officers are doing is part of an initiative called “100 blocks in 100 days.” “It’s really just a get-back-to-the-basics kind of police work,” he said. Boteler, who is in a newly appointed position with the 4th Police District, is teaming up with officers covering parts of Northwest and Northeast to build better relationships with neighbors. “The amount of folks that live in the city versus the amount of crime that we respond to on a daily basis is ever-increasing,” Boteler said. To help fight that crime and the growing number of homicides year after year in the district, Chief Robert Contee selected a handful of inspectors to serve as second-in-command for larger police districts.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Red tide could cause people along certain parts of the Gulf Coast to experience respiratory irritation, health officials said. The Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County on Sunday recommended that anyone with chronic respiratory problems consider staying away from areas experiencing red tide, the Tampa Bay Times reports. Officials also advised people not to swim around dead fish and to keep pets away from water, sea foam and dead marine life. The National Weather Service in Tampa issued a beach hazards statement Saturday evening cautioning that red tide can cause coughing, sneezing and tears in the eyes and that symptoms can be worse for people with asthma, emphysema or other chronic lung diseases. Red tide is an algae bloom producing toxins that kill fish. The toxins may also make the surrounding air difficult to breathe and often turn the water red. Those with allergies also can be affected, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Close told the newspaper. “And just the smell, dead fish smell,” he said. St. Petersburg crews cleaned up 9 tons of dead fish in 24 hours last week, the paper reports. During a news conference Friday, St. Petersburg Emergency Manager Amber Boulding said red tide blooms killed the fish, and Tropical Storm Elsa pushed them ashore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Biden administration’s decision to reevaluate Georgia’s plan to overhaul how residents buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act came as a “surprise” and suggests it wants to revisit the plan’s approval, which is not allowed, Gov. Brian Kemp’s office said. The “Georgia Access” plan would improve the experience of shopping for insurance and encourage the private sector to enroll uninsured residents, the director of Kemp’s Office of Health Strategy and Coordination said in a letter to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Despite unsubstantiated claims to the contrary, Georgia Access will put more affordable, quality insurance coverage within reach of consumers in our state than a one-size-fits-all federal solution,” said the letter by Grant Thomas. Under the Republican governor’s plan, residents would bypass healthcare.gov and shop for federally subsidized health insurance through private agents. Critics worry the move will make it harder to shop for insurance and drive healthy people to cheaper plans that provide limited coverage, increasing premiums for older and sicker people who need the comprehensive benefits required by the ACA because the move to private websites would make it easier for consumers to simultaneously see plans that don’t provide all the benefits required by the federal health care law.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: To protect historic lands from invasive goats, officials will distribute the live animals to the public via a lottery. Hawaii officials will hold the lottery as a way to remove at least 700 goats from Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historic Park, which is an important cultural and historical site on the west side of the Big Island, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Those interested in the goats may apply for permits, which will be issued through a random lottery July 28. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources will distribute 20 to 50 goats per permit. Applicants must indicate how many goats they want and can’t choose individual animals. Lottery winners must have a 16-foot enclosed horse trailer or equivalent to pick up the goats so that they don’t escape. A permit can be refused if a trailer isn’t secured.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Friday mobilized the Idaho National Guard to help fight wildfires amid an ongoing drought and extreme heat. The Republican governor issued an emergency declaration allowing soldiers to help fight fires on the 9,700 square miles in mostly northern Idaho where the state provides fire protection. “Wildfire is presenting an imminent threat to life, property, and the environment, and we need all hands on deck,” Little said in a statement. “I appreciate our firefighters and fire managers for working so hard under such challenging conditions, and I am grateful that our guardsmen are able to step in once again to support Idaho communities.” It’s the first time the Idaho Department of Lands has requested the governor issue such an emergency declaration. The agency said the soldiers will help with fire suppression and logistics support. State officials didn’t say how many soldiers might be deployed to help with wildfires. Officials also said National Guard Blackhawk helicopters could be used to drop water or other suppressants on fires as well as transport firefighters and supplies. Besides tapping the National Guard, the Lands Department has also requested workers in the agency with fire line qualifications to make themselves available for fire assignments.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to this year’s Illinois State Fair will be able to visit one of the nation’s more historic highways with the creation of the Route 66 Experience. The multiyear project will turn the Springfield fairgrounds’ Gate 2 into a year-round destination for visiting a microform of the Mother Road in Illinois, from Chicago to the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River in Madison. It will highlight communities and attractions along the way. The project sponsor, the Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway, will have the first phase completed by the state fair’s opening Aug. 12, executive director Casey Wichmann said. “Being able to provide visitors a central location to experience what our historic road has to offer is an amazing opportunity prior to the 100th anniversary of Route 66,” Wichmann said. The 2,448-mile highway, one of the nation’s first interstate “hard roads,” was begun 95 years ago. Dubbed the “Mother Road” by John Steinbeck in his novel “The Grapes of Wrath,” it runs from Chicago’s Loop business district to Santa Monica, California. Its path through Illinois is similar to that of current-day Interstate 55. Once running, the exhibit will feature Quick Response codes and story boards detailing historic attractions and businesses. Those communities lining Route 66 will be invited to participate.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: Six inmates are alleging in lawsuits that they were kept in near-total darkness for weeks at a time and suffered electric shocks from exposed wires at a state prison. The lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana claim the conditions at the maximum-security Miami Correctional Facility near Peru amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuits claim that the six men were held in isolation cells that had no lights and that some of them suffered cuts from broken window glass and were shocked by dangling wires from a broken light fixture while trying to make their way around in the dark. ACLU of Indiana attorney Ken Falk called the prison’s action “torture.” Inmate Jeremy Blanchard’s lawsuit filed in March said he was kept in nearly total darkness for about a month last year, and the conditions led to hallucinations and severe anxiety. Attorneys for the state have denied the allegations and asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The other five lawsuits were filed this month. A Department of Correction spokeswoman declined to comment on those cases.\n\nIowa\n\nVentura: The road running between a marsh wildlife area and Clear Lake in this small northern Iowa city is dangerous for turtles, even with a turtle crossing sign. So five boys have spent some time this summer helping the turtles cross it. On one recent summer day, they spent several hours assisting turtles, saving 20 to 30 from being flattened by motorists, and they reckon they’ve saved close to 200 overall, the Mason City Globe Gazette reports. “One time, I saw a pile of flattened turtles and two baby turtles – their parents must’ve died – so that motivated me to save other turtles,” said 10-year-old Zacaious Moe. Four friends have joined Zacaious in the turtle rescuing: Keygan Hoover, 9; Blake Meyer, 8; Cole Meyer, 10; and Casen Wenzel, 8. “That’s such a neat thing for them to spend their day doing that,” said Ventura City Administrator Else Taylor. Taylor said the turtle crossing sign and a geese crossing sign have been up for several years. “We have had issues with geese and turtles getting run over in large amounts,” she said. “I walk my dog by some of these places, and there are turtle pancakes.”\n\nKansas\n\nCheney: A central Kansas farmer has invented robots that can whack weeds and reduce the use of pesticides on crops. For years, Clint Brauer has struggled with keeping weeds out of his row crops. Along with keeping living roots in the ground, organic practices and no-till methods, he tried crimping, but the pigweeds just grew taller. Three years ago, Brauer, an ex-California-based executive who farms in Haven and Cheney, decided to implement a wild plan, using robots to behead weeds. “I realized there was no great way to get the weeds out at scale without chemicals,” Brauer said. “I needed to invent one.” So he started Greenfield Robotics. Before chemicals replaced them, workers pulled weeds from the farm. Greenfield Robotics puts the “workers” back in the field with a new kind of worker – a mechanized one. “We want to control weeds with labor and make it robot labor,” Brauer said. “Robotics is our way of putting (mechanized) labor back into the farm.” The challenge was that he felt regenerative farming did not work for large fields without the heavy use of agrichemicals. “I came up with the idea for it and tested it manually,” he said. “No one knew if it would work. It has to fit between rows.” Brauer uses the weeding bots on other farmers’ soybean crops in the area and hopes to work with sorghum, cotton and possibly canola farmers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Capitol is open again for visitors, but some fresh security regulations are in place. The new rules include measures detailing the types of masks allowed in the Capitol and prohibiting visitors from congregating in office entrances but still allow people to carry any gun of their choosing, with certain restrictions on ammunition and how they are secured. Gov. Andy Beshear said the emergency Capitol security measures were needed following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the building and forced the evacuation of members from both chambers. He also cited “a rise in domestic terror around the country.” Armed protesters have been a common sight outside the Capitol since the onset of the pandemic and even after the Jan. 6 insurrection, with the president of the Kentucky Three Percenters notably hanging the governor in effigy at one protest. About a dozen masked men wearing camouflage and carrying rifles posed for photos in the Capitol Rotunda in early 2020 – the same day as a large protest against a proposed “red flag” gun law – near the governor’s office, while the House and Senate were in session. Visitors won’t be allowed to wear their own face mask in the Capitol but will be given one by security as they enter.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: The state’s newest food trail has the quirky name No Man’s Land: Gas Station Eats. No Man’s Land was one of the names for a buffer zone between U.S. and Spanish territories for about 13 years after the Louisiana Purchase. The Gas Station Eats food trail is starting with three stops in each of seven southwest Louisiana parishes, The American Press reports. The 450-mile route runs through Calcasieu, Allen, Beauregard, Sabine, Natchitoches, Vernon and DeSoto parishes. Stops range from the South Beau Dairy Barn in the Beauregard Parish community of Longville to French Market Express, which offers meat pies, plate lunches, yam cakes, cookies and pies in Natchitoches. There’s also an Exxon station in Natchitoches, Big Thicket BBQ in DeRidder, a Shop-A-Lott in Mansfield and another in Many, Anacoco Mercantile, and a Grab N Geaux in Lake Charles. Several stops offer fried boudin balls and whole sausages such as boudin and andouille. Others have fried fish, burgers, sandwiches – and, in Zwolle, tamales. All are in the seven-parish area known as No Man’s Land and the Neutral Strip from about 1806 until a treaty in 1819 established the Sabine River as the boundary between the United States and what later became the state of Texas.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The state is nearly tripling the number of acoustic shark detectors in coastal waters a year after its first fatal shark attack. The Maine Department of Marine Resources deployed eight acoustic receivers in coastal waters a year ago between Wells and Popham Beach, raising the number of sensors to 11. This summer, the state has deployed 32 acoustic receivers between York and Boothbay Harbor, said agency spokesperson Jeff Nichols. The sensors don’t provide real-time data. They must be brought to shore for the data to be downloaded to determine if they detected sharks that were previously tagged with transmitters by researchers, the Bangor Daily News reports. The extra sensors come a year a fatal attack in Harpswell. Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, of New York City, was killed by a great white shark while swimming. It was Maine’s first fatal shark attack and the third fatal shark attack in New England. An increasing presence of large sharks in New England waters is tied to a growing number of seals.\n\nMaryland\n\nTowson: Mobile crisis teams in Baltimore County respond to fewer than half of calls to help people having mental health crises. But The Baltimore Sun reports that a pilot program funded by a $1.6 million federal grant aims to add more behavioral health professionals and set up a system to redirect some 911 calls from police to behavioral health resources. Of 4,319 calls for service since September, crisis teams have responded to 1,844, according to police data. When teams aren’t available – about 57% of the time – requests for aid are rerouted to officers, according to Police Chief Melissa Hyatt. “We have a significant capacity limitation,” Hyatt told lawmakers during a state Commission to Study Mental and Behavioral Health briefing earlier this year. There are 20 part-time and full-time clinicians and 12 officers with 40 hours of crisis intervention training in the county of nearly 830,000 residents. Next month, officials begin planning the program’s rollout, police spokeswoman Joy Stewart said. The program was announced just weeks before a May rampage in which a man set his Woodlawn home on fire and killed three neighbors before police killed him. Police said crisis teams had previous interactions with him but didn’t disclose more details.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Archaeologists combing a hill near Plymouth Rock where a park will be built in tribute to the Pilgrims and their Native American predecessors have made a poignant discovery: It’s not the first time the site has been used as a memorial. David Landon of the University of Massachusetts-Boston’s Fiske Center for Archaeological Research said his team unearthed a cache of personal items he thinks were buried there in the late 1800s, most likely by a brokenhearted settler who had outlived all three of her children. Landon said the objects – eyeglasses, clothing, sewing implements, a pocket watch and a book – gave him chills because they turned up during final excavations of Cole’s Hill, a National Historic Landmark site in Plymouth where Remembrance Park is set to be constructed. “Someone clearly used that space in that fashion in the past to memorialize members of their family,” said Landon, whose team spent the past month scouring the waterfront site where the Pilgrims are said to have come ashore in 1620. Remembrance Park originally was conceived to mark 2020’s 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim’s 1620 arrival, the founding of Plymouth Colony and the settlers’ historic interactions with the indigenous Wampanoag people. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit, idling events as well as construction.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Massive amounts of green are being spent to find green ways to prevent basements, yards, streets and freeways in the city from flooding during heavy storms like one last month. Of $100 million pumped each year into infrastructure upgrades for the city’s aging water and sewer systems, $10 million goes toward installing detention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens and permeable pavement. Called green stormwater infrastructure, the features hold and slowly release rainfall into sewers, lessening flooding that has plagued Detroit and other older cities for decades. “It’s not the end-all-be-all, but it is a type of intervention that reduces wet weather flows into the system or delays them,” said Palencia Mobley, deputy director and chief engineer for Detroit’s Water and Sewerage Department. City officials say 6 inches of rain that poured down in the area June 25-26 was the most at one time in 80 years. As with a funnel beneath a swiftly flowing faucet, the volume of water moved faster than it could be pumped out or pushed through sewers to water treatment plants. Water pooled in streets and yards as debris clogged sewer grates. Untreated water pushed up through basement drains. Motorists were stranded on freeways. New vehicles in one auto plant lot were nearly submerged.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state is planning to close all but one of its COVID-19 mass vaccination sites by Aug. 7. A statement from Gov. Tim Walz late Friday said the state will focus on the several hundred smaller vaccination sites around the state, at pharmacies and health care providers. Minnesota Public Radio reports the state’s COVID-19 vaccination rate has been stagnant in recent weeks, at about two-thirds of residents 16 and older with at least one vaccine dose. Health officials have been turning to small-scale, targeted efforts to get the shots to more people. As of Friday the state reported administering more than 618,000 vaccine doses at the mass vaccination sites since January. The Mall of America location will be the only state-run mass vaccination site to stay open past the first week of August. As of Sunday, the state-run sites in St. Paul, Oakdale, Lino Lakes, Duluth, Rochester, Mankato and St. Cloud are only offering second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in their final weeks of operation. The state-run site at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport will offer the one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine until it closes in early August.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: The Justice Department is continuing its investigation into the killing of Emmett Till, the Black teenager whose slaying 65 years ago in the Mississippi Delta community of Money sparked outrage and illustrated the brutality of racism in the segregated South. The department’s latest report on civil rights cold cases, released late last month, lists three investigations dating back decades that were closed because witnesses or suspects have died, leads went nowhere, or cases were too old to prosecute, but the Till case wasn’t among them. Relatives of Till said they didn’t know of anyone in the family who’d received official notification that the review had ended, a key step in the department’s process. “That’s all we know, that it’s still open,” family member Marvel Parker said Friday. Her husband, Wheeler Parker, was with Till the night he was taken from a family home at gunpoint. The youth’s brutalized body was later pulled from a river, where it had been weighted down with a cotton gin fan. Some news outlets reported last year that the investigation had ended. Initially closed in 2007, the case was reopened after a 2017 book quoted a key figure in the case, Carolyn Bryant Donham, as saying she lied when she claimed that the 14-year-old Till grabbed her, whistled and made sexual advances.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Three of the state’s top health officials said Friday that trusted local leaders and community representatives must be the primary influencers in the state’s efforts to reduce a surge in COVID-19 cases. During a virtual news conference, Robert Knodell, acting director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said the state continues to have a strong relationship with federal health experts, but they all believe local health department workers and community representatives are the best avenue for persuading residents to be vaccinated. Knodell said federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials agree that people from out of state cannot “parachute” into Missouri to persuade residents to get vaccinated. “We’re on the same page as it relates to that,” Knodell said. The comments came after Republican Gov. Mike Parson said last week that he does not support a suggestion from President Joe Biden’s administration that government employees go door-to-door to urge people to get vaccinated. Jeffrey Zeints, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, responded that the program would rely on local doctors, faith leaders and others, and suggesting otherwise was “misinformation.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has discontinued Montana’s membership in a coalition of two dozen states dedicated to fighting climate change. The U.S. Climate Alliance is a nonpartisan group committed to achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Democratic former Gov. Steve Bullock joined the alliance in 2019. The alliance is made up of nearby Western states, including Colorado, Washington and Oregon. Evan Westrup, of the U.S. Climate Alliance, said Gianforte did not respond to the organization’s invitation to continue the state’s membership, Montana Public Radio reports. Gianforte spokesperson Brooke Stroyke said in a statement that the governor believes the solution to climate change is unleashing American innovation, not overbearing government mandates. She said the Paris Agreement punishes the U.S., while letting countries like China off the hook. Stroyke didn’t respond to requests to clarify Gianforte’s climate goals, or what sort of innovation is necessary in Montana. Amy Cilimburg, executive director of Climate Smart Missoula, said the state needs more than innovation. “The U.S. Climate Alliance was not some kind of a radical group; it was governors realizing that we’re stronger together,” Cilimburg said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Roughly 200 people were possibly exposed to a rabid bat while staying overnight at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, the zoo said. The zoo and Nebraska health officials recommended that roughly 186 campers who stayed overnight at the aquarium in recent weeks, as well as some staffers, get rabies shots. A camper on July 4 woke up to a wild bat flying around her head. A zoo emergency medical technician didn’t find any bites or scratches on her. The zoo found seven wild bats in the aquarium and euthanized them. One tested positive for rabies. The zoo in a news release Friday said it has recommended that people exposed to wild bats while they were sleeping get rabies shots. The zoo gave campers refunds and is paying for their shots. Animal Health Director Dr. Sarah Woodhouse said in a statement that guests who visited the aquarium during the day shouldn’t be concerned because bats only come out at night. “The bats we identified were little brown bats, a common bat species in Nebraska that anyone could find in their backyard or attic,” Woodhouse said. “It is not unusual for a wild bat to be infected with rabies, which is why you should never directly touch a wild bat.” Zoo staff didn’t find any signs of long-term bat roosting at the aquarium.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Department of Energy has agreed to pay the state $65,000 after the government mislabeled and mischaracterized low-level radioactive waste that was shipped to a disposal site north of Las Vegas for more than five years. The settlement agreement announced Thursday certifies that multiple changes have been made to prevent unapproved waste from being shipped and disposed of at the Nevada National Security Site in the future, state and federal officials said. It also establishes an additional groundwater monitoring well at the site. The Energy Department has said none of the materials shipped to Nevada posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public. They were mischaracterized as the wrong category of low-level waste and should have been classified as low-level mixed waste, the state’s review determined. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals. Former Energy Secretary Rick Perry notified Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak in July 2019 that 33 packages of unapproved waste were sent in 10 shipments between 2013 and 2018 to the site from the Energy Department’s Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A council tasked with addressing broad issues around housing affordability and stability in the state seeks to increase housing availability by 13,500 units by 2024, according to its plan released Friday. The plan includes a three-year framework to specifically address homelessness across the state, with emphasis on the need for an increase in inventory of affordable housing. Recommendations include promoting new housing development, reducing barriers to affordable housing, and using a data-driven approach to understand regional needs. “The plan serves as a blueprint for our collective efforts – statewide, regionally, and locally – with a focus on alignment, coordination, innovation, and accountability,” Gov. Chris Sununu, who created the council last year, said in a statement. Sununu created the Council on Housing Stability after state police cleared a homeless encampment outside a courthouse in Manchester. It represents a revamping of the existing Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSeaside Heights: Gov. Phil Murphy signed a package of bills Friday aimed at moving the state closer to its goal of generating 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050. The measures make it easier to develop some solar energy projects and to locate and build electric vehicle charging stations. But still waiting for action by the Democratic governor is another bill that would remove most local control from where and how offshore wind energy projects come ashore. Murphy did not mention that bill at a signing ceremony in Seaside Heights in a municipal parking lot across the street from a popular water park. “From wind turbine component manufacturing to solar to electric vehicles, we are well on our way to putting New Jersey back to its rightful place as a national leader” in clean energy, Murphy said. One measure makes it easier to locate electric vehicle charging stations throughout the state, eliminating the need to go before planning or zoning boards to get them approved. A similar bill signed by the governor encourages development of zero-emission vehicle fueling and charging infrastructure in redevelopment projects. Murphy also signed two measures dealing with solar power projects. One allows so-called dual use solar projects located on unpreserved farm land that is still also used for agricultural purposes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Republican lawmakers are asking the state attorney general to weigh in on a spending dispute over $1.75 billion in federal pandemic relief aid. GOP leadership in a letter sent Thursday asked New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, a Democrat, to issue a legal opinion declaring the funds must be allocated by the Legislature to protect the body’s fiscal authority. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said her administration must distribute the money because of the way Congress passed the pandemic relief bill. The Legislature allocated money earlier this year, but Lujan Grisham used her veto power to effectively bring the money under discretionary control by her office. Republican lawmakers took issue. They, along with one vocal Democratic senator, signed a petition that called for an extraordinary legislative session to be convened to override the governor’s veto and bring the funds back under the Legislature’s control. Democratic majorities in the House and Senate did not sign on. “Standing on principle isn’t always popular,” Sen. Jacob Candelaria, D-Albuquerque, said on Twitter in response to a news article. “Was easy for my Dem colleagues to challenge (the) power of (former Republican Gov. Susana) Martinez. Such a fair weather commitment to the law.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases as vaccination rates slowly rise, according to data released Saturday. About 525 people each day tested positive for the coronavirus in New York for the seven days through Friday. That’s up from 369 people – a 42% increase – for the prior week. It’s unclear why more people in New York are testing positive, at a time when fewer people are getting tested. The state Department of Health said a higher percentage of cases are linked to more contagious variants and urged more people to get vaccinated. New York City is driving much of the increase in positives, though cases are also rising on parts of Long Island. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are flattening: Hospitals reported 342 COVID-19 patients as of Friday, similar to 340 patients from last Friday. About 55% of 20 million New Yorkers are fully vaccinated. That’s up from nearly 48% as of June 6. Vaccination rates are lowest in parts of western and central New York; about one-third of residents in Allegany County are fully vaccinated. Rates are also lower in parts of New York City: 43% of Bronx residents and 45.5% of Brooklyn residents are fully inoculated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: Fayetteville State University has used pandemic relief funds to clear $1.6 million in tuition debt for nearly 1,500 students. The Fayetteville Observer reports the historically Black school utilized money from the federal legislation that’s known as the American Rescue Plan. Signed into law in March, it provided nearly $40 billion to higher education institutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. FSU cleared tuition that was not covered by federal student grants or loans. The school also plans to use $4.7 million in federal funds to provide free summer classes to 1,400 undergraduates through the summer of 2023. “The university is focused on students’ success by clearing past due balances and erasing debt,” FSU spokeswoman Joy Cook said. “When the burden of financial stress is taken away, student success increases.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A Midwestern network and technology services provider says it plans to invest $200 million to upgrade and expand its fiber network in North Dakota. Midco said it’s part of a larger $500 million investment to its network in the upper Midwest that will benefit telehealth, education, government operations and remote working. Upgrading to 10-gigabit speed by 2030 is a goal toward which the cable provider has been working for the past couple years. “Now we think we can do it sooner,” said Midco President and CEO Pat McAdaragh. The phased upgrade begins in earnest in 2022, doubling Midco’s fiber network to 22,000 miles, McAdaragh said. Work in North Dakota will begin with a $100 million first phase in Bismarck, Dickinson and Fargo, lasting about three years. “Then immediately we’ll begin spending the other $100 million and getting to areas we haven’t gotten to done yet, so we’re looking at more of a six-year process than 10,” McAdaragh said. More than 25 communities, many of them rural, stand to benefit from the upgrade in North Dakota, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Midco expects remote work to continue to be an employment trend, sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOhio\n\nRootstown: An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper successfully performed the Heimlich maneuver after a man allegedly attempted to swallow a bag of cannabis when he was pulled over for speeding. Ohio State Police Sgt. Ray Santiago said the traffic stop occurred July 3 in Portage County. Trooper Charles Hoskin stopped a vehicle that was allegedly traveling at 94 mph in a 70 mph zone, WEWS-TV reports. Dash camera video posted to the Ohio State Police Twitter account shows Hoskin asking if the driver could breathe before helping him out of the car and performing the Heimlich. The man expelled a bag of marijuana and apologized to the officer. After the man recovered, Hoskins asked: “Do you want to die over a minor misdemeanor?” The man received citations for speeding and failing to wear a seat belt, according to Santiago. The man also received a summons for marijuana and was released at the scene.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials on Friday urged more residents to get vaccinated amid an alarming spike in new cases and hospitalizations for COVID-19, particularly in the northeastern part of the state. Oklahoma is seeing an uptick in cases with the emergence of the new delta variant of the coronavirus, particularly in rural areas where there are lower rates of vaccinations, said Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye. He said those numbers will likely continue to increase following the Fourth of July holiday. “Vaccination numbers for 12 to 34 years old are particularly low, meaning this demographic is especially at risk,” Frye said. “We want people to get out and enjoy their lives and their freedoms. Vaccination is the way to get there.” Oklahoma has the 11th lowest percentage of its population fully inoculated at 38.9%, compared to a national average of 47.8%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma has risen over the past two weeks from 190.29 new cases per day June 23 to 278.71 new cases per day Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, the CDC on Friday said it identified 47 cases, all with the delta variant, in April and May associated with a central Oklahoma gymnastics facility.\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Dozens of baby hawks, desperate to escape a blast of early summer heat in recent weeks, bailed from their nests and plummeted to the ground. Calls poured into Blue Mountain Wildlife day after day as temperatures pushed beyond 110 degrees across Eastern Oregon. Lynn Tompkins told the East Oregonian that she hadn’t seen anything like it in her 30 years as director of the wildlife rehabilitation center outside Pendleton. “They had no choice,” said Tompkins, 68. “It was just too bloody hot to survive.” In all, the center took in nearly 50 nestling Swainson’s and Cooper’s hawks after they leaped from their nests in the extreme heat wave that baked the Pacific Northwest. Thirteen of the raptors suffered injuries severe enough that they had to be euthanized. “We knew the temperature was going to spike beforehand, and we assumed we might get a few more calls,” said Trisha Marquez, a volunteer who fielded the calls and who is Tompkins’ niece. “But we did not expect this at all.” The influx was more than the small staff could handle. They hardly had the space to put them all and, eventually, asked people to turn on their sprinklers and hoses and set out pans of water for less-injured birds to cool themselves down.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A museum has returned to public view a 19th-century diorama that shows lions attacking a camel and its human rider, about a year after covering it up in response to complaints about how the courier was depicted. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports a curtain around “Lion Attacking a Dromedary” at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was removed a week ago, and information was posted to address the controversy. X-rays have confirmed that the figure contains a human skull and jaw, presenting an ethical problem for the museum, which does not know where those remains originated. The courier’s costume has been determined to be derived from at least five separate North African cultures. A new sign tells museum patrons that the exhibit, which vividly depicts two lions attacking a camel and its knife-wielding rider, is popular but reinforces stereotypes. “For the present, the museum is keeping the diorama on display,” the sign says. “We want to engage with visitors, staff, and community members to listen and learn from you as we consider the future of this diorama.” Museum director Gretchen Baker told the paper the curtains “were more harmful than not having them up at all,” and in hindsight covering the exhibit may not have been the right approach. The French-built diorama has been at the Carnegie since 1899.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee has vetoed legislation that would make property owners register with the state before listing short-term rentals through online lodging websites, to the chagrin of some concerned about the unregulated nature of the industry. “I cannot support this bill because it will create additional burden for property owners,” the Democratic governor wrote Thursday in a veto message. “Short-term rental concerns, like other property/land use and small business matters, are most effectively addressed at the municipal level.” Some municipal leaders and residents are worried about properties rented on vacation rental websites like Airbnb and VRBO becoming de facto hotels. Calls for a registry increased in the spring after a 22-year-old University of Rhode Island student was fatally stabbed during a party at a rental property in Newport. The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by the heavily Democratic Legislature, which can override McKee’s veto. Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement that they were “disappointed” by the veto.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservationists have pulled a historic canoe from a river and plan to put it on display. Volunteers with the Chattooga Conservancy hauled the weathered wooden canoe out of the South Carolina side of the Chattooga River on Tuesday after a group of canoeists headed downstream discovered the craft last fall, The State newspaper reports. Archaeologists at the University of South Carolina say the boat could be 200 to 250 years old, a discovery that could shed light on life in the late 1700s. Canoes of that age are rarely found along the Chattooga, a free-flowing mountain river that runs along the Georgia-South Carolina border. Most of South Carolina’s historic canoes have been found in the state’s Lowcountry region, said underwater archaeologist James Spirek. “Up in the mountains on the rivers, they’re a little rare,” Spirek told the newspaper. “It’s interesting to find people were using canoes on some of these wild rivers.” The experts said the canoe was hollowed out using an iron hatchet or ax, suggesting it was made after Europeans settled in the Southeast. A nail was also found at one end of the canoe. Volunteers are expected this week to pull the boat up a mountain slope and down a bank to then float it down a calmer river stretch to move it out of the river corridor for storage or display.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two Native Americans announced Thursday that they were joining a lawsuit against South Dakota alleging that state agencies failed to offer voter registration services. The two tribal members, along with the Lakota People’s Law Project, said they were asking a federal district judge to allow them to join a lawsuit that alleges state agencies are breaking federal law by not providing ample opportunities to register to vote or update voter registration information at places like motor vehicle and public assistance offices near Native American reservations. Federal law requires the agencies to help people register to vote at those kinds of offices, including ones that provide public assistance or serve people with disabilities. The Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe initiated the legal challenge last year. The state has denied those allegations in court documents and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. The tribes have argued that state practices already make it difficult for Native American people to register to vote. They alleged that they have documented instances in which people tried to register their votes at state agency offices but were turned away.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Friday halted enforcement of a new state law requiring businesses to post special signs if they allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. The first-of-its-kind law went into effect July 1 and would require such businesses to post signs on multiperson bathrooms that say: “This facility maintains a policy of allowing the use of restrooms by either biological sex, regardless of the designation on the restroom.” Businesses in Nashville and Chattanooga sued over the law, claiming that being forced to post those signs would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to communicate language they find offensive. The state of Tennessee argued in court that the signs are merely factual. In her Friday decision, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger handed a victory to the businesses that sued, granting a preliminary injunction that effectively prevents the state from enforcing the law while the case works through the courts. She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has found that compelling individuals to “mouth support for views they find objectionable” violates a cardinal constitutional command unless justified by “the strongest of rationales.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Houston man who received widespread attention after standing six hours in line to cast a ballot in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary was in jail Friday on charges that it was illegal for him to vote at all because he was on parole. Hervis Rogers became an overnight face of Texas’ battle over voting access when he emerged from a polling center at a historically Black college around 1:30 a.m. He was among Houston voters on Super Tuesday who waited more than an hour – some for several hours – in mostly minority, Democratic neighborhoods. Lines in mostly white, Republican neighborhoods were shorter. “The way it was set up, it was like it was set up for me to walk away,” Rogers told reporters. He was arrested this week on two counts of illegal voting, a second-degree felony that carries a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. His bail was set at $100,000. Rogers, 62, voted last March while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Andre Segura, an attorney for the ACLU of Texas who is representing Rogers, said his client did not know he was ineligible to vote. “We shouldn’t be prosecuting people for innocent mistakes,” Segura said. The rare arrest on illegal voting allegations comes as Texas Republicans begin a second attempt at passing many of the same restrictive voting measures blocked by Democrats during a dramatic late-night walkout in May.\n\nUtah\n\nMilford: Just outside this town of about 1,400 people in southwest Utah, researchers behind a major energy project are hoping to tap into a limitless supply of clean, reliable power. The energy exists thousands of feet below the surface, where the natural heat from the Earth’s core can be used to create electricity. Researchers at the Utah-based FORGE lab are working on technology to create geothermal reservoirs almost anywhere in the world, KUER reports. Geothermal power already exists but currently makes up just 0.4% of energy production in the U.S. So far it’s largely been limited to select areas around naturally occurring hot springs, such as the Roosevelt Hot Springs in Beaver County. FORGE lab researchers have recently completed one of two major wells they’ll use to develop the tools to build “enhanced geothermal systems” – human-made versions of natural geothermal reservoirs that pump water through cracks underground, heat it, and use the steam to power turbines or to heat buildings. If successful, the project and others like it could lead to “a 40-fold increase over present geothermal power generating capacity,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “The world is looking at Milford,” said Joseph Moore, a geologist and lead researcher at FORGE.\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: The state is undergoing a pandemic-related liquor shortage, regulators say, leading to empty shelves in some stores and warehouses, WCAX-TV reports. “It is a global issue. A lot of it has been exacerbated by the pandemic. It’s not going to be a quick fix,” said Wendy Knight, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Liquor and Lottery. It’s a global supply chain issue “from production gearing back up from the pandemic, worker shortages, shipping issues, and a glass shortage. That comes on top of demand from restaurants and bars reopening,” she said. The Burlington bar The Archives planned to open a second location in Winooski last year, but the pandemic kept it closed until Thursday. Now the arcade bar is facing another obstacle. “The liquor shortage has been a challenge,” the bar’s co-owner Matthew Walters said. Bars and restaurants are not the only ones feeling the tight supply. “There’s enough to at least have your second choice, if not your first,” George Bergin of the Beverage Warehouse in Winooski told the news station. “With all the bars and restaurants opening up everywhere, everyone is trying to restock their shelves, and it’s just taking a little bit of time to get caught up with the sudden demand.” Vermont saw a 13% increase in liquor sales amid the pandemic, Knight said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Cheers erupted Saturday as a Confederate statue that towered for nearly a century over downtown was carted away by truck from the city where it had become a flashpoint for racist protests and deadly violence. It was a day of palpable joy and immense relief for scores of residents and visitors who lined neighboring streets to watch the larger-than-life figure of Gen. Robert E. Lee as it was hoisted from its pedestal and taken – at least for now – to storage. The statue’s removal came more than five years after racial justice activists had renewed a push to take down the monument, an initiative that drew the attention of white supremacists and other racist groups, culminating in the violent “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. “I’m ecstatic that we’re here now. It’s sad that it’s taken so much to get us to this point. But this is an incredible day,” said Don Gathers, a local Black activist who long advocated for the statue’s removal. Work to remove Lee’s statue, as well as one of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson shortly after, proceeded peacefully and without interruption. Also removed Saturday was a statue depicting Sacagawea and explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark that has been criticized for a depiction of the Native American guide and interpreter that some view as subservient and weak.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A federal jury has convicted a timber thief who authorities said started a large forest fire in a case that prosecutors said marked the first time tree DNA had been introduced in a federal trial. The jury deliberated for about seven hours before convicting Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, on Thursday of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, and trafficking and attempted trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Western Washington said in a news release. The wood he sold to a mill in the city of Tumwater had been harvested from private property with a valid permit, Wilke said. But a research geneticist for the U.S. Forest Service, Richard Cronn, testified that the wood he sold genetically matched the remains of three poached trees. Wilke used gasoline to destroy a wasp’s nest in the base of a maple tree he was stealing, prosecutors said, though jurors did not convict him of charges related to the fire. Some witnesses testified that, although Wilke was standing next to the nest when the fire began, they did not actually see his actions in the dark. Wilke and others conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal, between April and August 2018, according to records filed in the case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice called on Saturday for the resignation of a state lawmaker who posted a sexually explicit TikTok video to his public account. State Del. Joe Jeffries was stripped of a committee assignment Friday after word spread of the social media posting, according to a statement from House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who called his fellow Republican an “embarrassment.” On Saturday, the GOP governor issued a statement calling Jeffries’ behavior “sad” and “childish.” “Not only did he yell graphic comments about me to a group of senators during the recent Legislative Session, but now we find that his not-so-secret TikTok is full of disgustingly vulgar videos, which are especially insulting to women,” Justice’s statement said. “This is the behavior of an immature child, not a 39-year-old father and elected official.” The governor said he had expected to hear an apology from Jeffries by Saturday morning, “but all he has done is hide from the media and the criticism.” Jeffries, whose district includes a group of counties near Charleston, posted the video Thursday. His account was set to private Friday. Belinda Biafore, chair of the West Virginia Democratic Party, said Jeffries “has a slew of inappropriate and vulgar videos with his own sexually explicit commentary on a social media app aimed at youth.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A bishop has taken the unusual step of removing a priest from the ministry after he made a series of divisive remarks about politics and the pandemic. The Diocese of La Crosse said in a statement Friday that Bishop William Patrick Callahan has issued a decree immediately removing the Rev. James Altman as pastor of St. James the Less, a parish in the city of La Crosse. The decree will remain in effect for an undetermined length of time, the statement said. “(The bishop) and his diocesan representatives have spent over a year, prayerfully and fraternally, working toward a resolution related to ongoing public and ecclesial concerns of the ministry of Fr. James Altman,” the statement said. “The obligation of a Bishop is to ensure that all who serve the faithful are able to do so while unifying and building the Body of Christ.” Diocese officials didn’t release the decree and didn’t immediately respond to a request for a copy. Altman told conservative news outlet LifeSiteNews.com that he’s not surprised the Catholic hierarchy is trying to silence him. “Unfortunately for the corrupt hierarchy, I will not be silenced by any arbitrary Decree, nor will I be cowed by any action against my priestly faculties,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A rancher who was pinned by an all-terrain vehicle survived on beer and bottled water for two days. Frank Reynolds, 53, was trying to round up a cow and calf on a neighbor’s pasture outside Gillette when the vehicle tipped over on him July 4, Reynolds told the Gillette News Record. “It was scary as hell is what it was,” Reynolds said Wednesday from a hospital room. Family thought Reynolds had gone camping or was with friends, said Quentin Reynolds, the Campbell County undersheriff and Frank’s brother. Later Monday, they began to worry. Eventually, they learned Frank Reynolds had planned to do some work on the property, where he was laying with a dislocated shoulder and broken ribs. A search began. Reynolds, meanwhile, honked the ATV’s horn so much he wore down the battery – to no avail. He was able to ration a couple of bottles of water and Keystone Light beers from a cooler, Sheriff Scott Matheny said. Searching on horseback, neighbor Don Hamm found Reynolds about 8 a.m. Tuesday. By that point, Reynolds recalled he was “pretty much out of it.” “Everything on the left side pretty much hurt, from the top of my head to my toes,” he said. He was expected to remain in the hospital a few more days and eventually recover.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/12"}]}
